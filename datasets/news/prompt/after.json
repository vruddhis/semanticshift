          "headline": "Live Aid campaigner Bob Geldof was ‘scathing about African leaders’, files reveal",
          "bodyText": "The Live Aid campaigner Bob Geldof urged Tony Blair not to appoint an African co-chair to the UK-led organisation working to overhaul international aid to the continent because he thought African leadership was “very weak” on the issue, newly released government documents suggest. The singer was “scathing about the ability and worthiness of virtually all African leaders” before the establishment in 2004 of Blair’s Commission for Africa, which would produce a report, Our Common Interest, and prompt a landmark pledge by rich nations to boost aid and write off debt. Geldof was instrumental in persuading the then prime minister to set up a “Brandt II” report, similar to the 1980 Brandt report on international economic development, which would lead to a “Marshall plan” for Africa, a reference to the US plan to rebuild Europe after the second world war. It would coincide with the UK’s presidency of the G8 nations group and the 20th anniversary of Live Aid. But behind the scenes, Geldof and the government had different ideas on how it should be set up, official papers released to the National Archives show. Geldof stressed in one letter to the prime minister that Blair’s personal leadership was vital if it was to succeed. “I do think this needs to be a direct commission from you personally – your vision, your authority, your weight,” he wrote. He also called for speed so it could report back in time for the G8 summit that Blair was hosting at Gleneagles in July 2005. “I know I’m pushy, and I know you’re up to your neck, but something short of the normal seven-week delay response would be welcome (do you use Royal Mail?). Seriously though, this must be implemented almost immediately,” Geldof wrote. A No 10 letter from October 2003, reporting on a telephone conversation between Blair and Geldof, said: “The PM spoke with Bob Geldof today. Geldof argued that unless we found a way to allow Africans to make livelihoods at home they would come to our shores, resulting in massive social upheaval. African leadership had been very weak.” Other Downing Street officials urged caution. One said they could face “opprobrium” from Geldof and his fellow Live Aid campaigner Bono if they were unable to deliver on the plan. Liz Lloyd, a senior adviser on international development, expressed concern over Geldof’s desire that the commission, while being chaired by Blair, should also be independent, and she stressed the government must have oversight. “If this document is going to have your name and be sold by you, [Geldof] must accept that we have the final editing role,” she wrote to Blair. The fact Geldof was opposed to a chair from Africa was particularly “tricky”, she added. “He is scathing about the ability and worthiness of virtually all African leaders and sees the audience as primarily the US,” she noted. “He therefore does not want an African co-chair, content to ride with your name to give it credibility.” She continued that they would need “prominent African involvement” and suggested Blair “talk carefully” to the then South African president, Thabo Mbeki, to secure his support. The ensuing pledge at Gleneagles to double aid and extend debt relief was hailed by Geldof as “mission accomplished”, although some anti-poverty campaigners complained that he had got too close to the government and that it did not go far enough."

          "headline": "ChatGPT search tool vulnerable to manipulation and deception, tests show",
          "bodyText": "OpenAI’s ChatGPT search tool may be open to manipulation using hidden content, and can return malicious code from websites it searches, a Guardian investigation has found. OpenAI has made the search product available to paying customers and is encouraging users to make it their default search tool. But the investigation has revealed potential security issues with the new system. The Guardian tested how ChatGPT responded when asked to summarise webpages that contain hidden content. This hidden content can contain instructions from third parties that alter ChatGPT’s responses – also known as a “prompt injection” – or it can contain content designed to influence ChatGPT’s response, such as a large amount of hidden text talking about the benefits of a product or service. These techniques can be used maliciously, for example to cause ChatGPT to return a positive assessment of a product despite negative reviews on the same page. A security researcher has also found that ChatGPT can return malicious code from websites it searches. In the tests, ChatGPT was given the URL for a fake website built to look like a product page for a camera. The AI tool was then asked if the camera was a worthwhile purchase. The response for the control page returned a positive but balanced assessment, highlighting some features people might not like. However, when hidden text included instructions to ChatGPT to return a favourable review, the response was always entirely positive. This was the case even when the page had negative reviews on it – the hidden text could be used to override the actual review score. The simple inclusion of hidden text by third parties without instructions can also be used to ensure a positive assessment, with one test including extremely positive fake reviews which influenced the summary returned by ChatGPT. Jacob Larsen, a cybersecurity researcher at CyberCX, said he believed that if the current ChatGPT search system was released fully in its current state, there could be a “high risk” of people creating websites specifically geared towards deceiving users. However, he cautioned that the search functionality had only recently been released and OpenAI would be testing – and ideally fixing – these sorts of issues. “This search functionality has come out [recently] and it’s only available to premium users,” he said. “They’ve got a very strong [AI security] team there, and by the time that this has become public, in terms of all users can access it, they will have rigorously tested these kinds of cases.” OpenAI were sent detailed questions but did not respond on the record about the ChatGPT search function. Larsen said there were broader issues with combining search and large language models – known as LLMs, the technology behind ChatGPT and other chatbots – and responses from AI tools should not always be trusted. A recent example of this was highlighted by Thomas Roccia, a Microsoft security researcher, who detailed an incident involving a cryptocurrency enthusiast who was using ChatGPT for programming assistance. Some of the code provided by ChatGPT for the cryptocurrency project included a section which was described as a legitimate way to access the Solana blockchain platform, but instead stole the programmer’s credentials and resulted in them losing $2,500. “They’re simply asking a question, receiving an answer, but the model is producing and sharing content that has basically been injected by an adversary to share something that is malicious,” Larsen said. Karsten Nohl, the chief scientist at security cybersecurity firm SR Labs, said AI chat services should be used more like a “co-pilot”, and that their output should not be viewed or used completely unfiltered. “LLMs are very trusting technology, almost childlike … with a huge memory, but very little in terms of the ability to make judgment calls,” he said. “If you basically have a child narrating back stuff it heard elsewhere, you need to take that with a pinch of salt.” OpenAI does warn users about possible mistakes from the service with a disclaimer at the bottom of every ChatGPT page – “ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.” A key question is how these vulnerabilities could change website practices and risk to users if combining search and LLMs becomes more widespread. Hidden text has historically been penalised by search engines, such as Google, with the result that websites using it can be listed further down on search results or removed entirely. As a consequence, hidden text designed to fool AI may be unlikely to be used by websites also trying to maintain a good rank in search engines. Nohl compared the issues facing AI-enabled search to “SEO poisoning”, a technique where hackers manipulate websites to rank highly in search results, with the website containing some sort of malware or other malicious code. “If you wanted to create a competitor to Google, one of the problems you’d be struggling with is SEO poisoning,” he said. “SEO poisoners have been in an arms race with Google and Microsoft Bing and a few others for many, many years. “Now, the same is true for ChatGPT’s search capability. But not because of the LLMs, but because they’re new to search, and they have that catchup game to play with Google.” Do you know more about this story?

          "headline": "Australia declines to follow EU in forcing airlines to pay passengers for delayed and cancelled flights",
          "bodyText": "The Albanese government has bowed to pressure from Qantas and other airlines advocating against laws that would force them to pay cash compensation to passengers whose flights are delayed or cancelled. The omission of a compensation scheme in the government’s draft aviation customer rights charter follows claims from airlines such as Qantas that compensation rules – which exist in the European Union – would force them to preempt costs and increase air fares. The charter was released on Sunday. When the government announced it would introduce an airline passenger charter of rights – to fall under a forthcoming industry ombuds scheme – it left open the door for the interim ombudsperson, Pauline Sullivan, to determine if a compensation scheme should be in the charter she was tasked with drafting. However, such a scheme is not included in the draft charter, which is now open for public consultation until the end of February. The omission means advocacy groups’ longtime hopes for an EU-style compensation scheme for Australian passengers lie in the Coalition’s “pay on delay” bill. There have been mounting calls to introduce a compensation scheme modelled on EU laws. It is understood Australia’s consumer watchdog closely studied the EU scheme in the lead-up to the delivery of a landmark aviation white paper. Proponents of an Australian scheme say forcing airlines to pay cash to passengers delayed as a result of the airline’s operations – but not weather-related issues – could bring airlines with poor on-time performances into line. They argue it could also disincentivise airlines from deliberately scheduling and cancelling flights to retain takeoff and landing slots. In Europe, passengers whose flights arrive at their final destination delayed more than three hours are entitled to between €250 (A$485) and €600 (A$1,165), depending on the distance of the trip. Longer delays mean passengers can opt to be fully refunded within seven days. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email If a delay means a passenger misses a connecting flight on the same reservation, the airline must also pay compensation. Instead, the draft Australian charter of rights proposes a list of legal entitlements for passengers that airlines will adhere to or face penalties. The draft charter includes a provision that airline customers in Australia have a right to “prompt and fair remedies and support during and after cancellations, delays and disruptions”. As part of this, if a flight is disrupted or delayed for more than three hours for reasons within the airline’s control, customers should – at no cost to themselves – receive assistance to rebook with the airline or an alternative carrier, or an option to cancel and receive a full refund for the ticket, as well as a refund on meals, accommodations and transfers incurred from the delay. Also included in the draft charter is a right for customers to “be treated with dignity and respect in an accessible and inclusive environment”, including airport and airline staff knowing how to help passengers with disabilities or medical issues, as well as not discriminating against any passengers – including if they do not speak English – throughout their journey. Under the draft charter, airlines will also be forced to provide “accurate, timely and accessible information and customer service” to passengers, including “easy-to-understand conditions” about refunds, charges and fees as well as “prompt updates” about delays and cancellations. Customer service representatives for airlines in call centres and at airport desks must offer a call-back option to prevent customers waiting long periods for help. Additionally, airlines and airports will be made to protect the personal information of passengers collected during booking and improve their complaints handling processes, with a target of 24 hours for acknowledgment and 30 days for resolution. Qantas took an average of 97 days to solve customer complaints in 2023. The draft charter also includes a right to safe and timely baggage handling remedies, including mandated reimbursements for temporarily lost luggage and “timely” processing of claims. Legislation will be introduced next year with the formal ombuds scheme and charter of rights expected to be established by 2026. The transport minister, Catherine King, said the government was “delivering the strongest-ever protections for Australian travellers to ensure passengers get what they pay for or get their money back”."

          "bodyText": "In the harsh light of his cell, alone and near death, Simon Cartwright pressed the intercom. Water, he pleaded. He needed water. “Please, please, just give me a chance, please,” he said, according to call logs provided to the coroner. On the other end of the buzzer, the prison guards were getting irritated. They’d shut off the water to Simon’s cell deliberately. It was being used as a bargaining chip, an inquest would later find, by guards who had a limited understanding of his severe and untreated mental illness. Simon begged for water 19 times before he died. “Yeah, this is really entertaining actually,” a guard joked after one of Simon’s frantic pleas. “Yeah, keep buzzing up actually – this is keeping me entertained.” They found Simon the next day, naked on a mattress in the middle of his cell. He was cold to the touch. Despite being in an observation cell designed for 24/7 surveillance at Sydney’s Silverwater jail, rigor mortis had set in by the time anyone realised he was dead. A nurse who had rushed to the cell, responding to a request for medical assistance, wrote in her report that Simon had been dead for a “prolonged period”. His death was needless, a coroner would find. He was suffering from chronic peptic ulcer disease and had an ulcer in his small intestine. It was highly treatable. A drug called pantoprazole, administered at any point before the 25th day of his 30-day stay in Silverwater, would most likely have saved him, according to a gastroenterologist expert witness. But prison staff inexplicably missed all signs pointing to serious illness. Simon was extremely thin, to the point of malnourishment, and was recorded on CCTV clutching himself in pain and collapsing to the ground, although this was not observed by guards. He told guards he was struggling to breathe. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Prison health staff had failed to make even a cursory check of their own records. Those records showed he had a history of gastric ulcers, infection and vomiting blood. Instead they wrongly answered “no” to a prompt of “history of gastrointestinal conditions?” during Simon’s intake assessment. The untreated ulcer penetrated surrounding organs in the weeks that followed, according to autopsy notes provided to the inquest. Bacteria entered Simon’s bloodstream and he went into septic shock, dying sometime on 19 September 2021. His grieving family have spent the years since trying to find answers. Their journey has led them to an incontrovertible truth – one that sits at the foundation of everything that went wrong. Simon should not have been in Silverwater. He should have been in hospital. Sixteen days before his death a psychiatrist had invoked the state’s mental health laws to order Simon be transferred to hospital for treatment for his unmedicated schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. No bed could be found, something the coroner would describe as a “gross systemic failure”. He was locked up for a month in a cell designed to be used for no more than 48 hours, and mocked by guards who withheld water from an emaciated man as punishment for behaviour they did not understand. “It was torture,” Simon’s sister Clare tells Guardian Australia. A mother’s premonition In her hospital bed at Lingard Private, in the beachside Newcastle suburb of Merewether, Simon’s elderly mother, Frances, had reason to smile. It was her birthday, 20 September 2021, and two of her three daughters, Michele and Alison, had just turned up. She thought they had managed to bypass Covid restrictions to pay her a surprise birthday visit. One look at their faces changed her mind. “I thought they had been given special permission as visitors were not allowed,” Frances wrote. “However, on closer look realised they were to give me bad news and I immediately knew it was Simon – a mother’s premonition.” At that stage, Frances didn’t even know her son had been in prison. None of his family did. Alison was the first to find out. Police officers told her about her brother’s incarceration when they knocked on the door of her Gosford home to tell her he was dead. The next day she and Michele travelled north to see their mother. The sisters could offer no explanation of what had happened. “That was the worst thing I have ever had to do,” Michele says. It was the beginning of a never-ending period of grief for Frances. The news triggered a desperate search for information. It was not forthcoming. The New South Wales government took months to release details. In December Justice Health, which runs health services at NSW correctional facilities, briefed the family on the results of its internal serious adverse event review. This raised more questions than it gave answers. The family wanted to know, among other things, why there were huge stretches of “unaccounted” hours where no recorded observations were made of Simon, and why more wasn’t done to investigate his physical health. Frances wrote a furious letter to the then corrections minister, Geoff Lee. She described her son’s treatment as worse than that of a dog. She asked for a more thorough investigation. “To be told that Simon had been found dead at 8pm on the 19th was one of the worst moments of my life,” she wrote to the minister on 27 January 2022. “Just thinking of Simon dying all alone with no family was unbearable.” She received an automatic receipt, promising the minister would respond within 28 days. When the 28 days passed without reply, Frances sent the letter again. She received nothing back. Smart, bright and loved to dance Simon was a smart kid, his sisters agree. They remember a child who loved music and loved to dance. He grew up in Tamworth, the youngest of six children. His closest sibling was 10 years his senior. Frances always told the kids it made raising Simon a dream. She had five pairs of hands eager to help. “He was a gorgeous little baby who everyone spoiled from day one,” Clare tells Guardian Australia. “He was a really loved kid. And he was very smart, probably because he had all his siblings pushing him along. He was bright, really friendly, outgoing social boy.” Things changed in his teenage years after he began using cannabis. “It just changed him, it changed the way he looked at life,” Clare said. “Keeping him at school was difficult, he just struggled.” The strain on his parents became overwhelming. His siblings tried to help. At one point Clare brought him up to the Gold Coast for rehab. She lost count of the times the family set him up in an apartment, furnishing it for him, and hoping for stability. “I don’t know what the percentage was of good to bad,” she said. “But there were lots of years where he was stable and he was still, sometimes, mentally challenged with his emotions.” In 2008, at age 28, Simon was diagnosed with schizophrenia and in 2013 he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When his parents moved from Tamworth to Wollongong, Simon followed, getting a unit in a public housing estate. “The move to Wollongong was the start of some more serious times when he was in a mental health hospital and then back out,” Clare said. “Then the cycle of good and bad would begin.” In July 2020 a new psychiatrist at Shellharbour hospital abruptly departed from the decade-long diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, reclassifying Simon’s condition as a personality disorder and polysubstance use disorder. The antipsychotic medications he had been taking for years were discontinued. Simon’s longstanding psychologist expressed concern about the sudden change. Records tendered to the inquest show the psychologist warned that Simon would become a problem for police and “potentially could go to gaol” if his psychiatric condition was not properly managed. That prediction was realised just six months later. In January 2021 Simon lit a fire in a neighbour’s apartment and was remanded briefly in Silverwater. At that point, prison staff noted his history of gastric ulcers and infection, vomiting blood and weight loss, obtaining records from two hospitals that had treated him. They had prescribed pantoprazole. All of these records would be available to prison health staff seven months later, when Simon returned to Silverwater. After 13 days on remand, the court deemed him not criminally responsible for the fire, due to his serious mental ill health, and sent him for treatment at Cumberland hospital in Parramatta. Discharge notes handed to the inquest suggest the treatment was effective. “On assessment at the day of discharge, Simon was well-kempt, polite and co-operative,” they read. “Engaged well and maintained a good eye contact. Speech was well articulated, coherent with normal rate, rhythm and tone. Did not exhibit any psychotic or pervasive mood symptoms.” Clare said her brother often responded well to treatment. It made him stable and able to spend time with the rest of the family. It gave them hope. He’d come to Christmases and weddings. He’d help Frances with her vacuuming. She’d do his washing. “He was good for long periods of time but that was on medication,” she said. “The medication had bad side-effects, so he’d self-medicate or come off the medications, and then the cycle of getting into trouble [would begin again].” Return to Silverwater On 19 August 2021 Simon was sent back to Silverwater. He’d been arrested on relatively minor charges of trespass, intimidation and resisting arrest. On 3 September a psychiatrist used the state’s mental health laws to order Simon be transferred to Long Bay forensic hospital, 40 minutes across Sydney, for involuntary treatment. “Care of an appropriate kind is not available in a correctional centre as he is refusing treatment in this setting,” the psychiatrist wrote. Experts told the inquest that, had such an order been made for someone in an emergency department, they would generally receive appropriate treatment within four hours. Delays of more than 24 hours would be rare. Delays beyond two days would be regarded as a significant failure of the system. There were no beds left at Long Bay. Simon languished in a queue for weeks. On 7 September he was still behind eight others waiting for a bed. A week later he was second on the list for transfer. Five days later he was still stuck at Silverwater. The inquest was told the delay was “unimaginable in Australia”. The deputy state coroner, Erin Kennedy, found that, had Simon been transported to Long Bay, his physical health would have been more closely monitored and the ulcer would probably have been detected and treated. Instead he was kept in his cell alone. It was, in the words of one psychiatric expert, a torture-like setting for a man suffering untreated schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The lights never went out. The surfaces were hard and cold. The noise and chaos spilling in from Silverwater’s Darcy wing was constant. The surveillance camera was always on. Ordinarily, inmates are not held on the wing for more than 48 hours. Simon was there for almost a month. At times, Simon was recorded as being doubled over in pain. He collapsed to the floor repeatedly. For long stretches he sat with his head in his hands. Guards reported him muttering “biblical things” they couldn’t understand. Transcripts of his intercom exchanges show a man confused and afraid. “You have to understand I’m struggling to breathe,” he told the guards the day before he died. Five minutes later, he buzzed for help again. “Yeah, um, sorry, just give me a sec, I’m standing in front – just give me a few minutes to breathe,” he said. A guard responded: “You’re not doing yourself a favour. Just go to sleep.” Clare and her family have watched the CCTV recordings and listened to the intercom exchanges of Simon’s final days. She says these will stay with her for ever. “He must have been in so much pain to die of sepsis in the last 48 hours, to be so unwell and to be refused water, just the basic human need of water,” she said. “It’s just, it can’t be comprehended.” Clare counted the 19 times that her brother pleaded for water over two days. Guards had shut off the water after Simon left a tap running, flooding the cell. On the evening before his death one told him they would give him water if he stayed silent. “Cartwright, is that you?” the guard asked. “Cartwright, listen. If you be quiet for half an hour and stop knocking up I’ll turn the water on.” Simon waited an hour and a half then rang again. “What is your 300th medical emergency for the night?” the guard responded. Simon pleaded: “Can you turn the water on!” The guard said: “If you aren’t knocking up so much I’ll do it.” Simon begged: “Please!” The last request for water came at 7.48pm. “Medical?” the guards responded. Simon again asked: “Can you turn the water on please?” The guard said: “If you don’t behave like that we will.” The voice in the recordings was barely recognisable to Simon’s family. “It was just so strained and pleading and begging,” Clare says. The prison had no formal policy or procedure governing the restriction of water to cells, the inquest found. Sometime in the year of Simon’s death, a requirement was introduced that compelled guards to get approval by a manager and document such a decision in an accommodation journal. There is no evidence that the requirement was in place at the time of Simon’s death. ‘Why are we burying him? We don’t know why’ Simon had not been convicted of any crime. He remained innocent in the eyes of the law. Even if he were convicted, the inquest heard, there was little indication he would have been sentenced to imprisonment. He could have been diverted for mental health treatment and sent to a hospital by the courts, as had happened previously, or given a non-custodial sentence. He was by no means a hardened criminal. “He was one of the most vulnerable in our community,” the coroner wrote. Clare has a vivid memory of her brother’s funeral. He was laid to rest in Newcastle. Covid restrictions meant Clare could not get across the Queensland border. She was forced to watch a video stream. On it she saw her mother sitting on her own, weeping. Frances was forced to grieve alone, separate from the rest of the family, because of social distancing rules. “Seeing my mum just sitting there hunched over on her own, sitting on her own, not even having someone sit next to her and hold a hand – it’s just the most memorable thing in my mind,” Clare says The family still knew little about what had happened. It robbed them of any semblance of closure. “You know, we’re burying our brother and we’re like, ‘What happened?’” Clare says. “You know, you can’t say farewell when there’s just questions in your head: ‘Why are we burying him? We don’t know why.’” Clare was dealing with trauma of her own when she found out her brother was dead. Her husband had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Between treatments, the couple jumped in a caravan and hit the road. Clare described their trip through the outback as “a bucket-list thing”. They got as far as Julia Creek in north-western Queensland when Clare’s sister called. “It’s almost numbing – you just don’t expect to get that call about your siblings,” she says. “Especially our youngest brother. In the back of your mind for so many years, you’re thinking, ‘is Simon going to get better and get himself on his feet or one day are we going to find out that something has happened to him, or he’s disappeared?’” “It was just this feeling of total numbness, the shock that one of us had passed away out of the six of us.” ‘Cartwright, wake up’ The CCTV camera in Simon’s cell captured several distressing scenes the day before his death. On three occasions he collapsed to the floor. The first time he stumbled and fell backwards over his toilet, remaining on the ground for two minutes. Three and a half hours later he fell while walking towards his bed. He stayed on the ground for two minutes. An hour and a half later he stood up from the bed then fell backwards. He fell again while trying to get to his knees, this time lying on his side for five minutes before getting up. No one in the jail noticed, the inquest found. “You don’t need to be a medical person to see how much pain he was in, anyone could see just how much he was suffering,” Michele says. “His whole experience in the facility by those who were supposedly looking after him was inhumane.” About 9pm that evening, Simon covered his cell’s CCTV camera. Staff testified that steps are usually taken within an hour to uncover surveillance cameras. It took three shifts and almost 24 hours for the camera to be uncovered. Physical checks of the cell were not much better. On the day of Simon’s death, CCTV recordings showed the guard on duty looking into the cell for about four seconds at 2.17pm. He didn’t stand outside the cell and look in again for five hours. The guard used the intercom about 3.41pm to ask Simon to uncover the camera. He received no response. About two hours later, he tried again: “Hey, mate, 37. Cartwright. Cartwright, wake up.” Again, there was no response. Nobody bothered to conduct a physical check. “Although in ostensibly a 24 hour surveillance cell, he was in fact not being observed, nor indeed observable, 24 hours a day,” the coroner wrote. “In the days leading up to his death no one identified that Simon was in fact in urgent need of medical attention. His falls were not observed, his weakened state was not investigated. “The seriousness and urgency of his condition was missed.” After Simon’s death was discovered, the guard on duty filled out an observation form that wrongly suggested that electronic observations had been conducted at 30-minute intervals, the inquest found. The guard later accepted that the form was “not an accurate representation of his observations”. He said he had created the document in an attempt to “neat up” a scrappy piece of paper he had been using to record his checks on Simon. He also made “misleading” statements about his physical checks on Simon, which he later accepted as being “false”. The inquest found that, even with proper checks on that final day, Simon may not have survived. “The fact that Simon lay dying and dead on a cell floor, for long enough that he was not found until there were clearly no indications of life, despite supposedly being subject to the highest level of monitoring within the gaol, is both alarming, and carries its own particular trauma for Simon’s family,” the coroner found. ‘Haunt us forever’ Simon’s mother waited almost three years for an inquest into her son’s death. The family felt it was their only real avenue to the truth. Frances, a pensioner, tried to obtain legal aid so they could be represented in the coronial process but was rejected. It was a decision that infuriated them. They travelled to Sydney for the hearings in May and August this year. They sat in the courtroom, despite invitations to leave, as Simon’s last moments were played to the court, and then prepared a moving statement for the inquest: We are changed forever by the circumstances surrounding his death. Beyond the lack of health care provided the fact that a staff member unilaterally chose to deny Simon water after multiple pleading requests is appalling and a disregard for his basic human rights. We can only regret the many missed opportunities to save him and the thought of what he would have suffered will haunt us forever. The statement was repeated, almost in full, in the coroner’s concluding remarks. Her findings were delivered this month. They are damning. Kennedy found that Simon could have been saved. She was highly critical of the decision to withhold water from him. “Simon’s death was preventable,” she found. “This inquest highlights that [Corrective Services NSW] is not and should not be placed in a position to care for a mentally ill person. Once Simon was scheduled arrangements should have been made to provide medical care.” She recommended that guards on duty be told the reason that inmates are placed in observation cells. She said it was “unfair” that guards were not explicitly given this information, but accepted that it was available to them if they looked for it. She recommended that formal policies be implemented to govern the practice of restricting water to cells and to ensure that prisons monitor food and fluid intake. Justice Health was told to “give consideration” to recommending transfers of mentally unwell patients to external hospitals when no beds at a designated facility are available. The coroner recommended mandating mental health first aid training to officers staffing observation cells. She also recommended that guards be told at the start of their shifts why each inmate is in an observation cell. Justice Health said it acknowledged the pain caused by Simon’s loss and extended its sincere condolences to his family. “We are sorry for the distress experienced by Mr Cartwright’s family and will carefully consider the coroner’s findings and recommendations before providing a formal response to the attorney general,” a spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the current corrections minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, said the death was a “tragic loss” to Cartwright’s family and loved ones, and said “we offer them our deepest sympathies”. Corrective Services NSW’s formal response to the inquest will be released at a later date. But the spokesperson said a number of reforms have already been implemented since Cartwright’s death, including establishing a specialised observation suite at Silverwater’s remand centre to monitor at-risk inmates electronically; updating observations policies for at-risk inmates; and implementing a mandatory requirement for control room officers to document and record emergency response activities. Corrective Services is also trialling a new proof of life monitoring technology to detect vital signs, including heart and respiration rates. It has commenced a review of its policies regarding the restriction of water to prison cells. It will also aim to improve its supervision of inmates held in assessment cells for more than 48 hours and is investigating further mental health training for guards. “Corrective Services NSW takes seriously its duty of care to inmates who they are tasked with keeping safe and secure while under supervision,” the spokesperson said. “Any conduct that jeopardises the health or wellbeing of inmates or staff is completely unacceptable and inconsistent with the extremely high standard of behaviour that the minister expects.” “Corrective Services NSW will follow the expert advice of Justice Health in respect to the clinical management of inmate physical and mental health issues, and placement in specialised mental health beds.” It is understood the Corrective Services NSW professional standards unit is also assessing the inquest report to determine whether to take action. The coroner’s findings have come too late for Frances. She died last month at the age of 87, about two weeks before the decision was handed down. “My mother was always at the forefront of finding out what happened to Simon,” Clare says. “Her grief was endless and her regular questions and follow-up with me ensured that we wrote a response to the initial [serious adverse event review] report.” Clare says the inquest has given the family a partial sense of justice. They have nothing but praise for the police investigation and the crown lawyers who worked to find out what had happened. But she says she feels like there have been no real consequences. “It feels like a bit of a slap on the wrist, you know, that they’ve been told that they probably should do things better,” she said. “But really, is that enough when they’ve let someone die in those circumstances?"

          "bodyText": "Victoria has seen a surge of cases of a flesh-eating bacteria, prompting warnings from the chief health officer to take protective measures after it spread through suburban Melbourne. Buruli ulcer has been known to occur in Australia since the 1940s, with cases noted from Victoria to the Northern Territory and far-north Queensland. Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Ben Cowie, on Friday warned the community about the risk of infection, after a recent increase in cases linked to the Melbourne suburb of Ascot Vale, in Melbourne’s north. He said “cases remained high” across the state. “The disease is spreading geographically across Victoria and is no longer restricted to specific coastal locations,” he said in a health advisory. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email As of 17 December, there have been 344 cases notified so far in 2024, compared with the same time in 2023 (362 cases), 2022 (338 cases), 2021 (286 cases), and 2020 (217 cases). The state’s health department said those affected usually develop a painless lump or wound, which can initially be mistaken for an insect bite. Over time the lesion slowly develops into a destructive skin ulcer. Cowie said everyone was susceptible to infection, but Buruli ulcer notifications were highest in people aged over 60. “Prompt treatment can significantly reduce skin loss and tissue damage, and avoid the need for more intensive treatment,” he said. “The incubation period varies from four weeks to nine months. The lesion of Buruli ulcer may occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on exposed areas of the limbs.” Cowie advised people to use personal inspect repellents, cover up with light, loose, light-coloured clothing, and to avoid mosquito-prone areas or being outdoors during peak biting times. Analysis recently published suggests Buruli has also become endemic in the New South Wales town of Batemans Bay, about 110km south-east of Canberra. Researchers have studied the coastal town’s two only known cases, reported in 2021 and 2023, as well as picking apart 27 samples of possum poo. Victoria’s department of health said possums were known to develop ulcers caused by this infection and research has shown that mosquitoes play a role in transmitting the disease to humans. – With AAP."

          "headline": "Pop-up heart-health hubs sought for Premier League clubs in England",
          "bodyText": "Premier League football clubs across England could soon offer fans a one-stop clinic, designed to scan, diagnose and treat some early signs of cardiovascular disease after a successful screening pilot. Almost one in three football supporters screened at Everton football club’s pop-up clinic this autumn were diagnosed with hypertension, the leading preventable risk factor for heart failure, heart attack and stroke. Almost one in five of those diagnosed were discovered to require emergency hospitalisation, which was averted by the immediate prescription of life-saving drugs. “We were able to test, diagnose and provide vital medication within 60 minutes – a process that can take up to six months in the NHS,” said Dr Rajiv Sankaranarayanan, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for the Beat Breathlessness Hub, run with the Everton in the Community charity. Fans received a blood test, an AI echo heart scan and a specialist review. If needed, they were given life-changing medication and advice on how to improve their quality of life to reduce the risk of future hospitalisation. The Beat-HF national screening programme also diagnosed fans with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Where needed, these fans were also given life-saving medication. Everton fan Eddie Coan, 83, got tested only because he saw other people getting it done. “I had no symptoms and had no indication that I had an issue, but I went over and asked if I could be tested too. “Within minutes, the nurse said she wasn’t very happy with my readings and made an appointment for me to go and see the GP,” he said. Coan was found to have a missing heartbeat and was fitted with a pacemaker. “I had no symptoms whatsoever – so who knows what would have happened had the hub not been there that day, offering tests,” he said. More than 1 million people in the UK have heart failure, with about 200,000 new diagnoses every year. Although early treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity, about 80% of diagnoses in England are made during emergency hospitalisation, a number that has increased by 50% in the last decade. “The high rate of hospitalisation is a key reason why heart failure costs the NHS more than £2bn a year,” said Sankaranarayanan. “Between 60% to 70% of that £2bn is related to the expense of hospitalisation. “If we can get people tested early and treated quickly, the need for hospitalisation – and especially emergency hospitalisation – is vastly reduced,” he added. Run by the heart failure charity Pumping Marvellous – in collaboration with local NHS healthcare systems, hospitals, community trusts, integrated care board, councils, volunteer organisations and football clubs – the programme has already screened about 5,600 people at 10 sites across the country. “The objective is to harness the brand of football for targeted early detection of those at serious risk of heart failure and the prompt initiation of treatment,” said Nick Hartshorne-Evans, the CEO and founder of the Pumping Marvellous Foundation. “Our teams include a consultant cardiologist, specialist nurses, psychologists, smoking cessation service, volunteers and city council representatives,” he added. The lessons learned from the pilot project, which has been shortlisted for a Health Service Journal prize, are now in demand across the country. “We are in discussions with most of the other premier football clubs, who are wanting to set up community diagnostic hubs,” said Hartshorne-Evans. “We’ve had non-premier league football clubs, rugby clubs and leisure facilities getting in touch too.” The full results, presented at the global cardiovascular conference on clinical trials (CVCT) in Washington last week, will soon be published in a prominent international cardiology journal. Jon Jones, the director of adult services at Everton in the Community, said the charity was investigating ways to make the weekly clinic a permanent fixture. “Men traditionally don’t get their health checked until it’s too late,” he said. “As a football club, we have a good idea which season ticket-holders might be at risk based on their age and postcode. That means we can reach out to them in a way that breaks down barriers because it blends community and clinical.”"

          "bodyText": "Guardian Australia readers prove the journey is just as important as the destination. They share roadside eateries, welcoming country pubs, lovely rural towns and “epic” playgrounds in their picks of the best places to stop on a road trip. New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory Canberra to Merimbula: Pipers lookout, South East Forest national park “The view is beautiful. The trees are awe-inspiring. The air is clean. It’s refreshing and relaxing,” Gary writes about a beauty spot between Nimmitabel and Bemboka on the Snowy Mountains Highway. You’ll also find toilets, a picnic area and a 500-metre boardwalk leading to two more viewpoints. Sydney to Melbourne: Long Track Pantry, Riverside Drive, Jugiong A whopping nine readers and one staff member recommend this culinary pit stop when driving the Hume Highway. “I always stop for morning tea or lunch when I drive from Melbourne to Sydney,” Christopher writes. “When I was a child, it was the general store for the village. My aunts and uncles would do their shopping there.” The owners, Huw and Juliet Robb, produce their own jams, marmalades, chutneys and sauces. A reader, Kerry, stops in to “have lunch under the vine-covered verandah, then stock up on relishes, chutneys, jams and marmalades”. Adam rates its pleasant sheltered outdoor dining areas, along with “prompt service and generous portions”. Sydney and Canberra to Melbourne: the Niagara cafe, Sheridan Street, Gundagai A few readers mentioned this longstanding Gundagai cafe. “New owners have renovated and restored the Niagara, bringing back the vaulted ceiling destroyed in a fire (then covered over for decades),” Andrew writes. “I have been stopping here for Australia’s best chocolate milkshake for more than 30 years.” Anthony has been visiting for even longer: “For over 50 years I’ve made The Niagara a food and coffee stop. Travelling with friends on BMW motorcycles between NSW and Victoria in the late 1970s, we would always stop for a big cafe meal and coffee.” Northern Territory Darwin to Alice Springs: Bitter Springs, Martin Road, Mataranka A Parkinson likes to wash off the long drive at this natural thermal pool: “My favourite is always Bitter Springs. It’s the perfect place for a float and bonus: there are two petrol stations here so you can refresh and refuel not just yourself but the car too, at a competitive price.” Queensland Saint George to Mitchell: Maranoa riverside, south-west Queensland “There is a magnificent river red gum leaning over the bank down towards the river. I stop there, boil the billy and have a sandwich,” writes Ian, who likes to spend time listening to the birds, including galahs and sulphur-crested cockatoos, at this beauty spot. “One time I was sitting enjoying a cup of tea and I watched a pee wee fly past up the river and then back again a few minutes later … She must have been building a nest down river and had a good source of mud near where I was sitting. Beautiful!” Brisbane to Bundaberg: Farmer &amp; Sun, Southside Town Centre, Gympie “It’s a real treat to eat fresh local food that is healthy!” writes Anna, who recommends pulling into the Southside Town Centre for its grocery. “Isn’t a road trip all about connecting with the land and regional communities?” Brisbane to Hervey Bay: Tiaro, Fraser coast Robyne likes to stop at this “very friendly little village” when driving the Bruce Highway: “The whole town is lovely, and it has the best butcher shop in Australia. I love the little shop for gifts, and there’s also a Christmas shop 100m down the road.” South Australia Adelaide to Melbourne: the Keith playground train, Don Moseley park, Keith Anne stops at the SA town of Keith on trips between Adelaide and Melbourne, as it has an old-school mini train that’s always free for kids (of all ages) to play with. “The train is so much fun. Everyone has a go. It’s fast and makes lots of noise! There’s space to have a picnic and toilets in the park too.” Waffles and Jaffles, Dukes Highway, Coonalpyn “Good coffee, waffles and jaffles and nice outdoor seating – perfectly placed two hours out of Adelaide, right when you need a break,” says Petra, a Guardian Australia staffer. Adelaide to Perth: Ceduna Oyster Barn, Eyre Highway, Ceduna There’s a little shack selling seafood on the side of the Eyre Highway that one reader, Steph, recommends visiting before or after driving the Nullarbor: “Get oysters!! Whichever direction you’re driving in, it’s exciting to have a bit of luxury when you’re in quite a deserted area.” If oysters aren’t your thing, it also sells fish and chips, sushi, burritos, loaded fries and burgers. Tasmania Hobart to Launceston: Ross A small, peaceful town halfway between Hobart and Launceston is home to “the best sausage rolls, scallop pies and vanilla slices this side of Oatlands”, writes Adam, who loves the overall feel of the place. Adam recommends a trip to the Tasmanian Wool Centre, the 1830s-built bridge and its “King of Iceland” stone carving. “Plus a female factory that housed female convicts, a cemetery, and a tribute to the 42° latitude that passes through the town. Never a dull visit.” Hobart to west coast: the Possum Shed cafe, Gordon River Road, Westerway “Old-world charm in a beautiful part of the world, homemade scones and cakes, good coffee and a beautiful place to sit and hang out,” Maximo writes about this roadside cafe that backs on to the Tyenna River – where it’s common to spot platypus. Victoria Melbourne to Adelaide: Mr Le, Nelson Street, Nhill This Vietnamese eatery received shout-outs from three readers who travel between Adelaide and Melbourne. Bek times journeys to coincide with Me Le’s opening times and has “gone very much out of the way” to visit at other times. The “Snickers brownie is to die for”, they write. It also serves rice paper rolls, bao, curries, pies, Vietnamese pancakes and pastries. Another reader, Matt, writes: “You can get fresh banh mi including vegetarian options that will make you question if you have left Footscray yet.” Melbourne to Canberra: Benalla ceramic mural, Mair Street, Benalla An intriguing ceramic sculpture on the bank of Lake Benalla, a short distance from the M31, is a picturesque stop that doubles as kids’ entertainment. “It’s very cool and unique, right next to a splash park and lake,” Brigit writes. The mural was created by more than 1,500 artists, students and volunteers. It’s always open and free to access. “It’s a good place for a picnic and for the kids to get the wiggles out … We get pictures of our kids there every time we go and now have pictures through the years of them getting bigger each time.” Melbourne to Bright: Milawa Bakery cafe, Snow Road, Milawa “This cafe has no pretensions to be anything other than a time-honoured, old-school country bakery,” Steve writes, and it “absolutely nails the mid-90s interior design aesthetic”. He adds: “It has the best sausage rolls and pies you’ll find. Fight me!” Western Australia Perth to South West Capes: the Crooked Carrot, Forrest Highway, Myalup This Forrest Highway cafe has a sandpit, restored Melbourne trams, climbing frames and veggie patches to explore. It’s “a paradise for kids of all ages”, writes Pippy. “The only problem is you can’t just do a quick wee, you’ll be there for an hour.” Deb agrees: “Fantastic food, lovely place to sit outside, cool playground for the kids.” Perth to Albany: Cuballing Tavern, Alton Street, Cuballing “It’s just a small diversion off the main Albany Highway to pass through this Wheatbelt township, a dozen kilometres north of Narrogin. Here you will find this exceptionally friendly country pub,” write Kate and Nick, a retired couple. Caravans and campervans can also park at the back of the pub, free of charge, for up to three nights (no electricity provided). Kate and Nick add: “Great pub food and excellent ale, all at sensible prices. What more do we need?” Riverside Roadhouse, Albany Highway, Bannister “I had the best sausage roll of my life here,” writes Alfonso, who first visited the roadhouse 15 years ago and “many dozens of times” since. “It was alarmingly good, so good that after scoffing it on the road I turned around and bought another one.” Alfonso stops in on drives between Albany and Perth, and says: “When I last visited, the roadhouse was typical of those in rural WA; vending machine coffee and teabag tea in white styrofoam cups, shelves full of eclectic items like fishing rods and comic books, toilets that are apocalyptically flyblown in summer, a few green slab park benches and some shade.” Riverside Roadhouse now serves barista-made hot drinks (the vending machine has been retired) and there are alpacas on site for bonus animal spotting."

          "headline": "‘Gisèle has forced France to stop looking away’: our panel on the Pelicot rape trial verdict",
          "bodyText": "Rokhaya Diallo: This trial has killed off the myth of the ‘monster’ rapist One face and name dominated the streets of Paris on 23 November as the annual march marking International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women took place. Gisèle Pelicot’s image was everywhere – she is a new feminist hero. A respectable, retired grandmother, whose husband sedated her, raped her and recruited dozens of other men to inflict an unimaginable amount of sexual violence on her over a decade, had come to embody the perfect victim. It should not be surprising, then, that Dominique Pelicot and all of his 50 co-defendants have now been found guilty, and that Pelicot himself has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Unlike the vast majority of the 110,000 people who face sexual violence in France every year, the fact that Gisèle Pélicot was drugged unconscious during these crimes meant she could not be unfairly accused of having somehow caused or provoked the rapes. But the strength of one woman whose unspeakable fate has garnered international solidarity cannot mask the fact that most French women still face denial and dismissal daily when they allege sexual assault. Over the past decade, 86% of reports of sexual violence have been dropped, meaning that only 14% of cases have made it through to a trial. But even in those cases, the conviction rate is very low: only 13% of suspects in sexual violence cases face consequences. The trial of Dominique Pélicot and the staggering variety of profiles of his co-defendants have shown to the world that there is no “type” when it comes to sexual violence. The myth of the pervert “monster” who assaults unknown women does not reflect the reality of rapes, most of which are committed by people known to the victim. And reporting sexual violence does not mean that you will get support: 40% of women who file a complaint in France have reported that their treatment by the police or gendarmerie was poor. If this trial and the verdict have prompted a national reckoning and introspection among men, it is up to the French government to take responsibility for making sure that every victim feels heard and validated. In her statement after today’s verdict, Gisèle Pelicot said she has confidence “in our capacity collectively to find a better future where women and men alike can live together with mutual respect”. I hope she is right. Rokhaya Diallo is a French journalist, writer, film-maker, activist and Guardian columnist Anne Bouillon: After Gisèle Pelicot, the women I represent are demanding public justice This is a good day for French justice and for French society. The court did not have to hand down the severest possible sentences to make examples of the guilty, but rather the trial needed to be conducted in an exemplary way. I believe this objective has been achieved to perfection. But after this verdict, what will remain of this extraordinary trial? The nature of the crimes that were committed was not in itself exceptional, it was the scale of them that was so harrowing. We were already well aware that women are in danger first in their own homes and that rape is perpetrated by ordinary men. In that sense, this trial has taught us nothing that we did not already know. But it is the courage of Gisèle Pelicot that has forced us collectively to stop looking away. Now that the perpetrators have been convicted, what should we do? Rape is a massive social and structural phenomenon. As a lawyer who spends most of my time representing victims of rape, I know that these cases are primarily heard in assize courts and that they are so extremely numerous, these courts are overwhelmed. In practice, the perpetrators I see in court every day are just like the accused in the Mazan trial. What do they share? A belief that under certain circumstances they don’t need to restrain themselves when it comes to doing whatever they want to the body of an unconscious woman. Victims, like Gisèle Pelicot, are ordinary women. And many of the women I represent in court have the same courage as Gisèle, refusing the option of having their cases heard in camera. After discussion, they frequently agree to go public and reject “huis clos” hearings. They want wider society to understand what they have endured and they know that justice carried out behind closed doors gives an advantage to the defendant. Combatting rape in France does require possible legislative reform; we must seriously consider introducing the concept of consent into criminal law, which currently lacks it. But that will not be enough. Only when our values have changed will women no longer be raped and men no longer become rapists. Consent must constitute the cornerstone of our romantic, marital and sexual relationships. Again and again, we must explain how respect for the physical integrity of each person is the very foundation of our relationships with others. To think that a simple legislative reform will resolve the issue is a delusion. Justice always intervenes too late. Anne Bouillon is a lawyer specialising in women’s rights Victoire Tuaillon: Our sexist culture still encourages these crimes This is an important day for victims of sexual assault in France. But a lot of things still need to change. French society is only beginning to understand the normality of rapists: that rapists are men like any other, men who look like our brothers, our friends, our neighbours. Rape is a massive problem because it is such a common crime: at least 15% of women and 10% of children are victims, most of the time of men close to them, which means that there are a lot of rapists around. The acts committed in Mazan have also acted as a magnifying glass on masculinity. They reveal an extreme version of what many men find exciting: penetrating the body of an unconscious woman. They reflect a belief that many share: that they have the right to do what they want with the body of “their” wife, that their wife “owes” them sex and that any “opportunity” for sexual intercourse is good to take. In this way, rape is a performance of masculinity that says: as a man I am superior to you, so I have the right to do what I want with your body whenever I want; I consider you and treat you as an object. For some men, the fact of having themselves been victims of sexual violence and/or serious abuse in childhood seems to encourage them to act out. The Pelicot trial should mean we collectively understand that rape happens because our entire culture encourages it; these crimes are rooted in a deeply sexist culture. We must address that problem at its root: which is to combat sexual inequality and take seriously all the clues and warning signs of sexual violence that attackers often indicate before committing such serious acts (sexist insults, harassment, and so on). As for shifting the weight of shame from victims to aggressors, as Gisèle Pelicot sought by waiving her anonymity, there is at least a chance of that now because everybody saw clearly in Avignon that even when you are the “irreproachable victim”, like Gisèle, rape trials are excruciating. As the victim, you have to repeatedly endure defence lawyers’ odious questioning and the defendants’ infuriating explanations and denials. Yet since 2017 (the beginning of the #MeToo movement) the number of rape complaints in France has multiplied. Women are coming out and denouncing what has happened to them. The problem is that France does not have the necessary public policies to properly respond to all of these allegations. We need major public policy reform to combat sexual violence. We need emotional, relationship and sexual education classes for all students, from kindergarten to high school. We need a massive plan for the detection of child abuse and the care of child victims. We need training plans for all professions in contact with victims: caregivers, police officers, teachers, judges and lawyers. Finally, we must think about what we do with rapists, since sending them to unsanitary prisons without care or proper rehabilitation helps no one. Sentencing is never the most important issue for me, because I don’t think prison is always the appropriate punishment. What counts for me today is that these rapists were all found guilty. Victoire Tuaillon is a French journalist, author and the host of the podcast Couilles sur la Table Cécile Simmons: Online platforms enabled this abuse Dominique Pelicot used a now-closed online chat platform known for facilitating pornography and child sexual abuse to orchestrate his abuse. It was through this site and a forum called A son Insu (“Without her knowledge”) that he recruited men and circulated photos and videos of his wife. This website is only one of many, part of an online world rife with illegal, dehumanising and degrading sexual material that continues to evade legal accountability: campaigners begged French authorities to close Coco down for years, but to no avail. Unmoderated online spaces such as these have become havens for abusers, enabling their violent fantasies against women. In South Korea, “humiliation” chat rooms on the encrypted platform Telegram have fuelled waves of sexually abusive deepfakes featuring women and girls. “Nudifying” apps are widely available and promise to make “men’s dreams” – presumably to use women’s bodies without their consent – “come true”. To see digital technologies as mere facilitators of sexual violence would be a mistake: widely used “mainstream” platforms are actively shaping men’s behaviours and beliefs about women. Several men on trial in Avignon consumed a significant amount of online pornography – 90% of which features some form of abuse against women, according to the French gender-equality watchdog. Gisèle Pelicot has spoken about her determination to change society. That change cannot happen without holding platforms to account for the harms they promote. From France’s arrest of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov over alleged failures to stem child sexual abuse and other crimes, to the UK’s Online Safety Act’s criminalisation of sexually explicit deepfakes, there are signs that the era of unaccountability is over. The frontiers of digital abuse keep moving: lawmakers and the government need to be ahead of the abusers, not playing catch-up. Cécile Simmons is an investigative researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) focusing on dis/misinformation, online subcultures, women’s rights and wellness Clémentine Choubrac: Consent must be at the heart of our rape laws The Pelicot rape trial has sent shock waves through French society, and revealed the urgent need for a change of paradigm – one that might already be under way. As the public prosecutor’s office made clear, one of the main concerns of the trial was to “fundamentally change the relationships between men and women”. In other words, to see rape culture being replaced by a culture of consent. For the French feminist collective #NousToutes, one way of doing this is to reform the criminal law, and introduce the concept of consent into the definitions of rape and sexual assault. What is most interesting in this trial is that consent was at the heart of the closing speech given by the two lawyers from the public prosecutor’s office. Laure Chabaud claimed that “it is not possible any more, in 2024, to consider that, because she hasn’t said anything, [a woman] is consenting”. Jean-François Mayet also made this issue a central one by asking when the defendants had inquired about Gisèle Pelicot’s consent – his suggestion was: “not before, not while at it, not after”. This is a powerful indictment of a culture that has long normalised silence as consent, and a sign that the perception of rape by French society at large might already be evolving, as Gisèle Pelicot herself has called for. The Pelicot trial has been a wake-up call, forcing French people to face the patriarchal nature of their society. Hopefully, it will strengthen the country’s nascent cultural change around rape, which is essential if we are to finally put an end to gender-based violence. • Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

          "headline": "All my Christmas huffing and puffing has prompted a new catchphrase: ‘Stop struggling, Mum’",
          "bodyText": "Every few years, the grind of modern life inspires calls for a radical rethink. We have seen this most recently in Iceland, where the rollout of a 35-hour, four-day working week has shown signs of success, and more broadly with the conversation around remote working. For obvious reasons, these productivity experiments relate to adult working life. But what if children’s increasingly frantic lives were also given a rethink? I write this under the strain of what feels like the most flat-out week of the year, in which the sheer volume of low-key demands – plays, choirs, nativities, secret Santas, whip rounds, costume days, not to mention the bizarre closure of so many after-school programmes aeons before school finishes – leaves families dragging themselves towards the finish line, gasping for air. This image isn’t, as it turns out, merely figurative. As I slog through the final days, I am so theatrically put-upon that every small gesture triggers involuntary noises – huffing, puffing, groaning, sighing, the occasional piercing shriek – something I have only become conscious of thanks to my children’s catchphrase of the season: “Stop struggling.” The struggle is real. They seem fine, buoyed up by the prospect of Christmas, but it is hard for parents at this time of year not to wonder if there may not be a better way of doing things. I find myself thinking enviously of those cousins of mine who took their kids out of school to travel the world for two years on the basis that the experience would be more valuable than traditional learning. I don’t have the resources to do that, so instead I hover over words such as “holistic” and “flexi”, and all the other terms we reach for to launder an exhausted desire to do less. “I’m opting out” has become a useful phrase that dignifies what used to be called “can’t be arsed”. Ditto boundaries and comfort levels and the right to say no, all of which may get us some way further towards equilibrium. These kinds of measures are personal, small-scale responses to feelings of being overwhelmed. But there is another approach where children’s schedules are concerned, which involves something called “flexi-schooling”, in which kids are neither fully home-schooled, nor in full-time attendance at school, but engage in a mixture of the two. Devised originally for children suffering or recovering from illness, flexi-schooling isn’t a legal right for children in the UK but is allowed at the discretion of headteachers. If permitted, you can homeschool your child for part of the week. There are obvious downsides to this, as anyone whose memories of limited schooling during the pandemic cause them to twitch their limbs or experience rapid onset breathlessness can testify. Earlier this month Sir Martyn Oliver, the head of England’s schools inspectorate, Ofsted, raised concerns about flexi-schooling from a safeguarding perspective, since it makes record-keeping around absences and children who “go missing from education” harder. Ofsted’s annual report estimated that approximately 34,000 children were attending school on a flexi, part-time basis, for reasons that went unrecorded. Ideally, he said, flexi-schooling should be used only as a short-term measure rather than a long-term way to address behavioural needs. All of this makes sense and, of course, for most parents who work, the prospect of increasing their children’s number of hours at home during the day is a nightmare, not a solution. The desire for a general lowering of pressure is real, however, which explains how often “Scandinavia” is cited in conversations around education, with its prioritisation of play and relaxed approach to the age at which kids learn to read (six to eight years old, almost two years later than UK and US models). The longer you are in the system, it seems, the less intrusion you want from the system at home. I used to be quite keen on the idea of homework, but now that my kids are enrolled at a more or less homework-free primary school all I can think is, quite right and thank God. Let them have these 10 years without hitting marks or making grades. And while the answer to the craziness of the Christmas schedule isn’t a pivot to hybrid schooling, we should regularly remind ourselves not to treat our kids like tiny executives, slogging through their five-day week plus sports and music and drama and homework. Maybe one of these days, the gurus behind the Icelandic four-day week experiment or blockbuster books such as The 4-Hour Work Week might profitably turn their attention to the under-18s.

          "bodyText": "That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today. Here were today’s major developments: The federal court has fined AGL $25m for wrongly taking money from the pockets of welfare recipients who were no longer its customers using the government-run Centrepay system. The federal government announced it would slow visa processing in place of its failed blanket caps on international students with a new ministerial direction. The New South Wales Icac has announced it will not investigate the premier, Chris Minns, over his involvement in the proposal to turn Rosehill racecourse into 25,000 homes. Sydneysiders have been warned to expect imminent disruptions across the city’s rail network – including in the lead-up to the busy New Year’s period – after a court quashed the state government’s bid to halt industrial action, paving the way for unions to resume work stoppages. Jaclyn Symes has been sworn in as Victoria’s first female treasurer in a reshuffle by the premier, Jacinta Allan, after Tim Pallas quit politics on Monday. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed for the first time that an estimated 4.5% of Australians 16 years and over are lesbian, gay, bi, trans or gender diverse, or intersex (LGBTI+). The Australian federal police says it has charged a second Colombian national with debt bondage and servitude offences in relation to alleged human exploitation at their home in Adelaide. And a hiker has been found safe and well, six days after she went missing in bushland in the Blue Mountains. Have a good evening, wherever you are. Melbourne expected to hit 40C on Boxing Day Residents of Melbourne are in for a scorcher on Boxing Day, the weather bureau has predicted. The Bureau of Meteorology has released some of its forecasts for 26 December, showing the Victorian capital is in for a top of 40C. It’ll be hot in Canberra too, where the temperature is expected to reach 37C. Adelaide can expect a top of 34C. Sydney and Hobart are both set for a maximum temperature of 31C. We have more details on the Christmas Day forecasts here: Hiker missing in Blue Mountains for six days located safe and well, NSW police say A hiker has been found safe and well, six days after she went missing in bushland in the Blue Mountains. The 33-year-old woman was last seen at Katoomba last Friday. Police said they started looking for her after the alarm was raised when she could not be located or contacted. Her car was found on Galwey Lane in Mt Wilson about midday on Saturday, police said. Police said they had conducted a “widescale land and air search” of the bushland at Mt Wilson this week. The search included local police with the assistance of Police Rescue, PolAir, NSW ambulance service, the State Emergency Service and the Rural Fire Service (RFS). About 2.30pm today, the woman was spotted by a Rural Fire Service helicopter, police said. Police rescue officers and paramedics treated the woman at the scene for minor injuries and dehydration. She was flown to Nepean hospital for further treatment. Police have thanked the public and media for their assistance. The Albanese government has approved the extension of four coalmines that climate campaigners estimate will release more than 850m tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime, an equivalent to almost double Australia’s annual emissions. All four extensions were approved on Thursday afternoon. The four projects target mostly steel-making coal, with a small amount of coal for burning in power stations. Campaigners said the approvals would put Australians at increased risk from extreme weather events that are being amplified by fossil fuel emissions. The four projects approved are the Boggabri coalmine in New South Wales, the Caval Ridge Horse Pit in Queensland’s Bowen Basin, and also in Queensland, the Lake Vermont Meadowbrook coalmine and the Vulcan South coalmine. We’ll have more to come on this. Australian Energy Regulator says $25m AGL fine a warning to other retailers The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) has welcomed the issuing of a record $25m fine to AGL for using Centrepay to receive money from the welfare payments of former customers. The federal court issued the fine earlier today for AGL’s misuse of the system to wrongly receive and keep money from 483 Centrepay users between 9 January 2017 and 28 October 2021. The AER, which brought the case, said the penalty is the largest ever handed out for breaches of the national energy retail rules. The regulator said it served as a warning to energy retailers that they must refund money who have been overcharged. The AER chair, Clare Savage, said: The record $25 million penalty reflects the seriousness of the breaches and serves as a warning that the AER expects all retailers to refund customers if they have been overcharged and to provide consumers the full protections afforded under the Rules. The actions by AGL negatively impacted hundreds of people over an extended period, many of these may have been experiencing vulnerability. Continued from previous post: AFP Det Supt Melinda Adam said the federal police were committed to ensuring the safety and welfare of alleged victims of human trafficking. In a statement, Adam said: Servitude practices, including debt bondage, occur when people are subjected to conditions to which they had not agreed. Victims of human trafficking can be significantly deprived of personal freedom in all aspects of their life, and threats, coercion or deception are often used against them. In some instances, those being exploited may not come forward about their situation out of fear of retribution by perpetrators, social isolation or financial dependence of others. The AFP urges people to be aware of the indicators of slavery-like practices and report anything that may seem suspicious. Adam encouraged anyone that suspected they or another person was being exploited or at risk of being exploited to seek help by calling the AFP on 131 237 or making a report on its website. AFP charges second person over alleged human exploitation at Adelaide home The Australian federal police says it has charged a second Colombian national with debt bondage and servitude offences in relation to alleged human exploitation at their home in Adelaide. The AFP has alleged the woman was involved in the “ongoing and degrading treatment of other residents” who lived at her property in Kilburn, in Adelaide’s inner north. She allegedly maintained daily control of the victims by tracking their movements, restricting daily activities, scheduling compulsory daily chores, controlling earnings and forcing victims to pay off debts that were unreasonably enforced, the AFP said. The AFP said the allegations relate to a number of individuals who migrated to Adelaide from Venezuela in 2015 and 2016, and alleged the offences took place over a prolonged period at the Kilburn home and elsewhere in Australia. The AFP said it arrested the woman, 35, at her Kilburn home yesterday and charged her with the criminal offences of one count of remaining in servitude and one count of intending to cause a victim to enter into debt bondage. The woman appeared in the Adelaide magistrates court today, where she was granted bail with strict conditions, the AFP said. On 14 November, the AFP arrested a Colombian man who lived at the same Kilburn property and charged him with debt bondage and servitude offences. The man appeared in the Adelaide magistrates court on 15 November and was remanded to reappear at the same court today. The man and the woman are expected to reappear in court at a later date. The New South Wales government has accused rail unions of putting “a gun to our head” during negotiations over a new pay deal, after a court decision paved the way for unions to take rolling industrial actions that could disrupt Sydney’s train network on New Year’s Eve. The NSW transport minister, Jo Haylen, admitted to not knowing what industrial actions would be the first the unions have vowed to take immediately – conceding she couldn’t guarantee trains would definitely run on Friday – after the federal court earlier on Thursday dismissed the Minns government’s attempt to stop actions that rail unions had voted to take. Haylen warned the union now had the ability to now take any of the more than 200 industrial actions the court had cleared the way for – noting “many of them are contradictory” and had the ability to “strangle our network”, such as demands for 24-hour services or none at all, as well as bans on the state transit authorities changing rosters. She said: This is not a toy train set. You can’t just move it around with a click of your fingers and expect that that’s going to service the millions of people across Sydney that rely on it each and every day. Haylen vowed the government will seek to have industrial action banned in the lead-up to New Year’s Eve – going to the Fair Work Commission on grounds the actions could risk public safety and economic harm – but warned beyond that, the prospect of reaching a breakthrough in pay negotiations with unions was bleak. She said: The fact is, they’re happy to talk … as long as we agree with them. Now, we will not negotiate with a gun to our head. Matt Longland, the CEO of Sydney Trains, warned that authorities expect the period between Thursday and New Years to be “a challenging period on the rail network”. Longland said: So this will be a very significant impact for the travelling public … we do expect that we will see impacts from this industrial action in the coming days.

Handing over now to Catie McLeod who will keep you posted on the afternoon’s news. The opposition has hit out at Labor’s “open-slather approach” on limiting the number of international students that can study in Australia, with shadow education minister, Sarah Henderson, vowing to impose a “much tougher” but unspecified cap. As my colleague Caitlin Cassidy reported earlier today, the Albanese government introduced a new ministerial direction to throttle student visa applications once a tertiary education institution has reached 80% of its proposed international student cap. Labor’s approach replaces a former ministerial direction that gave visa processing priority to “low risk” sandstone universities and students from “low risk” nations. The Coalition has pledged a tough crackdown on the increasing number of international students entering the country after record lows in 2021 and 2022 due to the pandemic. Figures from the education department, released Wednesday, show there were more than 200,000 higher education commencements across the country in 2024. Labor has planned to pass legislation in the final sitting weeks to remove the former ministerial direction and replace it with new powers to set a cap on universities and suspend and cancel courses. The Greens and the Coalition teamed up against the changes and the bill did not pass. Henderson clarified on Thursday the opposition still supported a policy of limiting foreign student numbers, promising to bring in a “much tougher cap”. She added: By tying the new Ministerial Direction 111 to Labor’s flawed student caps scheme, the government will continue to drive excessive numbers of foreign students to Australia’s elite, metropolitan universities. This open-slather approach places no limit on the number of foreign students who can come to Australia. The Coalition will impose a much tougher cap on foreign students at metropolitan universities which puts the needs of Australians first.” But how would the opposition do that differently? We’re still none the wiser. Fears Vanuatu health system could be overwhelmed after earthquake Vanuatu’s public health system risks being overwhelmed amid mounting waterborne disease, aid agencies have said, as a lack of clean water and patchy telecommunications service complicated rescue operations after Tuesday’s powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake. The government’s disaster management office said early on Wednesday that 14 deaths had been confirmed, but hours later said nine had been verified by the main hospital. The number was expected to increase because people remained trapped in fallen buildings, a spokesperson said. About 200 people have been treated for injuries. Much of Vanuatu remains without water after two large reservoirs serving the capital, Port Vila, were totally decimated by the earthquake, the National Disaster Management Office said. Landslides and aftershocks exacerbated the damage to water infrastructure and increased the risk of disease, aid agencies said.

The $16.9tn estimated household wealth translates into about $625,000 per Australian, and the September quarter marked eight in a row that wealth has increased. Compared with June 2022, wealth has risen 17.4%, according to ABS data. Of course, a lot of the increase in health has been linked to rising house prices, which might ease the pain of repaying the mortgage just a bit. (The December quarter will probably mark a ninth quarter in a row of bulging wealth unless we get a string of days like today on the stock market, where shares have shed about 2%.) Superannuation assets rose 3.5% (or $137.4bn) in the September quarter, aided by the increase in the super guarantee from 11% to 11.5%, the ABS said. The Reserve Bank will be wary that an increase in the value of our assets will be accompanied by a “wealth effect” of households spending a bit more. However, there’s little sign of that spending splurge. The government’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) out yesterday forecast the growth of household consumption in this fiscal year will be only 1%, or half what they were expecting in the May budget. (The Kiwis copy us for many things, such as Reserve Bank of New Zealand. They also have a half-year economic and fiscal update. Myefo wears it better, I think.) The RBA in its most recent statement on monetary policy also had pencilled in a 2% growth pace for consumption in 2024-25. If they rein in their consumption predictions ahead of their next board meeting, set for 17-18 February – they might be more inclined to cut their key interest rate at that gathering. (Trouble is, we probably won’t know about that revision until the rates verdict lands.) Odds continue to shift gently towards a February RBA rate cut, but a lot can change between then and now. The New South Wales corruption watchdog will not investigate the premier, Chris Minns, over his involvement in the proposal to turn Rosehill racecourse into 25,000 homes. In a statement released a short time ago, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) said it had determined the information received did “not indicate a reasonable likelihood of involving corrupt conduct”. That decision was made unanimously by an assessment panel of three commissioners and senior staff, the watchdog said. The referral was made by a NSW parliamentary inquiry into the Rosehill plan, which found the Minns government failed to maintain impartiality in its championing of the controversial deal. In its report, released on 6 December, the upper house inquiry found the government had not followed proper process in the early stages of its dealings with the Australian Turf Club. It also found that Minns labelled a meeting with the head of the Australian Turf Club, Steve McMahon, as a “meet and greet” in one of his diary disclosures. The inquiry found this was “misleading” and inappropriate given Minns and McMahon’s longstanding friendship, and that the premier should have declared a conflict of interest. The inquiry referred its report to Icac. At the time, Minns emphatically denied any suggestion of wrongdoing. Icac has now confirmed that it will not pursue the report’s referral or an earlier referral that canvassed “analogous allegations”. The watchdog’s chair has written to the parliamentary committee which chaired the inquiry to advise it of the decision not to investigate the matter. You can read more of our coverage here: Racism ‘deeply entrenched’ at universities, human rights commission finds in Respect at Uni report “Both interpersonal and structural racism are pervasive and deeply entrenched at universities”, the Australian Human Rights Commission has found. The commission has published an interim report on its study, Respect At Uni. Race discrimination commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said the “alarming increase in antisemitism” on university campuses was one of the catalysts of the project. He said: Racism impacts different communities in different ways, including Jewish, Muslim, Palestinian and Arab students and staff. It has a profoundly negative impact on First Nations students and staff. International students also felt excluded and unwelcome, and African and Asian students and staff described “frequent and severe incidents of racism”. A “significant amount of work” is needed to address the issue, Sivaraman said, and the commission will make recommendations in their final report next year. Group of Eight universities opposed to Labor’s new international student policy University bodies have come out broadly supportive of Labor’s new international student policy, but not the Group of Eight (Go8). Ministerial Direction 111, introduced from today, replaces the current policy of visa processing priority for “low risk” sandstone universities with giving all education providers high priority processing until they reach 80% of their proposed international student cap. The caps failed to be legislated last month when they were were defeated by the Liberals and the Greens. Ceo of the Go8, which represents Australia’s research intensive universities,Vicki Thomson, said replacing “one flawed process with another” wouldn’t improve integrity and quality of the international student visa system. She said: We run the risk of confusing the international student market with these constant changes to policy settings. For too many potential students, it makes Australia look too hard and too unwelcoming as a higher education destination. Having set targets for each Australian university’s international enrolments for 2025, it makes no sense that prompt government support processing visas will only apply to 80% of that target. Even more bewildering is the fact that the direction allows for processing to be slowed down once this threshold reaches 80% – not the full threshold. You can see the full cap breakdown here: NSW government vows to prevent Christmas and New Year’s travel chaos The New South Wales government has vowed to “take every possible measure” to ensure Sydney’s train network runs smoothly over Christmas and New Year’s Eve after the federal court cleared the way for rail unions to resume industrial action immediately. After Thursday’s federal court ruling and a vow from union chiefs to resume action – including possible work stoppages – immediately, a NSW government spokesperson said: We will continue to take every possible measure to ensure industrial action does not affect Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Our next step is to lodge a section 424 into the Fair Work Commission to protect New Year’s Eve and stop rail disruption.” Jo Haylen, the NSW transport minister, is expected to speak shortly. Greens accuse Labor of ‘dog whistle’ on migrants under new international student policy The Greens’ reaction to Labor’s new international student policy is lukewarm at best, with the deputy leader and spokesperson for higher education, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, accusing the government of continuing to “dog whistle” on migrants. Faruqi said the replacement of Ministerial Direction 107 with Ministerial Direction 111 was welcome but the “heart of the issue remains unchanged”. Instead of targeting regional universities and “high risk” countries, the new policy will slow visa processing after institutions reach 80% of their proposed international student cap. Faruqi said Labor was using the “same flawed international student caps that were thoroughly rejected by … the sector” with their new direction. This might be a small reprieve for a sector that has been crushed for too long, but implementing international student caps by stealth through a ministerial direction is sneaky and does not tackle the issues universities face. Labor continues to dog-whistle and blame international students and migrants for the housing crisis they did not cause. The Albanese government should be ashamed of competing with Dutton’s Coalition in the terrible race to see who wins on punching down on migrants the hardest. Sydneysiders have been warned to expect imminent disruptions across the city’s rail network – including in the lead-up to the busy New Year’s period – after a court quashed the state government’s bid to halt industrial action paving the way for unions to resume work stoppages. On Thursday, the federal court dismissed the Minns government’s attempt to ban industrial action that rail unions had voted to take, undoing an interim injunction the government secured two Sundays ago which effectively paused rolling industrial action – which had been launched after an intense negotiating period for a new pay deal broke down. After the federal court’s decision, Toby Warnes, the New South Wales secretary of the Rail Tram and Bus Union (RTBU), said the union would now tell its members they could bring forward industrial action. Before Thursday’s ruling, the union had applied for a fresh protected industrial action ballot – which members voted in favour of – that would be exempt from the interim injunction. “As a result, industrial action will recommence immediately. We’re going back to our office to inform our members to enforce the bans that were on immediately before the injunction two Sundays ago,” Warnes said. Work stoppages, as well as distance limits for drivers and orders to deactivate Opal readers, are among the industrial actions that can now take place. Continued from previous post: Weather conditions are forecast to ease in the south-east on Thursday, as a south-easterly surge from New South Wales pushes north. “That means showers will start clearing from the south-eastern areas while continuing in parts further to the north,” the Bureau of Meteorology’s Miriam Bradbury said. As residents in the south-east wait for flood waters to subside, Queensland’s north is preparing for the next deluge of wet weather. The bureau has warned a trough offshore the coast of Townsville will drift northward from Thursday and linger for days. A weak embedded low may form in the trough later in the week but the bureau believes it is unlikely to become a tropical cyclone. Daily rainfall totals up to 60mm are forecast on Thursday and up to 80mm on Friday but there could be heavier localised falls of up to 200mm. “There is significant uncertainty in the timing and location of the heaviest rainfall, though small coastal catchments may receive the highest rainfall totals,” the bureau said. “Localised river level rises and flash flooding are likely within the areas of heaviest rainfall, with isolated minor riverine flooding possible.” – Australian Associated Press Emergency alerts as deluge raises rivers Anxious residents in two regional areas are waiting for flood waters to subside after emergency alerts were issued for rising river levels after days of heavy rain. People in the Western Downs and South Burnett in Queensland have been told to be prepared to evacuate homes ahead of possible inundation. “Residents in low-lying areas should PREPARE NOW,” Queensland police said in an alert early on Thursday. Warn neighbours, secure belongings and enact your emergency plan. It follows days of heavy rain across south-east Queensland which caused flooding and power outages. Conditions are forecast to ease but the state’s north could next be in the firing line of torrential downpours with a possible storm system forming off the coast. The Western Downs mayor, Andrew Smith, said the council was monitoring the situation in Jandowae after the local dam started spilling overnight. “We still have water coming into the dam. It is very much a watch and see,” he told ABC Radio. We’ll wait and see what unfolds during the day but I think the forecasts are very favourable. A major flood warning has also been issued for downstream of the Logan River at Beaudesert, expected to reach 8.3 metres on Thursday. – Australian Associated Press The National Tertiary Education Union (Nteu) has urged the federal government to ensure no jobs will be lost as a result of its new policy on international student visa applications. Ministerial Direction 111, which comes into effect today, will slow down visa processing once an institution reaches 80% of its proposed international student allocation in place of smaller universities and “high risk” countries, as was in practice. Nteu national president, Dr Alison Barnes, said the federal government must guarantee there would be no job losses stemming from a reduction in international students. We are calling for a transition fund to be put in place to ensure universities have no excuse but to protect their most precious asset – staff. Vice-chancellors have already shown a willingness to use changes to international student arrangements as fig leaf to cover their own failures, and unfairly threaten job cuts.The scaremongering must now end once and for all. We need an iron-clad commitment from universities and the federal government that this ministerial direction will not lead to a single job being cut. Australian shares plunge, Australian dollar hits 26-month low The Australian share market has plunged to a six-week low after the US Federal Reserve indicated it expected to cut interest rates just twice next year, while the Australian dollar hit its lowest level in 26 months. At 10.40am AEDT on Thursday, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 166.4 points, or 2.0%, to 8,143.0, while the broader All Ordinaries had fallen 172.8 points, or 2.02%, to 8,384.9. Overnight the Federal Reserve cut interest rates as expected, although it was a split vote, with one official favouring leaving rates on hold. The consensus of its rate-setting committee was for just two rate cuts in 2025, half the number previously predicted. “As we think about further cuts, we’re going to be looking for progress on inflation,” the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, told a news conference. “We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation.” – Australian Associated Press The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) is working with Commbank (CBA) to subsidise electric vehicles for customers earning less than $100,000 a year, as well as essential workers including police, teachers, fire fighters and healthcare workers. CEFC has committed $150 million to CBA’s EV Access Program, supporting a discounted rate that will apply to new and used EVs valued up to $55,000, as well as home charging infrastructure. The program could save customers between 1% and 5% for EV specific loans compared to secured internal combustion engine vehicle loan, according to a CEFC statement. “For example, on a loan of $40,000, a five% interest rate discount over seven years could save customers more than $8,000 in interest,” as put in the statement. The loan aims to support CBA customers earning less than $100,000 a year, as well as police, teachers, fire fighters, health care, and other essential workers. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed for the first time that an estimated 4.5% of Australians 16 years and over are lesbian, gay, bi, trans or gender diverse, or Intersex (LGBTI+). According to ABS head of health statistics, Robert Long, this is the “first nationally representative data of their kind in Australia”. The ABS estimated that: About 0.3% of Australians 16 years and over report they know they were born with variations of sex characteristics LGB+ Australians 16 years and over make up about 3.6% of the population About 0.9% of Australians 16 years and over are trans and gender diverse, including trans men, trans women and non-binary people Young Australians were more likely to be LGBTI+, with 9.5% of people aged 16 to 24, and 7.5% in the 25-34 category identifying as LGBTI+. The jurisdictions with the most LGBTI+ people were in the ACT (5.9%) and Victoria (5.3%), statistically significantly more than other states and territories – although LGBTI+ people are found everywhere in Australia. Jaclyn Symes is speaking about her appointment as Victoria’s first female treasurer. She says she’s very excited about the new challenge, though sad to leave her role as attorney general and emergency services minister: When you are a minister and you have the opportunity to work in a portfolio, it’s somewhat a part of your family, it becomes part of your identity. Leaving attorney and emergency services is hard, but I am excited about a new challenge. Asked how she will she be different to Tim Pallas, Symes says: I have an enormous amount of respect for Tim, but I’m a very different person. I will bring a different approach, and I’ll let you guys, perhaps do comparisons at some time in the future. Allan says Symes will be first female treasurer in state history Allan says Jaclyn Symes will bring “new energy” and focus to the role of treasurer. She says: I am particularly proud to note that Jaclyn is the first woman in Victoria’s history to serve in the role of treasurer, and alongside myself, we are the first two women to hold these roles in the state’s history, and that is something that reflects enormously on Jacqueline’s great work ethic, great dedication and commitment, and also has the Victorian parliament and the Victorian government reflect the community that we represent. Allan says: This team backs in my priorities in housing, jobs and supporting busy families. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has unveiled her new cabinet. As we reported earlier the state attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, will become treasurer as well as minister for industrial relations and regional development, with the planning minister, Sonya Kilkenny, to take over her role as attorney general. Vicki Ward will take Symes’ emergency services portfolio, equality and a new minsitry for “natural disasters and recovery” In a demotion for Danny Pearson, he has lost his transport infrastructure ministry to Gabrielle Williams and responsibility for the suburban rail loop to Harriet Shing, who will also take the newly created “housing and building” portfolio. His portfolios of Worksafe and TAC will be handed to deputy premier, Ben Carroll. Instead, Pearson will become minister for economic growth, jobs and a new portfolio for “finance”. Labor’s newest minister, Nick Staikos, will take on the ministries of consumer affairs and local government. Minns says pill-testing is not permanent and they will be ‘led by the information’ Minns reiterated that the introduction of trial pill testing at music festivals is not a permanent decision. He said to press: We [are] not making the decision to make it permanent today, we want to be led by the information that is presented over [the] summer period. Ultimately our responsibility is to keep people alive and to save lives and we believe this decision is a step in the right direction. Minns acknowledges ‘essential contradiction’ in NSW pill testing turnabout but says it’s better than risking deaths Speaking to press about the introduction of trial pill testing at music festivals, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, says his government has decided to “live with a contradiction” in law “rather than risk someone dying as a result of not having it in place”. He said: I want to make it clear from the beginning, we acknowledge there is an essential contradiction to this change in policy. Drugs are illegal in the state yet we have made a decision to allow for pill testing at major music festivals. There is no perfect law here, there is no law that we can craft that can do both things at the same time. The government has made a decision to live with a contradiction rather than risk someone dying as a result of not having it in place. AGL has been fined $25m for wrongly taking money from the pockets of welfare recipients who were no longer its customers using the government-run Centrepay system. The federal court issued the substantial fine on Thursday morning. It had previously ruled that AGL had breached the energy rules 14,000 times in its use of Centrepay, a debit system designed to help welfare recipients pay for essentials. The Centrepay system was used to allow AGL to take deductions from hundreds of welfare recipients who had long ago left as customers. The court ordered that AGL implement a compliance and training program to ensure that it was automatically alerted when money came to it via Centrepay from former customers. It must also set up a compliance and training program to ensure staff do not breach energy retail rules when dealing with inactive customers, with the program to be regularly and independently reviewed. AGL was also ordered to appoint a compliance officer to ensure the company meets the court’s orders. The company is not alone in its alleged misuse of Centrepay. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, has referred three other energy retailers to the regulator over similar allegations. The regulator is still considering whether to take enforcement action against them. The federal government recently announced a suite of reforms to Centrepay, including measures to stop energy retailers using the system to continue receiving money from former customers. Shareholders rebuke ANZ over executive pay ANZ’s outgoing chief executive, Shayne Elliott, will forfeit $3.2m in bonuses in a bid to quell backlash by shareholders against the bank’s executive remuneration plans at the annual general meeting today. The forfeited 2025 bonus is called “long term variable remuneration”, which refers to various incentives linked to performance. Last financial year, he secured a $3.4m long-term bonus, and a total statutory pay packet of $5.7m. The long-serving CEO is due to step down next year, and will still earn his base pay plus any other available bonuses. Elliott’s base pay last financial year was $2.5m. Earlier, the ANZ chairman, Paul O’Sullivan, told shareholders in Melbourne today that a “sizeable group” of shareholders will voting against the remuneration report. “We will ensure we take the lessons into account in our future deliberations,” O’Sullivan said. Early voting results from appointed proxy groups showed that the protest vote would exceed 25% when votes are finalised today, which would represent a first strike against the remuneration report. A second strike next year would open the bank up to a potential board spill. The corporate regulator has previously announced it is investigating ANZ over its handling of a bond sale. Australia sends disaster assistance to Vanuatu Australia has sent a 64-person disaster assistance team and two canines to Vanuatu to help with search and rescue efforts after a powerful magnitude-7.3 earthquake hit the island on Tuesday. The federal government confirmed the teams, which include doctors, paramedics and federal police, landed in the island’s capital, Port Vila, on Wednesday. Communications and the commercial airport on the island have been heavily affected by the earthquake and teams on the ground are still assessing the damage and searching for survivors. Overnight, 148 Australians were returned home on two Royal Australian air force aircraft. The foreign affairs department has confirmed about 500 Australians have registered on its online crisis registration portal for assistance. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, was asked whether further flights would be organised to help stranded Australians. She told ABC News breakfast this morning: We stand ready to support the people of Vanuatu at the government of Vanuatu’s request. Really what was sent in the last 24 hours was the first instalment and of course we are ready to provide further assistance as this disaster unfolds. We are neighbours and friends in this region. Qantas engineers to strike on Friday Qantas is seeking to reassure its holidaymakers that industrial action planned by some of its engineers for Friday won’t wreak havoc on their travel plans. Members of an alliance of engineering unions will take stop work action tomorrow, a week after they also walked off the job last Friday, as they seek better pay and conditions. On Thursday, Qantas said last week’s strike led to no customer impact. In a statement, Qantas said: The airline has worked hard to put a number of contingencies in place and passengers should continue to head to the airport as planned. As always, unplanned maintenance issues, adverse weather, or other events may impact operations on the day. Approximately 160 line maintenance AMEs are rostered on during Friday’s period of action with only Alliance union members eligible to take part. The additional workgroups taking action form part of long-term aircraft maintenance teams and don’t perform day of operation engineering support. A Qantas spokesperson said: It’s disappointing to see the unions targeting people travelling to see loved ones at this time of year. We’re offering our engineers a competitive package including pay rises, upskilling and career progression that will enable them to earn significantly more over the next few years. New South Wales will trial pill testing at music festivals after a decades-long push by advocates calling for the government to heed harm reduction evidence. The Minns government announced on Thursday the 12-month long trial will enable festival-goers to take a small sample of narcotics to a health professional to test for purity, potency and adulterants. “No parent wants to be given the news that something has happened to their child at a music festival, and that they are now in an emergency department or worse,” said the state premier, Chris Minns. The trial has a clear purpose – to reduce harm and save lives. In March, Queensland became the first state to establish two permanent pill-testing clinics after Canberra established one in 2022. Last October, the Minns government had rejected renewed calls to introduce pill testing after two young men died at a music festival. Jen Ross-King, whose daughter Alex Ross-King died in 2019 at a Sydney music festival after taking MDMA and drinking, was among those calling for the change, imploring the government “listen to the experts”. The introduction of pill testing was overwhelmingly backed by drug reform advocates at the state’s second drug summit, last month.

Marsden founded Candlebark in 2006, then Alice Miller School in 2016, “embodying his progressive educational philosophy that emphasised student agency, creativity, and adventure,” their statement reads. John Marsden transformed countless young lives through both his writing and his groundbreaking approach to education. Despite stepping down as principal earlier this year, John remained deeply involved with both schools … Just last week, he attended both the Year 7 and Grade 6 graduations, where students spoke movingly about the impact of his educational vision on their lives. As an author, John’s contribution to young adult literature was revolutionary. His unflinching honesty in addressing complex themes resonated with readers globally, earning him numerous awards including the Children’s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year award. However, true to his humble nature, John often downplayed his literary success, preferring to focus on his educational work where he could directly impact young lives. The Australian author, beloved for young adult novels including the Tomorrow series and The Rabbits, died yesterday, aged 74: Threats to Australian federal parliamentarians reported to the Australian Federal Police have increased by more than 40% in the past financial year. The AFP received 1,009 reports of incidents involving harassment, nuisance, offensive and threatening communications in 2023-2024. This is a 42% increase from the 709 matters reported during the same period in 2022-23. AFP Cmdr Stephen Fry said a threat of harm or violence against a federal parliamentarian is a criminal offence. Universities Australia welcomes scrapping of Ministerial Direction 107 Universities Australia has breathed a sigh of relief over Labor’s decision to scrap Ministerial Direction 107 (MD107), which “wreaked havoc” on regional and outer metropolitan institutions. The regulation, enacted in December last year, gave visa processing priority to “low risk” sandstone universities and students from “low risk” nations. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy, said it was a “commonsense decision” that was “desperately needed” to deliver certainty and stability to the embattled sector. MD107 has wreaked havoc, stripping billions of dollars from the economy and inflicting incredibly serious financial harm on universities, particularly those in regional and outer suburban areas. We have called for it to be revoked since June and we strongly support the Albanese government’s decision to create a more even playing field for universities. Sheehy said declining government investment in higher education had meant institutions had become “necessarily reliant” on international student venue, while also being used as “cannon fodder in a political battle over migration and housing”. “As we head toward the next federal election, our ask is simple – we need to take the politics out of higher education and focus on the national interest that flows from it.” The federal government will slow visa processing in place of its failed international student cap with a new ministerial direction. The cap, which would drive down enrolments to a maximum of 270,000, was voted down by the Liberals and the Greens. Ministerial Direction 107, which has been operating as an arbitrary cap by targeting regional universities and “high risk” countries, will be replaced from today with a new direction that priorities international education providers acting “sustainably”. The home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said the policy was a counterbalance to Peter Dutton’s “recklessness” in blocking the legislation. The best option would have been the cap that was voted down by Peter Dutton, but this option will still allow us to use one of the biggest levers in our migration system. Jaclyn Symes to become Victorian treasurer Victoria’s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, is set to become the state’s first female treasurer. Guardian Australia understands Symes – the leader of the government in the upper house – will be sworn in on Thursday to replace Tim Pallas, who quit politics on Monday. She was tapped by the premier, Jacinta Allan, for the role, despite not being from the socialist left faction Pallas was a part of. While she does not have an economic or financial background, Symes currently sits on the cabinet’s expenditure committee and is widely considered a good operator. Symes will be one of few treasurers to sit in the upper house, including former Labor treasurer John Lenders. Her swearing-in at Government House will be accompanied by a more significant cabinet reshuffle than previously flagged by Allan earlier this week. It will kick off at about 11am. Man charged after allegedly threatening violence against an aged care facility based on religion A man has been charged with threatening violence based on religion after he allegedly posted an offensive comment online directed towards a Randwick aged-care facility, NSW police said in a media release. Guardian Australia understand the comment is believed to be antisemitic. Officers commenced investigations on Wednesday after receiving a report of an alleged threat of violence. A 48-year-old man was arrested at a home in Cambridge Street, Harris Park, at 3pm. He was charged with publicly threatening violence on the grounds of religion and using a carriage service to “menace/harass/offend,” police said. The man was released on conditional bail to appear at Parramatta local court on 15 February 2025. Police will allege he posted a threatening and offensive comment on a social media platform directed towards an aged care facility in Randwick. Bali bomb plotters moved from Guantánamo to Malaysia after guilty plea The US has transferred two Malaysian detainees from the Guantánamo Bay military prison to their home country, after they pleaded guilty to charges related to deadly 2002 Bali bombings and agreed to testify against the alleged ringleader of that and other attacks. Prosecutors say Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep worked for years with Encep Nurjaman, known as Hambali, an Indonesian leader of al-Qaida affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah. The two men helped Nurjaman escape capture after the 12 October 2002 bombings that killed 202 people at two nightspots in Bali, US officials said. The two men entered guilty pleas to conspiracy and other charges in January. Their transfer comes after they provided testimony that prosecutors plan to use in the future against Nurjaman, the alleged mastermind, the Pentagon said in a statement on Wednesday. Nurjaman is in custody in Guantánamo awaiting resumption of pre-trial hearings in January involving the Bali bombings and other attacks. Read the full story here: Almost 150 Australians were flown out of Vanuatu overnight after a powerful earthquake hit the Pacific island earlier this week. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the 148 Australian citizens returned home on two Royal Australian Air Force aircraft in a post on X on Thursday morning. “We are helping Vanuatu to restore operations at the commercial airport. Additional assistance will be provided where possible, ahead of the airport reopening.” The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed its online crisis registration portal had around 500 registrations from Australians as of Wednesday. Violent attacks against women and children spike on key public holidays, as a new study reveals New Year’s Day as the worst date for a rise in assaults recorded. Data released by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research shows the extent of the increase in violence on significant dates of the calendar. The report shows both domestic violence and non-DV assaults peak on New Year’s Day, with more assaults occurring on this day than on any other day of the year. “The early hours of New Year’s Day are particularly concerning, with assaults peaking between midnight and 3am, reflecting the extended revelry of New Year’s Eve,” the bureau’s executive director, Jackie Fitzgerald, said. While domestic violence assaults soared on Christmas Day, non-DV attacks were among the lowest of the year. Fitzgerald said it showed the unique pressure families faced at this time of the year as people were forced to navigate heightened emotions and family dynamics. The research also found “notable spikes” on Australia Day and Anzac Day. Domestic violence in particular soared by more than 60% on Australia Day, with greater alcohol consumption, crowds and social gatherings attributed as higher risk factors. - Australian Associated Press Australian aid to Ukraine to surpass $1.5bn as embassy reopens Australia’s support for Ukraine will surpass $1.5bn as it offers more aid and reveals an embassy will reopen in the war-torn country for the first time since 2022, Australian Associated Press reports The ambassador to Ukraine, Paul Lehmann, and the deputy head of mission will return to Kyiv in January, the foreign minister, Penny Wong, said from the nation’s capital on Thursday. Wong visited Australia’s embassy in Kyiv, which was closed by the former Morrison government in 2022 at the outbreak of war against Russia. “The Albanese government has always said we would reopen our embassy in Kyiv when it is safe to do so,” she said. A cross-party parliamentary inquiry in November said there was a “strong case” for a return of a physical diplomatic presence, pointing to 70 other nations that have reopened their embassies. Wong met Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, her counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, and the energy minister, Herman Halushchenko. From the ground in Vanuatu More from AAP: Tim Cutler, the Sydney-raised boss of Vanuatu Cricket, was having lunch in the downtown Coffee Tree cafe when the mighty tremor shook the buildings around him. “The first shake was not an alien feeling to anyone that has spent much time in Vanuatu. You get frequent tremors,” he told AAP. “But it just got stronger and stronger so I went from a moment of ‘oh’ to ‘oh no’. “Things were just flying around and I was lucky not to be hit by anything. A couple of people I was with had a few bruises, some people were screaming, some were quiet, a few people were running around. “A water tank fell over and rolled on to a lady hiding under a table ... it was just surreal, slow-motion (that felt) somewhere between a dream or a movie or at a theme park.” Gallagher says Labor has done a lot to address ‘structural pressures’ on budget The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has defended the government’s approach to aged care, health, the NDIS, defence and paying interest on debt after accusations from the opposition of high spending ahead of next year’s federal election. Asked why the government has failed to bring in enough reform to pay for spending on ABC Radio National, Gallagher said: I think we have … We’ve got some big pressures coming on to the budget. We’ve been talking about that those for a while, aged care, health care, NDIS, defense and paying interest on the government’s debt, and I think we’ve made progress in all of those areas. They are the big five structural pressures on the budget. We’ve put in reforms the NDIS, we’ve put in reforms to aged care, and both of those are showing improvements in MYEFO [the mid year economic financial outlook]. In Defence, Richard Marles has done an extraordinary amount of work to make sure that defence can live within their funding envelope, and we’ve lowered the debt burden and reduced the interest on that debt in the order of $70bn. Each budget update and budgets are a set of decisions and balances, but on the structural side of the budget, I don’t think you would have found a government that’s done more to try and address those big structural spends than we’ve done in the last two years. The MYFEO handed down yesterday indicated Australia’s federal budget is on track for a deficit of $26.9bn this financial year and is not projected to return to balance until 2034-35. Read more: Gallagher defends budget after criticism from EY economist Katy Gallagher, the minister for finance, has responded to a statement from Cherelle Murphy, EY’s chief economist, on ABC Radio National. Murphy said the government – and other governments before it – have not been willing to match up revenue and expenditure, passing debts across generations. Gallagher: I think it’s easy to commentate on a budget. It’s harder to put one together. And we when you look at what we’ve done with this budget since coming to government, the budget is $200bn better off since we inherited it. We’ve also paid down debt. We’ve paid lowered the interest bill on that debt. We’ve delivered two surpluses, and we’ve managed to find investments to go into all of those key areas that people care about, whether it be cost of living or essential services. And we’ve done all of that. It’s a balancing act. There’s more work to do. A budget is an ongoing project, in a sense, because the demands of government never stop. Australian rescue and medical teams have arrived in Port Vila as Vanuatu races to respond to Tuesday’s 7.3-magnitude earthquake. The death toll stood at 14 late on Wednesday with at least 200 injured, according to the Red Cross, Australian Associated Press reports. Anthony Albanese said the crews would be on the ground from last night and the people of Vanuatu had a long road to recovery ahead. “Australia stands ready to provide further assistance to our Pacific family in their time of need,” he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. No Australians have been confirmed dead in the quake, but one case in particular shows the ties between the two Pacific neighbours. Rodney Prestia, chief executive of labour hire business iComply, told AAP that a 26-year-old woman who he identified only as Valerie was crushed in a collapsed building. “It’s an absolute tragedy and our team’s been really rattled by it,” he said. With the airport reopening on Wednesday afternoon, relief and support from Australia was able to touch down, including a C17 Globemaster and C130 Hercules with personnel from Queensland and NSW Fire and Rescue. Australian federal police, a foreign affairs department crisis response team and a medical assistance team were also deployed. The taskforce leader and chief superintendent, Douglas May, said their first priority was to help people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. “Ultimately we know there are lives to be saved there right now,” he said. Labor gives go ahead to electricity transmission link in southern NSW The Albanese government has given the greenlight to a major electricity transmission link in southern New South Wales that could allow three gigawatts of large-scale renewable energy projects to connect the Australian east coast power grid. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said she had approved the $4.8bn HumeLink – a long-promised 365km, 500-kilovolt high-voltage connection that would link Wagga Wagga, Bannaby and Maragle and is needed to connect the troubled Snowy 2.0 development. Plibersek said the approval came with conditions to protect nature, including limits on land clearing and that most of the new transmission lines would be within existing transmission corridors. In a statement, Plibersek said Labor was “getting on with the job of transforming Australia into a renewable energy superpower” while the Coalition was proposing a “risky nuclear plan”: The renewable energy transition is real, it’s happening right now, and it’s the only plan supported by experts and business to deliver clean, affordable and reliable power for homes. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, last week announced further details of the Coalition’s nuclear policy. It would involve significantly slowing the rollout of renewable energy and attempting to extend the life of old coal-fired plants until after 2040. You can read more about it here, here and here. Thank you Martin Farrer for kicking off the blog this morning. I’ll be rolling your news updates through the day – let’s get into it Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it will be Rafqa Touma who takes over. Penny Wong has pledged another $1.5bn in aid to Ukraine and announced that the Australian embassy in Kyiv will be reopened. On a visit to the Ukrainian capital on Wednesday, the foreign minister said the ambassador to Ukraine, Paul Lehmann, and the deputy head of mission will return to Kyiv in January. More coming up. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has announced this morning that tech companies will have two extra months to finalise plans to restrict children from accessing adult websites. She said the industry needed time to consider the rushed under-16s social media ban legislation and how it might intersect with restrictions on adult content. Vanuatu’s capital was still without water last night, a day after reservoirs were destroyed by the magnitude 7.3 earthquake that wrought havoc on the South Pacific island nation. The death toll of 14 is expected to climb as rescue workers dig through collapsed buildings and includes a woman who recently finished a nine-month work stint in Queensland. More coming up."

          "headline": "Australian government moves to slow foreign student visas after failure of cap plan",
          "bodyText": "The federal government will replace its failed international student cap with slowed visa processing in what has been described as “political point scoring” by the former deputy immigration secretary. The cap, which aimed to drive down enrolments to a maximum of 270,000 by setting limits for individual institutions, was blocked by the Liberals and the Greens in the final sitting days of parliament. The new Ministerial Direction 111 (MD111), to operate from Thursday, will introduce two categories of student visa processing: “high priority” and “standard priority” instead of capping numbers. All international education providers will receive high priority processing up to 80% of their indicative international student cap. After reaching 80%, they will receive standard priority processing. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It replaces Ministerial Direction 107 (MD107), which was enacted in December last year as an arbitrary cap that gave visa processing priority to “low risk” sandstone universities and students from “low risk” nations, disproportionately affecting applicants from south Asia. The minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, said the policy was a counterbalance to Peter Dutton’s “recklessness” in blocking the legislation. “The best option would have been the cap that was voted down by Peter Dutton, but this option will still allow us to use one of the biggest levers in our migration system,” he said. Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of immigration, said MD111 wasn’t “earth shattering” and wouldn’t change much other than a slightly faster processing of visas for regional universities. “It certainly isn’t a cap on student visas and it would be illegal for the government to try to use it that way,” he said. Rizvi pointed to an “absolute blizzard of measures” enforced to improve integrity in international education in the past 12 months, which reduced the offshore application rate by 40% and largely removed visa processing delays. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on overseas migration, released last week, showed there were 207,000 international student arrivals in 2023-2024, a decrease from 278,000 in 2022-23 and well below Labor’s proposed cap. “The order of processing doesn’t make much difference if there is no backlog,” Rizvi said. “The primary factor is the refusal rate which is linked to the risk rating system and hits regional universities much harder. “There’s no proposal to change it, it just means a faster no. This looks like political point scoring to me – they’re trying to show Dutton ‘we’ve got to do what we were going to do’.” The chief executive officer of Universities Australia, Luke Sheehy, said MD111 was a “commonsense decision” that was “desperately needed” to deliver certainty to the embattled sector. “MD107 has wreaked havoc, stripping billions of dollars from the economy and inflicting incredibly serious financial harm on universities, particularly those in regional and outer suburban areas,” he said. “We have called for it to be revoked since June and we strongly support the Albanese government’s decision to create a more even playing field for universities.” Sheehy said declining government investment in higher education over the past decade had meant institutions had become “necessarily reliant” on international student revenue, while also being used as “cannon fodder in a political battle over migration and housing”. “As we head toward the next federal election … we need to take the politics out of higher education and focus on the national interest that flows from it,” he said. CEO of the Group of Eight, which represents Australia’s sandstone universities, Vicki Thomson, said replacing “one flawed process with another” wouldn’t improve the integrity and quality of the international student visa system. “We run the risk of confusing the international student market with these constant changes to policy settings,” she said. “Having set targets for each Australian university’s international enrolments for 2025, it makes no sense that prompt government support processing visas will only apply to 80% of that target.” The Innovative Research Universities (IRU), which represents seven institutions including Western Sydney University, said it shouldn’t have taken this long to replace MD107, particularly when the education minister had described it as a “blunt instrument”. Its executive director, Paul Harris, said decisions taken over the past year had “damaged Australia’s reputation as a high-quality provider of international education”. “We now need a commitment from all sides of politics to a positive and proactive approach to international education.” Finance minister Katy Gallagher told ABC News Breakfast on Thursday the new policy would “prioritise visas for students going to … regional and smaller universities”, which Labor had “wanted to do” through its student cap. “It will just help us manage those international student numbers, which … have contributed to quite substantial growth in numbers of people coming to Australia,” she said. The Regional Universities Network (RUN) chief executive officer, Alec Webb, said MD111 was an improvement on the proposed student cap and MD107, which rewarded a “handful of metropolitan universities”. Since 2019, international student fee revenue at regional universities has dropped by 61% and international student numbers have dropped by more than half. “The key thing is how it works in practice,” Webb said. “How visas are processed, what are the time frames, and how do we set numbers going forward. “We had issues with caps that set some universities well below pre-pandemic student numbers, which could perpetually be trapped at a significantly lower [international student] number.”"

          "bodyText": "‘You can’t spend Christmas like that!” exclaimed friends and relatives when I revealed my plan to cycle around London on my own on Christmas Day. “I’ll be worried about you feeling lonely and depressed,” said one. “I really don’t think it’s a good idea.” I understood. Usually, the idea of Christmas alone filled me with nightmarish images of isolation and despair. But I had recently lost both my parents. For the past 11 months, my brother and I had been in our parents’ house going through a lifetime of letters, books, clothes, pictures and precious possessions. I needed a break from it all. I wanted a day to explore, to dream, to be open to whatever crossed my path. A few days before Christmas, I was in a taxi, chatting to the lovely driver. When I told him I was going to cycle around London on Christmas Day, he cried: “Me too! That’s what I always do.” I was amazed. So it’s a thing. We agreed to look out for each other and wave if our paths crossed. So, on Christmas Day, armed with home-made mince pies and wearing a twinkling scarf of cheap battery-operated fairy lights (which broke after five minutes), I set out on my adventure. I whizzed about, owning the streets of London. It was fabulous. After about an hour, I stopped at a bench in Regent’s Park and started chatting to a Spanish woman who was taking photographs of the zoo. “This is where the wolves used to be before they were moved. You can still see them, though, in a scene in Withnail and I,” she told me excitedly. I knew the spot well, as it is where we used to pick conkers as children. She was meant to be in Madrid but had missed her flight the evening before. So her huge Spanish family were gathered in her mum’s tiny flat, while she walked around London with her camera. Once she had got over the shock, she embraced the situation. Up to now, she said, every Christmas had been the same and they would probably be the same for years to come. That resonated with me. I had certainly had enough Christmases to get me through one alone. All those trees and stockings and presents and failed attempts to light the pudding. All the laughter and rows and forgotten brandy butter. All of it was so alive in me still, keeping me company. Sometimes a moment to pause and digest is a relief. After surprising the Spanish woman with my mince pies (she asked for a second one), I ventured on. The streets were pretty empty on the whole, but in Piccadilly Circus there were crowds of people under the electronic billboards. As I got closer I spotted a tiny hot dog stand, operating at full steam. I bet the owner knew that, with most restaurants closed, people would suddenly be mad for hot dogs. I cycled down Oxford Street and managed to arrive in front of a traffic camera at the time I had arranged with my friend Julian. He was watching the camera feed online and took a screenshot of me with my bike. Somehow, despite the plethora of media we have at hand, and despite being just a blurry blob in the image, it felt thrilling that we had connected via CCTV. And not on any day. This was Christmas Day. I sailed down Park Lane and when I stumbled on the very Parisian-looking Shepherd Market I decided to ask a couple to take a photograph of me. They were extremely sweet and had just got engaged. But they were really hungry as they hadn’t managed to find a place to eat. So I offered them my mince pies and they were delighted. They told me how the man had hidden the ring in his jacket pocket, but when he got down on one knee, he realised he was wearing the wrong jacket. They used a bit of string from a clothes tag on a new jumper instead. And they showed me the precious piece of string that they were now trying to keep safe. Then I went east. As I approached Shoreditch, it started raining so I pulled over. A man took shelter under the same canopy. He looked very sad. I wanted to say “Merry Christmas”, but it didn’t seem appropriate. I didn’t know why he was sad but given that I was going through intense grief myself, I knew it when I saw it. While we waited, I offered him a mince pie. I told him I had made them myself. He asked what brought me to do that and to cycle around, so I told him about my parents and my need to step away from traditions this year. He nodded knowingly and smiled. We ate our pies in silence and I felt touched by the warm presence of this gentle human being. I remembered when I first lost my mum and dad, how small interactions from strangers had a huge impact. Sometimes it seemed as if grief is a secret club that you join unwittingly and then people who can tell that you are a new member whisper little pieces of unforgettable advice or support into your ear. As I meandered around Shoreditch I thought I saw my friend the taxi driver on his bike. I waved madly and he waved back – but it wasn’t him. However, I know that on any other day of the year, a total stranger cycling in London would never wave back at me. So I took this as a prompt to wave at any cyclist I passed as I made my way home, and they all waved merrily too. By now it was starting to get dark and cold and I was happy to step into the warmth of home. I put the kettle on and it struck me that I hadn’t felt a single moment of solitude all day. I felt accompanied by the wonder of the world and all the many lives going on, a few of which I had the honour of glimpsing more closely. I realised there are many ways to spend Christmas Day and, by stepping away from the comfort of convention, I ended up somewhere unexpected and magical. I curled up on the sofa with my tea and looked at a photo of my parents. My grief felt different – lighter. My perception of loss altered that day. I discovered that small cracks of possibility reside in the dense tapestry of grief and that a painful void can also become a place of freedom and adventure.

          "headline": "Amazon-hosted AI tool for UK military recruitment ‘carries risk of data breach’",
          "bodyText": "An artificial intelligence tool hosted by Amazon and designed to boost UK Ministry of Defence recruitment puts defence personnel at risk of being identified publicly, according to a government assessment. Data used in the automated Textio system to improve the drafting of defence job adverts and attract more diverse candidates by improving the inclusiveness language, includes names, roles and emails of military personnel and is stored using Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the US. This means “a data breach may have concerning consequences, ie identification of defence personnel”, according to documents detailing government AI systems published for the first time today. The risk has been judged to be “low” and the MoD said “robust safeguards” have been put in place by the suppliers, listed on the MoD website as Textio, AWS and Amazon GuardDuty, a threat detection service. (Amazon says GuardDuty is not a supplier, rather a product of AWS.) But it is one of several risks acknowledged by the government about its use of AI tools in the public sector in a tranche of documents released to improve transparency about the central government’s use of algorithms. Official declarations about how the algorithms work stress that mitigations and safeguards are in place to tackle risks, as ministers push to use AI to boost UK economic productivity and, in the words of the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, on Tuesday, “bring public services back from the brink”. It was reported this week that Chris Wormald, the new cabinet secretary, has told civil servants the prime minister wants “a rewiring of the way the government works”, requiring officials to take “advantage of the major opportunities technology provides”. Google and Meta have been working directly with the UK government on pilots to use AI in public services. Microsoft is providing its AI-powered Copilot system to civil servants, and earlier this month the Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said he wanted government to “think more like a startup”. Other risks and benefits identified in current central government AIs include: The possibility of inappropriate lesson material being generated by a AI-powered lesson-planning tool used by teachers based on Open AI’s powerful large language model, GPT-4o. The AI saves teachers time and can personalise lesson plans rapidly in a way that may otherwise not be possible. “Hallucinations” by a chatbot deployed to answer queries about the welfare of children in the family courts. However, it also offers round the clock information and reduces queue times for people who need to speak to a human agent. “Erroneous operation of the code” and “incorrect input data” in HM Treasury’s new PolicyEngine that uses machine learning to model tax and benefit changes “with greater accuracy than existing approaches”. “A degradation of human reasoning” if users of an AI to prioritise food hygiene inspection risks become over-reliant on the system. It may also result in “consistently scoring establishments of a certain type much lower”, but it should also mean faster inspections of places that are more likely to break hygiene rules. The disclosures come in a newly expanded algorithmic transparency register that records detailed information about 23 central government algorithms. Some algorithms, such as those used in the welfare system by the Department for Work and Pensions, which have shown signs of bias, are still not recorded. “Technology has huge potential to transform public services for the better,” said Kyle. “We will put it to use to cut backlogs, save money and improve outcomes for citizens across the country. Transparency in how and why the public sector is using algorithmic tools is crucial to ensure that they are trusted and effective.” Central government organisations will be required to publish a record for any algorithmic tool that interacts directly with citizens or significantly influences decisions made about people, unless a narrow set of exemptions apply such as national security. Records will be published for tools once they are being piloted publicly or are live and running. Other AIs included on the expanded register include an AI chatbot that handles customer queries to Network Rail trained on historic cases from the rail body’s customer relationship system. The Department for Education is operating a lesson assistant AI for teachers, Aila, using Open AI’s GPT-4o model. Created inside Whitehall, rather than using a contractor, it allows teachers to generate lesson plans. The tool is intentionally designed not to generate lessons at the touch of a button. But risks identified and being mitigated include harmful or inappropriate lesson material produced, bias or misinformation and “prompt injection” – a way of malicious actors tricking the AI into carrying out their intentions. The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, which advises the family courts about the welfare of children, uses a natural language processing bot to power a website chat service handling about 2,500 queries a month. One of the acknowledged risks is that it may be handling reports of concerns about children, while others are “hallucinations” and “inaccurate outputs”. It has a two-thirds success rate. It is supported by companies including Genesys and Kerv, again using Amazon Web Services. • This article was amended on 17 December 2024 to include reference to Textio in the subheading and second paragraph, and to make clearer that the tool’s data is hosted on Amazon Web Services. Amazon says AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS cloud, while AWS customers have ownership and control over their data."

          "bodyText": "On 2 January 2024 the body of 68-year-old Janice Walker was found in her home at the corner of King and Sandy streets in Urangan, Queensland. It’s suspected Janice was killed by her partner, who also ended his own life. Janice was the first woman to be allegedly killed this year of a total of 98 so far, according to Australian Femicide Watch, which was founded by the journalist and researcher Sherele Moody. As 2024 comes to a close and we wind our way through December, a time of year when domestic and family violence rates traditionally escalate, we will no doubt add to these numbers. It’s no understatement to say that 2024 has been a horror year in terms of femicide. I have deliberately chosen to start this reflection on the year that was with Walker’s name because I think it is important that we centre the women and children who have paid the highest price for our collective failure to end this scourge. Elisabeth Armitage, the Northern Territory coroner who last month handed down the findings from her year-long coronial inquest into the deaths of four Aboriginal women, made a similar point. As I read Armitage’s report, what struck me was her insistence that we “bear witness” to each and every woman’s death. Her report found that 87 women have been killed by their domestic partners since 2000 in the Northern Territory and at least 82 of those women were Aboriginal. Acknowledging that these passages of her report contained “graphic details” that would probably “cause distress”, Armitage wrote that she “wanted to publicly acknowledge as many of these women as I can, and in doing so, to highlight the horrifying reality of domestic violence killing in the Northern Territory”. What followed was 16 pages devoted to the harrowing circumstances of each woman’s death. It is relentless, heartbreaking and, as the coroner emphasised, preventable “if we do not look away, and act”. To Armitage’s point about not looking away and acting, this year has also seen Australia pause to mark the 50th anniversary of several landmark moments in its now five decades-long struggle to eradicate men’s violence against women. This included the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Elsie, Australia’s first domestic violence refuge, in March, and the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Sydney rape crisis centre in October, Australia’s first. In between these two milestone anniversaries, as it was revealed that the murder rate had escalated (indeed, in April the Australian Institute of Criminology released the latest findings from the national homicide monitoring program which found that the intimate partner homicide rate had increased by 28% in a single year), politicians, experts, frontline workers and survivor advocates gathered for “crisis talks”, dedicated national cabinet meetings, a “rapid review” of prevention efforts, and most notably took to the streets alongside tens of thousands of everyday Australians for another historic “Women’s March”. As I wrote at the start of this year, inevitably, big anniversaries prompt deep reflection: how far have we come, and how far do we have yet to go? Women are still dying. Why, five decades on, are we still here? I wish – after a year in which I’ve observed, up close, many of those key activities as a journalist with a specific focus on domestic and family violence – I had an answer. What I do have is this personal reflection from the domestic, family and sexual violence commissioner Micaela Cronin’s crisis talks, held in Canberra in May. I had the great privilege of attending those talks as one of only two journalists permitted to observe the proceedings from inside the room. As I drove past Parliament House early in the morning en route to the crisis talks, I was reminded of another time nine years ago when I came to Canberra at a time when there was also heightened national interest in domestic and family violence. I was there to support the then Australian of the Year, Rosie Batty, as she delivered her first speech to the National Press Club. That morning I met the legendary advocate Ann O’Neill for the first time. Ann had flown out from Western Australia to support Rosie – they share such a tragic bond, both losing children to men’s violence. As we drove onwards in a taxi to the National Press Club, Ann asked the driver to pull over so we could get a photo as the sun rose with Parliament House behind us. “Come on,” Ann said, “you have to capture these moments”. I thought about this as I travelled to the crisis talks and I wondered if we were in the midst of another “moment”. And I wondered if this would be “the” moment – the tipping point that translates into real change. I was acutely aware that we had been here before. And then I arrived at the crisis talks and saw other survivor advocates and, quite frankly, I got a bit teary. So, as we approach the end of this horror year, a year that has been draining and soul-destroying for so many, I just want to pause and also urge us to “bear witness” to the dogged determination of frontline workers, survivor advocates, academics and so many others. They keep showing up – again and again. In all the big moments and all the little moments in between. Will 2024 go down in the history books as the year we turned a corner? Only if, to once again use the words of Armitage, we don’t look away, and act. And only if we follow the lead of the many who have always lived by those words.

          "bodyText": "Who were crosswording’s stars of 2024? Neither of the names Starmer nor Badenoch much captured the imagination of setters this year, beyond Dynamo noticing that the prime minister’s surname provides a handy anagram of ARMREST. (Picaroon, in our beginner-friendly quiptic, also noticed that SUPERMARKET is an anagram of STARMER PUKE.) And 2024 largely gave us a rest from the ubiquity of Trump clues of the late 2010s, though he remains an individual whose surname Oxford defines as “break wind audibly” – even without its first letter we have “(humorous) a person’s buttocks” – so the president presumptive seems likely to return to our grids after reinauguration. The “most 2024” clue in the Guardian was probably this one, written by Paul for an election special. It’s a snapshot of both the start of the campaign, when a damp prime minister risked being drowned out by a song associated with Labour and its end, when gambling scandals lingered for days. 5d What things can only get for Rishi’s campaign official? (6) [ double definition ] The answer: BETTER. “Rishi” has gone back to its previous duty as a word meaning “wise man” or “sage” – and apart from elections and the like, the news that story setters returned to time and again was the Post Office Horizon scandal. Aspects of the shameful tale popped up in clues from Django (twice), Kcit and an unnamed setter in the Telegraph, Phi in the Independent, Julius, Leonidas, Neo and others in the Financial Times – and made up most of entire puzzles by Tees and Vlad. Here’s Vlad, whose 8 and 29 gave HORIZON and INQUIRY … 1,14,7ac If then high debt, thief, now it’s different (as often heard at 8,29) (4,3,7,2,9) [ wordplay: anagram (‘different’) of IFTHENHIGHDEBTTHIEFNOWITS ] [ definition: effectively a catchphrase of the inquiry ] … and a sceptical take on the bromide WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. “Post Office” in a clue has for so long been a way of nudging the solver to think of a PO in an answer: I hope that soon he or she will be able to do that again without thinking about malpractice. And that the scandal gets a face. People, then, and first our runner-up, ubiquitous in crosswords as in life. In March, for example, the Everyman series (where I’m the incumbent setter) attempted an evocative description … 14a Powerful scent: a billionaire’s characteristic?

Besides his newsworthy oligarchical tendencies, Elon Musk appeals to setters not just because of the many definitions of his surname but also because ELON has letters in useful places: will the scandal that brings his White House tsardom to an end, for example, be known as Elongate? Crosswords’ Person of 2024, though, is in no doubt. Here are just a few examples (answers at the bottom), from Tramp … 8d Taylor Swift cut touring – hard opening in UK?

          "headline": "Royal Mail takeover by Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský approved",
          "bodyText": "The sale of Royal Mail’s parent company to the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has been approved by the UK government after a review under national security laws. The £3.6bn takeover of International Distribution Services (IDS) – the owner of the 508-year-old Royal Mail – by Křetínský’s EP Group was confirmed on Monday morning. It will be the first time Royal Mail has been controlled by an overseas owner in its history, which can be traced as far back as 1516 under Henry VIII. The government will retain a “golden share” in IDS, which means any changes to Royal Mail’s ownership, tax residency or headquarters will need its assent. The Royal Mail brand will also be protected for as long as EP owns the company. The board of IDS agreed to the takeover in May, after rejecting initial approaches at a lower price. EP Group agreed to a series of undertakings to persuade the government to let the deal through. They include retaining the universal service obligation for a first-class postal service to anywhere in the country for a fixed price six days a week while Křetínský is in control – a stronger commitment than the previous five-year pledge. The government has also blocked Royal Mail from making dividend or similar payments to its owners unless the company meets financial targets and has improved its postal delivery performance. Dividends and asset sales will also be blocked if they put the universal service at risk. IDS has suggested second-class post could be reduced to every other weekday. Keith Williams, the non-executive chair of IDS, said the deal’s approval was an “important milestone”, but called for “urgent reform of the universal service and the continued transformation of this great British business”. Dame Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of the regulator Ofcom, told BBC Breakfast on Monday that the company had “a lot of changes that they need to make” because of the decline in letter volumes and said the watchdog would make proposals for the future of the postal service next year. Other undertakings include keeping the Royal Mail headquarters and tax residency in the UK for five years, and maintaining base salaries and benefits for staff for at least two years. Křetínský said: “EP Group is a long-term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator.” The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said talks with EP and Křetínský had been “constructive”. “I look forward to working with them to fix the foundations and ensure Royal Mail continues to deliver for the communities and businesses who rely on it most,” he said. The takeover was called in for a review in August on the grounds of national security because Royal Mail’s letter delivery still plays a crucial – albeit diminishing – role in the country’s communications infrastructure. The UK owns golden shares in companies that are regarded as crucial to its security, including the weapons manufacturers BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. Approval of the deal, which values IDS at £5.3bn including debt, will be seen as a triumph for a businessperson who – despite his reputation as the low-profile “Czech Sphinx” – has shown a clear interest in snapping up British assets. Alongside EP’s main business running coal, gas and power generation operations, Křetínský owns 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain. The deal, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025, will probably prompt further scrutiny of Křetínský’s business dealings, particularly in Russia. EP Group holds a stake in a Slovakian gas pipeline that continues to pump Russian gas to Europe. The Guardian has reported that Křetínský held talks with Alexey Miller, the head of Russia’s state-owned gas company, Gazprom, and a close ally of Vladimir Putin. EP Group is also part-owned by Patrik Tkáč. In June, the Guardian revealed that Tkáč’s J&amp;T Banka is embroiled in a court case over a $6m (£4.7m) loan it provided to the former premier of the Turks and Caicos Islands Michael Misick, who is facing a corruption prosecution. J&amp;T denied any wrongdoing to the Guardian at the time. EP Group said on Monday it had reached a deal with the Communication Workers Union (CWU) and Unite over the terms for workers and managers at Royal Mail. Dave Ward, the CWU general secretary, said the union wanted public ownership but that it had to be realistic and work with Křetínský. In a sign of the deep discord between workers and Royal Mail management, Ward said the Czech offered a better prospect than the Royal Mail board, which he accused of “giving up”. “The way forward is to get investment in the business, diversify revenue,” he said, adding that the government “cannot sit on the side going forward” because of its involvement in the negotiations."

          "bodyText": "“I need to take a picture of this for my wife. She absolutely adores Kenneth Williams.” We’re in the recently revamped performance gallery of the V&amp;A, a dazzle of theatrical memorabilia. “This” is Kenneth Williams’s costume from Carry on Cleopatra, worn while protesting “Infamy! Infamy! They’ve all got it in for me!” And wielding the cameraphone is British novelist Edward Carey, visiting from his home in Texas to launch his eighth novel, Edith Holler. It’s an irresistible, darkly gothic story set in a theatre and full of the author’s trademark illustrations – so the gallery makes a fittingly immersive interview location. We dart between costumes, playbills and set models. For Carey’s heroine, a 12-year-old girl in 1901 Norwich, the Holler theatre is all she knows: she believes that to step outside the building will bring disaster. “She has been fed on fancy, on nothing,” Carey says. “But to her, all these fanciful ideas are real.” Carey’s stories skew unpredictable: a waxwork artist’s progress in Little (2018), about Marie Tussaud, or Pinocchio’s shark-engulfed maker Geppetto in The Swallowed Man (2020). But a theatre setting was long-brewing. It’s the paradoxical reality of theatre that gets him: “There’s something about sitting in the darkness, like the darkness of the tomb. You’re stuck there with a story until it reaches its end.” Edith herself crisply describes the trajectory of tragedy as “four acts of hurtling disaster, culminating in calamity”. The novel most satisfyingly follows the pattern. It was lockdown that returned Carey’s imagination to his home city of Norwich. “There’s something about being far away from home that frees you up to write about it,” he reflects. “I was stuck in Austin for the pandemic, and I missed Norwich. I fell in love with the city again from a distance. And I thought: now I can write about it.” In the course of his research for the novel, he devoured material about the city’s myths, and especially its undercrofts – vaulted rooms beneath medieval houses, of which Norwich has more than any other British city. “Much of the city was destroyed by fire in 1508, but the old city is still underground. It hasn’t left us.” As the theatre becomes inhospitable to Edith, she retreats underground, but isn’t alone in the undercrofts. She is haunted by another architectural quirk – the proximity of Norwich’s theatre, its palace of dreams, and the asylum, where nightmares cluster. “Right opposite the theatre is the Bethlem hospital,” Carey says. “They were so close to each other, I was shivering with it.” As well as Norwich, Carey was preoccupied with toy theatres – a world of paint and cardboard where Edith exerts rare agency. The novel includes character and set designs, proscenium arches and wings, everything needed for your own tabletop retelling (for those who would rather not shred the book, Carey’s website offers printable pdfs). The grey-toned figures carry a melancholy sense of their own fragility: as Edith remarks: “To die in cardboard is still to die”. The young Carey wasn’t deep into toy theatres, but did grow up with a keen apprehension of the uncanny and the way the past can infiltrate the present. His childhood home, outside Norwich, was once owned by Anne of Cleves. Built on the foundations of a Saxon hall, it was later a first world war convalescent hospital. “History was everywhere,” Carey says. “The whole building moved and was always in conversation with itself.” In ways that filter into Edith Holler, it was riddled with deathwatch beetles (“We could hear them clicking”), and occasional phantom footsteps. He saw his first pantomime at Norwich Theatre Royal, glorified as the novel’s Holler theatre. “I must have been four or five – I sat on the edge of my seat, gobsmacked.” V&amp;A exhibits prompt memories of youthful theatregoing in a far-off era of affordable West End tickets. “I saw everything”: Judi Dench’s Cleopatra, Alec Guinness, John Gielgud’s final production. “Gielgud was very old – he lost his line several times, but covered it beautifully.” Carey himself studied drama at Hull, where he gave his Hamlet. “Someone likened my performance to Mickey Rooney,” he giggles happily. Now 54, Carey has spent enough time in theatres for their atmosphere to seep beneath his skin. A stint as stage door keeper at London’s Comedy theatre (now the Harold Pinter) confronted him with Pinter himself, as both actor and author. “Pinter was extraordinary,” Carey recalls. “Very generous, but utterly terrifying. He took me out to dinner one night, and to his house. [Pinter’s wife] Antonia Fraser was writing a ghost story, and wanted a tour of the theatre when everybody else had gone, so we did that one night and frightened each other.” Beyond encounters with the great and good, guarding the stage door was “the best thing in the world. I would get up in the morning, bike into town and unlock the theatre. It was just mine. I would lock up last thing at night, with the sounds of pubs and everybody screaming outside.” After “a series of crappy jobs after leaving university” (a stint at Madame Tussauds bore fruit in Little), “as a stage door keeper there was nothing to do once you unlocked. I just sat there and wrote.” He longed to be a playwright, although “the sort of plays I wanted to put on would have big casts and large puppets”. British theatre budgets couldn’t stretch to his ambitions, though he did manage a large-scale show based on Pinocchio in Craiova, Romania. “I actually lived in the theatre, a huge, Ceausescu-era monster. The actors were dirt poor, and many were living in their dressing rooms. One day I went up into the lighting grid, and there was a sleeping bag up there.” Something of this inflects Holler’s theatre, its staff crammed into every tiny chamber. Puppets remain a passion – Carey fizzes with excitement when he sees them up ahead at the V&amp;A. He worked with puppets in the theatre company Faulty Optic. “These objects have life,” he reflects. “More lifelike than human beings, with more grace.” Puppets make a decisive appearance in Edith Holler – there’s not a scrap of theatrical craft that Carey doesn’t cherish. One spine-tingling sequence conducts us through the theatre, backstage and front of house, above and below stage, through all the twisty passages and hidden crannies. Brilliantly, it’s written as a chase scene – Edith is evading her new stepmother, the disarmingly unscrupulous Margaret Unthank – so the building radiates peril. Edith’s story began in images rather than words. “The very first illustration I did was of Edith, as a cutout figure in a grey smock.” Does illustration often kickstart his writing? “I always work with them in tandem. I can’t see my characters properly until I draw them.” Occasionally, they leave the page, like the 4ft doll Carey made when imagining Marie Tussaud. “You can move her arms and legs, and my wife had a haircut so that the doll has hair. She sits at home, and when our kids were very small they would sit on her lap.” Carey’s narrators tend to the solitary, not always through choice. Disregarded, they emerge with almost plaintive force, insisting on our attention. Carey made the shift from stage to page when he came across The Tin Drum by Günter Grass. “The voice was so strange, wild and exciting. So far, all my books have been written in the first person – it feels like a voice coming on stage, declaring, ‘Here I am’.” The settings of Carey’s works are wonderfully various. Does he see a connecting thread? “Many of my characters are artists, in one form or another,” he considers. “And there are lots of fake humans!” It took 15 years to find a voice for Marie Tussaud, fake-maker extraordinaire. Returning to the manuscript after writing his Iremonger trilogy, he took heart from Tussaud’s unreliable autobiography. “It’s full of lies!” he says. “I began to relax: she lied so I could too; she was her own fictional creation.” Bouncing between exhibits, eyes shining, Carey absorbs all he misses in Texas. “Austin is not a theatre city, it’s a music city.” He followed his wife, American author Elizabeth McCracken, to the university that employs them both, 14 years ago (“You can tell by my Texas twang”). He relishes teaching, but speaking just weeks before the presidential election, America’s turbulent recent past weighs more heavily. “It can be devastating, particularly under Trump. If this election goes the wrong way, I don’t know what will happen. Back to theatre – how can you have a pantomime villain, and still want to vote for him?” • Edith Holler by Edward Carey is published by Gallic (£16.99).

          "bodyText": "Ed Miliband’s bacon sandwich Was a photograph of Ed Miliband biting into a bacon sandwich to blame for Labour losing the 2015 general election? Perhaps not, but it did prompt a torrent of mocking coverage, memes and a cultural conversation that took in everything from class to antisemitism. And Miliband can’t seem to stay away from food controversy, telling Sky News “I wish I could have a cross-party consensus here with Kemi Badenoch. But I can’t. I think I need to persuade her of the delights of a bacon sandwich.” The ‘Dom Raab special’ In 2018, the diary secretary for the then-housing minister was recorded saying he was “difficult”, “dismissive of women” and, crucially, ordered “the chicken Caesar and bacon baguette” from Pret every single day. Raab denied it all, adding that he was “tempted by the spicy Italian baguette from Subway”. Rishi Sunak’s last meal in politics The day before this year’s UK general election, Sunak was asked what his final meal in No 10 would be if he lost. He described himself as a “big sandwich person” having said “club sandwich, chips and a Coke would be one of my favourite meals”. The electorate was unimpressed – but presumably he had a great dinner. This wasn’t even the first time Sunak prompted a culinary storm: in 2022, he talked of enjoying McDonald’s breakfast wraps – an item removed from the menu nearly two-and-a-half years before. The Trump sandwich In 2015, the owner of Washington DC’s American City Diner created a Trump sandwich that made their political loyalties clear: “He’s got a really big mouth and a lot of the stuff that comes out of it is bologna, so I figured that a sandwich filled with a pound of bologna would be the only one big enough to fit his big mouth.” The prawn sandwich brigade As Nick Hornby popularised football for the middle classes, Manchester United’s Roy Keane took aim at the club’s fanbase. “Away from home our fans are fantastic, I’d call them the hardcore fans,” he said in 2000. “But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don’t realise what’s going on out on the pitch.” And thus the phrase “prawn sandwich brigade” was coined for those who prefer half-time hospitality to the action on the pitch. Is a hot dog a sandwich? In the US, the debate over whether a hot dog counts as a sandwich has taken on a life of its own, with actors, politicians and celebrities weighing in. “I’ve never considered a hot dog a sandwich because a hot dog is a hot dog,” Matt Damon told a Reddit AMA. “I mean technically it comes between two pieces of bread or one fold it into two, so I guess you can classify it as a sandwich. Then what would you call it, a hot dog sandwich? That’s like a hat on a hat so let’s just keep it as a hot dog.” Meryl Streep tried to have it both ways. “Is a hot dog a sandwich? Well with a bun, yes. Without a bun, no. It’s a canapé.” In 2020, US website The Verge said the debate had gone on long enough – but to little avail."

          "headline": "New Jersey drone cluster sightings prompt call for ‘state of emergency’",
          "bodyText": "The mysterious reported sightings of drone clusters in the night skies over New Jersey and other parts of the US north-east have prompted frustrated outbursts from Congress members, triggering calls for a limited state of emergency to be declared over the region. Jon Bramnick, a Republican state senator in New Jersey, has demanded a ban on all drones until the mystery is solved. ABC’s Action News reported that he called for a “limited state of emergency … until the public receives an explanation regarding these multiple sightings”. Concern about unexplained drone sightings began in mid-November as isolated postings by local residents on social media. The issue has steadily risen up the political food chain, bursting this week on to the stage of state and federal authorities. On Wednesday, the governor of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, held a briefing call with the US homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, as well as representatives in Congress and state police to discuss the drone reports. He emphasized there was “no known threat to the public at this time”. Also on Wednesday, the House subcommittee on counter-terrorism, law enforcement and intelligence held a hearing on the subject. Robert Wheeler, an FBI official in charge of investigating the matter, confirmed to the hearing that the agency still had no explanation for the sightings. When asked whether the public was at risk, Wheeler replied: “Are we concerned there are nefarious intentions that could cause either an actual security or public safety incident? There’s nothing that is known that would lead me to say that, but we just don’t know. And that’s the concerning part of it.” He told Congress members that more than 3,000 sightings had been phoned in to a tip line set up by the FBI last week, but so far there had been no breakthrough. The admission that the country’s pre-eminent law enforcement agency remains essentially clueless about the mystery underlines the confusion that continues to swirl. It is not known whether a group or individual might be behind the phenomenon, or whether any credible issue even exists – there has been speculation that the flurry of activity might merely amount to confusion over sightings of regular planes or be the product of social media distortions. Sightings have been made in eight New Jersey counties. Mayors in 21 towns across the north and center of the state have written a joint letter to Murphy calling for statewide action. Concerns have focused on drones spotted near the Bedminster golf course of president-elect Donald Trump, as well as sensitive infrastructure including electric transmission sites, rail stations and police departments. Recently sightings have spread to parts of New York City and over the suburbs of Philadelphia. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican Congress member representing Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, told the House hearing that drones had been reported over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, close to US military bases. “They are flying over sensitive infrastructure, and the fact that we don’t know what they are, or who’s behind them, or what they’re doing is very concerning to me, particularly in a post-Chinese spy-ballon world,” she said, according to a report in the local Morristown Daily Record. On Wednesday, the Pentagon responded and addressed the baseless claims from one Republican New Jersey congressman that the drones were from an “Iranian mothership” lying off the coast of the state. US military bosses do not believe the drones or other craft are coming from “a foreign entity or adversary”, the deputy Pentagon press secretary, Sabrina Singh, told reporters. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there’s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States,” she added. The United States Northern Command also issued a statement. “USNORTHCOM conducted a deliberate analysis of the events, in consultation with other military organizations and interagency partners … at this time we have not been requested to assist with these events,” it said."

          "headline": "Harrods adding £1 ‘cover charge’ to every diner on top of 12.5% service fee",
          "bodyText": "Harrods has introduced a £1 a diner “cover charge” in all its restaurants and cafes in London which staff say aims to bump up profits by up to £1m after a government crackdown on companies taking a cut of tips. The upmarket department store, whose owners took a £180m dividend last year, charges diners a 12.5% service charge – all of which has gone to workers in the kitchens and restaurants since 2022 – and a further £1 cover charge that the business keeps. The charges mean that a cappuccino could cost £8.31, including a £1 cover charge and 81p service charge. The charge has emerged as more than 100 Harrods workers prepare to strike on 21, 22 and 26 December over pay and conditions, including concerns about the distribution of customer fees in the restaurants. Workers say they fear the imposition of the cover charge – which was first trialled a year ago and is now in place at all Harrods’ London restaurants – will prompt diners to cancel paying the optional service charge, hitting their income. They want Harrods to either cancel the cover charge or share it among workers and to be more transparent with staff about how the service charge is distributed. Workers say Harrods is making more than £2,500 a day from the cover charge and is considering raising it to £2 a diner. Alice Howick, a member of Harrods’ waiting staff, said: “Given that there’s no law on cover charge at the moment, we feel like it’s a loophole that the company is using to make more money as a result of inflation. They’ve also said that they’ve introduced the cover charge to protect the prices on the menu so that they don’t have to keep increasing it. “It’s not distributed to the staff, and we feel like we’ve been hit by it, because customers will now ask to remove the service charge as well as the cover charge, or maybe sometimes instead of removing the cover charge. So, we’re worried in the long term that it’s going to affect the amount of service charge that we get.” Harrods said: “Like many restaurants in the UK where there is a high level of service, it is standard practice to include a cover charge. We want to keep our prices as competitive as possible, while maintaining the best levels of service to our customers. “The cover charge supports providing the premium environments our restaurants are known for during peak periods of business. Harrods has paid 100% of all service charge to colleagues since January 2022, over two years before legislation was introduced which required all restaurants to do so.” It is understood that, as yet, the imposition of the cover charge has not affected service charge payments. Under new legislation implemented in October this year, companies must share all tips and service charges to those working in restaurants and hotels, and in other businesses such as hairdressers and minicabs. The rules say the tips and service charges must be distributed in a “fair and transparent” way between workers at a particular establishment. The law was introduced after it emerged that many businesses were using card-based fees to underpin profits rather than reward wait staff and chefs. Instead of passing on the service charge, chains including the luxury Ivy Collection chose to bump up workers’ hourly pay rate by a set amount, with senior staff taking a greater share no matter how much is collected during their working hours. It is understood that some big chains continue to hand a much larger chunk of the service charge to senior staff than others. • Have you been hit by an unexpected charge on a restaurant bill?

          "bodyText": "Like many music fans with a conscience, I use Spotify begrudgingly. I need to listen to a vast amount of music for work; I want to listen to a vast amount of music for fun, and I would have to forgo groceries if I attempted to buy it all. Still, I resent its financial distribution model to artists: my £11.99 a month isn’t divided between the musicians I actually listen to, but proportionally related to their popularity across the platform, meaning Ed Sheeran is getting significantly more of my money than Mabe Fratti. Spotify hosts music almost certainly made by fake artists or AI; playlists are prioritised over albums; there was the whole Joe Rogan thing that made Joni Mitchell and Neil Young quit the platform for a year. Perhaps counterintuitively, I have less ire for Spotify Wrapped, the packaging of a user’s year in listening that Spotify revamps annually with silly little made-up genre names (pink Pilates princess strut pop?) and flattering stats about being in the top 0.5% of any given act’s listeners. It unarguably puts a tidy bow on Spotify’s poor artist remuneration – as well as big-tech creep – and is nothing more than a giant marketing push that its users carry out for free. But the main gripe against it this year is the company’s frank use of AI – as if previous years’ instalments were as lovingly curated as a handmade mix CD. In a comment piece for the New Yorker titled “The hollow allure of Spotify Wrapped”, critic Brady Brickner-Wood writes: “If we can’t trust the apps to tell us a meaningful story about our art consumption, how will anyone, including ourselves, ever discover the idiosyncratic composition of our inner lives?” Is anyone who deeply cares about music entrusting the idiosyncratic composition of their inner lives to these platforms? It seems like an astonishing fool’s errand that anyone would ever want something so personal and immeasurable from an app, in this case a tech company that has hijacked music consumption for capital and that only cares about your taste insofar as it can harvest your consumer profile for profit. But I understand the desire for a useful at-a-glance look at your music taste and have the perfect, stalwart solution to this predicament: last.fm, a data-focused archive of your listening habits. I have been using last.fm to “scrobble” my music history since 22 April 2007, recording music I play across Apple’s Music app and Spotify (though sadly I reset it in late 2011, apparently embarrassed by my youthful taste). You can use its calendar setting to look at your artist/track/album charts from the last week/month/six months/year/all time, or any window you specify, if you’re keen to remember who you were in, say, July 2015 (a huge Julia Holter fan, apparently). It was founded in 2002 and now runs a reduced service compared to its early days, although not an enshittified one: it doesn’t package my listening back to me in stimulating graphics like Spotify does, but provides a genuinely useful, straightforward list of my life in music – when Guardian writers come to vote for our albums of the year, it’s the first place I look to discern the sound of my 2024. Moreover, as I come up on half a lifetime spent on the site, it genuinely does tell me stories about who I was and am. As a teenager going off to uni to study French and German, I used its “recommended radio” function – my first bite of the algorithm – to discover music from those countries, and found an all-time favourite in the late French punk Lizzy Mercier Descloux. I joined the University of Bristol last.fm group before I got there and befriended someone who had great music taste and seemed cool, only to realise we had been put in the same massive house and would spend the next two years together squeezing the city’s gig scene dry. I met one of their last.fm friends when I went to Chicago a few years later; just last week we updated each other’s addresses for our annual Christmas card exchange. It’s also played a reasonable role in my love life. In my late teens, I flirted heavily with my then-crush on its messaging function while cramming all the new-to-me bands we were about to see at my first ATP festival. When an actual dating service based its matches on the last.fm API, it proved so accurate that I’d already been out with two of my top five, one of them twice. This summer, I started seeing someone who is also an inveterate last.fm user. The social side of the site has long lapsed, but we added each other as friends for the novelty of it. Even though I already felt we were well matched, last.fm designating our comparability as “SUPER” charmed me, as does seeing my favourite music infiltrate his stats. My account contains so much information about me that I feel like it should set off a wellbeing alarm somewhere when I’ve been listening to the National for several days straight (certainly one went off elsewhere when I accidentally leaked the track list for their surprise last album after I forgot to turn off scrobbling). Although more tellingly, at least to me, I can see I hardly played them at all in summer 2022, when my life fell apart at my own hands and I didn’t want to create negative associations with any beloved music, much as I would have found comfort in it. Instead, Haim’s Women in Music Part III became my lonely driving companion, Sam Gendel’s parched sax the soundtrack to my walks. Last.fm can be a great motivator: a friend told me that as he’s got older, the statistics encourage him to listen as he did when he was younger because he can look back and see when his efforts at discovery are waning. It reveals to me when a musician is going from someone I’ve dabbled in to a fully fledged fave. I only discovered Clarissa Connelly a couple of months ago, but the Scottish/Danish composer has shot into my top five most-played artists of the year. The data is one thing; remembering listening to her while co-working in my flat with my aforementioned new last.fm friend is the bigger picture of what her music has come to mean to me. Similarly, Death Cab for Cutie made a return to my top three for the first time since my teens – when I posted on a music forum using one of their song titles as my handle – ahead of us seeing them in London in the summer. But whether Spotify Wrapped or last.fm, the numbers can only ever be a prompt to remember who you really were during Brat summer, or Driver’s License January, or, you know, nihilist Gilla Band autumn 2022. We can’t trust streaming platforms to tell us a meaningful story about our art consumption and should never fall for the suggestion that they could. (For a good story on what streaming platforms have done to our consumption, meanwhile, read critic and reporter Liz Pelly’s new book Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist.) Worst of all, some listeners seem defeated by the idea that “the algorithm” (a concept that critic Max Read debunks well) is making them boring. Break out of it! Set yourself listening seasons and projects; form a music group chat with friends and swap recommendations. Taste isn’t just what the machine feeds you, or how many times you listened to an artist, or what upper percentile of their fans you exist in, but the experiences it is woven into, the relationships it reflects, the colour it adds to your life. In my opinion, last.fm still rules – but when it comes to taste, the last word should be yours."

          "bodyText": "I recently had the opportunity to see a demo of Sora, OpenAI’s video generation tool which was released in the US on Monday, and it was so impressive it made me worried for the future. The new technology works like an AI text or image generator: write a prompt, and it produces a short video clip. In the pre-launch demo I was shown, an OpenAI representative asked the tool to create footage of a tree frog in the Amazon, in the style of a nature documentary. The result was uncannily realistic, with aerial camera shots swooping down on to the rainforest, before settling on a closeup of the frog. The animal looked as vivid and real as any nature documentary subject. Yet despite the technological feat, as I watched the tree frog I felt less amazed than sad. It certainly looked the part, but we all knew that what we were seeing wasn’t real. The tree frog, the branch it clung to, the rainforest it lived in: none of these things existed, and they never had. The scene, although visually impressive, was hollow. Video is AI’s new frontier, with OpenAI finally rolling out Sora in the US after first teasing it in February, and Meta announcing its own text-to-video tool, Movie Gen, in October. Google made its Veo video generator available to some customers this month. Are we ready for a world in which it is impossible to discern which of the moving images we see are real? In the past couple of years, we’ve witnessed the proliferation of generative AI text and image generators, but video feels even more high-stakes. Historically, moving pictures have been more difficult to falsify than still ones, but generative AI is about to change all that. There are many potential abuses of such technology. Scammers are already using AI to impersonate people’s friends or family members’ voices, in order to trick them out of money. Disinformation pedlars use deepfakes to support their political agendas. Extortionists and abusers make fake sexual images or videos of their victims. We are living in a world where some security researchers now suggest that families adopt a secret codeword, so they can prove they really are who they say they are if they have to call for help. The creators of these tools appear to be aware of the risks. Before its public release, OpenAI opened up access only to select creative partners and testers. Meta is doing the same. The tools incorporate various safeguards, such as restrictions on the prompts people can use: preventing videos from featuring public figures, violence or sexual content, for instance. They also contain watermarks by default, to flag that a video has been created using AI. While the more extreme possibilities for abuse are alarming, I find the prospect of low-stakes video fakery almost as disconcerting. If you see a video of a politician doing something so scandalous that it is hard to believe, you may respond with scepticism anyway. But an Instagram creator’s skit? A cute animal video on Facebook? A TV ad for Coca-Cola? There’s something boringly dystopian about the thought of having to second-guess even the most mundane content, as the imagery we’re surrounded with becomes ever-more detached from reality. As I watched the AI-generated tree frog, I mainly wondered what the point of it was. I can certainly see AI’s utility in CGI for creative film-making, but a fake nature documentary seemed a strange choice. We have all marvelled at the amazing visuals in such programmes, but our awe is not just because the pictures are pretty: it is because they are real. They allow us to see a part of our world we otherwise could not, and the difficulty of obtaining the footage is part of the appeal. Some of my favourite nature documentary moments have been behind-the-scenes clips in programmes such as Our Planet, which reveal how long a cameraperson waited silently in a purpose-made hide to capture a rare species, or how they jerry-rigged their equipment to get the perfect shot. Of course, AI video can never reach this bar of genuine novelty. Trained on existing content, it can only produce footage of something that has been seen before. Perhaps how a video has been produced shouldn’t matter so much. A tree frog is a tree frog, and one survey suggests that as long as we don’t know an image is made by AI, we like it just the same. It’s the deception inherent in so much AI media that I find upsetting. Even the blurriest real photograph of 2024 meme hero Moo Deng contains more life than a Movie Gen video of a baby hippo swimming, which, however sleekly rendered, is dead behind the eyes. As AI content gets more convincing, it risks ruining real photos and videos along with it. We can’t trust our eyes any more, and are compelled to become amateur sleuths just to make sure the crochet pattern we’re buying is actually constructable, or the questionable furniture we’re eyeing really exists in physical form. I was recently scrolling through Instagram and shared a cute video of a bunny eating lettuce with my husband. It was a completely benign clip – but perhaps a little too adorable. Was it AI, he asked? I couldn’t tell. Even having to ask the question diminished the moment, and the cuteness of the video. In a world where anything can be fake, everything might be.

          "bodyText": "Moderate Liberals will rally behind Gisele Kapterian in an attempt to hold the seat of Bradfield against a teal independent challenge after the resignation of Paul Fletcher. On Tuesday the manager of opposition business announced he will quit federal parliament at the 2025 election, likely to spark a contested preselection for the Liberal to run against Nicolette Boele, an independent. Fletcher’s departure is another concerning sign for the moderate faction after the Liberal Senate leader and shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, announced his retirement from politics in November. Guardian Australia understands the faction will rally behind Kapterian, a Salesforce executive and former staffer who had been preselected to run for the Liberals in North Sydney before the electoral commission abolished the seat. Other potential Liberal candidates include Warren Mundine, who unsuccessfully contested Gilmore at the 2019 election and lives in the electorate, and Paul Nettelbeck, a conservative who previously worked for the Menzies Research Institute and contested Fletcher’s preselection. At the 2022 election Fletcher held blue-ribbon Bradfield on Sydney’s north shore with a 4.23% margin, after a surprisingly strong showing from Boele, who had a primary vote of 20.89%. Boele has maintained a campaign presence since the 2022 election, including winning support from MP Kylea Tink who vowed not to run against her, despite large swathes of Tink’s North Sydney electorate being absorbed into Bradfield. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Boele’s campaign was contacted for comment. Kevin Bonham, an election analyst and psephologist, said the retirement of a sitting MP was generally damaging for that political party’s chances of retaining the seat, with the incumbent factor worth “a point or two” in polling. He noted that, in previous elections, new independent candidates had generally won seats which did not have a sitting MP contesting the vote. “The teal wins last time were unusual in that they beat incumbents who weren’t particularly controversial, but it used to be when a new independent would win it was when the seat was vacant,” Bonham said. “I would suspect the [Climate 200] movement will probably chuck a lot of money into that seat.” In a statement, Fletcher claimed “the local mood is discernibly different from 2022”. Bonham noted the potential for some number of Labor voters in 2022 to switch to the Coalition in 2025, which would make it harder for independents in previously Liberal seats to win or retain some seats. “It’s always a benefit to have a seat vacant unless the sitting member was a dud, but not a massive benefit,” he said. In a statement Fletcher said that he expected “some outstanding people will put themselves forward to be the next Liberal candidate for Bradfield”, promising the candidate “once chosen through our party processes, will have my full support”. Last week Fletcher angered supporters of community independents by arguing teal campaigns were a “Green left con job”. He cited as evidence that challengers had “appeared in a range of Liberal seats and made no appearance in Labor seats”. “The intention was to get people to think, ‘That nice teal candidate could almost be a Liberal, I’ll vote for her.’” The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, praised Fletcher as “a man of superb character” and a “voice of reason” in the Liberal party. “A man who believes in accountability and transparency, Paul’s recent speech at the Sydney Institute was a tour de force in exposing the true colour of the teals and their track record,” Dutton said in a statement. Fletcher, a former minister for communications, said that after a break he intends to return to the private sector with a focus on “the communications, digital technology, infrastructure and transport sectors where I have worked extensively in both public and private sector roles”."

          "bodyText": "Anyone in the US can now use OpenAI’s artificial intelligence video generator, Sora, which the company announced on Monday would become publicly available. OpenAI first presented Sora in February, but it was only accessible to select artists, film-makers and safety testers. At multiple points on Monday, though, OpenAI’s website did not allow for new sign-ups for Sora, citing heavy traffic. Sora is known as a text-to-video generator, a tool that can create AI video clips based on a user’s written prompts. An example on OpenAI’s website has the prompt of “a wide, serene shot of a family of woolly mammoths in an open desert”. Its video shows a group of three of the extinct creatures slowly walking through sand dunes. “We hope this early version of Sora will enable people everywhere to explore new forms of creativity, tell their stories, and push the boundaries of what’s possible with video storytelling,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. OpenAI is known for its popular chatbot ChatGPT, but it has been branching into other forms of generative AI. It is working on a voice-cloning tool and has integrated an image generation tool, Dall-E, into ChatGPT’s functions. The Microsoft-backed company leads the burgeoning AI market and is now valued at nearly $160bn. Before today’s release of Sora, OpenAI let the tech reviewer Marques Brownlee test the tool. He said the results were “horrifying and inspiring at the same time”. Brownlee said Sora did well with landscapes and stylistic effects but that it struggled to realistically depict basic physics. Some film-makers who were also given a preview said the tool produced strange visual defects. It is understood that OpenAI is still working through compliance requirements with the Online Safety Act in the UK and the Digital Services Act and GDPR in the EU. Two weeks ago, the company suspended any access to the tool when a group of artists created a backdoor that would allow anyone to use it. In a statement posted to the AI community site Hugging Face, they accused OpenAI of “art washing” a product that would steal the livelihood of artists like them. The “Sora PR Puppets”, as they dubbed themselves, said the company was trying to spin a positive narrative for its product by associating with creative people. While generative AI has improved considerably over the past year, it is still prone to hallucinations, or incorrect responses, and plagiarism. AI image generators also often produce unrealistic images, such as people with several arms or misplaced facial features. Critics warn that this type of AI video technology could be misused by bad actors for disinformation, scams and deepfakes. There have already been deepfake videos of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, supposedly calling for a ceasefire and of Kamala Harris supposedly describing herself as “the ultimate diversity hire”. OpenAI said in its blogpost that it would initially limit uploads of specific people and that it will block content with nudity. The company said that it was additionally “blocking particularly damaging forms of abuse, such as child sexual abuse materials and sexual deepfakes”. Sora will be available to users who already subscribe and pay for OpenAI’s tools. People in the US and “most countries internationally” will have access to the tool, but it will not be available in the UK or Europe."

          "bodyText": "It was Ange Postecoglou’s Tottenham in microcosm. A couple of steps forward; more in the opposite direction. Where it left the manager was the biggest question as Chelsea roared back from 2-0 down to win yet again, surging into second place in the Premier League. They have moved above Arsenal and are only four points behind Liverpool, albeit the leaders have a game in hand. It is becoming increasingly difficult to believe the manager, Enzo Maresca, when he argues that Chelsea are not title contenders. They had so much good stuff here. Above all, they had Cole Palmer. The TV cameras made the obligatory cut-aways to the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, with about 15 minutes to go, inviting everybody to wonder what he will do with Postecoglou, who had said two weeks ago that he would be in trouble if his team were still in mid-table at Christmas. They have only two matches to play before then – away at Southampton; home to Liverpool. It is not just that they are 11th. One of the main takeaways was how little belief they showed, how the trudge towards defeat felt inevitable. They did manage a late goal for 4-3 from Son Heung-min but it was all over by then. Assurance is not a problem for Chelsea. Or Palmer. He had already equalised from the penalty spot for 2-2 when he mesmerised Destiny Udogie and three other Spurs defenders on the right before sending over a cross that deflected and found Enzo Fernández, who blasted Chelsea in front. Spurs had had enough of Palmer; they were driven to distraction. It was the only explanation for why Pape Sarr barged into the back of him on the right-hand side of the area. It was another penalty and Palmer finished with a cold-as-ice Panenka; the ultimate snapshot of Chelsea’s supremacy. Put your house on Palmer. He never misses penalties, despite not practicing them. Postecoglou had applauded the South Stand at length before kick-off, which felt significant after what had happened between him and the travelling Spurs fans at Bournemouth last Thursday. He needs them behind him. His team would make the dream start, two up after 11 minutes, and yet it never looked like lasting. There would be boos at the full-time whistle but no fan mutiny. The opening exchanges had been the stuff of nightmares for Chelsea and especially Marc Cucurella, who lost his footing for both of the concessions. First, Brennan Johnson punished him, running away to cross for Dominic Solanke, whose movement was too sharp for Levi Colwill. The second saw Cucurella go over again, Spurs regain possession and Dejan Kulusevski jam a low shot home from the edge of the area. It was the prompt for Cucurella to rush over and change his footwear. Chelsea never panicked. They never lost the feeling that they would have enough to come back. The first-half was end-to-end, so open and it was no surprise when Chelsea pulled one back. Spurs had been boosted by the returns of Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven from injuries; the latter was the surprise. Romero did not last long. He felt something in his thigh in the eighth minute after pulling off a high-risk back-heel inside his own area and he found that he could not continue. On came Radu Dragusin and he was one of the Spurs defenders who could not get out to the excellent Jadon Sancho as the Chelsea winger sliced inside from the left. Sancho’s low shot was a beauty, shaped into the far corner. Van de Ven would also be forced off before the end, although Postecoglou said it was only tightness. There was controversy before the interval and we are not talking about the South Standers who threw screwed-up bits of tifo cardboard at Chelsea’s corner-takers, including Palmer. They were told to pack it in at half-time, which was a bit late. Perhaps Palmer took it personally. Moisés Caicedo was a lucky boy when he followed through hard into Sarr’s lower shin. Anthony Taylor missed the flashpoint and the VAR, Jarred Gillett, deemed there was no serious foul play and therefore no red card. Kulusevski would also get away with an elbow on Romeo Lavia. Chelsea had the chances to equalise before the break, the big one created by Fernández for Palmer; incredibly, he missed his kick from close-range. Pedro Neto extended Fraser Forster after banging low for the near corner. Spurs had their first-half opportunities, too. Son curled just past the far top corner. Sarr headed against the crossbar from a Son corner. Solanke could not finish from a low Son cross. Maresca made a key change for the second-half, Malo Gusto on at right-back, Caicedo into midfield on a full-time basis. Previously, he had been there only in possession. Lavia made way. It was to reconfigure the collective press and how it paid off. Chelsea piled forward. They could sense vulnerability in Spurs. Everybody could. It was one-way traffic after the restart. Sancho drew an excellent save out of Forster. Fernández bent a shot just wide. Spurs lost Johnson to illness and it was clear that the equaliser was coming. Postecoglou’s team were jittery, the stadium a sea of anxiety. When the goal for 2-2 came, it was because of a rush of blood by Yves Bissouma, Palmer’s man-marker. Bissouma had initially lost the ball on the Spurs left and when Sancho, back on the other side, worked it through for Caicedo, Bissouma leapt in to scythe him down. Palmer did the rest. Spurs would flicker, Son and Van de Ven going close. Unfortunately for them, Palmer had plenty left."

          "headline": "Team GB track cyclist Katy Marchant taken to hospital after dramatic crash",
          "bodyText": "The British cyclist Katy Marchant has suffered a broken arm and two dislocated fingers after a dramatic crash at the UCI Track Champions League meeting in London, which led to the remainder of Saturday’s races being suspended. Marchant was involved in a collision with the German rider Alessa-Catriona Pröpster during the first round of the women’s keirin competition. Pröpster and Marchant veered to the right together on the approach to a left-hand turn and both were flipped over the barriers at Lee Valley VeloPark. The race was suspended while both women received medical treatment, along with four spectators. Eurosport’s trackside reporter, Adam Blythe, was able to confirm that although the cyclists had fallen into an area of seating, there were no serious injuries. “The good news is that the GB rider [Marchant] is OK,” Blythe said. “She has got a broken forearm, but seems to be in a stable condition. There were a couple of members from the crowd that were involved and they seem to be OK as well. Everyone’s in a good condition, although Katy Marchant has broken her forearm.” Blythe also reported that Pröpster was not hurt in the incident and that the rest of the event, which was taking place across Friday and Saturday, had been cancelled. According to PA Media, Marchant was carried out of the venue by medics after receiving treatment for about 30 minutes. Cycling’s world governing body, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), released a statement on Sunday with an update on the condition of Marchant and Pröpster. “After receiving prompt medical attention from the track medical team, Katy Marchant was escorted to the hospital by the British Cycling doctor. X-rays revealed a fractured radius and ulna in her right forearm, along with two dislocated fingers. Katy is in good spirits and is receiving excellent care from her medical team. “We are also pleased to report that the other rider involved in the incident, Alessa-Catriona Pröpster, as well as the spectators, exited the venue after receiving medical attention.” A statement from British Cycling posted on X said: “The event medics responded immediately, with one rider transferred to the hospital. WBD Sports, British Cycling, Lee Valley VeloPark and the UCI unanimously decided to suspend all further racing for the evening and want to extend their best wishes for a speedy recovery to both riders and all affected spectators. “We also wish to thank the medical staff for their prompt response and ongoing support. We are working closely with all parties to review the incident before taking appropriate action. No further comments will be made at this time.” Marchant won Olympic gold in Paris in the summer, triumphing in the team sprint alongside Sophie Capewell and Emma Finucane. The Team GB trio went on to win the world title in Ballerup, Denmark in October. The London meeting of the UCI Track Champions League marked the finale of a five-stage event which began in France last month. Earlier on Saturday, British rider Katie Archibald secured victory in the women’s endurance league – but several other events were left uncompleted. Saturday’s crash brought back memories of a similar incident involving Matt Walls, which took place on the same bend of the Stratford velodrome during the 2022 Commonwealth Games. That incident led the venue to install a higher safety fence around the track, which was in use for only the second time this weekend."

          "headline": "Smashed Ebenezer Scrooge gravestone swiftly repaired free of charge",
          "bodyText": "A gravestone for Ebenezer Scrooge in Shrewsbury that was smashed to bits has been repaired for free, in what the vicar has described as a “really heartwarming” Christmas story. The gravestone for Scrooge, a fictional character created by Charles Dickens in his 1843 A Christmas Carol, was used as a prop during filming for a 1984 adaptation of the novella. But one Sunday in November this year, the vicar at St Chad’s church, the Rev Sam Mann, walked past and saw the grave had been shattered in a mystery act of destruction. Now it has been repaired in time for Christmas by a local stonemason. “When we discovered the vandalism, there was such a sense of shock,” Mann, 31, told the Guardian. “It means so much to Shrewsbury as a town. We get people coming specifically to look at that grave.” The town and church received an outpouring of messages and support after reports circulated of the destruction. Dickens’ A Christmas Carol follows Scrooge – a mean-spirited moneylender who mistreats and underpays his clerk, Bob Cratchit – who is visited by four ghosts on Christmas Eve. Showing Scrooge the impact of his actions and the unmourned damnation that awaits him, the ghosts prompt the old man into a dramatic change of heart, as he embraces generosity and compassion. Within about 48 hours, the vicar said, the stone was taken away for repair, after local firm Midland Masonry offered to fix it for free. The speedy timeline was remarkable, Mann said, because gravestone changes or repairs usually need diocese approval. In this case the Diocese of Lichfield granted emergency permission. Local stonemason Ed Jones told BBC Radio Shropshire: “Basically, I spoke to my boss, and he was quite happy for us to do it free of charge.” The repair, Jones added, involved removing the gravestone, digging out the grave, laying a concrete foundation, fixing the stone with stainless steel pins and resin, applying a mortar repair across the top to address cracks, then adding a cement base so it cannot be lifted. “I just feel that it’s something we can do for society and for everyone who comes to see it, because it’s an heirloom of Shrewsbury, isn’t it,” Jones said. “People in the street will ask you, ‘Where’s Ebenezer?’ And you just say, ‘Well, it’s down there on the left, in St Chad’s church.’” The identity and motive of the vandal remains unknown. The gravestone, Mann said, “for us as a town came to represent our attitude towards welcoming visitors”. He added: “Local people were really hurt that this had happened.” He praised the work of the Shrewsbury town council, town clerk Helen Ball, Lichfield diocese, and stonemasons Midland Masonry for the swift job. “The message in the book is all about generosity, isn’t it,’” Mann said. “Actually, in a strange way, this whole episode ties into what Christmas is all about … It’s just really heartwarming that it’s been repaired so quickly and for free.”"

          "headline": "Trump to attend Notre Dame reopening as Macron weathers political storm",
          "bodyText": "The restored Gothic spire of Notre Dame is to provide a dramatic backdrop for Donald Trump’s return to the geopolitical stage this weekend, as the US president-elect prepares to make his first visit to Europe since the election to mingle with world leaders at an official reopening ceremony in Paris on Saturday. The medieval cathedral, which was ravaged by a fire in 2019, has been reconstructed in a painstaking €700m (£580m) effort that took just five years, involving the application of carpentry methods dating to the 13th century and enabled with donations from 150 countries. Festivities will stretch over two days, starting with an address by the beleaguered French president, Emmanuel Macron. Speaking before Saturday’s opening ceremony, Macron said: “The shock of the reopening will - I believe and I want to believe - be as strong as that of the fire, but it will be a shock of hope.” Macron had initially been expected to deliver the speech on the limestone forecourt outside the cathedral followed by a liturgical ceremony inside but late on Friday, Macron’s office and the Diocese of Paris said heavy winds would force the celebrations to be held entirely inside. The archbishop of Paris, Laurent Ulrich, will strike the 850-year-old edifice’s heavy door with his crosier, accompanied by the singing of Psalm 121, to symbolise the cathedral’s reawakening. The service continues with the “awakening of the great organ”, which has not been heard since the fire, a solemn blessing and the singing of the Te Deum. On Sunday, which marks the annual feast of the Immaculate Conception, the archbishop will hold an inaugural mass that Notre Dame’s rector said would be attended by people in need: “the poorest among Parisians”. The new main altar will be consecrated in a special ritual and the relics of five saints, including Saint Catherine Labouré and Saint Charles de Foucauld, will be sealed into the altar. But for Macron, what should be a moment of triumph comes at a time of spiralling national crisis, just days after his prime minister was turfed out in a no-confidence vote and amid fears of a looming budgetary crisis. Compounding Macron’s misery, the European Commission on Friday finalised a long-delayed trade deal between the EU and South America’s Mercosur bloc that France says poses an “unacceptable” existential threat to its own farming industry. Soon after the office of Ursula von der Leyen, the commission’s president, said she was not planning to participate in Saturday’s opening ceremony, where approximately 50 world leaders, including the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, and his wife, Jill are expected. Pope Francis will also not be in attendance, having announced in September to some surprise that he would be making a historic visit to the French island of Corsica instead. Prince William will represent the UK. Trump’s attendance may also prompt a visit to the ceremony from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is keen to enter a dialogue with the US leader over the future of his war-torn country. In the run-up to the US election, Trump promised he would be able to settle the conflict “within 24 hours” of taking office. The Republican was serving his first term as president when a fire erupted at Notre Dame on 15 April 2019. He commented on X, then known as Twitter: “So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out?” Macron had an ambivalent relationship with Trump during the latter’s first term in office, with the French president initially setting out to woo and flatter his American equivalent in spite of their apparent political differences. He invited the US’s 45th president to the Bastille Day parade on the Champs-Élysées, leading Trump to hail him as “one of your great presidents”. But the cordiality began to unravel in 2018, as Trump attacked Macron over plans to build up a European army, in spite of the fact that his own declared intention to withdraw defence commitments in Europe had triggered them. On the campaign trail this year, Trump mocked the French president’s accent as he recounted one of their meetings. After the US elections in November, Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump, saying he was “ready to work together”. Announcing his visit on the Truth Social network on Monday, Trump lauded the French leader in uncharacteristically positive tones: “President Emmanuel Macron has ensured Notre Dame is restored to its highest glory – and even beyond,” he said. “It will be a very special day for all!” The Notre Dame fire was watched on live TV by millions of viewers around the world, who looked on as flames tore through the building, destroying most of the wood and metal roof and the spire. The precise cause of the blaze was never established but investigators believed it to be accidental, started by either a discarded cigarette or a short circuit in the electrical system. In a televised tour of the renovated interior on 29 November, Macron promised: “The shock of the reopening will be as great as that of the fire, but it will be a shock of hope.” He thanked the craftspeople and donors who contributed to the restoration effort for healing a “national wound”. Before the fire, about 12 million people a year visited Notre Dame. Visitor numbers are expected to be higher after the reopening. While entry to the cathedral will remain free, visitors will need to book a dedicated time slot through an online ticketing system."

          "bodyText": "A red warning for wind, signalling “danger to life”, has been issued by the Met Office for parts of Wales and south-west England on Saturday as Storm Darragh hits the UK. Gusts of 90mph (145km/h) or more were possible over the coasts and hills of west and south Wales, as well as funnelling through the Bristol Channel with some very large waves on exposed beaches, the forecaster said. Warnings for possible significant flooding have been issued for parts of south Wales that were overwhelmed only last month during Storm Bert. The rare red warning was due to be in place from 3am to 11am on Saturday and signalled a danger to life due to flying debris and falling trees. Residents in the south-west of England and parts of Wales received a “severe alert” from the UK government on their phones through the public warning system on Friday evening. Mobile phone users received the emergency alert on the home screen of their device, coupled with a vibration and a loud siren-like series of beeps. “A red warning for wind has been issued in your area,” the alert said. “Stay indoors if you can. It is not safe to drive in these conditions.” The emergency alert system was launched last year and is designed to be used for events such as severe flooding, fires or extreme weather. Similar systems had been credited with saving lives in countries including the Netherlands and Japan. An amber warning for wind was already in place for large parts of the UK, with power cuts and flying debris possible amid the arrival of Storm Darragh, the fourth named storm of the season. The amber warning for “potentially damaging” winds was in place on Saturday from 1am until 9pm for the west coast of the UK from South Ayrshire in Scotland down to Cornwall, as well as in Northern Ireland. Yellow warnings for wind and rain on Thursday across parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England were extended to cover the north-east and south of England on Friday. Flying debris could cause injury or danger to life and buildings may be damaged, such as tiles blown from roofs, the Met Office said. Power cuts and large waves should be expected, and some roads and bridges may be closed, with falling trees posing an additional hazard. National Highways, which runs England’s motorways and busiest A-roads, has issued a severe weather alert for Saturday and has warned motorists in the south-west and north-west to prepare for gale-force winds. It said routes likely to be affected by the strongest winds include the M5 in northern Somerset, the A30 in Cornwall and the M6 in Cheshire. Severe winds were already affecting travel in parts of the UK with the M48 Severn Bridge in Gloucestershire closed on Thursday night because of gusty weather. A yellow warning for rain will be in place for Northern Ireland and Wales, which were badly affected by flooding during Storm Bert, from 3pm on Friday until noon on Saturday. Up to 60mm of rain could fall in these areas during the warning period, which might lead to some flooding and disruption, forecasters said. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) has urged people to be vigilant and prepared for possible significant flooding in areas of south Wales on Saturday and into Sunday. While rainfall totals are not expected to be as high as those experienced during Storm Bert last month, further heavy rain experienced in Wales this week means the ground is saturated and rivers could rise quickly, NRW said. Some rivers will also contain debris yet to be removed following Storm Bert, which could heighten flood risk. Rhondda Cynon Taf, where between 200 and 300 properties were flooded during Storm Bert, was forecast to be hit by heavy rain once again. NRW issued more than 30 flood alerts and warnings, while the Environment Agency in England put more than 20 red flood warnings in place, with residents and business owners told to “act now”. Simon Partridge, the senior forecaster for the Met Office, said there would be some “very dangerous” conditions, particularly around coastal areas. He said: “Unless you really need to be going out in this on Saturday, it’s best to avoid it, particularly if you live in any of those areas covered by the amber wind warning … 70mph winds are dangerous and we could see, as the warnings suggest, a risk to life as a result. “We have a very blustery spell of weather ahead. Amber warnings are usually over small areas, but because of the track of the storm, this will actually affect quite a large part of the UK.” The warnings come as a result of areas of low pressure propelled towards Britain by the jet stream (a flow of winds high in the atmosphere). At the core of the jet stream, speeds are expected to reach 240mph, driven by cold air across the northern US and Canada. Storm Darragh was named by the Met Office on Thursday morning. The names run in alphabetical order, starting this season with Ashley, Bert and Conall. Last week, questions were raised over a lack of sufficient warnings of flooding after Storm Bert wreaked havoc in parts of south Wales and south-west England as a month of rain hit sodden towns and villages. Extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world. This is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by other factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use. • This article was amended on 6 December 2024. National Highways’ remit covers England only, not the whole of the UK as an earlier version said."

          "bodyText": "An elderly man was left unable to swallow after waiting over two days in A&amp;E without being given regular medication, and died four weeks later. In a “shocking” case that has raised fresh concerns over the state of urgent NHS care, the 85-year-old was sent to a hospital emergency department after a routine appointment. Amid massive delays, his A&amp;E wait went into a third day, with most of it spent on a bed in the corridor. He had Parkinson’s disease and required medicine at various intervals to control his symptoms. During his time in A&amp;E, the man should have received 18 doses but seven were not given and three were given late, according to a report from the Health Services Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB). The report, which does not name the patient or hospital, highlights how the man was advised to go to A&amp;E after complaining of back pain following a fall at home the day before. After 52 hours in A&amp;E, he was finally admitted to a ward where his Parkinson’s symptoms deteriorated and he lost the ability to swallow, the HSSIB said. He died four weeks later, with the causes of death listed on the death certificate as a severe chest infection, Parkinson’s and frailty of old age. The HSSIB report highlights how the man spent most of his time in A&amp;E on a bed in a corridor because of demand on services. Corridor care can cause problems for emergency staff because there are “limited opportunities to store medication brought from home”, the authors said. They highlighted how there was no function to automatically alert staff that he should have received time-critical medication. And staff were not able to check prescription information with the patient’s GP practice or Parkinson’s specialty team outside of working hours. A&amp;E staff also received contradictory information about the dosage of medication required from the patient’s record and his son. Staff took the GP information “as the most accurate record, but the information it contained was incorrect”. Investigators found there were “no defined roles or responsibilities in the emergency department to ensure patients who required time-critical medications were identified, and medications prescribed, as soon as possible”. The HSSIB warned that “patients who need medications can suffer harm if these are not provided” as it called on health bodies to make sure they are adhering to expert guidelines on time-sensitive medications for patients. The latest performance data for the NHS in England shows that 49,592 people had to wait more than 12 hours in A&amp;E departments in October from a decision to admit to actually being admitted, the third highest monthly figure since comparable records began in 2010. Dr Adrian Boyle, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the case was shocking and tragic. “[This] should serve as a call to action for all emergency department clinicians. No patient who enters an emergency department should fear their health will be put at risk because they are unable to access their regular prescription when they need it,” he said. “Asking patients if they take any time-critical medication, and when their next dose is due, should be one of the questions every clinician asks. “This simple inquiry becomes increasingly pertinent given the backdrop of the extremely long A&amp;E stays more and more people are having to endure. In this tragic case – a shocking 52 hours.” Deinniol Owens, the deputy director of investigations at the HSSIB said: “When patients are in the emergency department it is crucial that, alongside any emergency treatment needed, medication they require for other conditions is prioritised. “The case we examined during this investigation was a sobering example – if patients do not receive medication for their Parkinson’s it can make them seriously unwell, and doses not being given on time increases the risk of harm and reduces the effectiveness of the medication. “It is distressing for patients and their families, and in this case the family felt they were not always listened to even though they communicated his needs and emphasised how important the correct timing of the dosage was. “Our investigation makes a number of important findings in relation to how time-critical medications are considered in emergency departments. “We are sharing this at a national level to prompt providers to look at how they administer critical medication, in a busy and challenging emergency environment and how they ensure patients receive medication in a timely and safe way.”"

          "bodyText": "Keir Starmer will attempt to reset his premiership with a series of pledges to show he is “delivering change”, including 13,000 extra neighbourhood police and a named “bobby on every beat”. In a speech Labour hopes will set out the “next phase” of government, the prime minister will detail half a dozen “milestone” targets covering living standards, NHS backlogs, secure energy, housebuilding and children’s readiness for school. As part of a promise to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour, he will say that every neighbourhood in England and Wales will have a named, contactable police officer. Each police force will also have an antisocial behaviour lead tasked with coming up with ways to tackle concerns raised by local residents and businesses. Starmer will pledge 13,000 more neighbourhood police, PCSOs and special constables by 2029, with an additional £100m of funding. “These officers must demonstrably spend time on visible patrol and not be taken off the beat to plug shortages elsewhere,” he will say. The boost would bring the total police workforce to a level above its 2010 peak. After ministers were accused of blindsiding businesses with a big increase in employer national insurance contributions in the budget, the heads of three high street retailers – Asda, Co-op and McDonald’s – endorsed the “neighbourhood policing guarantee”. The promise will prompt comparisons with the Blair-era “tough on crime” slogan. Many of the plans were first outlined by Labour last year. The attempted reboot – labelled Starmer’s “plan for change” – follows a rocky first five months in power for the government. A major tax and spend budget was welcomed by campaigners for greater spending on public services but sapped business confidence and led to protests by farmers. Starmer has also faced a row over ministers enjoying freebies, and the resignations of both his chief of staff, Sue Gray and his transport secretary, Louise Haigh, who quit after it emerged she had been convicted of fraud over a missing work phone. The Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, has branded Thursday’s speech an “emergency reset”. But Starmer will say claim that the new “milestones” are the next phase of the “missions” he said would shape a Labour government. But it is also a tacit admission that those missions are being dumped as they were either too woolly or not achievable. The missions were: achieving the highest growth out of G7 countries, making Britain a “clean energy superpower”, halving serious violent crime, breaking down “barriers to opportunity” and building an NHS “fit for the future”. No 10 insiders have argued that numerical targets are more memorable for voters. “We’ll be putting them [the missions] into layman’s terms,” said one source last week. The Guardian has reported that the planned reset is being driven by Morgan McSweeney, who replaced Gray as chief of staff. “Morgan knows our best chance of holding off a populist surge, and winning Keir a second term, is delivering noticeable change to voters,” an ally said. In his speech on Thursday, Starmer will say: “My government was elected to deliver change, and today marks the next step. People are tired of being promised the world, but short-term sticking plaster politics is letting them down. “Hardworking Brits are going out grafting every day but are getting short shrift from a politics that should serve them. They reasonably want a stable economy, their country to be safe, their borders secure, more cash in their pocket, safer streets in their town, opportunities for their children, secure British energy in their home, and an NHS that is there when they need it. My mission-led government will deliver.” On the crime and antisocial behaviour plan, he will add: “The neighbourhood policing guarantee will deliver 13,000 extra neighbourhood police, visible on your streets, cracking down on antisocial behaviour. A named, contactable officer in every community. A relief to millions of people scared to walk their streets they call home. “But it’s a pledge that is only possible because we are matching investment with reform; standardising procurement, streamlining specialist services like forensics, and ending the madness of 43 forces purchasing their own cars and uniforms.” Shops have complained of facing an epidemic of shoplifting in the past year, fuelled in large part by the cost of living crisis. Liz Evans, the chief commercial officer at Asda, said: “Asda welcomes the introduction of the neighbourhood policing guarantee and the new role for businesses in shaping local policing priorities. “At the heart of communities, retailers see every day the devastating impact retail crime is having on our colleagues and our customers. The changes introduced today are positive, and Asda stands ready to work in partnership with our new neighbourhood officers to help reduce crime and improve safety in the communities we serve.” Alistair Macrow, the CEO of McDonald’s UK, said: “Addressing and raising awareness of antisocial behaviour is essential in keeping high streets and local communities safe.” Paul Gerrard, Co-op’s campaigns and public affairs director, said: “The Co-op sees every day in our stores and in the communities they serve the impact of crime and antisocial behaviour so we welcome the government’s action today.” Police numbers fell following the 2010 election, when David Cameron came to power, before rising again after 2019 as the previous government pledged to recruit 20,000 police officers. While the number of officers reached record levels, the number of PCSOs and special constables continued to decline. The Conservatives said only a third of the 13,000 new recruits would be full police officers, while the £100m would not cover what was needed to pay for them, leading to cuts elsewhere. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “The Conservatives recruited over 20,000 extra police officers and gave the police an extra £922m for policing this year, ensuring the police could protect the public and prosecute more criminals. Starmer has once again misled the public by claiming to recruit an extra 13,000 officers when the actual number is 3,000, and even that is not properly funded.”"

          "headline": "Georgia’s payback machine: Fani Willis resists subpoenas by state lawmakers over Trump prosecution",
          "bodyText": "Even before Project 2025 made it a Republican goal to use federal power to bring progressive prosecutors to heel, the Fulton county, Georgia, district attorney, Fani Willis, found herself in the crosshairs of conservative state legislators angered by her prosecution of Donald Trump. That conflict found its way into yet another courtroom on Tuesday. Willis’s office defended itself against a subpoena by a state senate committee, which had demanded her appearance to explain how she might have spent money on Nathan Wade, her former special prosecutor and paramour, in the prosecution of now president-elect Trump and others charged in the election interference case. She rejected two subpoenas issued by the Senate special committee on investigations demanding her testimony and a barrel full of documents about the relationship, her office’s finances and the case. The future of the Trump election interference case in Georgia remains unclear. The state appeals court canceled a hearing scheduled for this week, in which Trump and other defendants had sought to remove Willis as prosecutor on the case. The appeal cited Willis’s relationship with Wade, arguing that the financial entanglement between the two created a conflict of interest that should force a recusal. The appeals court could – and often does – rule without hearing oral arguments. It could scuttle the case entirely, order Willis to be removed as prosecutor, sever Trump from the trial or allow the case to move forward as is. Federal prosecutors rolled up their cases after Trump won election to a second term, noting that the federal government cannot prosecute a sitting president. The Georgia case remains the only one left to prosecute against Trump, with 14 co-defendants still in legal jeopardy. Anger over that prosecution has come from multiple flanks within the Republican party. Even as the former Georgia governor Roy Barnes argued on behalf of Willis before the Fulton superior court judge Shukura Ingram on Tuesday that the state senate subpoenas were unconstitutional, another judge issued an order declaring her office in violation of the state’s Open Records Act in another case. Conservative legal activists from Judicial Watch sued Fulton county after Willis’s office refused to turn over records of her communications with the special counsel Jack Smith and the House January 6 committee. The Fulton county superior court judge Robert McBurney ordered her office to turn the records over within five days. Republicans want to know how Willis might have coordinated Trump’s prosecution with the Department of Justice and, ultimately, the Biden White House. But they are also contemplating how the results of the committee investigation may lead legislators to rewrite laws to take authority away from district attorneys, to cut Willis’s budget or to otherwise limit her authority to prosecute wayward Republicans. Willis has said she views this as political harassment and is fighting them all the way down, likening it to the legislative movement that created a state panel that could remove local prosecutors. Willis’s office argued before that committees representing only the statehouse or the state senate do not have subpoena power: both chambers must issue a subpoena as a joint act under the Georgia state constitution. “The operative word is ‘general assembly’,” argued Barnes. The term refers to both chambers of the Georgia legislature together, he said. “Only the general assembly has the right of subpoena. Not the senate. Not the house.” Willis’s office argued that a subpoena cannot be issued when the general assembly is not in session, as the committee did in this case, and that the subpoenas are overbroad relative to limitations made in Georgia’s Open Records Act and a common-law sense of separation of powers. Barnes argued that legislative oversight over state spending is being used by hostile politicians on a fishing expedition-as-harassment, citing the Mazars decision by the US supreme court seeking Trump’s financial records from his accountants. “This wrought committee created by one set of the general assembly says, ‘Oh, wouldn’t it be fun for us to just drag the district attorney down and see what she’s got on old Donald Trump,’” Barnes said. “Well, Fani Willis had an affair with Nathan Wade. This is a pretext. We would be blind not to see what all of us see. This was nothing but singling out one person who’s been duly elected in this circuit, and duly re-elected, to embarrass her. It’s not for any legitimate legislative reason.” Josh Belinfante, representing the senate committee, argued that the district attorney is challenging the constitutionality of subpoena power for all legislative committees, and that doing so gets between lawmakers and their duty. “They’re investigating … these allegations that may show that existing state laws – including those establishing the processes for selecting, hiring and compensating special assistant district attorneys – are inadequate,” Belinfante said. “It is necessary to determine whether the alleged conduct of District Attorney Willis, if proven to be true in whole or in part, should be addressed by the enactment of new laws or prompt some change in state appropriations, or both.” Legislators began looking at the actions of district attorney before the Trump case rocketed to the top of their attention, Belinfante said. Arguments were made that one provision of state statute could be used to limit the authority of the legislature that passed that statute in the first place. “It is presumed that the general assembly can act unless the constitution says otherwise,” Belinfante said. “There is no constitutional prohibition against investigations.” Belinfante noted that the state constitution empowers each chamber to establish legislative committees, and that – in the absence of an expressed prohibition – that gives each chamber the power to issue subpoenas without consulting the other chamber. No Georgia court has ever examined the subpoena power of the state legislature as Ingram has been asked to do on Tuesday, legal experts say."

          "bodyText": "What do you get if you mix Keir Starmer, Thames Water, and a weight-loss-drug-taking Father Christmas? The top 10 best Christmas cracker jokes of 2024, as voted for by the British public. The jokes were written by members of the public and then posted online, where they were filtered into a shortlist by a panel of judges before being put to an anonymous vote of 2,000 people. Ranging from political puns to Britpop gags, the list of jokes, collated by U&amp;Gold, formerly Comedy Gold, are in keeping with Christmas cracker tradition of lame one-liners that prompt eyerolls, rather than genuine chuckles. The No 1 joke poked fun at the prime minister: “What gifts will Sir Keir get this Christmas? None, he’s had enough!” The quip is a reference to the autumn freebies row, where it was revealed that Keir Starmer accepted tens of thousands of pounds worth of gifts and hospitality, including Taylor Swift concert tickets, pairs of glasses, and rented clothing for his wife. The other shortlisted jokes on the top 10 list were: Why are pensioners bulk buying-brussels sprouts this Christmas? It’s the only way they’ll keep the gas flowing this year Why is Rachel Reeves in the Nativity this year? She’s collecting inn-heritance tax. Why is Santa worried about being stalked? He’s surrounded by baby reindeer Who’s Santa’s favourite member of Oasis? Noel Why does Father Christmas find going down chimneys easier this year? He’s on Ho Ho hozempic. Why aren’t there more jokes about receiving Oasis tickets for Christmas? Most people won’t get them. What do you call a Belgian reselling tickets at inflated prices? – a Brussels tout. What’s the Thames Water advent calendar like? It’s full of number 2s. Why did Gareth Southgate get into difficulty with the Christmas Club money? He was always late with his subs. Comedy critic Bruce Dessau, who led the judging panel, said: “Another brilliant list of festive funnies from the public – a true testament to British wit! After an eventful 2024, I’m glad to see the nation’s humour bringing a bit of light to some of the year’s headlines!” Christmas crackers were invented by Victorian confectioner Tom Smith. In the 1840s, generating ideas to push sales, Smith began writing love messages and poems on the wrappers of his popular sugared almond “bonbons”, which were big sellers at Christmas. The idea snowballed after Smith began packaging the confectionery in tubes and adding the famous “pop” when the wrapping was pulled apart. The legend goes that the pop mechanism of the cracker was inspired by the crackle and sparks of Smith’s log fire. After Smith’s son Walter took over the company in 1869, paper hats and trinkets began being added to the crackers. By the 1930s, when crackers were manufactured by a range of companies and were becoming household Christmas items, the love messages started to morph into jokes, for broader appeal."

          "bodyText": "When Tim first tried ChatGPT, he wasn’t very impressed. He had a play around, but ended up cancelling his subscription. Then he started having marriage troubles. Seeking to alleviate his soul-searching and sleepless nights, he took up journalling and found it beneficial. From there, it was a small step to unburdening himself to the chatbot, he says: “ChatGPT is the perfect journal – because it will talk back.” Tim started telling the platform about himself, his wife, Jill, and their recurring conflicts. They have been married for nearly 20 years, but still struggle to communicate; during arguments, Tim wants to talk things through, while Jill seeks space. ChatGPT has helped him to understand their differences and manage his own emotional responses, Tim says. He likens it to a friend “who can help translate from ‘husband’ to ‘wife’ and back, and tell me if I’m being reasonable”. He uses the platform to draft loving texts to send to Jill, calm down after an argument and even role-play difficult conversations, prompting it to stand in for himself or Jill, so that he might respond better in the moment. Jill is aware that he uses ChatGPT for personal development, he says – if maybe not the extent. “But she’s noticed a big change in how I show up in the relationship.” When the free-to-use chatbot was launched in November 2022, it became the fastest-growing platform in history, amassing one million users in five days. Two years later, ChatGPT is not only more powerful but increasingly commonplace. According to its developer, OpenAI, more than 200 million people are using it weekly – and not just for work. ChatGPT is gaining popularity as a personal cheerleader, life coach and even pocket therapist. The singer Lily Allen recently said on her podcast that she uses ChatGPT to mediate text arguments with her husband, using prompts such as “add in a bit about how I think this is all actually to do with his mum”. The novelist Andrew O’Hagan said he uses another chatbot to turn people down, calling it his “new best friend”. It shows how – steadily, but subtly – generative AI is making inroads into our personal and professional lives. “It’s everywhere, and it’s happened so quickly. We really don’t have any way of addressing or understanding it yet,” says Ella Hafermalz, an associate professor of work and technology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In a recent study, Hafermalz and her colleagues found that in the workplace, people are increasingly turning to ChatGPT with their questions rather than asking their colleagues or manager, which can cause problems with organisational effectiveness and personal relations. “The technology is bad enough at the moment that people are getting burnt … but it is seductive,” she says. After interviewing 50 early adopters of ChatGPT, the researchers found that people were driven to explore “out of curiosity, anxiety or both”. From tinkering around with the platform with “dumb stuff”, it was often a rapid progression to integrated daily use, says Hafermalz. “We’re seeing it in all sorts of different contexts.” She uses ChatGPT herself to proofread her writing, express herself in Dutch (her second language) and even generate bedtime stories for her children. The technology isn’t inherently negative, she says – but it does pose challenges that will be more destabilising if we don’t engage with them. Right now, she says, “people are at vastly different levels with Gen AI”, driven by private use. You don’t have to be using ChatGPT yourself to be interacting with its output. Yvette works in the charity sector, and started using ChatGPT to refine funding applications. “I don’t use it to write the whole thing, because it comes off as completely disingenuous,” she says. But she has also used it in a personal context: “My ex is not a nice person, not easy to deal with.” She does her best to keep the peace for the sake of their child, but when she received a letter informing her that he would no longer be paying child maintenance, she was furious. “I thought, ‘I’m going to have to stand up for this – it’s not right.’” In the past, she might have spent hours crafting a text that was assertive but not emotional; this time, Yvette let loose to ChatGPT. “I ranted away, and said all of the horrible things I wanted to say … and then ChatGPT spat out this much more balanced viewpoint.” The exercise was “quite therapeutic”, Yvette says – and nowhere near as emotionally taxing as writing the message herself. She sent ChatGPT’s suggestion to her ex-partner unchanged. “It was a bit Americanised, but I didn’t really care.” He responded with a “nasty message”, but Yvette found that she was able to resist engaging. Her ex eventually agreed to continue paying support. The chatbot-middleman took the heat out of the interaction, enabling her to present a “better version” of herself, Yvette says. She has since used ChatGPT for support with troubles her child is having at school. “I know that it’s not going to be perfect, but even then it came back with practical tips.” Some she had already thought of, but she appreciated the validation. “It was reassuring to me that my gut response was its gut response.” For Tim, ChatGPT has played a more active role – as “a teacher of emotional intelligence”. Since the platform introduced its “memory” function in February, it can now draw on everything that Tim has inputted about Jill and their relationship to give more personalised responses. When he asked ChatGPT to describe their individual “psychological blindspots”, it produced a lengthy list of what he saw as “99% of the drivers of conflict” in their marriage. “It nailed me perfectly,” he says. While Tim is aware that the chatbot only gets “one side of the story”, he says it has made him a better partner, shielding Jill from his spirals. “If I get really anxious, like ‘What’s she thinking?’, I can go to ChatGPT and it says: ‘She’s doing this because of this’ … That’s the perfect thing: ChatGPT can do emotional labour all day long.” The interactive, responsive element has enlarged his understanding of empathy, Tim adds. “Before, my version was just to imagine me, in her position … Now I’ve got a much bigger respect for emotionality.” Previously, when Tim sought advice online, he was directed to hyper-masculine, even toxic resources. “It does sound a little bit bad to say, ‘As a man, ChatGPT helps me understand women.’ But when you think that it’s trained on everything, and so many books written by women … It has no gender; it’s all of humanity.” Indeed, ChatGPT now knows enough about Jill to anticipate her response, Tim says. “Sometimes, if I’m going to send her a message, I’ll ask ChatGPT: ‘Given what you know about my wife, how will she interpret this?’” The chatbot might suggest a different text, which Tim always revises, but he acknowledges that on occasion, ChatGPT’s feedback has “really saved my skin”. Tim is not in therapy; Jill doesn’t want to go together, and he’s put off by the cost. Barriers to professional help are one reason for ChatGPT’s mounting popularity as an emotional support tool. It is being used for reflective journalling, dream analysis and exercises in different therapeutic schools; there are even dedicated (and unauthorised) relationship chatbots advising in the manner of the celebrity therapist Esther Perel. But it’s not just an accessible alternative – ChatGPT is starting to encroach on actual therapy, says the therapist Susie Masterson. “At first I felt quite affronted – like, ‘Oh no, are we going to be replaced?’” Masterson says. But having a background in tech, she has been able to accommodate clients’ enthusiasm for ChatGPT in her practice. Sometimes they bring their transcripts for discussion, or she suggests areas for research. ChatGPT can help with reframing thoughts and situations, similar to cognitive behavioural therapy – but “some clients can start to use it as a substitute for therapy”, Masterson says. “I’ve had clients telling me they’ve already processed on their own, because of what they’ve read – it’s incredibly dangerous.” She has had to ask some clients to cease their self-experiments while in treatment with her. “It’s about you and me in the room,” she says. “You just cannot have that with text – let alone a conglomeration of lots of other people’s texts.” Self-directed chatbot therapy also risks being counterproductive, shrinking the area of inquiry. “It’s quite affirmative; I challenge clients,” says Masterson. ChatGPT could actually cement patterns as it draws, over and again, from the same database: “The more you try to refine it, the more refined the message becomes.” Tim found this himself. At his peak, he was spending two to three hours on ChatGPT daily, causing the chatbot to repeat itself. “I did get a little too obsessed with it,” he says. “You can start overanalysing yourself – and it’s really easy to overanalyse your wife.” For others, however, ChatGPT’s insights are transformative and lasting. Liam found that even six years after his father died, he still felt stuck in grief. “My dad’s birthday would come around, and Father’s Day, and I’d have all these emotions swell,” he says. Having used ChatGPT as a research tool through his master’s degree, Liam began exploring it as a means of therapeutic support, telling it “like I was talking to a person” about his painful mixed feelings of resentment and loss. Liam has been in therapy for five years, and says ChatGPT is in no way a replacement – but he was still “shocked and amazed” by the chatbot’s nuanced replies. “It validated and reflected an emotional response that was appropriate for the context, so it made me feel very safe.” Afterwards, he felt as though some internal block had dissolved: “I didn’t feel that same emotional volatility.” The experience was “deeply moving” – but, Liam adds, ChatGPT was just one strand of his processing. “Sometimes I find the validation is almost too much.” Some experimental interactions left him feeling a “bit wigged out”. Young or isolated people may be at particular risk, however. Earlier this year, an American teenager killed himself after becoming emotionally attached to his Character.AI chatbot; his mother is now suing the company, alleging that the chatbot encouraged her son’s suicidal ideation. As much as AI presents a way to augment our knowledge and understanding, there is a danger of dependency, says Masterson. “Everything that we do in terms of outsourcing our emotions means we’re missing an opportunity to connect with ourselves – and if we cannot connect with ourselves, how the heck do we expect to connect with someone else?” Using ChatGPT to role-play or mediate challenging conversations may reflect fear of emotional exposure, or pressure to always be word-perfect. “To err is human. Every relationship will involve a rupture, but it’s the repair that’s important,” Masterson says. If we seek to dodge both, by “using somebody else’s platitudes, then we’re missing out on the beauty of life”. The increasing use of AI is also causing people to second-guess their interactions, “creating a climate of suspicion”, says Rua M Williams, an assistant professor at Purdue University in Indiana, US. Last year a colleague accused Williams of having used AI in an email, pointing to its lack of “warmth”. Williams replied: “It’s not an AI. I’m just autistic.” They felt bewildered, not offended, Williams says – but it illustrates the vigilance accompanying the rise of AI. Williams’ professional writing has also been flagged. “People are looking for signs … but what they are noticing is the kinds of awkwardness or idiosyncrasies common in neurodivergent expression and English as a second language.” These looming “side-effects” of ChatGPT are worsened by its siloed use, says Prof Hafermalz. “As this becomes very intertwined with the way people work, there’s less and less need for them to look towards other people.” For organisations, it presents existential challenges, reducing colleagues’ opportunities to collaborate and learn from one another – and managers’ ability to improve organisational functioning. Many of her interviewees were reluctant to be upfront about their ChatGPT use, concerned it would be seen as “cheating” or unprofessional – while also noting the undeniable benefit of being able “to do their work faster”. What’s needed is open discussion about workplace use of AI and how to harness it, before it becomes too difficult to control, Hafermalz says. “The ripple effects are just getting started, and I think that keeping it covert is a surefire way for those to be more unpredictable and problematic.” The increasing personal use of ChatGPT is harder to detect, let alone put parameters around. Having spent hours a day on ChatGPT, Tim is now down to 15 minutes, treating it as a sounding board rather than an authority on his relationship. Many questions he took to ChatGPT “probably could have been solved with a good friend group”, he says – but he links his previous compulsive prompting to social isolation. His own ties had been weakened by an international move and midlife drift. “It’s kind of sad, with this loneliness epidemic – we’re all having to get therapy from a robot.” It could even be creating unrealistic expectations, Tim suggests: modelling “the perfect partner” and affirming people’s least charitable views of their real-life spouse. “It is a little bit dangerous, because it’s sort of half-baked – it seems like it could be so much more beneficial than it maybe is.” He recalls, at the peak of his anxious use, asking ChatGPT if he was using it too much. “It said: ‘Yeah – maybe get a therapist.’” All case studies’ names have been changed"

          "headline": "Government may cap UK political donations to limit foreign influence",
          "bodyText": "Caps on political donations are being considered by ministers as part of sweeping reforms to the UK electoral system. Labour is examining proposals to limit how much individuals and companies can donate to political parties as part of an effort to tighten the rules around money in UK politics. In a report to be published in the coming weeks, the Institute for Public Policy Research will recommend that ministers limit individual and corporate donations to political parties to £100,000 a year. The Guardian understands that officials have sought more detail on those proposals, though the work is still at a very early stage and would come in for the second half of this parliament. It comes amid speculation that Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media platform X, could donate $100m (£79m) to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party. In its manifesto, Labour committed to “protect democracy by strengthening the rules around donations to political parties”. At the core of this pledge is an aim to tighten protections around foreign interference in UK democracy. In opposition, Labour raised concerns about the Conservative government’s decision to abolish the 15-year cut-off at which UK citizens who live abroad were no longer eligible to vote in general elections. Labour argued that by allowing Britons who have lived abroad for more than 15 years to make political donations and loans, the Tories would give people who are “vulnerable to manipulation by hostile actors” the ability to influence politics. Donation caps are among a number of measures the government is looking at as part of plans for an election and democracy bill in the next parliamentary session. The bill did not form part of the king’s speech in July and is therefore not expected at the next session in 2026 or later. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “As set out in the manifesto, we are working to strengthen the rules around donations to political parties to ensure we maintain trust in our electoral system. We will set out more details on this in due course.” Other reforms being considered are automatic voter registration, which would remove the requirement for people to register to join the electoral roll, and reducing the minimum voting age to 16, which was a Labour manifesto commitment. Claims that Musk is considering supporting Farage through the UK arm of X will prompt fresh calls to tighten the rules around political donations and impose limits. Musk, who has been chosen by the US president-elect, Donald Trump, to head up the department of government efficiency, a non-federal presidential advisory body, has been scathing of Starmer’s government since Labour’s landslide victory in July. Last week, he endorsed a post saying Reform would win the next election. Capping political donations would limit the amount of money flowing into the Labour party’s coffers, however. Labour received more in donations than all other parties combined during the election campaign, collecting more than £9.5m in total. The party’s biggest donor was David Sainsbury, the former chair of the Sainsbury’s supermarket chain, who gave £2.5m. The Conservatives, meanwhile, have benefited from more than £20m in donations from the businessman Frank Hester since the start of 2023. Hester was at the centre of a political furore in March after the Guardian revealed he had told colleagues at his IT healthcare company in 2019 that looking at Diane Abbott, the UK’s first black female MP, made you “want to hate all black women” and that she “should be shot”. Analysis by Transparency International over the weekend suggested that loopholes in the existing law were allowing “dark money” to infiltrate British politics, with almost £1 in every £10 donated to parties and politicians coming from unknown or dubious sources. Cash from companies that have never turned a profit, from unincorporated associations that do not have to declare their funders, and banned donations from overseas donors via intermediaries are all entering the system, according to the research. In December 2023, Wajid Khan, a Labour frontbencher, told the House of Lords: “We think that opening the electoral register as widely as the government are doing today goes far beyond what our current donation rules were set up to do. “It will allow those with tenuous links to the UK, who have spent most of their lives in states that may even be openly hostile to our aims, the right to massively influence our system.”"

          "headline": "What are the allegations against MasterChef’s Gregg Wallace?",
          "bodyText": "Gregg Wallace has been accused of making sexualised jokes and other inappropriate remarks towards a range of women dating back nearly two decades. The 60-year-old MasterChef presenter announced last week that he was stepping back from the BBC show amid an investigation into his conduct. Wallace’s lawyers have said it is entirely false to suggest he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. On Sunday he said his accusers were “middle-class women of a certain age” and claimed that “absolutely none” of the staff on his other shows had complained about him. These are the allegations that have emerged in the last four days. Kirsty Wark and the 13 accusers The broadcaster Kirsty Wark was one of the first women to publicly accuse Wallace of inappropriate behaviour, telling BBC News last week that he told “sexualised” jokes during filming of Celebrity MasterChef in 2011. Wark said she felt the comments were “really, really in the wrong place” and that they made people “uncomfortable”. The former Newsnight host said she raised it at the time with an executive at the production company, Shine, and the gist of the reply was “almost as if it was some kind of affliction”, adding: “And if his behaviour became too egregious, he’d be pulled back.” Wark was one of 13 people making allegations about Wallace’s conduct over a 17-year period, BBC News reported last Thursday. The claims included Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to “give her a fashion show”, and telling a junior female colleague he wasn’t wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans. Allegations dating back 19 years Many of the accusations against Wallace span the last decade, the height of Wallace’s TV fame, but some date as far back as 19 years. BBC News reported that a worker on MasterChef said Wallace regularly made sexually explicit remarks on set in 2005 and 2006. A former contestant, Dr Kate Tomas, has said she complained about his treatment of her on the show in 2008 but that nothing was done. In a video on TikTok, Tomas alleged that he sexually harassed her and described him as “disgusting and repulsive”. She called him a “racist piece of shit” and claimed he impersonated an Indian accent in front of a staff member who was Indian. Tomas said his actions meant she refused to appear again on the show when they asked her to return as one of the “best losers”. Kirstie Allsopp The presenter Kirstie Allsopp became the latest person to accuse Wallace of making inappropriate remarks when she said he referred to sex acts shortly after meeting her. Writing on X on Sunday, the co-host of Location, Location, Location said: “Within 1 hour of meeting Gregg Walllace he told me of a sex act that he and his partner at the time enjoyed ‘every morning’, she’d just left the room, we were filming a pilot. Did he get off on how embarrassed I was? It was totally unprofessional, I’m a #MiddleClassWomanOfaCertainAge.” Allsopp said Wallace made the remarks in the green room rather than on camera. She added: “Why say nothing? Because you feel, in no particular order, embarrassed, a prude, shocked, waiting for a male colleague to call him out, not wanting to ‘rock the boat’, thinking it’s better to plough on with the day, assuming you misheard/misunderstood or just don’t get the joke.” Complaint in 2012 A number of women have said they reported concerns about Wallace to television bosses years ago but he was allowed to remain on screen. The actor and author Emma Kennedy said she complained about the presenter to production staff in 2012 after he allegedly touched another woman’s bottom. Kennedy, who won the seventh edition of Celebrity MasterChef, said: “I complained about behaviour I witnessed on MasterChef in 2012. They knew then. They knew before then and they’ve known since. “The photographer had a young female assistant and she bent over and in front of me. Gregg went over and went ‘corr!’ with his hands over her arse. I think he touched her, because she did react, though I cannot be 100% certain that he did touch her. “He thought it was funny. It wasn’t the act of a sexual predator; it was the act of somebody who just doesn’t get that that stuff is inappropriate.” Kennedy said she later spoke to a member of the MasterChef public relations team and that “the only topic of conversation was ‘when the problem with GW was going to come to light’”. Complaint in 2017 The Sunday Times has reported that Wallace was told by a BBC executive in 2017 that his behaviour was “unacceptable and cannot continue” after complaints were made by the broadcaster Aasmah Mir, who appeared on the 12th series of Celebrity MasterChef. Kate Phillips, who oversees unscripted programmes for the BBC, said she would ensure that she was “informed straight away” should further allegations be made against the MasterChef host, according to the report. Mir apparently wrote in an email forwarded to Phillips in November 2017: “Should anything happen in the future, I don’t want to feel guilty when people say ‘why wasn’t anything said before?’, or for producers or editors to claim they didn’t know.” Warning in 2018 Wallace is said to have received a warning from BBC bosses in 2018 after a complaint was raised about his behaviour on the quizshow Impossible Celebrities. Two of the women who complained told BBC News that he made staff feel uncomfortable by talking about his sex life and making “disgusting” sexual jokes. The broadcaster reported that a formal HR investigation took place and concluded that “many aspects of [Wallace’s] behaviour were both unacceptable and unprofessional”. In a subsequent letter, seen by BBC News, a BBC executive said she had held a 90-minute meeting with Wallace to make clear “how seriously the BBC takes this matter”. She also reassured the workers that action would be taken “to prevent a similar reoccurrence and to safeguard others in the future”. But further incidents have since emerged. Complaint in 2022 A letter containing several allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Wallace was sent to the BBC in 2022 but did not prompt further investigation at the time, the Observer revealed on Sunday. The letter described a “pattern of behaviour” by the MasterChef presenter that “clearly fails to meet the sexual harassment and bullying standards that prohibit unwelcome sexual advances and sexual innuendo”. Dawn Elrick, the director and producer who sent the 2022 letter on behalf of other women who had contacted her, said the BBC suggested each individual would have to make their own direct complaint to the corporation. Elrick said that soon after sending the letter she also submitted the allegations to the BBC via Navex Global, an external whistleblowing service. She said she received no further contact with regards to that report. Elrick said the BBC’s lack of action showed there was “no satisfactory means of reporting sexual harassment and bullying within the TV industry”. Claims about other shows Wallace is facing claims from people who worked or appeared on other shows in addition to those related to MasterChef, Celebrity MasterChef and Impossible Celebrities. Women who worked on the shows Gregg Wallace’s Big Weekends and Eat Well for Less? allege he regularly behaved inappropriately, including making “highly inappropriate” comments about sex. One woman said he made constant “lesbian jokes” and became “fascinated” by her relationships with women and wanted to know the “logistics” of how she dated, while filming Big Weekends in 2019. Another woman told BBC News that while working on the Channel 5 programme at the same time Wallace’s conversation often revolved around sex, including spanking and domination. Last year, Wallace stood down from the show Inside the Factory after staff at a Nestlé factory in York complained that he made inappropriate comments about the weight of female employees. Wallace responds Wallace’s lawyers have said the suggestion that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature is entirely false. He took aim at his accusers in an Instagram video on Sunday, saying: “I’ve been doing MasterChef for 20 years, amateur, celebrity and professional MasterChef, and I think in that time I have worked with over 4,000 contestants of all different ages, all different backgrounds, all walks of life. “Apparently now, I’m reading in the paper, there’s been 13 complaints in that time. In the newspaper, I can see the complaints coming from a handful of middle-class women of a certain age, just from Celebrity MasterChef. This isn’t right. “In 20 years, over 20 years of television, can you imagine how many women, female contestants on MasterChef, have made sexual remarks, or sexual innuendo? Can you imagine?” Wallace went on to claim that “absolutely none” of the staff on his other shows had complained about him. He said: “Look, this is important to me. Twenty years of doing Celebrity MasterChef, amateur, professional, Eat Well for Less?, Inside the Factory. Do you know how many staff, all different sorts of staff, you imagine the people I’ve worked with. Do you know how many staff complained about me in that time? Absolutely none. Zero. Seriously.” Broadcasters respond MasterChef’s production company, Banijay UK, has launched an investigation into Wallace’s behaviour and said the 60-year-old is “committed to fully cooperating throughout the process”. It said in a statement last week: “While this review is under way, Gregg Wallace will be stepping away from his role on MasterChef and is committed to fully cooperating throughout the process. Banijay UK’s duty of care to staff is always a priority and our expectations regarding behaviour are made clear to both cast and crew on all productions, with multiple ways of raising concerns, including anonymously, clearly promoted on set.” The company said allegations had not been raised directly with it but it felt “it is appropriate to conduct an immediate external review to fully and impartially investigate”. It said anyone with issues or concerns could contact speakup@banijayuk.com in confidence. A BBC spokesperson said: “We are always clear that any behaviour which falls below the standards expected by the BBC will not be tolerated. Where an individual is contracted directly by an external production company we share any complaints or concerns with that company and we will always support them when addressing them.” A spokesperson for Channel 5, which airs Big Weekends, said: “We take any allegations of this nature extremely seriously. We have asked the production company to look into these historical claims. The health and wellbeing of everyone involved in our productions is very important to us and we want all of our productions to be safe and secure places for people to work.”"

The letter described a “pattern of behaviour” by the MasterChef presenter that “clearly fails to meet the sexual harassment and bullying standards that prohibit unwelcome sexual advances and sexual innuendo”. It was announced on Thursday that Wallace would be stepping back from his role on MasterChef while allegations of historical misconduct are investigated. An investigation by BBC News revealed that Wallace is facing allegations of inappropriate sexual comments from 13 people who worked with him over a 17-year period. Channel 5 is also looking into allegations of inappropriate behaviour by the presenter while making the programme Gregg Wallace’s Big Weekends in 2019. The 2022 letter, seen by the Observer, contained the experiences of several women, and detailed some of the allegations reported last week by the BBC, including complaints of sexualised comments and of Wallace appearing topless in front of colleagues. It was sent to the BBC four years after Wallace had already been issued with a formal warning following an HR investigation into his behaviour. It emerged last night that five years earlier, in 2017, Wallace was warned by a BBC executive that his conduct on set was “unacceptable and cannot continue”, after the broadcaster Aasmah Mir, who appeared on the 12th series of Celebrity MasterChef, complained about sexist comments Wallace had made during filming. Kate Phillips, now in charge of the BBC’s unscripted programmes, told Mir she would “make sure that a system is in place and that I am informed straight away if something like this should ever occur again”. Dawn Elrick, the director and producer who sent the 2022 letter on behalf of other women who had contacted her, said the BBC suggested each individual would have to make their own, direct complaint to the corporation. “This is very tricky for freelancers to do without identifying themselves, which makes life extremely tricky in the freelance world,” she said. “Placing the onus on individual employees/freelancers means they failed to see that I was trying to tell them there was a pattern of alleged behaviour.” Elrick, who submitted her letter with the support of industry union Bectu, had received the allegations against Wallace through her Instagram account, Shit Men in TV Have Said to Me, which has become a place for workers in the UK film and TV industry to share instances of workplace sexism and sexual harassment. She had received multiple submissions about Wallace and felt compelled to report this to the BBC. Elrick said that, soon after sending the letter, she also submitted the allegations to the BBC via Navex Global, an external whistleblowing service. She said she had received no further contact with regards to that report. Elrick said the BBC’s lack of action showed there is “no satisfactory means of reporting sexual harassment and bullying within the TV industry”. A BBC spokesperson told the Observer: “If issues are raised with us we have robust processes in place to deal with them swiftly and appropriately. We will always listen if people want to make us aware of something directly. “It would be inappropriate for us to comment on anything that could form part of Banijay’s [MasterChef’s production company] ongoing investigation or otherwise influence it.” BBC News reported last week that the 2018 internal investigation looked into allegations of “sexual jokes” and other sexualised language that reportedly made colleagues “feel uncomfortable” and concluded that aspects of Wallace’s behaviour had been “unacceptable and unprofessional”. The presenter Kirsty Wark told BBC News Wallace had told stories and jokes of a “sexualised nature” when she was a Celebrity MasterChef contestant in 2011. Rod Stewart claimed Wallace had “humiliated” his wife, Penny Lancaster, on the show in 2021. In October, Wallace posted a denial of claims that he’d talked about his sex life and taken his top off in front of a colleague to his Instagram account, saying: “I didn’t say anything sexual.” Wallace’s lawyers have said the suggestion that Wallace engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature was entirely false. On Thursday, MasterChef’s production company, Banijay UK, said it had launched an investigation after the BBC made the company aware that it had received complaints and that Wallace is “committed to fully cooperating throughout the process”.

A BBC spokesperson said: “We are always clear that any behaviour which falls below the standards expected by the BBC will not be tolerated. Where an individual is contracted directly by an external production company we share any complaints or concerns with that company and we will always support them when addressing them.” The allegations against Wallace are the latest in a line of scandals involving talent at the BBC. Professional dancers on Strictly Come Dancing faced allegations of bullying and harassment, while in August, football pundit and One Show presenter Jermaine Jenas was sacked after a female colleague raised concerns about his conduct. The newsreader Huw Edwards, who was found guilty of making indecent images of children this year, was taken off air in 2023 after allegations that he paid a teenager for sexually explicit images. The Sunday Times reported that the BBC had warned Edwards about his online conduct two years previously. In October, the BBC announced a review of its workplace culture, focusing on “preventing abuse of power and ensuring everyone at the BBC conducts themselves in line with our values”. Bectu Unscripted posted to its Instagram account on Friday: “We would urge anyone affected by the revelations to come forward in confidence … Bullying, harassment, unwanted sexual conduct or any behaviour that makes you feel uncomfortable is unacceptable.” Elrick said the existence of Instagram accounts, WhatsApp groups and Reddit forums where TV workers could share their experiences with peers “are a symptom of sexism, classism and racism within the TV industry”. “People are sick of bad behaviour and having to put up with things no one should have to put up with in the workplace because people have clout,” she said."

          "bodyText": "AI means too many (different) things to too many people. We need better ways of talking – and thinking – about it. Cue, Drew Breunig, a gifted geek and cultural anthropologist, who has come up with a neat categorisation of the technology into three use cases: gods, interns and cogs. “Gods”, in this sense, would be “super-intelligent, artificial entities that do things autonomously”. In other words, the AGI (artificial general intelligence) that OpenAI’s Sam Altman and his crowd are trying to build (at unconscionable expense), while at the same time warning that it could be an existential threat to humanity. AI gods are, Breunig says, the “human replacement use cases”. They require gigantic models and stupendous amounts of “compute”, water and electricity (not to mention the associated CO2 emissions). “Interns” are “supervised co-pilots that collaborate with experts, focusing on grunt work”. In other words, things such as ChatGPT, Claude, Llama and similar large language models (LLMs). Their defining quality is that they are meant to be used and supervised by experts. They have a high tolerance for errors because the experts they are assisting are checking their output, preventing embarrassing mistakes from going further. They do the boring work: remembering documentation and navigating references, filling in the details after the broad strokes are defined, assisting with idea generation by acting as a dynamic sounding board and much more. Finally, “cogs” are lowly machines that are optimised to perform a single task extremely well, usually as part of a pipeline or interface. Interns are mostly what we have now; they represent AI as a technology that augments human capabilities and are already in widespread use in many industries and occupations. In that sense, they are the first generation of quasi-intelligent machines with which humans have had close cognitive interactions in work settings, and we’re beginning to learn interesting things about how well those human-machine partnerships work. One area in which there are extravagant hopes for AI is healthcare. And with good reason. In 2018, for example, a collaboration between AI researchers at DeepMind and Moorfields eye hospital in London significantly speeded up the analysis of retinal scans to detect the symptoms of patients who needed urgent treatment. But in a way, though technically difficult, that was a no-brainer: machines can “read” scans incredibly quickly and pick out ones that need specialist diagnosis and treatment. But what about the diagnostic process itself, though? Cue an intriguing US study published in October in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which reported a randomised clinical trial on whether ChatGPT could improve the diagnostic capabilities of 50 practising physicians. The ho-hum conclusion was that “the availability of an LLM to physicians as a diagnostic aid did not significantly improve clinical reasoning compared with conventional resources”. But there was a surprising kicker: ChatGPT on its own demonstrated higher performance than both physician groups (those with and without access to the machine). Or, as the New York Times summarised it, “doctors who were given ChatGPT-4 along with conventional resources did only slightly better than doctors who did not have access to the bot. And, to the researchers’ surprise, ChatGPT alone outperformed the doctors.” More interesting, though, were two other revelations: the experiment demonstrated doctors’ sometimes unwavering belief in a diagnosis they had made, even when ChatGPT suggested a better one; and it also suggested that at least some of the physicians didn’t really know how best to exploit the tool’s capabilities. Which in turn revealed what AI advocates such as Ethan Mollick have been saying for aeons: that effective “prompt engineering” – knowing what to ask an LLM to get the most out of it – is a subtle and poorly understood art. Equally interesting is the effect that collaborating with an AI has on the humans involved in the partnership. Over at MIT, a researcher ran an experiment to see how well material scientists could do their job if they could use AI in their research. The answer was that AI assistance really seems to work, as measured by the discovery of 44% more materials and a 39% increase in patent filings. This was accomplished by the AI doing more than half of the “idea generation” tasks, leaving the researchers to the business of evaluating model-produced candidate materials. So the AI did most of the “thinking”, while they were relegated to the more mundane chore of evaluating the practical feasibility of the ideas. And the result: the researchers experienced a sharp reduction in job satisfaction! Interesting, n’est-ce pas? These researchers are high-flyers, not low-status operatives. But suddenly, collaborating with a smart machine made them feel like… well, cogs. And the moral? Be careful what you wish for. What I’ve been reading Chamber piece What If Echo Chambers Work? is a striking essay that highlights a liberal dilemma in the Donald Trump era. Savings plan A sharp analysis by Reuters is Mapping the Way for Elon Musk’s Efficiency Drive. Inventive thinking Steven Sinofsky’s fabulous, wise essay On the Toll of Being a Disruptor is about innovation and change."

          "headline": "Beekeepers halt honey awards over ‘huge fraud’ in global supply chain",
          "bodyText": "The World Beekeeping Awards will not award a prize for honey next year after warnings of widespread fraud in the global supply chain. Apimondia, the International Federation of Beekeepers’ Associations, says it will showcase honey from around the world at its congress in Denmark, but for the first time make no awards for the product. The decision came as beekeepers and importers face a mounting crisis over the scale of fraud, with warnings that genuine products are bulked out with cheaper sugar syrup. Some common tests to detect fraud can easily be defeated, and beekeepers say there has been a failure by food watchdogs and the industry to combat the fraudsters. Apimondia said in a statement: “We will celebrate honey in many ways at the congress, but honey will no longer be a category, and thus no honey judging, in the World Beekeeping Awards. This change to remove honey as a category was necessitated by the inability to have honey fully tested for adulteration.” The awards are typically held every two years at the congress, attended by thousands of beekeepers, scientists and industry representatives. Dozens of entries in recent honey competitions have been rejected because adulteration was suspected. About 45% of honeys were rejected at the awards in Montreal in 2019 for a variety of reasons, including suspected adulteration. At the Istanbul congress in 2022, 39 out of 145 honeys were withdrawn for suspected adulteration. The awards also has other categories, which will still be judged at next year’s competition, including beeswax, mead, innovation and publications. Jeff Pettis, the federation’s president, says the first laboratory tests for honey were introduced for the 2019 awards. Honeys which were excluded were replaced with a card stating: “This exhibit has failed laboratory analysis and cannot be judged further.” There were logistical challenges for the competition in authenticating entries and in border controls, he said. The Copenhagen congress in September 2025 would highlight the damage being done to beekeepers around the world by fraud. He said: “We are continuing to fight for improvements to the testing. We want the public to know that local honey is much less likely to be adulterated. The beekeepers get their name on it and can stand behind it.” He said there was widespread adulteration in cheaper commercial honeys. The fraud can occur at any point of the supply chain, with many importers and retailers unwittingly trading in fake honey. An EU investigation published last year found 46% of imported sampled products were suspected to be fraudulent, including all 10 from the UK. Samples used in October by the UK branch of the Honey Authenticity Network for a novel form of DNA testing found that 24 out of 25 jars from big UK retailers were suspicious. China is the world’s biggest producer of honey, but experts say it can be fraudulently blended with cheaper sugar syrup. The UK is the world’s biggest importer of Chinese honey, with more than 39,000 tons imported last year. Bernhard Heuvel, president of the European Professional Beekeepers Association, said there was overwhelming evidence of fraud in the supply chain. “It’s just unbelievable if the world organisation for all beekeepers cannot guarantee the authenticity of honey. The scale of this fraud is huge.” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, which has hives in and around London, said the UK should require importers to label the country of origin on all honey, including blends. He said: “We have to give consumers information at the point of sale that they can act on.” Importers in the UK have rejected as unreliable the hundreds of tests commissioned by campaigners and investigators on British-sold honey that suggested adulteration. Regulators in the UK have not published detailed results of official tests, but rejected claims of significant fraud. An assessment of food crime published by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in September said it was “unlikely that adulterated honey is broadly present on the UK market”, but recognised the “complexities” in making the judgment. Enid Brown, director of the World Beekeeping Awards, said: “The UK government needs to wake up to this problem of adulteration of imported honey. Until the government starts official tests on honey and publishing the results, we are never going to win.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “We take any type of food fraud very seriously. There is no place for adulterated honey which undermines consumer confidence and disadvantages responsible businesses acting within the law. “We work closely with enforcement authorities to ensure that honey sold in the UK is not subject to adulteration, meets our high standards, and maintains a level playing field between honey producers.” Andrew Quinn, head of the FSA’s National Food Crime Unit, said: “We are working closely with Defra and other government colleagues to develop conclusive testing that will be able to establish the authenticity of honey on sale.”"

          "bodyText": "Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch. In this week’s newsletter we are going hard on maps. We have a map based on a Billy Joel song, a Lego US election map and much more. For the non-map nerds (how many can there be?) there are also visuals on microplastics in the oceans, how mpox spreads and mutates, electric cars, and a beautifully illustrated scrolly. But first … a great big infrastructure map Millions of Australians in the fastest growing areas of our cities have poor access to schools, healthcare, third spaces or other basic infrastructure. As families are increasingly pushed out to the city fringes in search of affordable housing, it can take years for (often privately provided) infrastructure to catch up. Check out our map and dive into the rest of the data here. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. The sitting/standing divide Before your eyes glaze over, this isn’t about standing desks. Our former colleague Alvin Chang has created yet another beautiful interactive at the Pudding, this time exploring the divide between “sitters” (those doing mostly office jobs such as coding or legal work) and standers (restaurant servers or construction workers, etc). It’s a great interactive to play around with. And from a technical perspective, the transitions are lovely. There’s a video version you can check out too. And Alvin has written a behind-the-scenes post to explain his thinking. *** 2. The how, where and why of mpox A trigger warning that some of the beautiful illustrations in this Reuters story are a bit confronting. But this is a great visual primer on a disease that the WHO has declared a public health emergency of international concern. *** 3. Trillions and trillions of particles When we talk about big global problems like the plastics crisis, it can feel a bit abstract. This Straits Times interactive takes you on a journey from the synthetic microfibres released in your washing machine to one of the great garbage patches in the ocean. It can take between 20 and 200 years for these plastics to break down and they can be ingested by sea life, enter the food chain or release toxins as they break down. Read and see more here. *** 4. Where it makes sense to go electric It’s common to hear that electric cars are cheaper to run than their internal combustion cousins. But how cheap or environmentally friendly they are actually varies quite a bit, depending on the price and emissions intensity of energy. The Economist has developed a ranking of 122 countries. Norway, where 98% of electricity comes from renewable sources, does well on both measures. Australia is somewhere in the middle. You can read and explore more here. Spotlight on … so many amazing maps We’re coming to the end of this year’s #30DayMapChallenge, where cartography nerds create new maps every day in response to a prompt. There really are too many amazing maps, shared on too many platforms, to pick favourites. But here are a few that caught our eye on Bluesky: A 3D printing of John Snow’s famous cholera map How different map projections change the size and shape of Greenland A Lego cartogram of the US presidential election results A digital elevation recreation of a 1726 map of Formosa (now Taiwan) More than 64,000 observations of lizards and snakes in Australia (over just one year) A typographical map of the European Union A beautiful hand-drawn map based on a Billy Joel song There are so many more to choose from. We recommend checking out the #30DayMapChallenge hashtag on your social media platform of choice. Off the Charts “Scrollytelling” can be an overused device in interactive graphics these days. They can be unwieldy and often make it harder to get your head around the data. But this beautifully illustrated interactive by Badiucao is an example of just how powerful they can be. We don’t want to write too much because you really do need to read and see this story to appreciate it. The page describes Badiucao as “an Australian, a Chinese dissident and an Age cartoonist”, and this is his story.

          "headline": "Putin threatens to target Kyiv ‘decision-making centres’ with new missile after US and UK-made weapons used in Russia – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike at “decision-making centres in Kyiv” with his country’s new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) missile. Putin said officials were drawing up a list of targets, and Russia would continue combat tests of the missile Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin also boasted that Russia was producing ten times as many advanced missile system as Nato countries collectively were able to manage. He said that overnight Russia had used 90 missiles of and 100 drones to strike 17 targets in Ukraine, which he described as “military facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russia had used cluster munitions, overnight, which he described as “a very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics” Ukrainian authorities said the attacks had been aimed at energy infrastructure, and earlier today at least one million people had been left without power. Ukraine’s energy company Ukrenergo said the emergency blackouts had ended, but warned of “four rounds of blackouts” occurring before the end of the day Kyiv said on Thursday that Russian forces had shot dead five Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered in the eastern Zaporizhzhia region, marking the latest war crimes allegations levied against Moscow. Both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other’s armies of committing atrocities Putin told reporters in Kazakhstan was outraged by the assassination attempts on incoming US president Donald Trump, and he believes that the Biden administration is trying to create difficulties for Trump in US-Russian relations Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s energy company, has now warned of four rounds of power blackouts during the day. Here are some of the latest images from the conflict in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrinform, citing Khmelnytskyi regional governor Serhiy Tyurin, reports that an energy supply facility was damaged by fragments from a downed missile this morning in the region. No casualties were reported, and all power supplies were expected to be restored to normal by the evening. Vladimir Putin has been giving a press conference in Astana, which Tass has been covering on a live video stream. The Russian president has said, among other things, that: The new Oreshnik missile reaches a temperature of 4,000 degrees, and “the kinetic impact is powerful, like a meteorite falling. We know from history what meteorites fell where, and what the consequences were. Sometimes it was enough for entire lakes to form” It is unrealistic to expect Russia’s CSTO allies (Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan) to assist Russia “in any way in connection with the American weapons strikes on the Russian Federation” but Russia was prepared to protect them and the mutual defence clauses in the treaty were clear The Russian Federation is considering making drone operations a separate branch of the military He has not set conditions for peace talks with Ukraine, but has set out Russia’s position clearly. In June he said any peace deal would have to involve Ukraine giving up its aim to join Nato, and giving up full control of the four Ukrainian regions that Russia has claimed to annex on top of the 2014 annexation of Crimea He was outraged by the assassination attempts on incoming US president Donald Trump, and he believes that the Biden administration is trying to create difficulties for Trump in US-Russian relations He rejected accusations in Angela Merkel’s memoir that he had tried to scare her with his dog, and said if she came to visit Russia again he would keep dogs away from her Russia, he claimed, unlike the west, does not interfere in internal political processes in Georgia Vladimir Putin has accused Germany of using “unlawful measures” and “unacceptable” methods in its treatment of assets belonging to Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft, the Interfax news agency reported. The future of Rosneft’s German assets, which include a 54.17% stake in the PCK Schwedt refinery, is unclear after Berlin effectively took control of them. Ukrainian prosecutors have alleged that a former lawmaker embezzled more than $10million (£7.9m) in an army uniform corruption scheme, the AFP news agency reports. AFP says: The government in Kyiv, which has been plagued by corruption since the fall of the Soviet Union, is facing a new raft of graft scandals amid a surge of spending on its military as it fights Russia’s invasion. The Prosecutor General’s office said it had uncovered “a scheme to embezzle more than $10 million for the purchase of military uniforms for the Armed Forces of Ukraine”. It accused a former MP and advisor to the country’s deputy defence ministry of orchestrating the scheme in 2022, along with his son and a foreign citizen. It said the group brokered a contract to produce $25.6 million worth of army uniforms at an inflated price of more than $35 million, agreeing to divide the extra $10 million between them. The ex-MP and his son were served a notice of suspicion of “misappropriation of property by deception on a large scale”. Prosecutors did not identify the accused by name, nor say if any had been taken into custody. Kyiv said on Thursday that Russian forces had shot dead five Ukrainian soldiers who had surrendered in the eastern Zaporizhzhia region, marking the latest war crimes allegations levied against Moscow. Both Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other’s armies of committing atrocities since Russian forces launched their full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Prosecutors said the incident had taken place on 24 November near the village of Novodarivka in the Pologiv district of the Zaporizhzhia region, reports AFP. “Servicemen of the Russian armed forces shot dead five Ukrainian defenders out of six who had been taken prisoner,” a statement read. There was no immediate response to the accusations from Moscow, which claimed to have annexed Zaporizhzhia along with three other partially occupied Ukrainian territories in late 2022. Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he had contacted the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) over the allegations. The German defence ministry has said Patriot missile units could be deployed in Poland from early 2025 for up to six months, says Reuters. “With this we will protect a logistical hub in Poland which is of central importance for the delivery of materials to Ukraine,” German defence minister Boris Pistorius said. Tass, citing the local regional governor, reports that two civilians were injured in Belgorod region after a Ukrainian drone attack. It also reports that Russia’s air defences have destroyed a Ukrainian drone over Bryansk region. Ukraine’s air force said on Thursday that Russia made 12 strikes on Ukrainian targets in an overnight aerial attack which mostly targeted fuel and energy infrastructure, Reuters reports. Earlier Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, speaking in Astana, said Russia had struck 17 targets which were “military facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems.” It is 2pm in Kyiv and 3pm in Moscow. Here are the headlines … Russia’s president Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike at “decision-making centres in Kyiv” with his country’s new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) missile. Putin said officials were drawing up a list of targets, and Russia would continue combat tests of the missile Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin also boasted that Russia was producing ten times as many advanced missile system as Nato countries collectively were able to manage. He said that overnight Russia had used 90 missiles of and 100 drones to strike 17 targets in Ukraine, which he described as “military facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russia had used cluster munitions, overnight, which he described as “a very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics” Ukrainian authorities said the attacks had been aimed at energy infrastructure, and earlier today at least one million people had been left without power. Ukraine’s energy company Ukrenergo said the emergency blackouts had ended, but warned of “three rounds of blackouts” occurring before the end of the day Russia’s air defence systems destroyed 25 Ukrainian drones overnight over four regions, the defence ministry said on Thursday. It also claimed to have intercepted a Neptune guided missile Russian authorities in Kursk have opened a criminal case against Ukrainian service personnel after two civilians were injured in a drone attack on vehicles on Wednesday Here are some images from Ukraine of the aftermath of the overnight Russian attack. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that, while the earlier emergency blackouts have ended, Ukraine’s energy company Ukrenergo has said it still expects there to be “three rounds of blackouts” until the end of the day, warning that “the time of application and the amount of restrictions may change during the day”. Reuters is carrying fuller quotes now from Vladimir Putin’s speech in Kazakhstan, where he threatened the use of the new Oreshnik missile on Kyiv. It quotes the Russian president saying: Of course, we will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory with long-range western-made missiles, as has already been said, including by possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions, as was done on 21 November. At present, the ministry of defence and the general staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory. These could be military facilities, defence and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centres in Kyiv. Putin is attending the Collective Security Treaty Organization summit in Astana, a grouping which includes Armenia, Belarus, hosts Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan alongside Russia. During his appearance at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin said that overnight 17 targets within Ukraine were struck. Tass quotes Putin saying: Tonight we carried out a comprehensive strike using 90 missiles of similar classes and 100 drones. We hit 17 targets: military facilities, defence industry facilities and their support systems. Ukrainian authorities said the attacks had been aimed at energy infrastructure, and that earlier on Thursday at least one million people had been left without power after the attack caused emergency blackouts. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed that Russia had used cluster munitions, which he described as “a very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics.” Russia and Ukraine have agreed to return to each other a total of nine children to be reunited with family members, according to a senior Russian official. Reuters reports that Russia’s commissioner for children, Maria Lvova-Belova, said on Thursday that six boys and one girl, aged six to 16, were being returned to relatives in Ukraine. She added that Qatari mediation had also enabled the repatriation of two young Russian boys, aged seven and nine, from Ukraine. In March 2023 the international criminal court issued a warrant for the arrest of Lvova-Belova, alongside president Vladimir Putin, after a panel of judges agreed that there were “reasonable grounds” to believe they bore responsibility for the “unlawful deportation” of Ukrainian children. The UK’s ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has accused Russia of creating “a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine” and called recent attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure “deeply concerning.” In a speech delivered in Vienna on Thursday, Neil Holland said: Over the past month, Russia has intensified its airstrikes, primarily targeting energy infrastructure causing rolling blackouts in several regions. Last night’s attacks were the latest in a series. As winter approaches and temperatures plummet, this additional strain on the energy grid is deeply concerning and will disproportionately affect the vulnerable, including the elderly and frail. Repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure and restrictions on aid delivery have exacerbated the suffering of vulnerable populations. The suffering in Ukraine cannot be ignored. It is our collective responsibility to act decisively to alleviate this humanitarian crisis. Reuters reports a Russian court sentenced a defence lawyer, Dmitry Talantov, who is 63 and has represented critics of Moscow’s war in Ukraine, to seven years in prison. Talantov was accused of writing Facebook posts which condemned the actions of Russian soldiers in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has boasted that Russia produces ten times more missiles than all of the Nato countries combined, and threatened an attack on decision-making centres in Kyiv with its new intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) missile. Appearing at the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) summit in Astana, Putin spoke about the capabilities of the Oreshnik missile. He said that Russia had been forced to deploy the new missile “in response to the enemy’s actions” – a reference to the use of US and UK manufactured missiles inside Russian territory – and that there were “no analogues to the Russian Oreshnik in the world”. He said western equivalents would not appear any time soon. In the event of a massive use of the Oreshnik, the force of the strike will be comparable to a nuclear weapon, he said. He said decision-making centres in Kyiv could become a target for the Oreshnik missile, and pointed out that Ukraine has launched multiple attacks against Moscow and St Petersburg. Ukraine carried out its biggest drone strike on Moscow earlier this month. US and UK sources indicated to the Guardian last week that they believed the Oreshnik missile fired on Dnipro was an experimental nuclear-capable, intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which has a theoretical range of below 3,420 miles (5,500km). That is enough to reach Europe from where it was fired in south-western Russia, but not the US. Tass reports that in Kazakhstan, Putin also said that other new missile systems could appear and that Russia will continue combat tests of the Oreshnik. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that emergency power blackouts in the country have ended. This does not mean that everybody will remain with power for the rest of the day. Ukrenergo announced that “all customers return to hourly outage schedules”. Tass reports that Russia claims it shot down one of Ukraine’s Neptune guided missiles overnight. Ukraine’s air force has claimed it shot down 79 out of 91 missiles fired by Russian, and downed 35 out of 97 drones, Reuters reports. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed that Russia used cluster munitions in a massive strike at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure overnight, describing it as “a very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics.” Ukraine’s president, in a message posted to Telegram, said that about 100 drones and 90 missiles were involved in the attack, adding: In several regions, Kalibr strikes with cluster munitions were recorded, specifically on civilian infrastructure. These cluster parts make it much more difficult for our rescuers and energy workers to eliminate the consequences of the impact, and this is a very vile escalation of Russian terrorist tactics. Earlier authorities in Ukraine reported that at least one million people were without power. Missile debris was reported at two locations in Kyiv, but local authorities claimed that air defences intercepted all of the missiles fired at the capital. Many other regions reported strikes. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s appeal for better air defences in his message, saying: Each such attack proves that air defence systems are needed now in Ukraine, where they save lives, and not in storage bases. This is especially important in the winter, when we have to protect our infrastructure from targeted Russian strikes. We are constantly working with partners to have more power to defend and timely delivery now and full implementation of agreements particularly on air defense is what is most needed. Ukraine disconnected several nuclear power units from the network amid Russian attacks on energy infrastructure on Thursday, a Ukrainian energy industry source told Reuters. This map from our interactive team shows the location of Ukraine’s three operational nuclear power plants, along with the Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since nearly the very beginning of the invasion, and the location of Chernobyl, site of the accident in 1986. Reuters reports that a source in Ukraine’s energy industry told it that overnight Russia struck infrastructure with “a hard blow”, and claimed cluster munitions were deployed. The claims have not been independently verified. In Russia, Tass reports that authorities in Kursk have opened a criminal case against Ukrainian service personnel after two civilians were injured in a drone attack on vehicles on Wednesday. “During the preliminary investigation, all representatives of the armed formations of Ukraine involved in this crime will be identified and brought to justice as provided by law,” the main military investigation department said. Ukraine launched in incursion into Kursk in August. At least one million people are without power across Ukraine after a large Russian overnight missile attack on energy infrastructure in the country. Reuters reports that three regions in the west are affected by the power outages. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Ukraine’s western region, reported energy infrastructure attacks there, and said more than half a million people in the region were without power. Missiles were detected overnight headed for Kharkiv, Odesa and eight other regions Missile debris was reported at two locations in Kyiv, but local authorities claimed that air defences intercepted all of the missiles fired at the capital. Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported damage to property but no casualties. The national power grid operator Ukrenergo had “urgently introduced emergency power cuts”, said the energy minister, German Galushchenko. The temperature in Kyiv was not expected to rise above 2C (35.6F) today. Russia’s ministry of defence claimed to have destroyed 25 Ukrainian drones overnight in four regions, including the Moscow-annexed Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014. Reuters has a quick snap that there are power cuts in Ukraine’s southern region of Mykolaiv as a result of Russia’s missile attack. It cited regional governor Vitaliy Kim. Zhitomir and Chernihiv region have ended their air alarms in Ukraine. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Ukraine’s western Lviv region, reports on the Telegram app that energy infrastructure in the region has been attacked by Russia Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has posted to Telegram to report that debris from a rocket has hit a private business in Darnytskyi district in south-east of the city. He reported there were no casualties, but that damage was caused. Russia’s air defence systems destroyed 25 Ukrainian drones overnight over four regions, the defence ministry said on Thursday, Reuters reports. Fourteen of the drones were destroyed over the Krasnodar region, six over the Bryansk region, three over Moscow-annexed Crimea and two over the Rostov region, it said. Krasnodar’s regional governor, Veniamin Kondratyev, wrote on Telegram that two districts in the southern Russian region were subjected to a “massive drone attack” overnight. One civilian was injured, he said. A senior UN official, Rosemary DiCarlo, this month denounced the rise in civilian casualties in the nearly three-year conflict between Ukraine and Russia, noting Moscow’s targeting of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure may make this winter the “harshest since the start of the war”. The latest missile salvo from Russia comes a day after US president-elect Donald Trump named staunch loyalist and retired general Keith Kellogg as his Ukraine envoy, charged with ending the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s energy grid has been heavily targeted since Russia invaded in February 2022, with Kyiv accusing Moscow of “terror” tactics by trying to plunge Ukrainian cities into darkness and cut off heating to civilians throughout the winter, writes AFP. The overnight strikes come after two weeks of dramatic escalation that has seen both sides launch new weapons to gain an upper hand ahead of Donald Trump being inaugurated as US president in January. Russia earlier this week said it was preparing its own retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on its territory using US-supplied Atacms missiles. Ukraine has launched at least three attacks on Russian border regions with the missiles since the White House gave it permission to fire them on Russian territory. Moscow responded to the first strike by firing a never-before-seen hypersonic ballistic missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. In an angry address to the nation, Russian president Vladimir Putin warned the nuclear-capable missile could be used against western countries if they let their arms be used by Ukraine to hit Russia. Ukraine’s military said earlier Thursday that an air raid alert had been declared across the country “due to a missile threat” in a message on Telegram. Missiles were detected headed for Kharkiv, Odesa and eight other regions, according to other messages from the air force. “Kharkiv, go to the shelters!” it warned. Oleg Synegubov, head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said on Telegram that three strikes had hit Kharkiv’s Kyivskyi district, with no casualties reported so far. The mayor of Lutsk in northwestern Ukraine, Igor Polishchuk, said that “explosions were heard again” in the city. Explosions were heard in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi, Kharkiv, Rivne and Lutsk on Thursday morning amid reports of a Russian cruise missile attack, Ukrainian news outlets Zerkalo Tyzhnya and Suspilne said. “Energy infrastructure is once again targeted by the enemy’s massive strike,” said the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko. The Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said: “The enemy continues to attack Kharkiv with missiles. The Odesa regional governor, Oleh Kiper, urged residents to stay in shelter. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said air defence was at work. The national power grid operator Ukrenergo had “urgently introduced emergency power cuts”, said the energy minister, German Galushchenko, as temperatures across the country dropped to around freezing. One energy supplier, DTEK, said Ukrenergo was introducing emergency power outages in the regions of Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipro and Donetsk. Hello, this is the Guardian’s live coverage of Russia’s war against Ukraine. This Thursday morning, Ukraine has come under widespread air raids, with a national alert issued and officials saying the country’s energy infrastructure is once again the Kremlin’s target. More of that to come, but for now, here’s a summary from our Ukraine war briefing of other major developments: A senior official in Joe Biden’s administration has told the Associated Press that the US is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and lowering the conscription age to as young as 18 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available. The Biden administration is preparing another urgent weapons package for Ukraine, this time worth $725m, two US officials said on Wednesday. It is predicted to include landmines, drones, Stinger anti-air missiles, and Himars ammunition, including GMLRS rockets with cluster warheads. The formal notification to Congress of the weapons package could come as soon as Monday, one official said. Ukrainian forces made a “complex drone and missile strike” against Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Wednesday, targeting the Belbek military airfield and a naval school, according to Russian and Crimean sources cited by the Institute for the Study of War. The attack reportedly used Ukraine’s homegrown Neptune cruise missiles, Soviet-style S200 missiles, western-provided Storm Shadow missiles, 40 strike drones and unspecified ballistic missiles. The US-based thinktank suggested it bolstered the case for the “provision of long-range strike weapons to Ukrainian forces”. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due on Thursday to sign Ukraine’s 2025 budget, which calls for the country’s first wartime tax increases. The finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said Ukraine hoped tax increases would generate additional budget revenues of 141bn hryvnia (US$3.39bn). The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said record sums would be directed to weapons production and purchases including modernising Ukraine’s defence industry and buying drones. There was no word on whether South Korea will supply arms to Ukraine after Kyiv’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, met with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, in Seoul on Wednesday. Yoon’s office said the two sides agreed to continue to share information on North Korean troops in Russia and North Korean-Russian weapons and technology transfers, while closely coordinating with the US. Umerov briefed other South Korean officials on the status of the Russia-Ukraine war and expressed hope that Kyiv and Seoul would strengthen cooperation, the statement said. Umerov predicted a “tangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions”. Russia’s rouble has plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions, Pjotr Sauer writes. Donald Trump has picked Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia – a newly conceived role given the ongoing war, Gloria Oladipo writes. Kellogg served as a national security adviser to the former vice-president Mike Pence, then acting security adviser to Trump himself after Michael Flynn had to resign. Kellogg has said he would emphasise getting the two countries to the negotiating table. Russia’s sabotage of western targets may prompt Nato to consider invoking its article 5 mutual defence clause, Bruno Kahl, head of Germany’s foreign intelligence service, has warned. The BND chief, speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, said he expected Moscow to further step up its hybrid warfare. Nordic and Baltic states and Poland said on Wednesday that they would in the coming months step up support for Ukraine, including to its defence industry, and invest in making more ammunition available. “We are committed to strengthening our deterrence, and defence, including resilience, against conventional as well as hybrid attacks, and to expanding sanctions against Russia as well as against those who enable Russia’s aggression,” the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Sweden said in a statement. The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, called for more defence spending in Europe over the next five years, as her top team was voted in by a wafer-thin majority in the European parliament. The EU faces acute challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump and the climate crisis, all against a backdrop of deepening fears of economic decline as von der Leyen starts her second term. Poland said on Wednesday that it had detained a German citizen and charged the suspect with brokering and exporting dual-use goods to Russia. The German citizen traded in specialist machines used in the technological industry, which – through his company – were illegally sent to Russian military plants involved in the production of weapons, said the Internal Security Agency (Isa). “The suspect pleaded guilty and filed a motion for voluntary submission to punishment.” Vladimir Putin arrived in Kazakhstan on Wednesday. Kazakhstan is a member of the Moscow-led CSTO security alliance but has expressed concern about the Ukraine war, which the Kazakh president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has refused to condone. Kazakhstan is also working to detour away from Russia as a route for its oil export, using Turkey instead."

          "headline": "Thursday briefing: The Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire brings respite – but for how long, and what comes next?",
          "bodyText": "Good morning. At 4am local time on Wednesday, a ceasefire began between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon’s devastated south were already on their way back, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there. The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian’s William Christou, as he returned from a reporting trip to the southern border, about what he saw and what comes next. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Assisted dying | The former president of the supreme court, who ruled on the most high-profile assisted dying cases, has declared his support for the law change. David Neuberger’s intervention came as MPs backing the bill say they believe they have the numbers for Friday’s historic vote to pass. UK news | Police believe Mohamed Al Fayed may have raped and abused more than 111 women over nearly four decades, with his youngest victim said to have been 13 years old. The Metropolitan police said that five unnamed individuals were being investigated for facilitating the offences. Ukraine | Ukraine’s power infrastructure was “under massive enemy attack” on Thursday, the country’s energy minister said, after a nationwide air raid alert was declared due to incoming missiles. Weather | The third named storm of the autumn, Conall, has brought more disruption to the UK, with trains cancelled in parts of southern England on Wednesday and the Met Office warning of delays on roads and potential power cuts. Trade | Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by US president-elect Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Possible retaliatory measures are under consideration after Trump said one of his first executive orders would be a 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico. In depth: Tackling mass displacement and destruction with meagre resources William Christou set off from Beirut to the devastated port city of Tyre at 7am yesterday. You can read about his visit here. The drive usually takes just over an hour: this time, it was twice as long. “There were jubilant scenes on the highway,” he said. “There were people clapping, cars with mattresses on top, a minority waving Hezbollah flags. There was a sense of excitement at going home.” Later, the traffic intensified: the BBC’s Hugo Bachega reported that the drive from Beirut to Sidon, the first major city on the coast south of Beirut, took more than four hours instead of the usual 20 minutes. But on a tour of areas near the border organised by Hezbollah later in the day, a grimmer reality presented itself. About 6km from the border, William saw two dogs eating the corpse of a dead horse in an otherwise deserted village, Silaa. In a nearby town, Zibqeen, two sisters called Zeinab and Dina, aged 19 and 28, said that they had started driving at 3am. “They were excited to make the journey, but sad for those who had died, and for the damage that has been done,” William said. “Their house had been destroyed.” *** The return | Many will have to stay in shelters At least 1.2 million Lebanese people have fled their homes since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel began. About 96,000 Israelis have been displaced on the Israeli side of the border. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than a fifth of internally displaced people in Lebanon are in collective shelters and more than a third are children. Yesterday, Lebanese parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri told those forced to flee: “I invite you to return to your homes … return to your land.” But the Lebansese government and military, as well as the Israeli military, have warned people not to rush back to war-torn areas. And it is likely that most of those going home are realistic about the fact that they will not be able to stay there, William said. “They are mostly just checking on their houses – many of them will be gone, and there may be unexploded bombs.” The Lebanese Real Estate Authority warned that bombs, weapons and booby-traps could still be in and around people’s homes, and urged the authorities to conduct a thorough survey before people are given the green light. “So they will still need to be housed elsewhere, whether that’s in shelters or with relatives,” William said. “The internal displacement crisis will continue.” *** The reconstruction | A huge task with few resources More than 100,000 homes have been destroyed in southern Lebanon, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The destruction is most intense in the border area, which Israel has been attempting to clear out to prevent cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in the future: an NBC News investigation using satellite data found that 42% of buildings in areas seized by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been destroyed. Water and electricity supplies have widely been cut off, as well. There were some nascent signs of a reconstruction effort yesterday, William said, with excavators arriving, rubble being removed and roads being cleared. “But it’s not clear how the work can be done on a large scale.” Lebanon has been in the grip of corruption and an economic crisis for years, and is virtually a failed state, while Hezbollah, which has long effectively ruled much of the south, has been vastly weakened by Israel’s onslaught. After the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, “the Gulf states [and] Russia put money in. It’s not clear if they’re interested this time.” Meanwhile, an international summit in Paris last month secured about $1bn in reconstruction pledges from international donors. But a World Bank report two weeks ago estimated the damage and loss from the conflict so far to be about $8.5bn. Lebanon’s GDP is $20.1bn. *** Hezbollah | Claims of victory undermined by severity of losses Hezbollah might once have been expected to fill much of that gap, perhaps using resources funnelled from its Iranian sponsors. That appears less likely this time. Yesterday, William asked Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah how it would be involved in reconstruction efforts: “He answered in vagaries. He couldn’t say how long it would take.” Despite the vast losses it has suffered, with all of its senior leadership killed, including secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, and its capacity to wage war vastly diminished, Hezbollah has sought to present the ceasefire as a victory. “The new secretary general, Naim Qassem, made a speech recently saying that it’s going to be Hezbollah cleaning up the roads and coordinating the work,” William said. “They say they’re not going anywhere.” But whether they will retain the support they have long enjoyed among a section of Lebanon’s population is not clear. One image in particular, which summarised how much they have been weakened, stuck with William: “In 2000, Nasrallah gave a famous speech to a huge crowd at the Bint Jbeil stadium after the Israelis withdrew from south Lebanon. We went there, and there’s still a little memorial where he stood. Hassan Fadlallah spoke in the same place with an audience of a dozen journalists and empty stands covered in wreckage. He declared victory, and it rang hollow.” *** The Lebanese army | A new role – but a very weak force In theory, the Lebanese army will now be taking charge of the south of the country, and the ceasefire calls for a deployment of 5,000 troops. Yesterday, former Lebanese army general Khalil Helou described the ceasefire as a chance for the army to “assert itself”, and added: “It’s not only a matter of hope, it’s a matter of taking responsibility.” The army lacks the cohesion and support it may need to take a more commanding role. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s economic crisis has left the army denuded of resources, and at least for now it has no significant presence in the south. “It was telling that this tour was organised by Hezbollah, not the army,” William said. “No one was manning the army checkpoints. And Unifil [the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon] says that it can’t always coordinate patrols with the army because they don’t have gas for their vehicles. Soldiers are paid about $100 [£79] a month.” *** What happens next | Anxiety about whether the ceasefire will hold The ceasefire has been agreed for 60 days. In theory, it should then lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities. “But there is a lot of apprehension in Lebanon about whether the 60 days will hold,” William said. “That’s not so much on the Hezbollah side: they have their tail between their legs, and they’re not in a position to fight.” But Israel has reserved its right to respond to military activity on the ground, and the IDF said that warning shots were fired yesterday to dissuade suspected Hezbollah operatives in border areas. “The worry is: if Israel sees weapons being transported and launches a drone strike, would Hezbollah then respond? It will be quieter in the short term, no doubt. But in the long term, Hezbollah is going to want to rebuild, and to return to a scenario where it is able, despite an agreement that says otherwise, to operate freely.” As for the wider picture in the region: in this analysis piece, the Guardian’s senior international correspondent Julian Borger writes that Israeli domestic politics mean that “the ceasefire in Lebanon arguably makes it less likely that an agreement can be struck in Gaza”. For now, at least, the prospects for real stability at Israel’s borders look remote. What else we’ve been reading A meat market in central London which has been operating for more than 800 years is being shut down. Caroline Davies spoke to shocked workers about the closure of the Smithfield site. Nimo You might know that famous portrait of Samuel Beckett, staring straight down the lens of the camera; photographer John Haynes’ favourite, detailed in this week’s My Best Shot column (and pictured above), is a different one. Unsurprisingly, Beckett was petrifying. Archie In this week’s edition of The Long Wave, Nesrine Malik spoke with the Guardian’s South America correspondent, Tiago Rogero, about Brazil’s Black Consciousness Day, a celebration that goes back decades but has finally been given formal recognition as a national holiday. Nimo There are few better British writers on public transport than Jonn Elledge, and his column about prosecutions of rail passengers for fare evasion over trivial sums, and why the problem eventually comes back to central government, is excellent. Although it might also drive you mad. Archie Donald Trump has spent much of the last year talking and thinking about retribution. Now that he’s in about to take office, New York magazine’s Kerry Howley takes a look at what it could mean in reality for those on the president-elect’srevenge list. Nimo Sport Champions League | Goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo, and a penalty save by Caoimhín Kelleher from Kylian Mbappé, helped Liverpool to a 2-0 victory over Real Madrid. Morgan Rogers’ late goal was ruled out for a foul, a decision Ollie Watkins and Unai Emery both felt was unfair on the hosts, in Aston Villa’s goalless draw with Juventus. Cricket | Shoaib Bashir took four wickets as England held New Zealand to 319-8 in the first innings of the first Test in Christchurch. Kane Williamson top scored with 93 for the hosts, who had been going well at 199-3 before a flurry of wickets for a sometimes sloppy England. Football | The Football Association is investigating allegations that the referee David Coote discussed giving a yellow card before a game. The allegations centre on messages Coote exchanged with a friend before and after he refereed the Championship game between Leeds and West Brom in October 2019, in which he booked the Leeds defender Ezgjan Alioski. The front pages The Guardian’s splash is “Police investigate more than 100 claims of rape and abuse by Fayed”, while the Daily Mirror has “Harrods scandal – Cops target Fayed Al Fayed ‘network’”. “Cameron U-turns on dying bill ‘to end pain’” says the Times, while the i leads with “Prisoner early release ‘puts public at risk’ from violent sex offenders”. “Kemi: Britain is NOT a hotel … it’s our home” is the top story in the Daily Mail while the version in the Telegraph is “Badenoch: Tories failed on migration”. The Express has a farm inheritance tax story: “You are stealing our children’s future and destroying the hard work of generations before us”. The Financial Times splashes on news of a possible collapse of prime minister Michel Barnier’s government in Paris: “Doubts over Barnier’s future prompt sell-off in French bonds and stocks”.

It was a real challenge to balance the business with family life, as the pair worked 15-hour days and had no relatives living near them in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. But they discovered an unexpected solution through their local community. Along with three other families who also had no extended family nearby, they formed a supportive “village” to help raise each other’s children together. As the restaurant grew, earning industry awards along the way, the family’s dynamics transformed. Kazuki found a better work-life balance, and he is now closer to his children than ever. “I love serving fine-dining to my customers, but I cherish making home-style food for my family too,” he writes. “I love that my children get excited thinking about what to eat”.

          "bodyText": "With eight out of 12 productions written by Australians, the Sydney Theatre Company (STC) will present a 2025 season rich with homegrown voices offering fresh perspectives on the unresolved legacies of colonisation, the complexities of love and the pursuit of truth and equality. Audiences can expect a program that speaks to our contemporary moment with urgency and humanity. Themes of love, family, justice and identity are explored through the lens of the past and the present in Picnic at Hanging Rock; The Dictionary of Lost Words; Bloom; RBG: Of Many, One; The Talented Mr. Ripley; Whitefella Yella Tree; The Shiralee; and Congratulations, Get Rich! (恭喜发财, 人日快乐), with each production showcasing the diversity of Australian talent. Writer, actor, Sydney Theatre Company resident director and proud Noongar man Ian Michael, will direct Picnic at Hanging Rock. Writer, actor, STC resident director and proud Noongar man Ian Michael, who will direct Picnic at Hanging Rock, has dedicated his artistic career to the dynamics of live performance. “For me, most of my career has been in theatre,” he says. “I have an enormous appreciation and love for it. Its ephemeral nature captivates me, and I believe it’s what also captivates audiences.” In an era dominated by screen culture that brings entertainment into living rooms, live theatre offers something more thrilling and shared. “The energy of theatre, its unpredictability, contributes to an experience that the screen can’t replicate,” Michael says. “In theatre, everyone – the audience, the performers, the creative team – must be fully present. The stakes are much higher. It’s a dynamic of spontaneity, community and expression, all coming together and happening live.” Words and people; STC is dedicated to Australian culture STC’s theatre makers might have international reputations, but the company is indelibly rooted in the uniqueness and diversity of Australia. Such a strong cultural identity requires the nurturing of Australian artists to create a theatre environment that listens as deeply as it tells its stories. “At STC, we are always trying to prompt meaningful dialogues with audiences,” Michael says. “I’m so excited and grateful for the opportunities I’ve had here. I’m being challenged as an artist and invited to engage in active listening and truth telling.” In 2022, Michael was named the Richard Wherrett fellow at STC, and has since directed Constellations in 2023 and Stolen in 2024 for the company. He is now a resident director. “As a Noongar man, I carry the profound responsibility to contribute to this company that works to prioritise the development of First Nations work and the work of emerging artists,” Michael says. “I love being part of an institution that cultivates inclusive conversations.” Pertame and Tiwi actor Joseph Althouse stars in Whitefella Yella Tree, Sydney Theatre Company. A commitment to diverse and original voices is the very thing that makes theatre meaningful and vibrant across time, Michael says. “When you nurture new artists, you renew the understanding and appreciation of theatre. For me, it is an absolute privilege to champion authenticity and representation.” For Michael, two crucial elements make for outstanding theatre. “The plays are all very much about words and people,” he says. “There is so much incredible Australian writing; I see what I do as creating a chamber for all these words. The audience receives them, takes them in and is affected internally and externally.” A story you only think you know In a highlight of the 2025 program, Michael will take on one of Australia’s most enduring stories, Picnic at Hanging Rock, adapted for the stage by Tom Wright from Joan Lindsay’s classic novel. This tale has evolved beyond literature into cultural myth, and Wright’s adaptation reshapes it for audiences who think they know the story of the vanished schoolgirls and teacher. Kirsty Marillier and Olivia De Jonge star alongside each other in Sydney Theatre Company’s Picnic at Hanging Rock. “As artists, we are constantly asking ourselves: why this play, why this story now?” Michael says. “This adaptation invites audiences into a world that is rich in history and is so alluring, yet compels us to ask: what are the consequences of disrupting sacred land? “At its core, Picnic is grappling with identity. There is a line in the play, ‘Everything is a colony in 1900’; it says everything about the complexity of storytelling in this country.” The 2025 season promises audiences immersive experiences in stories that reveal our collective troubles and joys. As Michael says: “This is the kind of theatre that makes you want to lean in to listen, because we must listen.” Experience a season of Australian storytelling live on stage in 2025.

          "bodyText": "A senior official in Joe Biden’s administration has told the Associated Press that the US is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and lowering the conscription age to as young as 18. The official, speaking to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilisation age from 25 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available. The Biden administration is preparing another urgent weapons package for Ukraine, this time worth $725m, two US officials said on Wednesday. It is predicted to include land mines, drones, Stinger anti-air missiles, and Himars ammunition, including GMLRS rockets with cluster warheads. The formal notification to Congress of the weapons package could come as soon as Monday, one official said. It is much more than the US president’s recent use of his presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which allows him to use weapons stocks to help allies in an emergency. Recent PDA announcements have typically ranged from $125m to $250 million. Biden has an estimated $4bn to $5bn in PDA already authorised by Congress that he could use before Donald Trump takes over on 20 January. Ukrainian forces made a “complex drone and missile strike” against Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Wednesday, targeting the Belbek military airfield and a naval school, according to Russian and Crimean sources cited by the Institute for the Study of War. The attack reportedly used Ukraine’s homegrown Neptune cruise missiles, Soviet-style S200 missiles, western-provided Storm Shadow missiles, 40 strike drones and unspecified ballistic missiles. The US-based thinktank said: “ISW continues to assess that the provision of long-range strike weapons to Ukrainian forces will allow Ukrainian forces to augment their existing long-range strike capabilities and scale up the effects Ukraine can generate through long-range strikes against Russian rear areas.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due on Thursday to sign Ukraine’s 2025 budget, which calls for the country’s first wartime tax increases. The finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, said Ukraine hoped tax increases would generate additional budget revenues of 141bn hryvnia (US$3.39bn). The prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said record sums would be directed to weapons production and purchases including modernising Ukraine’s defence industry and buying drones. There was no word on whether South Korea will supply arms to Ukraine after Kyiv’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, met with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, in Seoul on Wednesday. Yoon’s office said the two sides agreed to continue to share information on North Korean troops in Russia and North Korean-Russian weapons and technology transfers, while closely coordinating with the US. Umerov briefed other South Korean officials on the status of the Russia-Ukraine war and expressed hope that Kyiv and Seoul would strengthen cooperation, the statement said. Umerov predicted a “tangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions”. Russia’s rouble has plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions, Pjotr Sauer writes. Donald Trump has picked Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia – a newly conceived role given the ongoing war, Gloria Oladipo writes. Kellogg served as a national security adviser to the former vice-president Mike Pence, then acting security adviser to Trump himself after Michael Flynn had to resign. Kellogg has said he would emphasise getting the two countries to the negotiating table. Russia’s sabotage of western targets may prompt Nato to consider invoking its article 5 mutual defence clause, Bruno Kahl, head of Germany’s foreign intelligence service, has warned. The BND chief, speaking in Berlin on Wednesday, said he expected Moscow to further step up its hybrid warfare. Nordic and Baltic states and Poland said on Wednesday that they would in the coming months step up support for Ukraine, including to its defence industry, and invest in making more ammunition available. “We are committed to strengthening our deterrence, and defence, including resilience, against conventional as well as hybrid attacks, and to expanding sanctions against Russia as well as against those who enable Russia’s aggression,” the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Sweden said in a statement. The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, called for more defence spending in Europe over the next five years, as her top team was voted in by a wafer-thin majority in the European parliament. The EU faces acute challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump and the climate crisis, all against a backdrop of deepening fears of economic decline as von der Leyen starts her second term. Poland said on Wednesday that it had detained a German citizen and charged the suspect with brokering and exporting dual-use goods to Russia. The German citizen traded in specialist machines used in the technological industry, which – through his company – were illegally sent to Russian military plants involved in the production of weapons, said the Internal Security Agency (ISA). “The suspect pleaded guilty and filed a motion for voluntary submission to punishment.” Vladimir Putin arrived in Kazakhstan on Wednesday. Kazakhstan is a member of the Moscow-led CSTO security alliance but has expressed concern about the Ukraine war, which the Kazakh president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has refused to condone. Kazakhstan is also working to detour away from Russia as a route for its oil export, using Turkey instead."

          "bodyText": "This live coverage is ending now, thanks for following along. You can read the latest on Democrats winning a California house seat here: Democrat Derek Tran ousted Republican Michelle Steel in a southern California House district Wednesday that was specifically drawn to give Asian Americans a stronger voice on Capitol Hill. Steel said in a statement: “Like all journeys, this one is ending for a new one to begin.” When she captured the seat in 2020, Steel joined Washington state Democrat Marilyn Strickland and California Republican Young Kim as the first Korean American women elected to Congress. Tran, a lawyer and worker rights advocate and the son of Vietnamese refugees, declared victory earlier this week. He said his win “is a testament to the spirit and resilience of our community. As the son of Vietnamese refugees, I understand firsthand the journey and sacrifices many families in our district have made for a better life.” President Joe Biden’s administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and revamping its mobilization laws to allow for the conscription of those as young as 18, the Associated Press reports. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private consultations, said Wednesday that the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilization age to 18 from the current age of 25 to expand the pool of fighting-age men available to help a badly outnumbered Ukraine in its nearly three-year-old war with Russia. The official said “the pure math” of Ukraine’s situation now is that it needs more troops in the fight. Currently Ukraine is not mobilizing or training enough soldiers to replace its battlefield losses while keeping pace with Russia’s growing military, the official added. A bill that would accomplish Donald Trump’s goal of abolishing the federal Department of Education has been introduced into the US Senate. The Republican senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota introduced the bill, called the Returning Education to Our States Act, on Thursday. If passed, the bill would see $200bn in funding and the work of the education department redistributed to other federal agencies and states. “The federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and it’s long past time to end this bureaucratic department that causes more harm than good,” Rounds said in a statement announcing the bill. He added: “For years, I’ve worked toward removing the federal Department of Education. I’m pleased that president-elect Trump shares this vision, and I’m excited to work with him and Republican majorities in the Senate and House to make this a reality. This legislation is a roadmap to eliminating the federal Department of Education by practically rehoming these federal programs in the departments where they belong, which will be critical as we move into next year.” Major responsibilities of the Department of Education would be rerouted to other offices: the administration of federal student loans would become the responsibility of the treasury department; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which enforces protections for the 7.5 million students with special needs, would fall under the Department of Health and Human Services; the Fulbright-Hays Program would be overseen by the Department of State. US President Joe Biden’s administration is preparing a $725m weapons package for Ukraine, two US officials told Reuters on Wednesday, as the outgoing president seeks to bolster the government in Kyiv before leaving office in January. According to an official familiar with the plan, the Biden administration plans to provide a variety of anti-tank weapons from US stocks to blunt Russia’s advancing troops, including landmines, drones, Stinger missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). Today So Far Thanks for joining us so far today. Here are some of the top headlines we’ve covered: The Associated Press called two more House races, leaving only one congressional race undecided. Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, won reelection in her district in Iowa; while Democrat Derek Tran won his race in California’s 45th congressional district, beating incumbent Michelle Steel. Canada and Mexico have begun considering retaliatory tariffs they may levy on certain items from the United States should Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods. Several Trump appointees were confirmed to have been targets of bomb threats at their homes on Wednesday. The FBI confirmed it is investigating the threats. Those targeted include: Pete Hegseth, Matt Gaetz, Elise Stefanik, Howard Lutnick and Lee Zeldin. House speaker Mike Johnson said he would host a meeting with Republican lawmakers and the two leaders of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to discuss government cuts next week. A lawsuit was dismissed against Fox News brought by Ray Epps, a Donald Trump supporter who became the subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory about the January 6 attack and sued the outlet for defamation. Democrats are criticizing Kamala Harris’s campaign for failing to critically analyze her loss and any missteps she made. Mark Zuckerberg joined Donald Trump for a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago this afternoon, the New York Times reports. Although the Facebook founder did not back Trump, Zuckerberg called the president-elect in July after the first assassination attempt. Not long after, Zuckerberg called Trump’s response to the attempt on his life “badass” on a podcast. Zuckerberg joined a host of tech leaders who reached out to Trump in the days leading up to the election. Canada has begun considering retaliatory tariffs it may levy on certain items from the United States should Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian goods, the Associated Press reports. The senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Canada is preparing for every eventuality, but stressed no decision had been made. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is holding an emergency meeting today with leaders of the nation’s provinces, who’ve called on Trudeau to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the US, as opposed to the current, trilateral US-Mexico-Canada agreement. For her part, the Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum announced that her administration is also preparing a list of retaliatory tariffs “if the situation comes to that”. Amid criticism of Donald Trump’s transition from top Democrats like senator Elizabeth Warren, Trump’s team submitted an ethics plan that does not appear to include provisions for the president-elect himself, CNN reports. “There does not appear to be a provision addressing the requirement for the president-elect to address his conflicts of interest,” Valerie Smith Boyd, director of the Center for Presidential Transition at the nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, told CNN. The president-elect raised eyes for potential conflicts of interest during his first term in matters regarding his businesses and brands, particularly his hotels. During his recent campaign, Trump capitalized on his brand by selling a line of watches, bibles, shoes and NFTs. Trump’s transition team submitted the ethics plan as part of paperwork governing the presidential transition. Although agreements with the Biden White House and General Services Administration were due in September, Trump’s team only signed the White House agreement yesterday (and declined to sign an agreement with the GSA). Negotiations over transition paperwork with the Department of Justice are still ongoing. The Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced that he is in contact with law enforcement about the bomb threats and swatting targeting several of Donald Trump’s political appointees. “I’m in touch with law enforcement and closely monitoring the reports of bomb threats targeted at politicians. Violence has no place in our politics. Period. Law enforcement will work to keep everyone safe, and those responsible must be held fully accountable,” Schumer wrote in a social media post. With results still coming in from this year’s House elections, Axios reports that “at least two dozen ambitious House members are already sizing up runs for higher office in 2026”. Those potential runs for office could disrupt the razor-thin margins in the House if candidates are absent campaigning. Axios named a long list of Republicans and Democrats alike considering bids for the Senate or governorship, including congresswoman Nancy Mace and representative Michael McCaul. With Iowa representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks and California representative-elect Derek Tran declared the winners of their respective races, the Associated Press has yet to declare a winner in only one remaining House race. Results are still too close to call in California’s 13th District, where Democrat Adam Gray is slightly ahead of Republican incumbent John Duarte. As the Associated Press called California’s 45th district for Democrat Derek Tran, Republican incumbent Michelle Steel appeared to concede. In a statement posted on social media, Steel did not use the word “concede” or name Tran but said her journey in Congress “is ending”. “Everything is God’s will and, like all journeys, this one is ending for a new one to begin,” she said. “I owe a debt of gratitude to my supporters, my staff, my family, my daughters and especially my husband, Shawn, for standing by me through endless campaigns. To my volunteers, we would never have made it this far without your tireless efforts. And, to the voters, thank you.” Derek Tran, who won his race for California’s 45th district today, flipped one of just three seats for Democrats this election. The other two pick-ups for Democrats were elsewhere in California and Oregon. Tran, an attorney and Army veteran, defeated two-term Republican Michelle Steel, largely by focusing on her record on abortion rights. Steel had twice co-sponsored a nationwide abortion ban, called the Life at Conception Act, but later withdrew her support from the bill. Despite criticism from Donald Trump, who called Tran a “Radical Left Puppet of Communist China”, Tran was able to dodge such criticism as the son of war refugees from Vietnam. His district – which is anchored by Orange County – includes the nation’s largest Vietnamese community. Tran will be the district’s first Vietnamese American representative. He said his win “is a testament to the spirit and resilience of our community. As the son of Vietnamese refugees, I understand firsthand the journey and sacrifices many families in our district have made for a better life.” Democrat Derek Tran has won election to the US House of Representatives in California’s 45th congressional district, beating incumbent Michelle Steel. The AP has called the race for Tran after a weeks-long count. Republicans already control the US House, as well as the Senate, but picking up the seat is a big win for Democrats, who lost it to Steel in 2020. Although Steel initially had a commanding lead, the race became neck and neck as election workers tallied more ballots. Iowa representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, has won reelection to the House of Representatives, the Associated Press announced after a recount. Miller-Meeks’ lead over her opponent, Democrat Christina Bohannan, was less than a percentage point. Although Miller-Meeks had declared victory, the AP had not called the race because the margin was close enough that it could prompt a recount – which Bohannan’s campaign called for on 14 November. “This is a delaying tactic to thwart the will of the people,” the Miller-Meeks campaign said of the recount, adding that it wasted taxpayer dollars. “A recount won’t meaningfully change the outcome of this race as the congresswoman’s lead is mathematically impossible to overcome.” Miller-Meeks’ victory gives Republicans 220 seats in the House to Democrats’ 214 (the AP has yet to call one remaining House race). It also marks the first time in three decades that Iowa will have an all-Republican congressional delegation. A little-known Florida-based drones company said on Wednesday it had appointed Donald Trump Jr as an adviser – then saw its stock price surge. The Guardian’s Martin Pengelly has more on the president-elect’s son: “Don Jr joining our board of advisors provides us unique expertise we need as we bring drone component manufacturing back to America,” said Allan Evans, chief executive of Unusual Machines. By mid-morning on the New York stock exchange, company shares had climbed as high as $11.67, more than double the day’s opening price. Unusual Machines also said Trump Jr, the oldest son of the president-elect, was among its investors. A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission listed Trump Jr as the second-biggest shareholder. In a press release that described Trump Jr as “a globally recognized business leader” and “best-selling author”, Evans said he would “bring a wealth of experience”. Trump, typically referred to as Don Jr, has spent most of his adult life working for his father’s company, the Trump Organization, on real estate and branding. But he has risen to political prominence since his sister Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, distanced themselves from Donald Trump following his defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress by Trump supporters who tried in vain to overturn his loss. A host of Trump appointees experienced bomb threats today. To recap the day: Several Trump appointees were confirmed to have been targets of bomb threats at their homes on Wednesday. The FBI confirmed it is investigating the threats. Those targeted include: Pete Hegseth, Matt Gaetz, Elise Stefanik, Howard Lutnick and Lee Zeldin. Trump named some new people to round out his second administration. He added Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health; Jim O’Neill as deputy health secretary; John Phelan as Navy secretary and Keith Kellogg as a special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. House speaker Mike Johnson said he would host a meeting with Republican lawmakers and the two leaders of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, to discuss government cuts next week. A lawsuit was dismissed against Fox News brought by Ray Epps, a Donald Trump supporter who became the subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory about the January 6 attack and sued the outlet for defamation. Democrats are criticizing Kamala Harris’s campaign for failing to critically analyze her loss and any missteps she made. Democrats are criticizing Kamala Harris and her campaign for not critically analyzing her run or acknowledging any errors that could have contributed to her loss. Harris participated in a video call to thank donors, clips of which spread around the internet, with one Democratic National Committee official calling the call essentially “just patting each other on the back”, despite Harris’s loss. Separately, Pod Save America released an episode yesterday with several Harris campaign officials which has received pushback for failing to hold the campaign to account for its decisions and saw the aides defensive rather than reflective of any mistakes. For more on how some Democrats are reacting to the Harris post-mortems, the Guardian’s Robert Tait has the full story: House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that he would host Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy on Capitol Hill next Thursday to talk about ways to cut the government as part of the two men’s Department of Government Efficiency effort. In a post on Musk’s platform, X, Johnson said Republican House and Senate members were invited to “discuss major reform ideas to achieve regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings—&amp; revive the principle of limited government!” While it’s called a “department,” the new effort is not a department of the government – a president cannot unilaterally create a department. Instead, it is expected to offer suggestions to Trump on places to cut, which could include entire agencies and programs. Musk has previously said the government should have 99 agencies, a seemingly arbitrary number, instead of the several hundred it has now. Earlier today, he suggested getting rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency tasked with protecting consumers from predatory behavior in the finance sector. A report released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that abortions decreased by 2% in 2022, the year Roe v Wade was overturned. Since Roe’s demise, abortion restrictions and bans in some states have closed off or limited access in those places – though other states have increased access. More from the Guardian’s Carter Sherman in the full story here: Lee Zeldin, Trump’s pick to lead the environmental protection agency, said on X that a pipe bomb threat targeting his home “was sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message”. He and his family weren’t home, he said, and are safe. Zeldin added: “We are working with law enforcement to learn more as the situation develops. “We are thankful for the swift actions taken by local officers to keep our family, neighbors, and local community secure.” Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he chose Keith Kellogg to serve as a special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, a newly created role as the two countries remain at war and the US’s support for Ukraine will be a key decision for Trump’s incoming administration. Kellogg previously served as a national security adviser to Trump and to former vice president Mike Pence in Trump’s first term. “I am very pleased to nominate General Keith Kellogg to serve as Assistant to the President and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Keith has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration. He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!” The choice comes after reports last week that Trump was considering Richard Grenell for the role. Grenell served as intelligence chief during Trump’s first term. More members of Trump’s cabinet have emerged as subjects of bomb threats today. So far, those known to have had their residences targeted are: Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary and part of his transition team, whose home was threatened, Bronx outlet News 12 reported. Lee Zeldin, the environmental protection agency pick, who saw his Long Island home threatened, News 12 in Long Island reported. Matt Gaetz, the initial nominee for attorney general who has since withdrawn, had his Florida home targeted, various news reports said. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Trump’s UN ambassador choice, confirmed her home in New York was targeted. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary pick, whose home was targeted. Those targeted appear to be physically safe, and law enforcement has responded to check their homes for any devices or threats, several outlets have reported. The FBI has confirmed bomb threats and swatting incidents against Trump cabinet picks. In a statement, the agency said it is “aware of numerous bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting incoming administration nominees and appointees” and working with other law enforcement agencies to respond. “We take all potential threats seriously and, as always, encourage members of the public to immediately report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement,” the statement said. Fox News has welcomed the dismissal of a defamation case brought by Ray Epps, a Donald Trump supporter who became the subject of a rightwing conspiracy theory about the January 6 attack. A Fox News Media statement referred to other dismissed lawsuits when it said: “Following the dismissals of the Jankowicz, Bobulinski, and now Epps cases, Fox News is pleased with these back-to-back decisions from federal courts preserving the press freedoms of the first amendment.” Epps, now 63, is a former US marine and ex-member of the Oath Keepers militia who traveled from Arizona to Washington on 6 January 2021, as Trump sought to overturn his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. Epps was eventually sentenced to probation for his role in the attack on Congress that ensued, a riot linked to nine deaths and over which Trump was impeached but acquitted. After becoming subject to claims he was a covert government agent who stirred Trump supporters to cause trouble, Epps was forced into hiding. At his own sentencing, Epps said: “I have learned that truth is not always found in the places that I used to trust.” He filed suit against Fox in July last year. The suit said: “In the aftermath of the events of January 6, Fox News searched for a scapegoat to blame other than Donald Trump or the Republican party. Eventually, they turned on one of their own.” The suit cited Fox News hosts including Laura Ingraham and Will Cain but most prominently Tucker Carlson, who it said “was bluntly telling his viewers that it was a fact that Epps was a government informant. And they believed him.” Carlson was not a target of the suit – a lawyer for Epps said he “was an employee of Fox when he lied about Ray, and Fox broadcast those defamatory falsehoods. Fox is therefore fully liable for Mr Carlson’s statements.” Carlson was fired by Fox in April 2023, shortly after it settled (for $787.5m) a defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the advancement of Trump’s electoral fraud lie. Carlson has since flourished as an independent voice in far-right media, retaining influence with Trump as the president-elect prepares to return to power in January. Pete Hegseth, nominated to be Donald Trump’s defense secretary, was among several cabinet nominees and appointees of the president-elect who were targeted with bomb threats and so-called swatting on Wednesday, the Guardian has learned. A report also emerged that former congressman Matt Gaetz, who was briefly Trump’s first choice for US attorney general but stood aside after eight days amid a sexual misconduct scandal, was also targeted. A spokesperson for Trump confirmed threats against some of his cabinet picks but did not initially give any names or say how many people had received threats. But Hegseth, the military veteran steeped in controversy over his conservative views after being selected, was understood to be among the number, according to two people familiar with the developments. Reports by the Trump transition team that multiple Trump appointees and nominees were targeted by bomb threats and swatting comes amid a season of heightened concerns about political violence – and following two assassination attempts against Trump himself. On 13 July, a shooter fired into the crowd during an open-air Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, injuring two attendees and killing one. Trump was grazed by the gunfire but emerged almost entirely uninjured. Two months later, on 15 September, a suspect was caught while pointing a gun toward Trump’s Mar-a-Lago golf course, where Trump was golfing. He was apprehended the same day. Both incidents prompted the Trump and Harris campaigns to adopt heightened security for the duration of the race. After the Pennsylvania shooting, Trump frequently appeared at rallies behind bulletproof glass. Elise Stefanik, the congresswoman and Trump’s appointee for ambassador to the United Nations, confirmed on X that there was a bomb threat at her home. “This morning, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, her husband, and their three year old son were driving home to Saratoga County from Washington for Thanksgiving when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence,” her X post says. Law enforcement responded immediately, she noted, “with the highest levels of professionalism.” Leavitt wrote that the threats transpired Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, and included bomb threats and swatting, which refers to false reports of a crime to prompt police raids on a person’s home. Law enforcement “acted quickly,” wrote Leavitt, adding that “President Trump and the entire Transition team are grateful for their swift action.” Leavitt did not say who specifically was targeted. In a statement, Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt wrote that “several” of Trump’s cabinet appointments had been targeted with bomb threats and swatting. “In response, law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted,” wrote Leavitt. In case you missed it, Donald Trump’s transition team is planning for appointees to receive immediate security clearances, bypassing FBI background checks when Trump takes office, per a Guardian exclusive. Hugo Lowell reports: Donald Trump’s transition team is planning for all political appointees to receive sweeping security clearances on the first day and only face FBI background checks after the incoming administration takes over the bureau and its own officials are installed in key positions, according to people familiar with the matter. The move appears to mean that Trump’s team will continue to skirt FBI vetting and may not receive classified briefings until Trump is sworn in on 20 January and unilaterally grant sweeping security clearances across the administration. Trump’s team has regarded the FBI background check process with contempt for months, a product of their deep distrust of the bureau ever since officials turned over transition records to the Russia investigation during the first Trump presidency, the people said. Federal employees fear doxxing and retaliation after Elon Musk posted on social media the names and titles of multiple people who hold climate-related positions but who are not public figures, CNN has reported. Musk, who will co-lead an unofficial government body seeking to reduce spending – the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) – with Vivek Ramaswamy, posted the names of the employees on X, prompting at least one of them to delete her accounts in fear of retaliation by Musk’s followers. In a post, Hadas Gold, the author of the CNN story noted that she “was stunned when multiple experts in this field declined to speak to me on the record for fear of themselves becoming a target of Elon Musk.” Also in Trump transition news: last night Trump announced he had nominated John Phelan, an investor and GOP megadonor who contributed to the Trump 2024 campaign, to be secretary of the Navy. “John will be a tremendous force for our Naval Servicemembers, and a steadfast leader in advancing my America First vision,” Trump wrote in a statement. “He will put the business of the U.S. Navy above all else.” Phelan has not served in the military. His nomination follows Trump’s decision to pick Pete Hegseth, a Fox News personality and rightwing ideologue who was investigated by police for an alleged sexual assault, to serve as the secretary of defense. The US has negotiated the release of three Americans from Chinese custody in a prisoner swap. It’s a diplomatic win for the Biden administration, which has brought home more than 70 formerly imprisoned Americans abroad in the last four years, according to Politico, which first reported the exchange. The Americans, Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung, will be transferred to a medical facility for health screening. The negotiations follow the high-profile release of numerous Americans from Russian custody, including the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. Trump also named several high level health officials to serve in his next cabinet. Jim O’Neill was nominated to serve as Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy under Robert F Kennedy Jr, who was picked to lead the department. O’Neill previously served in the HHS department under George W Bush, before working in Silicon valley, where he invested in several business ventures with PayPal chief executive Peter Thiel. “[O’Neill] will oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,” said Trump in a statement. ' Jay Bhattacharya, a physician and Stanford professor, was picked to lead the National Institutes of Health. Bhattacharya is a major critic of the US government’s response to Covid-19, including lockdowns during the virus’s peak. He later published a paper in October 2020 arguing that those who are less vulnerable to the virus should resume normal life. Trump has continued to build out his cabinet as concerns about his transition intensify. Late Tuesday, Trump tapped Jamieson Greer, a lawyer who worked under Trump’s previous trade representative Robert Lighthizer, to serve as the next trade representative. If confirmed, Greer would oversee the trade deficit and work to expand “export markets everywhere”, Trump said in a statement. Greer would likely oversee the implementation of Trump’s plans to levy tariffs on Mexica, China and Canada. On Greer, Trump said: “Jamieson played a key role during my First Term in imposing Tariffs on China and others to combat unfair Trade practices, and replacing the failed NAFTA deal with USMCA, therefore making it much better for American Workers.” The MOU was supposed to be signed weeks ago, before the election. Trump has already indicated he will sidestep standard transition processes, including, The Guardian has reported, by issuing security clearances to appointees without requiring FBI background checks. In refusing to sign a transition agreement with the DOJ regarding FBI background checks, the incoming Trump administration stands to forgo access to classified information from Biden administration officials. Lawmakers have already raised concerns about key Trump appointees avoiding the standard security clearance process – which will likely arise during senate confirmation hearings early next year. Good morning, US politics blog readers. US senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, blasted an agreement announced between Donald Trump’s transition team and the Joe Biden White House last night as failing “to answer key questions about national security threats and FBI vetting of nominees”, thereby increasing “concerns about corruption”. We’ll have more details and also cover all the other politics news today, as it happens. Here’s what’s afoot: The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the incoming Trump and outgoing Biden administrations outlining some terms of the transfer of power departs from the norm in a few key ways, which is raising eyebrows on Washington. The Trump team said the transition will be privately funded and will not utilize “government buildings or technology [...] and will operate as a self-sufficient organization.” Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff said the transition team “has an existing ethics plan”, which she said would be uploaded to the General Services Administration website. Warren called Trump’s use of private funds “nothing more than a ploy for well-connected Trump insiders to line their pockets while pretending to save taxpayers money.” She expressed “concerns of corruption”. There is a fresh flurry of Trump appointments. Among those announced last night were John Phelan, an investor and Trump campaign donor, as his pick for secretary of the Navy, and Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University health researcher who opposed Covid-19 lockdowns, to head the National Institutes of Health."

          "headline": "UN chief says Lebanon ceasefire ‘first ray of hope amid darkness’ in conflict – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "The Israeli military said on Wednesday it shot down a drone that was carrying weapons and crossed from Egypt to Israel, Reuters reports. It’s just past 9pm in Beirut, Gaza and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Thousands of people displaced southern Lebanon have begun returning home after a ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-war between Israel and Hezbollah took effect on Wednesday. Lebanon’s motorways were thronged with packed vehicles carrying families returning south despite warnings from the Israeli military that they should stay away while its forces remained in the area. The Lebanese army asked displaced people to avoid frontline villages and towns near the UN-drawn “blue line” that separates the two countries. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the Lebanon ceasefire was the “first ray of hope” in the regional conflict after the “darkness of the past months”. “It is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,” Guterres said on Wednesday. He reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The 60 day ceasefire agreement brokered by the US between Israel and Hezbollah came into force at 4am local time and appears to be holding. If it continues to do so, it represents a major milestone in the 14-month-old war in Lebanon. However, in a sign of how volatile the situation remains, Israeli forces opened fire on a number of cars that attempted to enter what it said was a restricted area on Wednesday. The ceasefire in Lebanon came after Israel launched the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre. At least 42 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beirut and the south of Lebanon before the ceasefire began. Hezbollah also fired rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens. Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread on both sides. Supporters of Hezbollah, which has suffered heavy losses since October 2023, celebrated the group’s survival and waved its yellow and green flag across southern Beirut on Wednesday. Iran, Hezbollah’s ally, welcomed the end of Israel’s “aggression” in Lebanon. In Israel, the ceasefire has met a more mixed reaction where rightwingers and residents of Israel’s north have criticised the agreement. Dozens of people gathered outside the Israeli army’s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to protest against the ceasefire. The Lebanon ceasefire deal does will not have any direct effect on the fighting in Gaza, where the death toll passed 44,282 on Wednesday. Gaza’s health ministry said an additional 104,880 Palestinians have been injured since October 2023. An Egyptian security delegation is reportedly expected to travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal. The US will renew a push for a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory, president Joe Biden said. At least 12 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza City on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. A pregnant woman and two other Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south on Wednesday, Wafa reported. Two journalists were injured when Israeli forces “opened fire” on a group of journalists covering a border town of Khiam in south-east Lebanon on Wednesday, Lebanon’s National News Agency said. A video journalist told AFP that he was shot at while reporting in Khiam and that it was clear that the group were journalists. Israel has decided to notify the international criminal court (ICC) that it will appeal against arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant. Separately, France’s foreign ministry suggested that Netanyahu would not immediately be arrested if he came to French territory because Israel is not a member of the ICC. The Biden administration is reportedly pushing ahead with a $680m arms sales package to Israel. The package includes thousands of joint direct attack munition kits (JDAMs) and hundreds of small-diameter bombs, Reuters reported. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said it reserves the right to react to Israeli airstrikes last month, but that it is also taking account of other developments in the region. Tehran welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and hoped it will be permanent, Araqchi told reporters on Wednesday. Asked whether the ceasefire could lead to an easing of tensions between Israel and Iran, he replied: “It depends on the behaviour of Israel,” adding: Of course, we reserve the right to react to the recent Israeli aggression, but we do consider all developments in the region. An Egyptian security delegation is expected to travel to Israel on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire deal, Reuters is reporting, citing Egyptian security sources. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon was the “first ray of hope” in the regional conflict after the “darkness of the past months”. “It is essential that those who signed the ceasefire commitment respect it in full,” Guterres said on Wednesday, Reuters reported. He said the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon was ready to monitor the ceasefire, and reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. I received an auspicious sign yesterday, the first ray of hope for peace amid the darkness of the past months … It is a moment of great importance, especially for civilians who were paying an enormous price of this spreading conflict. The family of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a British-Egyptian political prisoner, said at the meeting with the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, that they had suggested several avenues to secure his release, after Lammy faced calls to impose economic punishment on Egypt in the Commons on Tuesday. Lammy insisted the issue was being raised with Egypt but also pointed to the importance of Egypt due to its proximity to Gaza. Abd el-Fattah’s sister, Sanaa Seif, said: It’s unfair to be using a bigger tragedy as a tool against a family facing such an ordeal. According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) since Abd el-Fattah was detained in 2019, the UK has licensed at least £237m worth of arms to Egypt. The single largest arms licence came in December 2023, issued for military radars worth nearly £80m. Asked about the CAAT arms licence figures, the family said they were unaware, but said it underlines the strong UK-Egypt relationship and that a release for Abd el-Fattah can be found. “Now after this information I feel a bit gaslit by David Lammy,” Sanaa added. The family also said Alicia Kearns, who has set up an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on arbitrary detention and hostage affairs, had notified the foreign office ahead of Abd el-Fattah’s September release date. “I believe that it’s possible to get this done and to get this done quickly,” said his mother, Laila, who will return to see her son in jail in Cairo later this week. We’ve had a lucky break by the fact that my body has been so resilient and my body has not collapsed. I hope everyone will believe that I’m serious about taking this through to the end. At least 12 Palestinians, including children and women, were killed in an Israeli strike on a school in central Gaza City on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa. The Israeli strike on the Al-Tabi’in School in Al-Daraj neighbourhood came as Gaza’s health ministry updated the death toll since October 2023 to 44,282 people and 104,880 injured. Later on Wednesday, Wafa reported that a pregnant woman and two other Palestinians were killed in Israeli bombing in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza and Khan Younis in the south. Palestinians searched through rubble after an Israeli airstrike hit a school in Gaza City, as they expressed hope for a ceasefire after news that Israel had agreed to halt hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon. An Israeli airstrike killed at least 13 Palestinians at a school in Gaza City, medics said on Tuesday. Dozens of people were also wounded in the strike on the Al-Hurreya School in the Zeitoun neighbourhood. Another Israeli strike hit the Tabeen School also in Gaza City, killing at least nine people, according to hospital officials. Both schools were sheltering hundreds of displaced people. We reported earlier that the Lebanese official news agency said Israeli forces “opened fire” on a group of journalists in Khiam in south-east Lebanon on Tuesday. Two journalists were injured by the Israeli fire while reporting on the return of residents in the border town, Lebanon’s National News Agency said. Video journalist Abdelkader Bay told Agence-France-Presse that he was reporting in Khiam with two other visual journalists when shots were fired and he was injured along with his colleague. “We saw people checking on their homes and, at the same time, we were hearing the sounds of tanks withdrawing,” Bay said. While we were filming, we realised there were Israeli soldiers in a building and suddenly they shot at us. He said it was clear that the group were journalists, and that the other wounded journalist was taken to hospital. The former chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), Fatou Bensouda, has said she was subjected to “thug-style tactics”, threats and intimidation while in office. Bensouda, who held the post between 2012 and 2021, said that when she was working on some the court’s most politically sensitive cases she experienced “direct threats to my person and family”. Bensouda was of intense interest to Israel’s intelligence agencies after she opened a preliminary inquiry in 2015 into allegations of crimes committed by Israel’s armed forces and Palestinian militants. A Guardian investigation revealed in May how an Israeli spy chief allegedly threatened her in an attempt to prevent an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in the occupied Palestinian territories. According to the investigation, the head of the Israeli intelligence agency the Mossad ran a covert operation against Bensouda as part of a broader campaign of surveillance and espionage by Israel against the ICC. The British-born mother of an Egyptian political prisoner who has been on hunger strike for 58 days met with the foreign secretary, David Lammy, on Wednesday, urging for the government to secure the release of her son Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a British and Egyptian dual citizen. The family said they felt heard by the foreign secretary in their Wednesday meeting, but left with no concrete promises or commitments on the case of Abd el-Fattah, who was due to be released in September, but has not been freed. Abd el-Fattah wrote about the Arab spring and its aftermath, was jailed for five years for “spreading false news”. At a press conference in London on Wednesday, his mother said: He listened to me, I hope my message got through. I’m on hunger strike, I’m not about to break my hunger strike until Alaa is released. Abd el-Fattah’s sisters, Sanaa Seif and Mona Seif who also attended the meeting with Lammy, said they felt heard by the foreign minister but wished the meeting had happened sooner. The family also said Alicia Kearns, who has set up an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on arbitrary detention and hostage affairs, had reached out to the foreign office ahead of their brother’s expected date of release in September, but no action was taken. Sanaa said: They have wasted a lot of opportunities to release my brother. We didn’t get any promises, we didn’t get any commitments. “We were hoping to come out of today’s meeting to share with you very tangible steps and timelines which isn’t the case,” said Mona. The Biden administration is pushing ahead with a $680m arms sales package to Israel, according to multiple reports. The package, reported by Reuters and the Financial Times, includes thousands of joint direct attack munition kits (JDAM) and hundreds of small-diameter bombs. Israel has decided to notify the international criminal court (ICC) that it will appeal against arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, Axios is reporting, citing an Israeli official. Lebanon will reopen its schools on Monday following the implementation of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese education minister, Abbas Halabi, has announced. A statement by Halabi carried by the country’s National News Agency reads: With many teachers and parents inspecting the damage to their homes or returning to their areas, schools that had previously been designated as shelters are seeing families depart. He said schools that had been previously used as shelters will resume their educational duties on Monday. France’s president Emmanuel Macron and Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu have a strained relationship, but Paris has been instrumental in efforts to help broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that came into force early this morning. Unconfirmed media reports have said Netanyahu angrily raised the issue of the international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant targeting him in calls with Macron, and that he urged France not to enforce the decision, Agence-France-Presse reported. The French foreign ministry’s statement was condemned by rights groups. Amnesty International described France’s position as “deeply problematic”, stating: Rather than inferring that ICC indictees may enjoy immunity, France should expressly confirm its acceptance of the unequivocal legal duty under the Rome Statute to carry out arrest warrants. Andrew Stroehlein, European media director at Human Rights Watch, said: Some shocking nonsense from France here. No one gets immunity from an ICC arrest warrant because they’re in office - not Netanyahu, not Putin, no one. Here’s more on the statement by the French foreign ministry that suggests Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, would not immediately be arrested if he came to French territory despite an international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant targeting him. Despite the prime minister, Michel Barnier, saying earlier this week that France would “rigorously” respect its obligations under international law, the foreign ministry on Wednesday said it would continue to work closely with Netanyahu. The ministry argued that Netanyahu and others ministers affected benefits from immunity because Israel is not a member of the court. It said: A state cannot be held to act in a way that is incompatible with its obligations in terms of international law with regards to immunities granted to states which are not party to the ICC. The ministry said this would be “taken into consideration if the ICC was to ask us for their arrest and handing over.” The statement also cited the “historic friendship that links France and Israel”, describing them as “two democracies committed to the rule of law and respect for professional and independent justice.” France intends to continue to work in close collaboration with prime minister Netanyahu and other Israeli authorities to achieve peace and security for all in the Middle East. The Israeli military has declared a curfew in southern Lebanon that began a short while ago at 5pm local time (1500 GMT) until 7am (0500 GMT). In a post on X, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned residents against moving south of the Litani river during that time. We inform you that starting from 5pm until tomorrow morning at 7am it is absolutely forbidden to travel south of the Litani river. Anyone already south of the river must remain where they are during the curfew, he said. He warned that Israeli forces will deal “firmly” with any movement that “violates” the ceasefire agreement. Here are some of the latest images from the newswires from Lebanon taken in the hours after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah came into effect. It’s approaching 5pm in Tel Aviv, Beirut and Gaza, here are the latest developments from the Middle East: A 60-day ceasefire agreement brokered by the US between Israel and Hezbollah came into force at 4am local time and appears to be holding. If it continues to do so, it represents a major milestone in the 14-month-old war in Lebanon, and will see Israel withdraw entirely from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah will move its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, about 18 miles (25km) north of the border. US president Joe Biden has posted to social media to say that over the coming days the US will renew a push for a ceasefire in Gaza. He said: “Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power.” The Israeli military warned displaced Lebanese residents from the country’s south that they could not return immediately as it remained a military area. “We will update you when it is safe to return to your homes,” the army’s spokesperson said in a post on social media. Though the ceasefire terms stipulate the IDF must withdraw completely from southern Lebanon within the 60-day period, it is not expected take place immediately. However, the speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, Nabih Berri, has told residents to return to their homes. He said that the war with Israel of the last few weeks had been the “most dangerous phase” in his country’s history, and urged residents to “return to your lands.” Lebanon’s army said it is reinforcing its presence in south Lebanon. It comes after prime minister Najib Mikati announced a cabinet decision to bolster the force’s deployment following a Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire. Lebanon’s army says it has begun reinforcing its presence in south Lebanon, AFP reports. It comes after prime minister Najib Mikati announced a cabinet decision to bolster the force’s deployment following a Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire. The military said in a statement. The army has begun reinforcing its presence in the South Litani sector and extending the state’s authority in coordination with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. AFP said one of its journalists saw army troops and vehicles in two south Lebanon areas. Earlier, we mentioned that Joe Biden’s national security adviser said the outgoing president will launch a renewed drive for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, now that Israel and Hezbollah have agreed to a truce in Lebanon. Here is his full quote: President Biden intends to begin that work today by having his envoys engage with Turkey, Qatar, Egypt and other actors in the region. We believe that this is the beginning of an opportunity for a more stable Middle East in which Israel’s security is assured and US interests are secured. Lebanon’s National News Agency has reported that Israeli forces in Khiam in south-east Lebanon have “opened fire on a group of journalists while they were covering the return of the residents and the Israeli withdrawal from the town” It reports they sustained various injuries and have been transferred to Hasbaya hospital. The claims have not been independently verified. More details soon … National security adviser Jake Sullivan has reinforced a message earlier from US president Joe Biden that the country wishes to make a renewed push to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking on MSNBC in the US, Sullivan said Biden intends to “begin that work today by having his envoys engage with Turkey, Qatar, Egypt and other actors in the region”. Israel’s military has issued a joint statement with the Shin Bet claiming to have foiled a smuggling operation which was transferring weapons from Iran into the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Al Jazeera is carrying some quotes Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who has been Iran’s speaker of parliament since 2020. It reports he said: We welcome the ceasefire in Lebanon. After the oppression and criminal bombings by the Zionist regime, tonight the people are experiencing peace. [Hezbollah] never allowed even an inch of their land to fall into enemy hands. We hope this peace will also be established in Gaza. However, the claim by the criminal [Benjamin] Netanyahu that his focus is on Iran is nonsense. When the war in Lebanon began, and they martyred Nasrallah [Hassan Nasrallah was killed by Israel in Beirut in September] and committed the pager massacre, along with so many other crimes, they thought Hezbollah had been weakened. During my trip to Beirut, amidst the smoke, fire, and the immense pressure on the people, I saw courage and patience among them. I saw that Hezbollah was more alive than ever. France appears to have ruled out acting on the international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes relating to the Gaza war. Reuters reports a foreign ministry statement said that as Israel was not a party to the ICC, this conveyed immunity. 124 countries are party to the court. Notable states that are not party to the court include China, India, Israel, Russia, and the US. US president Joe Biden has posted to social media to say that over the coming days the US will renew a push for a ceasefire in Gaza. In the post, Biden said: Over the coming days, the United States will make another push with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza with the hostages released and an end to the war without Hamas in power. A year’s worth of US attempts to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas have not succeeded since a brief pause in fighting and the release of some hostages that lasted from 24 November 2023 to 30 November 2023. Earlier on Wednesday Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told news agency Reuters that the group “is interested in reaching an agreement that ends the war in Gaza,” but, he claimed, “The problem was always with [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu who has always escaped from reaching an agreement.” Senior Hezbollah official Hassan Fadlallah, who is an MP in Lebanon, has said that the group would retain the right to defend itself if Israel attacked. On Tuesday Fadlallah insisted that Hezbollah would remain active after its war with Israel ends, including by helping displaced Lebanese return to their villages and rebuilding areas destroyed by Israeli strikes. Israel’s military today has said in a statement that it “remains in southern Lebanon and will actively enforce every violation of the ceasefire agreement.” It said it had “identified suspects in southern Lebanon and fired toward them” over the last few hours. The 60-day ceasefire period started in the early hours of Wednesday, and the terms are understood to be that by the end of it, Israel will have withdrawn from Lebanon, and the Lebanese army will be in position south of the Litani River to enforce an end to hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. Hind Khoudary is in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza for Al Jazeera, and she reports that, with news of the ceasefire to the north, Palestinians “are very happy for Lebanon because they feel what war means.” She writes that with the expectation that they might be next in line for a ceasefire deal “there is a little bit of hope.” However, she adds: But most people feel abandoned, that no one is hearing them. We’re talking about more than a year of continuous war, with over 40,000 Palestinians killed. People in northern Gaza are starving, forcibly displaced … and no one is listening. Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting that 12 people “including children and women” have been killed by an Israeli strike on the Al-Tabi’in school in central Gaza City, which was housing displaced people. The Hamas-led health authority in the territory has issued its latest casualty figures for the conflict, claiming that 44,282 Palestinians have been killed and 104,880 injured in Israel’s military offensive since 7 October 2023. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Our video team have put together this report with clips of families in Lebanon making the journey back towards their homes now that a ceasefire agreement has been reached. Reuters reports that Air France is to continue its suspension of flights to Tel Aviv and Beirut until the end of the year. The British Red Cross has said it welcomes the news of a ceasefire in Lebanon, but says challenges lie ahead. In a statement, Gabriel Karlsson, the Middle East country cluster manager at the British Red Cross, said: Our attention must now shift to the immense challenges faced by the hundreds of thousands of people who have had their lives turned upside down and fled their homes. Many of them will be returning to areas extensively damaged by the conflict, often with little to no access to basic services. With winter upon us the harsh weather conditions only add to their hardship. The statement urged people who wanted to help to make donations to its Gaza Crisis Appeal, with funds being directed across the region. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has also issued an alert calling for an urgent scaling up of humanitarian aid to Lebanon. Juan Gabriel Wells, the IRC country director in Lebanon, said: More than one hundred thousand homes have been either partially or fully destroyed across southern Lebanon, Bekaa and Beirut leaving thousands of families without a safe place to return to. It is vital that the international community now also invest in Lebanon’s recovery. These efforts are not only about rebuilding infrastructure; they are also critical to restoring dignity and hope to families who have lost everything. Israel’s military has issued a statement in which it has claimed that its recent military action in Lebanon destroyed 70% of the “stockpile of UAVs and cruise missiles” used by Hezbollah’s aerial unit, and also “eliminated” the unit’s chain of command. The claims have not been independently verified. Hani Mahmoud, reporting for Al Jazeera from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza writes that “There has been no end to attacks in Gaza since early this morning.” He said the northern gate of Kamal Adwan hospital has been under “relentless attack”, and said that “quadcopters are causing massive fear and intimidation” and are impeding “the movement of paramedics, medical staff and volunteers bringing injured people to the hospital.” Al Jazeera reports that since last night Israeli security forces have arrested at least 15 people in raids in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that two people were injured by live fire in Tubas, and have been transferred to hospital. The Wafa correspondent reported “widespread destruction of property and infrastructure” during the operation. The total number of arrests made by Israeli forces in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since 7 October 2023 has been put at more than 11,800 by the Palestinian Prisoners Society. Many are detained without charge, it says. In a statement, Israel’s military has claimed that in the hours leading up to the ceasefire coming into effect, it “conducted intelligence-based strikes on dozens of Hezbollah command centers, launchers, weapons storage facilities, and terrorist infrastructure sites” in Beirut, Tyre, and Nabatieh. It also claimed to have targeted what it said were “smuggling routes between Syria and Lebanon.” President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Wednesday that Turkey was ready to help in any way possible to establish a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, and expressed satisfaction with the ceasefire agreement that has come into effect in Lebanon, Reuters reports. The speaker of Lebanon’s parliament, Nabih Berri, has said that the war with Israel of the last few weeks had been the “most dangerous phase” in his country’s history, and urged residents to “return to your lands.” Despite a warning from the Israeli military that it was not yet safe to do so, streams of cars have been heading south inside Lebanon as many of the estimated 900,000 displaced people attempt to return home. In a televised message, Berri said Lebanon had “thwarted the effect of the Israeli aggression,” adding “the war showed Lebanon’s true face in cohesion and national unity.” Berri also paid tribute to former Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated by Israel in Beirut in September. The 60-day ceasefire agreement brokered by the US between Israel and Hezbollah came into force at 4am local time (2am GMT) on Wednesday, and so far appears to be holding. However, Israel’s military said earlier it had fired warning shots at what it suspected were Hezbollah operatives in the Lebanese village of Kfarkela, which is directly opposite the Israeli town of Metula across the UN-drawn blue line that separates the two countries. Israel’s air force reiterated that it continues to be ready to strike inside Lebanon if it deems it necessary, saying air defences are on high alert, and that “The IDF will act against anyone who tries to violate the ceasefire agreement, and will not allow harm to the security of the residents of Israel.” The international community has broadly welcomed the ceasefire, which Jordan said it hoped would prompt more efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. Turkey said Israel should pay reparations for damages caused by its military campaign inside Lebanon. In its response to the ceasefire deal, Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters “Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza.” At least 15 people have been reported killed by Israeli airstrikes on the north of Gaza on Wednesday morning. Reuters is now carrying fuller quotes from Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri, who gave his reaction to the ceasefire in Lebanon and said the group were still interested in a ceasefire deal in Gaza. He said: Hamas appreciates the right of Lebanon and Hezbollah to reach an agreement that protects the people of Lebanon and we hope that this agreement will pave the way to reaching an agreement that ends the war of genocide against our people in Gaza. Hamas showed high flexibility to reach an agreement and it is still committed to that position and is interested in reaching an agreement that ends the war in Gaza. The problem was always with [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu who has always escaped from reaching an agreement. Israel’s air force has reiterated that it continues to be ready to strike inside Lebanon if it deems it necessary, despite the beginning of the ceasefire in the last few hours. In a statement it said: Even during the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon that came into effect this morning, the air force continues to be prepared and ready to operate in all Lebanese territory in order to protect our forces. The personnel of the air defence system are all on high alert, all the time. The IDF will act against anyone who tries to violate the ceasefire agreement, and will not allow harm to the security of the residents of Israel. Here are some images sent over the news wires from close to the border that separates Israel and Lebanon this morning. Italy and Jordan have joined a chorus of countries welcoming a ceasefire in Lebanon that came into effect a few hours ago. Reuters reports that Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni said it had been a goal Italy had been working on for some time, while Jordan said the development should prompt greater international efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. Al Jazeera is quoting Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee council, saying that despite the ceasefire beginning this morning, a humanitarian crisis remains in Lebanon. He said: [The ceasefire] will be a moment of relief for the families I met recently in Lebanon – and for millions around the country – but this relief must be lasting. Many will have no homes to return to, no schools for their children, and livelihoods destroyed. The wellbeing of children and their families must be prioritised in what will be a long journey to recovery. It is now also far beyond time for the fighting in Gaza to cease too. The ceasefire in Lebanon must not lead to any further escalation there or elsewhere. Reuters reports that it has seen the text of the ceasefire agreement, and that it stipulates only “official military and security forces” in Lebanon are authorised to carry arms in the country, specifically naming the Lebanese armed forces, the internal security forces, general security, state security, Lebanese customs and municipal police. Here are some images of damage caused at the Arida border crossing between Lebanon and Syria, which was struck by the Israeli air force hours before the ceasefire came into force. Residents returning to their homes in Lebanon have been cautioned about the risks posed by unexploded munitions. The Lebanese Real Estate Authority in a statement said it was “the most beautiful thing” that people forced from their homes by Israeli attacks in southern Lebanon would be able to return, but warned of: The remnants of war, and what the enemy may have left behind of explosives, weapons, cluster bombs, booby-traps, or foreign objects thrown among neighbourhoods and homes, which pose a danger to citizens and children. It would have been more appropriate for the army and the relevant security authorities to conduct a security survey, and to inspect the damaged areas completely, so that adults and children would not fall victim, and it would not result in casualties. Palestinian news sources are quoting Hamas official Abdel Rahman Shadid who has called for an escalation in “clashes with the occupation and settler militias throughout the West Bank.” He is quoted as saying: The resistance fighters in the city of Tubas and the camps of the West Bank prove every day that they will remain the first line of defence for our people and their land, and we stress the need to expand the scope of the resistance to include every inch of the West Bank and Palestine, to deter the occupation and its settlers from continuing their brutal crimes. Reuters reports that Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri has this morning told it that the group hopes for a deal to end the war in Gaza, and says Hamas “appreciates” Lebanon’s right to reach an agreement with Israel. In recent weeks, after nearly a year of efforts, Qatar pulled out of mediating ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, saying it did not believe that either side were continuing to negotiate in good faith. Turkey has called for Israel to pay reparations for damage in Lebanon caused by its recent military campaign. In a message offering support for the ceasefire agreement which came into force earlier today, Reuters reports the foreign ministry said: It is imperative for the international community to exert pressure on Israel to fully comply with the ceasefire and to provide reparations for the damages it has caused in Lebanon. Turkey also repeated its call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The number of people killed by Israeli strikes on Gaza on Wednesday morning has risen to 15, according to medics. Reuters reports that the dead include two sons of former Hamas spokesperson, Fawzi Barhoum. Israeli media reports that, after the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF fired warning shots at what it suspected were Hezbollah operatives in the Lebanese village of Kfarkela. Posting to social media, and citing the IDF, Kan news military correspondent Itay Blumental reported: In the last hour, IDF forces identified a number of vehicles in Lebanese territory with suspected Hezbollah operatives, in a restricted area near Kfarkela. The forces fired to prevent their arrival in the area, and the suspects moved away. The IDF says that the air force is prepared to act. The territory of Lebanon and the air defence system is on high alert. As of this time, there is no change in the directives of the Home front command. Kfarkela is directly opposite the Israeli town of Metula, at almost the very northern tip of Israeli-controlled territory. Egypt’s foreign ministry has issued a statement saying it welcomes the ceasefire in Lebanon, and that it will lead to de-escalation in the region, Reuters reports. In a round of diplomacy in the region, Jordan’s King Abdullah II is heading to Egypt today, and then on to Cyprus. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that “a number of citizens, including children and women” have been killed by continued Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since dawn. Strikes are reported to have taken place on Gaza City and Beit Lahia, and 12 people are reported killed. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. Not everybody on the Israeli side of the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon is optimistic that the ceasefire will represent a long-term end to hostilities. Speaking to Israel’s army radio, Gabby Neeman, the mayor of the northern city of Shlomi, said many Israelis will continue to stay away from their homes at present. Neeman met with Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of the ceasefire agreement, and said afterwards “Everything we were shown testifies to the fact that the next round is ahead of us, whether in a month, two months or 10 years.” It’s coming up on 9am in Tel Aviv, Beirut and Gaza. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: A 60-day ceasefire agreement brokered by the US between Israel and Hezbollah came into force at 4am local time (2am GMT) on Wednesday. If it holds, it represents a major milestone in the 14-month-old war in Lebanon, and will see Israel withdraw entirely from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah will move its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, about 18 miles (25km) north of the border. Joe Biden, the US president, hailed the “historic” deal and said it was designed to be a “permanent cessation of hostilities”. Biden issued a joint statement with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, pledging that both countries would work with Israel and Lebanon to ensure the agreement is “fully implemented and enforced”. The Israeli military warned displaced Lebanese residents from the country’s south that they could not return immediately as it remained a military area. “We will update you when it is safe to return to your homes,” the army’s spokesperson said in a post on social media. Though the ceasefire terms stipulate the IDF must withdraw completely from southern Lebanon within the 60-day period, it is not expected take place immediately. Lebanon’s army said on Wednesday morning it is preparing to deploy to the south of the country. The deployment is in accordance with UN resolution 1701 – which formed the basis of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. Despite those warnings, streams of cars carrying people displaced from southern Lebanon in recent months began heading south early on Wednesday after the ceasefire came into force. Some celebratory gunshots could be heard in parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs. Residents whooped and cheered as they drove into Tyre, the second largest city in south Lebanon. Importantly for Israel, Hezbollah dropped its demand that a ceasefire in Lebanon was contingent on ending the fighting in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah deal will not have any direct effect on the fighting in Gaza, where US efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have not led to a deal. “Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza,” Biden said during his address on Tuesday. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, endorsed the ceasefire after his full cabinet approved the deal. He said Israel would retain “complete military freedom of action” and would respond “forcefully” if Hezbollah violated the agreement. In televised remarks, Netanyahu said that there were three reasons to pursue a ceasefire: to focus on the threat from Iran; replenish depleted arms supplies and rest tired reservists; and to isolate Hamas. News of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal was welcomed by world leaders. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, called for the ceasefire to be turned into “a lasting political solution”, adding that Britain and its allies would continue to be at the “forefront of efforts to break the ongoing cycle of violence” to achieve a “long-term, sustainable” peace in the Middle East. The president of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described it as “very encouraging news”. Iran on Wednesday said it welcomed the end of Israel’s “aggression” in Lebanon, after a ceasefire deal came into force between Israel and Hezbollah, an armed group backed financially and militarily by Tehran. It reiterated its support for the Lebanese government. Israeli airstrikes continued to pound Beirut even as Biden announced the ceasefire deal late on Tuesday and right down to the final hour before the truce took effect. At least 3,823 people have been killed and 15,859 others wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since October 2023, according to the Lebanese health ministry on Tuesday. The latest figures include 55 people killed and 160 injured in strikes on Monday alone, the ministry said. Syria has revised the death toll upward to six in the alleged Israeli strikes late on Tuesday which targeted Lebanon’s three northern border crossings with Syria for the first time (see earlier post here). For clarity: the strikes occurred before Wednesday morning’s ceasefire took effect. Syria’s state news agency reported four civilians and two soldiers were killed, and 12 people were wounded including children, women and Syrian Red Crescent workers. The Red Crescent said earlier a volunteer was killed and another was injured in “the aggression that targeted Al-Dabousyeh and Al-Arida crossings … as they were performing their humanitarian duty of rescuing the wounded early on Wednesday.” Here’s more from William Christou, reporting for the Guardian: The Lebanese army said on Wednesday morning that it was deploying in south Lebanon in accordance with UN resolution 1701 – which formed the basis of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. The resolution calls for the withdrawal of Hezbollah fighters north of the Litani river – about 18 miles from the Lebanon-Israel border – and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon. The Lebanese army told residents of border villages not to return yet, as Israeli forces had not withdrawn from the villages. “Now we’re returning! We’re just waiting for authorisation from the army and we’ll go straight to the village – even though there are no houses left,” said Rita Darwish, a displaced resident of Dheira, a village directly on the border which was remotely detonated by Israel last month. The highway leading back to south Lebanon was choked with traffic, filled with cars filled with families and mattresses strapped to their roofs. Families lined the roads near Saida, waving and cheering as cars passed by. Despite the jubilation, doubts remained over how long the ceasefire might last. Israeli drones buzzed over the skies of Tyre and Beirut, a reminder that the war could resume at any moment. Lebanon’s army said on Wednesday morning it is preparing to deploy to the south of the country, after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah came into effect, Reuters reports. The army also asked in a statement that residents of border villages delay returning home until the Israeli military withdraws. “With the ceasefire coming into effect, the army is taking the necessary measures to complete its deployment in the south,” the army said in a statement. “The army command calls on citizens to wait before returning to frontline villages and towns that Israeli enemy forces have penetrated, awaiting their withdrawal.” The Lebanese army is expected to deploy 5,000 troops to the south under the ceasefire agreement, to help fill the breach after the IDF vacates. The call for displaced residents to delay their return also echoes an earlier warning from the Israeli military. A dispatch from my colleague William Christou, who is on the ground in Lebanon: The roads leading from Beirut to south Lebanon were filled with traffic just hours after a ceasefire was established between Hezbollah and Israel. Hezbollah and the Amal political movement issued guidelines for residents who wanted to return to their villages, south of the Litani river – though the Lebanese state had yet to advise their citizens. Lebanese reported that they had received calls with pre-recorded warnings from Israel, telling them to not return to the south as it is still a military area. Doubts over whether the ceasefire would hold were widespread, as the smell of the overnight bombing hung over the southern suburbs of Beirut and an Israeli drone buzzed overhead, despite the ceasefire. Nonetheless, residents had already returned to south Lebanon, whooping and cheering as they drove into Tyre, the second largest city in south Lebanon. Much of Tyre and surrounding cities lay in ruin, after two months of Israeli bombing. Here is our latest full report taking in the first few hours of the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah: A highly anticipated ceasefire aimed at ending the 14-month-old war between Israel and Hezbollah officially came into effect early on Wednesday morning, hours after Joe Biden hailed the “historic” moment. The ceasefire officially began at 0200 GMT – 4am in Lebanon – after the heaviest day of raids on Beirut, including a series of strikes in the city’s centre, since Israel stepped up its air campaign in Lebanon in late September before sending in ground troops. By 7am in Lebanon there were no immediate reports of alleged violations of the truce. Some celebratory gunshots could be heard in parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs. The Israeli army warned soon after the ceasefire began that residents of south Lebanon should not approach Israel Defense Forces positions and villages its forces had ordered to be evacuated. “With the entry into force of the ceasefire agreement and based on its provisions, the IDF remains deployed in its positions inside southern Lebanon,” army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X. “You are prohibited from heading towards the villages that the IDF has ordered to be evacuated or towards IDF forces in the area.” However, Reuters reporters saw dozens of cars leaving the port city of Sidon south of Beirut around 4am local time and heading deeper into southern Lebanon. Displaced people started returning to the coastal city of Tyre on motorcycles and in cars early Wednesday, defying an Israeli military warning to stay away from previously evacuated areas. Ahmad Husseini said returning to southern Lebanon was an “indescribable feeling” and praised Speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, who led Lebanon’s negotiations with Washington. “He made us and everyone proud.” Husseini, who earlier fled a town near the coastal city, spoke to The Associated Press while in his car with family members. Meanwhile, sporadic celebratory gunfire can be heard at a main roundabout in the city, as people returning honked the horns of cars – some piled with mattresses – and residents cheered. A couple of men shouted slogans praising slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September. Hussein Sweidan said he sees the ceasefire as a victory for Hezbollah. “This is a moment of victory, pride and honor for us, the Shia sect, and for all of Lebanon,” he said. Some more images crossing the wires as the day breaks in Lebanon: The UN humanitarian agency OCHA says the UN has been unable to reach people in Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, in the north of the Gaza Strip, as it continues to face denials from Israeli authorities. “Between 1 and 25 November, the UN attempted to reach these besieged areas 41 times,” OCHA said in its latest update. Thirty-seven of these attempts were outright denied, while four were initially approved, but then severely impeded on the ground such that the assistance could not be delivered to people trapped in the besieged area. Families recently displaced to Gaza City are facing critical shortages of supplies and services, severe overcrowding and dire hygiene conditions. With the onset of heavy rains, over 1.6 million people living in makeshift shelters – nearly half a million of whom are in flood-prone areas urgently need adequate shelter, the agency said. Iran on Wednesday said it welcomed the end of Israel’s “aggression” in Lebanon, after a ceasefire deal came into force between Israel and Hezbollah, an armed group backed financially and militarily by Tehran. “Welcoming the news” of the end of Israel’s “aggression against Lebanon”, foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said in a statement, AFP reported, stressing Iran’s “firm support for the Lebanese government, nation and resistance”. Iranian affairs expert Tohid Asadi told Al Jazeera that Iran’s leaders are following the ceasefire in Lebanon closely, with the top priority for Tehran being “the extent to which this is going to be translated into de-escalation”. “This is the key objective for Iran – not to see an escalated situation, not to see an all-out war scenario,” the Tehran-based Asadi said. As images continue to come in of displaced Lebanese returning to their homes in the country’s south, this story by the Guardian’s Jason Burke is worth a read for the view from Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel. “We are not expecting a promise of eternal peace,” one resident says. “I just want a quiet life to raise my kids and I know that the Lebanese people over the fence want the same … All wars end in diplomatic agreements so this will too.” More on the cautious but nevertheless celebratory mood in parts of Lebanon, via the Associated Press: As the ceasefire went into effect early Wednesday, much of the country was quiet for the first time since late September, after weeks of intense overnight strikes in southern and eastern Lebanon. Some celebratory gunshots could be heard in parts of Beirut’s southern suburbs, battered over the past two months. Israel’s Arabic military spokesperson Avichay Adraee has warned displaced Lebanese not to return to their villages in southern Lebanon, but some videos circulating on social media show displaced Lebanese defying these calls and returning to villages in the south near the coastal city of Tyre. Israeli troops are still present in parts of southern Lebanon after Israel launched a ground invasion in October. Lebanese have also been displaced from other parts of the country, notably the southern Beirut suburbs and the eastern Bekaa province. It’s unclear how long it will take cash-strapped Lebanon to rebuild these bombarded neighbourhoods. The war has displaced more than 1.2 million people, according to the Lebanese government. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has said in a statement that the ceasefire was a historic moment that was good for Israel, Lebanon and the security of the region, while also expressing hope that de-escalating tensions in Lebanon can be a catalyst for finding peace in Gaza. Our support for Israel’s security remains ironclad, and so does our support for Israel’s right to defend itself from Iranian-backed terrorist organizations like Lebanese Hizballah and Hamas. The Department will consult closely with our international and interagency partners to support the implementation of the ceasefire. As we welcome the news of this ceasefire, we also hope that de-escalating tensions across the Israel-Lebanon border also brings renewed hope for ending the tragic conflict in Gaza. We must continue to focus on improving the desperate humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and we remain committed to securing the release of all of the hostages in Gaza, including U.S. citizens. Despite a warning from the Israeli military (see earlier post here) that it was not yet safe to do so, streams of cars carrying people displaced from southern Lebanon in recent months began heading south early on Wednesday after the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah came into force. Reuters reports dozens of cars leaving the port city of Sidon south of Beirut about 4:00 a.m. local time (0200 GMT) and heading deeper into southern Lebanon. The Biden administration kept president-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration closely apprised of its efforts to broker the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah that took effect early Wednesday, according to the outgoing Democratic administration. Trump’s team, meanwhile, was quick to claim credit for the rare spot of good news for a Democratic administration that’s been dragged down by the grinding Mideast conflict, reports the Associated Press. “Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump,” Mike Waltz, Trump’s choice for his national security adviser, said in a post on X on Tuesday, shortly before the Israeli cabinet signed off on the agreement. The Biden administration’s reported coordination with Trump’s team on its efforts to forge the ceasefire in Lebanon is perhaps the highest-profile example of cooperation in a sometimes choppy transition period. Some more world leaders have been voicing support for the ceasefire: German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock welcomed the deal, hailing it as “a ray of hope for the entire region”. “People on both sides of the border want to live in genuine and lasting security,” Baerbock said in a statement, calling the deal “a success for diplomacy”. A top UN official sounded a note of caution, saying that “considerable work lies ahead” to implement the deal. “Nothing less than the full and unwavering commitment of both parties is required,” UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said in a statement. A view from Beirut after the ceasefire had come into effect: What does this mean for a ceasefire in Gaza? Bethan McKernan has the following: Importantly for the Israelis, Hezbollah has dropped its demand that a ceasefire in Lebanon is contingent on ending the fighting in Gaza. Since a truce in the Gaza war collapsed after a week last November, ceasefire negotiations have repeatedly failed. Qatar, a major mediator between Israel and Hamas, announced earlier this month it was quitting its role until both parties showed “willingness and seriousness” in the talks. Resettling or permanently reoccupying Gaza is not official Israeli policy, but senior defence officials recently told the Haaretz newspaper that the government was aiming to annex large parts of the territory rather than negotiate an end to the war. The question that has the region on edge is whether the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants will hold. The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border over the next 60 days. An international panel led by the United States will monitor compliance, while Lebanon’s national army and Unifil, the UN peacekeeping force, will be tasked with filling the void. The ceasefire does not address the devastating war in Gaza, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable. There appeared to be lingering disagreement over whether Israel would have the right to strike Hezbollah if it believed the militants had violated the agreement, something prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted was part of the deal but which Lebanese and Hezbollah officials have rejected. As the 4am ceasefire threshold stipulated by President Biden passed, the situation appeared relatively calm in Israel, the New York Times reported. Hezbollah had not set off air raid sirens in the country by firing rockets and missiles since before midnight. The quiet contrasted with some of the other scenes created by recent truces between Israel and militant groups, which saw both sides engage in minor exchanges of fire at roughly the same time those agreements were set to go into effect. There were signs of apparent celebration in Beirut and no reported violations shortly after the ceasefire took effect, the Associated Press reported. Some Israelis close to the border have expressed doubts. “In my opinion, it would be a serious mistake to sign an agreement as long as Hezbollah has not been completely eliminated,” student Maryam Younnes, 29, told AFP. Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said Israeli forces remained deployed in their positions inside southern Lebanon “as the ceasefire comes into effect and in accordance with its terms”. He warned displaced Lebanese residents from the country’s south that they could not return immediately. “We will update you when it is safe to return to your homes,” he said in a post on social media. Though the ceasefire agreed by Israel and Lebanon stipulates that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) must withdraw completely from southern Lebanon within the stipulated 60-day timeframe, the return of the troops to Israel is not expected take place immediately. It is now past 4am local time in Tel Aviv and Beirut, and 2am GMT. That means the 60-day ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah is now in force. If it holds, it represents a major milestone in the 14-month-old war in Lebanon, and in what Joe Biden called a “historic” moment as he announced the deal from the White House earlier on Tuesday. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, endorsed the ceasefire after his full cabinet approved the deal on Tuesday evening despite opposition from his far-right allies. In televised remarks, Netanyahu said he was ready to implement the deal, but added that Israel would retain “complete military freedom of action” in the event of an infringement by Hezbollah. Under the deal’s terms, Israel will withdraw entirely from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah will move its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the border. During the transition phase, the Lebanese army will deploy to the buffer border zone alongside the existing UN peacekeeping force. Longstanding border disputes will be discussed after the 60-day withdrawal period. “This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities. What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed, I emphasise, will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again,” Biden said. Fighting continued down to the final hour before the ceasefire took effect, with reports of strikes on south Beirut after the Israel army issued an evacuation warning. That came after the IDF and Hezbollah traded attacks on multiple fronts in the preceding hours (see earlier post here). Down to the final half-hour before the ceasefire comes into effect and AFP is reporting strikes on south Beirut after the Israel army’s evacuation warning. “Urgent warning to residents of the Beirut area,” army spokesperson Avichay Adraee had earlier said in a post on X, telling people in the Bachoura area in the city centre to leave, as well as “all residents in the southern suburb area”, specifically in Ghobeiry. Foreign ministers from G7 countries threw their strong support behind an immediate ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah but sidestepped the question of whether to enforce an international arrest warrant for Israel’s leader over the war in Gaza, the Associated Press reports. In their final communique, the Group of Seven ministers demanded Israel “facilitate full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance in all its forms” to Palestinians in Gaza, warning that its year-long assault had led to unprecedented food insecurity. But they didn’t refer explicitly to The Hague-based international criminal court and its arrest warrants on charges of crimes against humanity for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant. The warrants said there was reason to believe Netanyahu and Gallant have used “starvation as a method of warfare” by restricting humanitarian aid and have intentionally targeted Palestinian civilians in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza – charges Israeli officials deny. Italy had put the ICC warrants on the official G7 meeting agenda, even though members were split on the issue and the right-wing government of Premier Giorgia Meloni, a strong supporter of Israel, said they were politically motivated. The US, Israel’s closest ally, isn’t a member of the court and has called the warrants “outrageous.” All the other G7 countries are signatories and are obliged to respect and implement the court’s decisions. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier outlined his rationale for agreeing to a ceasefire in Lebanon, in a recorded video address. He provided three main reasons: to focus on the threat from Iran; replenish depleted arms supplies and rest tired reservists; and to isolate Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that triggered war in the region when it attacked Israel on 7 October last year. “They were counting on Hezbollah to fight alongside them. Now they are left alone. The pressure on them will increase and this will help to free our hostages,” he said. The United States Central Command (CENTCOM), said it carried out an airstrike earlier against an “Iranian-aligned militia weapons storage facility in Syria”, in response to an attack on US forces in the area the previous day. In a brief statement it said the purpose of the strike was to “degrade their [Iranian-aligned forces] ability to plan and launch future attacks on US and Coalition forces who are in the region”, and said that in its assessment there were no civilian casualties. There are more details on the Israeli strikes late on Tuesday which targeted Lebanon’s three northern border crossings with Syria for the first time. The strikes, Reuters reports, came moments after U.S. President Joe Biden announced that a ceasefire would come into effect on Wednesday to halt hostilities between Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Israel. Syria’s Red Crescent said a volunteer was killed and another was injured “as they were performing their humanitarian duty of rescuing the wounded early on Wednesday”. The strike damaged several ambulances and work points, it added in a statement. Syrian state TV reported 18 people were injured, some in critical condition, in an Israeli strike on the Arida border crossing, with the wounded transported to nearby hospitals, while casualties were also reported in a separate Israeli strike on the Dabousieh border crossing with Lebanon. The Israeli military did not immediately comment. It has previously stated that it targets what it says are Iran-linked sites in Syria as part of a broader campaign to curb the influence of Iran and its ally Hezbollah in the region. The 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is due to go into effect at 4am local time (0200 GMT) on Wednesday. Under the deal’s terms, Israel will withdraw entirely from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah will move its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the border. During the transition phase, the Lebanese army will deploy to the buffer border zone alongside the existing UN peacekeeping force. Longstanding border disputes will be discussed after the 60-day withdrawal period. The US is expected to be a key security guarantor. American troops will not be committed to the Israel-Lebanon border but the US, France and its allies would provide the “necessary assistance” to ensure the deal is implemented “fully and effectively”, US President Joe Biden said. He said the ceasefire was designed to lead to “a permanent cessation of hostilities”. Importantly for Israel, Hezbollah dropped its demand that a ceasefire in Lebanon was contingent on ending the fighting in Gaza. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would “maintain full freedom of military action” in Lebanon “with the United States’ full understanding”. “If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to arm itself, we will attack,” Netanyahu said. Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, earlier welcomed a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah during a call with the US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday. A series of posts on X from Mikati described the proposal as a “fundamental step towards restoring calm and stability in Lebanon and enabling displaced persons to return to their towns and cities”. He thanked the US and France for their involvement, and reiterated his government’s commitment to “strengthen the army’s presence in the south”. Mikati said: While I value the joint efforts of the United States and France in reaching this understanding, I reaffirm the government’s commitment to implementing UN security council Resolution 1701, enhancing the presence of the Lebanese Army in the South, and cooperating with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil). News of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal has been welcomed by world leaders. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, called for the ceasefire to be turned into “a lasting political solution”, adding that Britain and its allies will continue to be at the “forefront of efforts to break the ongoing cycle of violence” to achieve a “long-term, sustainable” peace in the Middle East. The president of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described it as “very encouraging news”. French President Emmanuel Macron said that a ceasefire deal agreed between Israel and Lebanon should “open the path” for an ending of the war in Gaza. UN secretary-general António Guterres said “he hopes that this agreement can put an end to the violence, destruction and suffering the people of both countries have been experiencing”. Both sides appeared intent on trading attacks in the final hours before an agreed 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah comes into force. Israeli airstrikes continued to pound Beirut even as Biden announced the ceasefire deal late on Tuesday. Israel’s military issued more evacuation warnings for Beirut’s southern suburbs through the night. Several airstrikes were reported in Beirut. “Urgent warning to residents of the Beirut area,” army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X early on Wednesday, telling people in the Bachoura area in the city centre to leave, as well as “all residents in the southern suburb area”, specifically in Ghobeiry. Hezbollah said it launched drones at “sensitive military targets” in Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening, after deadly Israeli strikes in Beirut and as news of a ceasefire deal was announced. “In response to the targeting of the capital Beirut and the massacres committed by the Israeli enemy against civilians,” Hezbollah launched “drones at a group of sensitive military targets in the city of Tel Aviv and its suburbs”, the Iran-backed group said in a statement. Israeli airstrikes killed at least 10 people in central Beirut on Tuesday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. At least seven people were killed and 37 others injured after Israel launched attacks on 20 targets on the Lebanese capital in just 120 seconds, it said. Israeli strikes late on Tuesday also targeted Lebanon’s three northern border crossings with Syria for the first time, Lebanon’s transport minister Ali Hamieh told Reuters. The strikes came moments after the US president, Joe Biden, announced that a ceasefire in Lebanon would come into effect at 4am local time (0200 GMT) on Wednesday. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East crisis. At 4am local time (0200 GMT), we are expecting a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah to come into effect. The deal was announced by Joe Biden on Tuesday, after Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said his ministers had approved it. “This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,” Biden said. Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, has welcomed the deal as a “fundamental step towards restoring calm and stability in Lebanon and enabling displaced persons to return to their towns and cities”. The US, EU, UN and G7 had all pushed for a halt in the fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah after more than a year of violence. Biden and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the ceasefire would protect Israel from Hezbollah and create the conditions for a “lasting calm”. Macron later said the deal could “open the path” for an end to the war in Gaza. In the hours before the ceasefire, Hezbollah said it launched drones at “sensitive military targets” in Tel Aviv following deadly Israeli strikes in Beirut. Here is our full report: And these are the main developments so far today: Joe Biden, the US president, announced a highly anticipated ceasefire to end the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. In remarks from the White House Rose Garden, Biden hailed the “historic” deal and said it was designed to be a “permanent cessation of hostilities”. The 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is due to go into effect at 4am local time (0200 GMT) on Wednesday. The US is expected to be a key security guarantor. American troops will not be committed to the Israel-Lebanon border but the US, France and its allies would provide the “necessary assistance” to ensure the deal is implemented “fully and effectively”, Biden said. Under the deal’s terms, Israel will withdraw entirely from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah will move its heavy weaponry north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the border. During a 60-day transition phase, the Lebanese army will deploy to the buffer border zone alongside the existing UN peacekeeping force. Longstanding border disputes will be discussed after the 60-day withdrawal period. Importantly for Israel, Hezbollah dropped its demand that a ceasefire in Lebanon was contingent on ending the fighting in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah deal will not have any direct effect on the fighting in Gaza, where US efforts to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have not led to a deal. “Just as the Lebanese people deserve a future of security and prosperity, so do the people of Gaza,” Biden said during his address on Tuesday. Asked if he would be able to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza before leaving office, Biden crossed his fingers and replied: “I think so. I hope so. I’m praying.” Biden issued a joint statement with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, pledging that both countries would work with Israel and Lebanon to ensure the agreement is “fully implemented and enforced”. “This announcement will create the conditions to restore lasting calm and allow residents in both countries to return safely to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line,” the two leaders said. Biden’s announcement came after Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, endorsed the ceasefire after his full cabinet approved the deal. Israel’s national security cabinet voted to approve the deal by 10-1, according to the prime minister’s office. The far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he opposed the agreement, calling it a “historical mistake” but did not threaten to withdraw from Netanyahu’s ruling coalition. Netanyahu said Israel would retain “complete military freedom of action” and would respond “forcefully” if Hezbollah violated the agreement. In televised remarks after the Israeli security cabinet voted on the proposal, Netanyahu said that there were three reasons to pursue a ceasefire: to focus on the threat from Iran; replenish depleted arms supplies and rest tired reservists; and to isolate Hamas. Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, welcomed the ceasefire deal, describing it as a “fundamental step towards restoring calm and stability”. Mikati thanked the US and France for their involvement, and reiterated his government’s commitment to “strengthen the army’s presence in the south”. News of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire deal was welcomed by world leaders. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, called for the ceasefire to be turned into “a lasting political solution”, adding that Britain and its allies would continue to be at the “forefront of efforts to break the ongoing cycle of violence” to achieve a “long-term, sustainable” peace in the Middle East. The president of the EU commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described it as “very encouraging news”. Israeli airstrikes continued to pound Beirut even as Biden announced the ceasefire deal late on Tuesday. With just a few hours to go until the ceasefire went into effect, Israel’s military issued more evacuation warnings for Beirut’s southern suburbs. Several airstrikes were reported in Beirut. Israeli airstrikes struck central Beirut earlier on Tuesday as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a flurry of evacuation warnings that sent large numbers of people fleeing to safer areas. Israeli airstrikes killed at least 10 people in central Beirut on Tuesday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. At least seven people were killed and 37 others injured after Israel made strikes on 20 targets on the Lebanese capital within 120 seconds, it said. At least 3,823 people have been killed and 15,859 others wounded in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since October 2023, according to the Lebanese health ministry on Tuesday. The latest figures include 55 people killed and 160 injured in strikes on Monday alone, the ministry said. At least 13 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza City on Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing medics. Dozens of people were also wounded in the strike that hit the Al-Hurreya school in the Zeitoun neighbourhood, medics said. Separately, seven people were killed during an Israeli airstrike on a house also in the Zeitoun area, and an Israeli strike killed at least one man in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah, Reuters said. Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said it should occupy the Gaza Strip and halve its Palestinian population by the “encouragement of voluntary emigration”. “We can and must conquer the Gaza Strip. We should not be afraid of that word,” Smotrich said at an event late on Monday."

          "headline": "Trump’s picks for new administration are focus of bomb threats and ‘swatting’",
          "bodyText": "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s defense secretary pick, was among several cabinet nominees and appointees of the president-elect’s incoming administration who were targeted with bomb threats and so-called “swatting” on Wednesday, the Guardian has learned. Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman of New York and Trump’s pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, who has emerged as a hard-right loyalist of Trump in the last few years, was the subject of a bomb threat, her office said. The home of Howard Lutnick, Trump’s choice for commerce secretary and part of his transition team, was threatened, the Bronx outlet News 12 reported. And Lee Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency pick, saw his Long Island home threatened, News 12 in Long Island also reported. Zeldin later posted on X saying: “A pipe bomb threat targeting me and my family at our home today was sent in with a pro-Palestinian themed message.” He said they were not at home and were trying to find out more. A report also emerged via CNN that Matt Gaetz was also targeted. The former congressman was Trump’s first choice for US attorney general but withdrew after eight days amid a sexual misconduct scandal that meant he risked not being confirmed by the Senate. A spokesperson for Trump confirmed threats against some of his cabinet picks but did not initially give any names or say how many people had received threats. The FBI then later said it was involved in investigating the incidents. But Hegseth, the military veteran steeped in controversy over his hardline conservative views and a sexual scandal, was understood to be among those threatened, according to two people familiar with the developments. He was understood to have received a threat at home of a pipe bomb targeting him. It was unclear whether the threats related to real weapons or were hoaxes, but as events unfolded in the early afternoon there was no sign of any bombs being located. The threat is understood to have prompted a law enforcement bomb squad to deploy to his residence. Apart from the social media comment from Zeldin, there were no other comments on possible motive. Israel’s war in Gaza continues even as a ceasefire was declared with Hezbollah in Lebanon. A wave of bomb threats also occurred during the election campaign, with election officials and their offices often targeted. Trump has so far put together one of the most controversial and incongruous cabinet teams in US presidential history, delighting his supporters. The threats were made on both Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Members of law enforcement and various authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those targeted, according to Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s spokesperson and incoming White House press secretary, who released a statement. Leavitt did not give further details on the nature of the different threats. Spokespeople for the FBI and the justice department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Leavitt said the attacks “ranged from bomb threats to ‘swatting’”, when a hoax call is made to police designed to prompt them to dispatch a significant, armed response to someone’s home and cause fear and maximum chaos. Stefanik’s office said in a post on X: “This morning, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, her husband, and their three-year-old son were driving home to Saratoga county from Washington for Thanksgiving when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence. New York State, county law enforcement, and US Capitol police responded immediately with the highest levels of professionalism.” Wednesday’s developments follow two assassination attempts against Trump himself during his election campaign. On 13 July, a shooter fired into the crowd during an open-air Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, injuring two attendees and killing one. Trump was grazed by the gunfire but emerged almost entirely uninjured. Two months later, on 15 September, a suspect was caught while pointing a gun toward Trump’s Mar-a-Lago golf course, where Trump was golfing. He was apprehended the same day. Both incidents prompted the campaigns of both Trump and his rival, the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, to adopt heightened security for the duration of the race. After the Pennsylvania shooting, Trump frequently appeared at rallies behind bulletproof glass."

          "bodyText": "It is approaching 8pm in Kyiv and 9pm in Moscow. This liveblog will be closing soon but you can keep up to date on the Guardian’s latest coverage of Russia and Ukraine here. Here are the latest developments: President Joe Biden’s administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and revamping its mobilisation laws to allow for the conscription of troops as young as 18. A senior Biden administration official, who spoke to the Associated Press (AP) on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private consultations, said on Wednesday that the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilisation age to 18 from the current age of 25 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available to help Ukraine in its nearly three-year-old war with Russia. Ukrainian defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said he had discussed joint steps to strengthen security and stability with South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, while on a visit to Seoul on Wednesday. “We believe that our arguments about the need to increase cooperation between Ukraine and the Republic of Korea will lead to a tangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions,” Umerov wrote in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Yoon’s office said in a statement that the president hopes that Seoul and Kyiv will work out effective ways to cope with the security threat posed by the North Korean-Russian military cooperation including the North’s troop dispatch. The Ukrainian delegation later met separately with Yoon’s national security adviser, Shin Wonsik, and defence minister, Kim Yong Hyun. During the meetings, Umerov briefed the South Korean officials on the status of the Russia-Ukraine war and expressed hope that Kyiv and Seoul will strengthen cooperation, the statement said. It said the two sides agreed to continue to share information on the North Korean troops in Russia and North Korean-Russian weapons and technology transfers while closely coordinating with the US. The South Korean statement did not say whether the two sides discussed Seoul’s possible weapons supply to Ukraine. Nordic and Baltic states and Poland said on Wednesday that they would in the coming months step up support for Ukraine, including to the country’s defence industry, and invest in making more ammunition available. “We are committed to strengthening our deterrence, and defence, including resilience, against conventional as well as hybrid attacks, and to expanding sanctions against Russia as well as against those who enable Russia’s aggression,” the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Sweden said in a statement. Russia warned the US on Wednesday to halt what it called a “spiral of escalation” over Ukraine, but said it would keep informing Washington about test missile launches in order to avoid “dangerous mistakes”. The comments from the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, sent a signal that Moscow, which last week approved a new policy that lowered its threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, wants to keep communication channels open at a time of acute tensions with the US. Ryabkov, also said on Wednesday that the use of the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine was needed to make Moscow’s voice heard, Reuters reported citing the state RIA news agency. Russia’s rouble has plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions. Russia said on Wednesday that it would expel one correspondent and one cameraman from Germany’s ARD in a symmetrical response to German moves against journalists from Russia’s Channel One that Berlin denied undertaking. WDR, a regional arm of ARD responsible for the broadcasting association’s news output from Russia, criticised Russia’s decision to strip the two German journalists of their permits to work in the country. Pushing back against Russia’s version of events, a German foreign ministry spokesperson denied that the Channel One office in Berlin was being shuttered, and said the Russian journalists’ departure was related to residence law matters. “Russian journalists can report freely and unhindered in Germany. A whole series of Russian journalists are also accredited with the Federal Press Office,” the spokesperson told a regular government news conference. Russian president Vladimir Putin arrived in Kazakhstan on Wednesday for a two-day trip aimed at shoring up ties with his Central Asian ally as tensions mount over the Ukraine war. Kazakhstan is a member of the Moscow-led CSTO security alliance but has expressed concern about the almost three-year conflict, which Kazakh president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has refused to condone. Russia said on Wednesday that if the US stationed missiles in Japan, this would threaten Russian security and prompt Moscow to retaliate. Japan’s Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday that Japan and the US aim to compile a joint military plan for a possible Taiwan emergency that includes deploying missiles. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused Japan of escalating the situation around Taiwan to justify the expansion of military ties with Washington. Any plan for the west to give Ukraine nuclear weapons would be “insane”, the Russian foreign ministry has said and claimed that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow went into Ukraine. Zakharova said it was in the interests of responsible governments to ensure that such a scenario, which she called “suicidal”, did not unfold. The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for more defence spending in Europe over the next five years, as her top team was voted in by a wafer-thin majority of MEPs. The EU faces acute challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump and the climate crisis, all against a backdrop of deepening fears of economic decline as von der Leyen starts her second term. Poland said on Wednesday that it had detained a German citizen and charged the suspect with brokering and exporting dual-use goods to Russia. The German citizen traded in specialist machines used in the technological industry, which – through his company – were illegally sent to Russian military plants involved in the production of weapons,” the Internal Security Agency (ISA) said in a statement. “The suspect pleaded guilty and filed a motion for voluntary submission to punishment.” Russia’s rouble has plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions. The rouble on Wednesday hit 110 against the dollar for the first time since 16 March 2022. Before launching its war on Ukraine in February 2022, the Russian currency traded at around 75-80 against the US dollar. The latest drop came just days after the US introduced sanctions against Gazprombank, Russia’s third-largest bank, which played a key role in processing payments for the remaining Russian natural gas exports to Europe. Earlier rounds of sanctions had spared Russian gas because Europe’s economy was so dependent on it, but it is now far less reliant on Russian supplies. The Gazprombank sanctions raise the prospect of a further decrease in gas revenues and foreign currency for Moscow. The rouble’s weakening threatens to erode Russians’ purchasing power by increasing the cost of imported goods and could further increase inflation. The country is already contending with runaway inflation, which could climb to 8.5% this year – twice the Central Bank’s target. The borscht index, an online cost of living tracker monitoring the prices of four ingredients needed to make the traditional soup, reports a 20% rise compared with 2023. The rising inflation prompted the Central Bank last month to raise interest rates to 21% – their highest level in more than 20 years – and a further hike is expected in December. The weak rouble will, however, also help the Kremlin prop up its budget – much of which comes from energy exports – in order to pay for its war in Ukraine and maintain public spending. Ukrainian defence minister, Rustem Umerov, said he had discussed joint steps to strengthen security and stability with South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, while on a visit to Seoul on Wednesday. “We believe that our arguments about the need to increase cooperation between Ukraine and the Republic of Korea will lead to a tangible strengthening of security for our peoples and regions,” Umerov wrote in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, according to Reuters. President Joe Biden’s administration is urging Ukraine to quickly increase the size of its military by drafting more troops and revamping its mobilisation laws to allow for the conscription of troops as young as 18, reports the Associated Press (AP). A senior Biden administration official, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private consultations, said on Wednesday that the outgoing Democratic administration wants Ukraine to lower the mobilisation age to 18 from the current age of 25 to help expand the pool of fighting age men available to help Ukraine in its nearly three-year-old war with Russia. The White House has pushed more than $56bn in security assistance to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s February 2022 invasion and expects to send billions more to Kyiv before Biden leaves office in less than months. But with time running out, the Biden White House is also sharpening its viewpoint that Ukraine has the weaponry it needs and now must dramatically increase its manpower if it is going to stay in the fight with Russia. According to the AP, the official said the Ukrainians believe they need about 160,000 additional troops, but the US administration believes they probably will need more. Poland said on Wednesday that it had detained a German citizen and charged the suspect with brokering and exporting dual-use goods to Russia, reports Reuters. “The German citizen traded in specialist machines used in the technological industry, which – through his company – were illegally sent to Russian military plants involved in the production of weapons,” the Internal Security Agency (ISA) said in a statement. “The suspect pleaded guilty and filed a motion for voluntary submission to punishment.” A German foreign office source said the embassy in Warsaw was in touch with Polish authorities and working urgently to get details, according to Reuters. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has already applied a range of sanctions against Moscow to diminish the Kremlin’s ability to finance the war. The sanctions include a ban on selling to Russia certain dual-use goods and technologies that have both civilian and military applications. The ISA statement did not specify the article of the criminal code under which the suspect was charged and it was not immediately clear what penalty he faces, reports Reuters. Nordic and Baltic states and Poland said on Wednesday that they would in the coming months step up support for Ukraine, including to the country’s defence industry, and invest in making more ammunition available. “We are committed to strengthening our deterrence, and defence, including resilience, against conventional as well as hybrid attacks, and to expanding sanctions against Russia as well as against those who enable Russia’s aggression,” the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Poland and Sweden said in a statement, according to Reuters. The leaders were meeting at the Swedish government’s country retreat in Harpsund, south-west of Stockholm, for talks covering transatlantic relations, regional security cooperation and a common policy on the war in Ukraine. The election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term has raised questions about the US’ commitment to supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia and about Washington’s role in Nato. Many analysts believe that Europe will have to spend more on its own defence and on bolstering Ukraine’s military effort after Trump is inaugurated in January. The Nordic and Baltic countries – several of which share a border with Russia – are among Ukraine‘s biggest backers. Aid from the Nordics, Baltics and Poland totals about €24bn, according to the Kiel Institute’s Ukraine Support Tracker, second only to the US in absolute terms. “Europe needs to take a greater responsibility for its own security,” Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said in a separate statement, reports Reuters. He said: That is preconditioned on us increasing our cooperation and continuing to support Ukraine, which is fighting for both its own and our security, over the long term.” Russia said on Wednesday that it would expel one correspondent and one cameraman from Germany’s ARD in a symmetrical response to German moves against journalists from Russia’s Channel One that Berlin denied undertaking. WDR, a regional arm of ARD responsible for the broadcasting association’s news output from Russia, criticised Russia’s decision to strip the two German journalists of their permits to work in the country, reports Reuters. “This is a drastic step. It restricts our ability to report from Moscow once again. We have been dealing with intimidation and restrictions on our reporting from Moscow for almost three years,” said WDR programming director, Joerg Schoenenborn. WDR is assessing how it might continue its work in Moscow, it said in a statement. Pushing back against Russia’s version of events, a German foreign ministry spokesperson denied that the Channel One office in Berlin was being shuttered, and said the Russian journalists’ departure was related to residence law matters. “Russian journalists can report freely and unhindered in Germany. A whole series of Russian journalists are also accredited with the Federal Press Office,” the spokesperson told a regular government news conference. Residence law falls within the competences of the regional states, or Laender, which make decisions independently of the federal government in Berlin, he added. The spokesperson said the government was in close contact with German media in Moscow because of concerns that Russia was taking “very vehement” action against journalists. According to Reuters, the Nordic states, the three Baltic republics and Poland said in a joint statement on Wednesday they would step up their support for Ukraine and make more ammunition available to it in the coming months. We will update the blog with more on this story as soon as possible. The head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for more defence spending in Europe over the next five years, as her top team was voted in by a wafer-thin majority of MEPs. The European parliament’s endorsement of the new EU executive by the narrowest-ever margin clears the way for von der Leyen and her chosen 26 European commissioners to start a five-year term on Sunday. The EU faces acute challenges, including the war in Ukraine, the return of Donald Trump and the climate crisis, all against a backdrop of deepening fears of economic decline as von der Leyen starts her second term. She told MEPs in the run-up to the vote that there was “something wrong in [the] equation” where Russia was spending up to 9% of GDP on defence while the European average was 1.9%. “War is raging at Europe’s borders and we must be ready for what lies ahead, working hand in hand with Nato,” she told MEPs. “Our defence spending must increase,” she added, calling for efforts to boost the European defence industry and common defence projects. Von der Leyen said Europe faced difficult choices that required “massive investments in our security and our prosperity”. For the past three years, the CIA has run an unusually bold outreach programme. It targeted Russians within the country’s government and security services, attempting to turn them into double agents. Slickly produced recruitment videos portrayed cooperation with the US secret agency as the patriotic choice for officials disaffected with Vladimir Putin’s regime and the war in Ukraine. The videos ended with instructions on how to contact the CIA in a secure manner. Come January, however, any Russians who answered those calls will be facing a very different geopolitical reality. Donald Trump will be back in the White House and, if he pursues the same policies as last time around, will look to make an ally of Putin’s Russia. His nomination for a key intelligence post is Tulsi Gabbard, who has raised concerns with her remarks on foreign policy in recent years, including speaking of “Russia’s legitimate security concerns” as part of the cause of the war in Ukraine. The dramatic change in potential policy towards Russia and Ukraine, combined with Trump’s well-established dismissiveness of concerns over the security of classified information, may lead to sleepless nights among any double agents who remain inside Russia. “We don’t know for sure whether recruitments have been made, and nor should we know, but it’s certainly been the strategy, and moments of crisis like this in the past have been a golden opportunity for recruitment drives for western services,” said Calder Walton, an intelligence historian at Harvard’s Kennedy School and the author of a recent book on the history of the intelligence battle between Moscow and Washington. Russia said on Wednesday that if the US stationed missiles in Japan, this would threaten Russian security and prompt Moscow to retaliate, reports Reuters. Japan’s Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday that Japan and the US aim to compile a joint military plan for a possible Taiwan emergency that includes deploying missiles. According to Reuters, it cited unnamed US and Japanese sources as saying that under the plan, the US would deploy missile units to the Nansei islands of Japan’s south-western Kagoshima and Okinawa prefectures, and to the Philippines. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused Japan of escalating the situation around Taiwan to justify the expansion of military ties with Washington. She said: We have repeatedly warned the Japanese side that if, as a result of such cooperation, American medium-range missiles appear on its territory, this will pose a real threat to the security of our country and we will be forced to take the necessary, adequate steps to strengthen our own defence capability.” Zakharova said Tokyo could get an idea of what such steps would entail by reading Russia’s updated nuclear doctrine, published last week, which expanded the list of scenarios under which it would consider using nuclear weapons. On Monday, deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia would consider deploying short- and intermediate-range missiles in Asia if the US deployed such missiles to the continent. According to Reuters, when asked about that statement, Zakharova declined to discuss where Russia might site such weapons, but noted that half its territory is in Asia so any Russian missiles potentially deployed east of the Urals would be in that region. She said Moscow had sent a clear signal to the US and its “satellites” that Russia would respond decisively and in symmetrical fashion to the placing of land-based medium and shorter-range missiles in various parts of the world. She added that the west should have no doubts about Russia’s potential after it launched a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile, the Oreshnik, at a target in Ukraine last week. Any plan for the west to give Ukraine nuclear weapons would be “insane”, the Russian foreign ministry has said and claimed that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow went into Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said it was in the interests of responsible governments to ensure that such a scenario, which she called “suicidal”, did not unfold. She said that what she called “irresponsible actions” by Ukraine and its western backers could bring the world to “the brink of catastrophe.” Further to our earlier report, Germany rejected Russia’s claims it had shut a Russian TV channel’s Berlin bureau as ‘false’ on Wednesday, and criticised moves to expel two German journalists from Moscow in retaliation. “The Russian claims are false, the federal government has not closed the office of this broadcaster,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Christian Wagner. Commenting on reports Moscow would expel two German journalists in retaliation for the alleged closure, he said that Germany would reject such a move “in the strongest possible terms”. Russian state-controlled media outlets have faced restrictions in the west including broadcast bans since Moscow launched its Ukraine offensive, as western regulators accuse them of spreading disinformation. Russian state broadcaster Channel One’s correspondent Ivan Blagoi said on air that he and cameraman Dmitry Volkov were notified on Tuesday that they “must leave German territory in the first half of December”. Russia said on Wednesday it was expelling two correspondents from German public broadcaster ARD in retaliation. In Berlin, Wagner said about the two Russian journalists that “I can only assume that this is related to questions of residence rights”, which were a matter for regional, not national, authorities. “Russian journalists can report freely and unhindered in Germany,” he added, stressing that many Russian journalists are accredited in the country. He said that the Russian broadcaster “has been subject to EU sanctions since December 2022” – but that while this banned it from broadcasting in Europe, it did not impose any reporting restrictions. Russia’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that if the United States stationed missiles in Japan than it would pose a threat to Russia and Moscow would have to take retaliatory steps. Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova suggested that Russia’s nuclear doctrine be consulted to give a guide on what retaliatory steps could be taken in such a situation. Zakharova said that the United States continued to escalate the situation around Taiwan, undermining regional stability. She said that the United States had deployed medium-range missiles in the Philippines, a step she said would stoke an arms race and increase strategic risks. Germany has not closed the office of Russian broadcaster Channel One, and two journalists from the station who have reportedly been ordered to leave was a state matter related to residency requirements, said a German foreign ministry spokesperson. “Russian journalists can report freely and unhindered in Germany. A whole series of Russian journalists are accredited with the federal press office,” said the spokesperson on Wednesday, emphasising that the office had not been closed. A government spokesperson said that residency law was a matter for state authorities, but “if you don’t meet the residency requirements, then it’s no use working as a journalist, you have to meet the requirements”. The foreign ministry is in close contact with media colleagues in Moscow due to concerns that Russia is taking “very vehement” actions against journalists, added the spokesperson. Russian president Vladimir Putin arrived in Kazakhstan on Wednesday for a two-day trip aimed at shoring up ties with his Central Asian ally as tensions mount over the Ukraine war. Kazakhstan is a member of the Moscow-led CSTO security alliance but has expressed concern about the almost three-year conflict, which Kazakh president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has refused to condone. In an article published in Russia’s Izvestia newspaper before Putin’s visit, Tokayev emphasised his country’s support for “peaceful dialogue”, without mentioning Ukraine. Putin praised Kazakhstan’s “close [to Russian] cultural, spiritual and moral values” in an article published in a state-run Kazakh paper, saying he was ready to further develop “friendly and allied relations” with Astana. Russian state media showed footage of Putin’s plane landing in the capital on Wednesday. Trade ties between the two countries have frayed in recent months, with Moscow banning some Kazakh agricultural exports a day after the Central Asian state declined to join Brics. Putin has made expanding the alliance of emerging economies a pillar of Russia’s foreign policy, touting BRICS as a powerful counterweight to what he sees as a global western “hegemony”. Russia’s rouble has plunged to its lowest rate against the dollar since the early weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in the wake of new western sanctions and growing geopolitical tensions, reports my colleague Pjotr Sauer. The rouble on Wednesday hit 110 against the dollar for the first time since 16 March 2022. Before launching its war on Ukraine in February of 2022, the Russian currency traded at around 75-80 against the US dollar. The latest drop came just days after the US introduced sanctions against Gazprombank, Russia’s third largest bank, which played a key role in processing payments for the remaining Russian natural gas exports to Europe. The full story is here: Russia warned the US on Wednesday to halt what it called a “spiral of escalation” over Ukraine, but said it would keep informing Washington about test missile launches in order to avoid “dangerous mistakes”, reports Reuters. The comments from the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, sent a signal that Moscow, which last week approved a new policy that lowered its threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, wants to keep communication channels open at a time of acute tensions with the US. Ryabkov was speaking six days after Russia launched what it described as a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile called the Oreshnik against Ukraine – something he said had sent a clear message to the west. “The signal is very clear and obvious – stop, you should not do this any more, you mustn’t supply Kyiv with everything they want, don’t encourage them towards new military adventures, they are too dangerous,” state media quoted Ryabkov as saying. It cited Ryabkov as saying: The current (US) administration must stop this spiral of escalation. They simply must, otherwise the situation will become too dangerous for everyone, including the United States itself.” Russia’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday that it will expel one correspondent and one cameraman from Germany’s ARD in a tit-for-tat response to German moves against Russia’s Channel One, reports Reuters. Channel One reported that Germany was closing its Berlin bureau and that two Russian journalists, a correspondent and cameraman, working for the channel had been ordered to leave Germany on security grounds. Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Wednesday that the use of the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine was needed to make Moscow’s voice heard, Reuters reports citing the state RIA news agency. RIA reported Ryabkov as saying that Russia did not believe that the time for negotiations with the west had passed, but that it now needed to use stronger methods in order to get its point heard clearly. Further to our previous post a Ukrainian delegation led by defence minister, Rustem Umerov, meeting South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, the Associated Press (AP) has further details. According to the AP, Yoon’s office said in a statement that the president hopes that Seoul and Kyiv will work out effective ways to cope with the security threat posed by the North Korean-Russian military cooperation including the North’s troop dispatch. The Ukrainian delegation later met separately with Yoon’s national security adviser, Shin Wonsik, and defence minister, Kim Yong Hyun. During the meetings, Umerov briefed the South Korean officials on the status of the Russia-Ukraine war and expressed hope that Kyiv and Seoul will strengthen cooperation, the statement said. It said the two sides agreed to continue to share information on the North Korean troops in Russia and North Korean-Russian weapons and technology transfers while closely coordinating with the US. The AP reports that the South Korean statement did not say whether the two sides discussed Seoul’s possible weapons supply to Ukraine. Ukraine’s defence minister arrived in South Korea and is holding bilateral meetings, Kyiv said on Wednesday, after reports that officials from the countries would discuss potential South Korean military support for Ukraine. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the trip comes as South Korea signalled it could reverse a longstanding policy of not providing weapons to countries in conflict after revelations that North Korea had deployed thousands of troops to aid Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence ministry confirmed to AFP that defence chief, Rustem Umerov, is already in South Korea and that “his meetings there are taking place”. South Korean media had reported a planned meeting between Umerov and president Yoon Suk Yeol – though the presidential office declined to confirm to AFP. The Ukrainian delegation was expected to “share intelligence on North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia” and seek Seoul’s support for Kyiv’s war efforts, South Korean Yonhap news agency reported, citing unnamed sources. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an interview with South Korean media last month that his country was preparing to submit a list of needed military support. “This will be carried out simultaneously with our envoy, who will visit South Korea soon, and discussions will be held on weapons support,” Zelenskyy said according to a transcript by KBS. He added the list would include artillery support and air defence systems. According to AFP, earlier this month, Yoon said whether – or how – South Korea decides to help Ukraine directly depends on “the level of North Korean involvement” in the conflict, adding that Seoul was “not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons”. If South Korea were to supply arms, the initial batch would be defensive in nature, Yoon said. Ukraine is reliant on western air defence systems, particularly Patriots, to protect itself from Russian missile barrages – and has been calling for more deliveries. South Korea, which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North and has maintained production of weaponry long overlooked by western arms industries, could make a significant impact if it decides to supply weapons, experts say. Lawmakers in Russia’s upper house of parliament on Wednesday approved an almost 30% increase in defence spending next year, committing the country to yet more huge outlays as it wages its military offensive against Ukraine, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Moscow had already ramped up military spending to levels not seen since the Soviet era, pumping out missiles and drones to fire on Ukraine and paying lucrative salaries to its hundreds of thousands of frontline soldiers, according to AFP. The 2025 budget will see a record 13.5tn rubles ($125bn) spent on “national defence”, more than outlays for welfare and education combined. That figure does not include some other resources being directed to the military campaign, such as spending that Russia labels as “domestic security” and some outlays classified as top secret. The budget will now be sent to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to sign into law. More on that in a moment. Here are some of the other key updates on the Russia-Ukraine war: South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, met on Wednesday with a Ukrainian envoy and said he hoped the countries would come up with an effective response to the threat posed by Russia’s military cooperation with North Korea, Yoon’s office said. Russian’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that its forces had taken control of the settlement of Nova Illinka, close to the embattled Donetsk region town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine, the TASS state news agency reported. TASS also cited the defence ministry as saying that Ukrainian forces had attacked the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant with drones and artillery. Ukraine’s defence ministry is investigating defective mortar shells after at least 100,000 Ukrainian-made 120mm rounds had to be removed from the frontline. Soldiers began saying in early November that the rounds failed to explode, remained stuck in the launcher or fell off target, according to private Ukrainian TV 1+1. The defence ministry confirmed it had stopped using them on the frontline “until the causes of the malfunction are determined” and seized part of the supply. The Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile fired by Russia at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro last week carried multiple warheads but no explosives and caused limited damage, two senior Ukrainian government sources said. The Kremlin described it as a warning to the west after the US and the UK allowed Ukraine to fire their missiles inside Russia. Russia said it was expelling a British diplomat that it accused of espionage and had summoned London’s ambassador to the foreign ministry in Moscow. A No 10 spokesperson said: “To be clear, we refute these allegations. They’re baseless. We’re now considering our response. This is not the first time that Putin’s government has made malicious, baseless accusations against our staff.” On Tuesday the Kremlin also banned cabinet ministers including Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves from entering Russia under new sanctions. It comes after the UK imposed fresh sanctions on 30 oil tankers from Russia’s “shadow fleet” as Ukraine’s allies try to squeeze Vladimir Putin’s funding of the war. Russian shelling killed two civilians in the city of Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president. Earlier, Russian forces staged their largest ever drone attack on Ukraine over Monday night into Tuesday – cutting power to much of the western city of Ternopil and damaging residential buildings in Kyiv region, Ukraine’s officials said. Speaking in Athens, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, has said he wants the alliance “to go further to change the trajectory of the conflict” in the Ukrainians’ favour. Nato needed to more than just “keep Ukraine in the fight”, he suggested. Rutte highlighted the importance of strengthening the bloc’s “deterrence and defence” and the critical need to increase investment and production in the arms industry. The US is continuing to surge security assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defences in the east, Antony Blinken, Joe Biden’s secretary of state, said on Tuesday after meetings with the Group of Seven democracies. The Kremlin said it was preparing retaliatory measures, claiming that Ukraine twice fired US-made Atacms missiles into Russia in the last three days. Moscow said both strikes targeted air defence positions in the Kursk region. Ukrainian prosecutors said on Tuesday that Russian forces had murdered five soldiers immediately after taking them prisoner in the eastern Donetsk region, building on previous war crimes allegations against Moscow. There was no immediate response to the claims from Moscow. The Ukrainian rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said he had contacted the UN and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) over the allegations. A journalist who once freelanced for the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty was sentenced on Tuesday to four years in prison in Russia after being convicted of cooperating with a foreign organisation. Nika Novak, 24, was found guilty after a closed hearing in the Zabaikalsky regional court in the far-eastern city of Chita. The human rights group Memorial has described Novak as a political prisoner and the RFE/RL president and CEO, Stephen Capus, said: “We condemn today’s unjust conviction and sentencing of RFE/RL journalist Nika Novak in Russia. These politically motivated charges are intended to silence individual reporters and cause a chilling effect.”"

          "headline": "Nationwide’s £2.3bn takeover gain prompts criticism of Virgin Money bosses",
          "bodyText": "Nationwide building society has revealed a £2.3bn gain from its takeover of Virgin Money, prompting accusations that Virgin’s bosses decided to “take the money and run” after losing faith in the ex-chief executive David Duffy. The building society’s bosses hailed the terms of the deal on Wednesday, as it published its final set of results as a standalone brand. Although the £2.8bn it paid for Virgin Money represented a premium on the target-bank’s share price – and its £2bn market valuation prior to the bid, according to Guardian calculations – it ended up being a “significant” discount compared with the actual value of Virgin Money’s assets. Those assets are worth £5.1bn, Nationwide said, weeks after the deal completed in October. That represents a £2.3bn gain on the purchase price, which is even higher than the £1.5bn gain it had previously forecast. “I don’t think there was any surprise,” Nationwide’s chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, said. “Certainly wasn’t any surprise for us. It was very thoughtful and very considered, and certainly on the Virgin Money board, they would have been very, very aware of this, as all of their competitors would have been about where they were trading.” Investors and bosses have long bemoaned the floundering market valuations of UK banks on the London Stock Exchange. However, some analysts say the discounted sale price was also a sign that bosses had given up on Duffy and the 29-year-old bank. “I think it highlights that the Virgin Money board didn’t have faith that the CEO’s plan to generate higher profitability from the business to support a higher standalone valuation was going to be successful, so they decided to take the money and run,” Gary Greenwood, a banking analyst at Shore Capital, said. “They were struggling to deliver growth, particularly in mortgages, and were suffering from a funding disadvantage versus larger banking peers, which meant they had thinner margins. “They also kept disappointing on below-the-line costs, noting management had only recently announced another [plan] to invest a further £130m in cybersecurity, which had not been expected by the market and so was not in forecasts. Consequently, the profits they generated were well below where they needed to be.” Virgin Money bosses were due to share a £6m payout as a result of the deal, after accumulating stock through years of service at the bank, which was co-founded by the billionaire Sir Richard Branson in 1995. That included the head of Virgin Money’s legal team, James Peirson, who was due a £691,812 windfall, and the chief financial officer, Clifford Abrahams, who was set for a £415,494 payout. Duffy, who resigned in October as part of the takeover agreement, was due to take the lion’s share of the windfall, gaining about £3.5m from the buyout of his nearly 1.6m shares. Branson, who was Virgin Money’s largest shareholder and had backed the deal, will experience the biggest windfall of £724m. That includes £414m from his 14.5% stake. However, it also accounts for the £310m that Nationwide has agreed to pay for the use of the Virgin Money brand, a sum that includes £15m in annual royalties for the first four years, as well as a £250m exit fee, which will lead to the name disappearing from UK high streets within six years. However, Crosbie said the £2.3bn gain would still give Nationwide “significant headroom” to cover the costs of integrating the two businesses, as well as service and value for customers. She hinted that could mean further payouts and competitive interest rates for account holders. Crosbie said: “You should expect to see a really great package announced at the full year … and we’re working hard to make sure that that’s as attractive as it can possibly be.” Her comments came as Nationwide published its half-year results, which showed that pre-tax profits fell 43% to £568m in the six months to 30 September. Bosses said this was due to falling interest rates, but also money spent on payouts and deals for customers."

          "headline": "What are the terms of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire and will it succeed?",
          "bodyText": "A ceasefire to end 14 months of fighting between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah has come into effect, with Lebanese civilians already returning to the devastated south of the country. Do we know the details of the deal? The agreement follows the contours of UN security council resolution 1701, which ended the 36-day Israel-Hezbollah war of 2006, but was never fully implemented. The deal requires Israel’s military to withdraw from southern Lebanon and Hezbollah to pull its heavy weapons north of the Litani River, about 16 miles (25km) north of the frontier. The western-backed Lebanese army is expected to deploy to the south during a 60-day transition phase. While Hezbollah is part of the Lebanese government, its forces are not part of the official military. A copy of the ceasefire deal seen by Reuters stipulated that only “official military and security forces” in Lebanon will be allowed to carry weapons. Hezbollah is unlikely to disarm completely but might reduce its armed presence in public. Israel has long complained of Hezbollah stationing weaponry near its territory while Hezbollah has claimed only it – not the weaker Lebanese state army – is powerful enough to resist Israel’s expansionist policies. The hope is that the ceasefire will become permanent, and the deal will be monitored by a US-led supervisory mechanism that will act as a referee on infringements. A letter of assurance that is not formally part of the deal reportedly guarantees US support for Israeli freedom of action if Hezbollah attacks Israel again or moves its forces or weaponry south of the Litani. Is it likely to work? Israel appears to have come to the table after warnings from Washington that a failure to agree a ceasefire would prompt the US not to veto a UN security council resolution that would impose a ceasefire under disadvantageous conditions for Israel. Hezbollah, which the US considers a terrorist organisation, participated in the talks for the truce via mediators and has not formally commented on the ceasefire. Israel will be glad of the opportunity to rest its tired ground forces and reservists and repair and replenish munitions and inventory. It is also pleased that the US, its major ally, will be directly involved in mediating violations. What is the situation on the ground? There has been fierce fighting over the past few days as both sides seek to solidify gains. Israel carried out intensive airstrikes on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, and across the south of the country on Monday and Tuesday, after Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets into Israel on Sunday – one of the heaviest attacks since the war began. The conflict escalated in late September, when hundreds of Hezbollah pagers exploded in an attack attributed to Israel. Israel then killed much of Hezbollah’s leadership in airstrikes, and launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. About 3,700 people have been killed in Lebanon, and 126 people in Israel by the fighting. Hundreds of thousands on both sides of the frontier have been displaced from their homes. What about a ceasefire in the war in Gaza? Importantly for the Israelis, Hezbollah has dropped its demand that a ceasefire in Lebanon is contingent on ending the fighting in Gaza. Since a truce in the Gaza war collapsed after a week last November, ceasefire negotiations have repeatedly failed. Qatar, a major mediator between Israel and Hamas, announced earlier this month it was quitting its role until both parties showed “willingness and seriousness” in the talks. Resettling or permanently reoccupying Gaza is not official Israeli policy, but senior defence officials recently told the Haaretz newspaper that the government was aiming to annex large parts of the territory rather than negotiate an end to the war."

          "headline": "Full list of 56 year 12 exams affected by ‘cheat sheets’ leak released by Victorian government",
          "bodyText": "The full list of exams affected by the VCE “cheat sheet” bungle has been released by the Victorian government, and includes English, which is compulsory for almost all year 12 students. The education minister, Ben Carroll, had previously revealed that 56 of the 116 VCE exams had been affected by a “publishing error”, which saw the release of questions weeks before the tests were sat. The questions – either identical of very similar to those in the final exams – were contained in Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) sample cover pages, which contained hidden text in seemingly blank sections. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The sample cover pages became de-facto cheat sheets, and were available online for weeks before the were pulled. On Wednesday, Carroll released the list of affected exams, which also includes popular subjects such as biology, history, legal studies, maths (foundation, methods and specialist streams) and politics. “There is no risk that any other exams were impacted in this way,” Carroll said. The VCAA’s interim chief executive, Marcia Devlin, said while English and English as an additional language were included on the list of affected exams, the information for both were instructional and did not include any questions or answers. “It is clear from the expert assessment of the material published early that no possible advantage could have been gained by any student through accessing that material,” Devlin said. “The material that was published earlier for the English exam was either already in the public domain through advice on how the English exam is structured this year, or so general as to be of no assistance.” She said the marking of the English exam would proceed as usual. Devlin said early advice from an independent expert advisory panel brought in to review the exams indicated this was likely the case for other exams. She said in many of the exams, “only a partial question or prompt was released” in the cheat sheets. “In no case was the full examination published early,” Devlin said. Carroll said he still had “many questions” about the saga, which was why he ordered a “root-and-branch review” into the structure and operations of the VCAA. Last week, it was announced the chief executive, Kylie White, had resigned from the VCAA. Carroll said the possible advantage to students who had accessed the cheat sheets would not be clear until exams had been marked. He said he was confident VCE results would still be published by 12 December, well before the first round of university offers in mid-January.

          "bodyText": "Automakers have petitioned Trump, as fears of tariff-induced consequences loom. The price of vehicles will significantly increase under Trump, especially if he implements his 25% tariff. This live coverage is ending now, thanks for following along. You can find the latest stories here. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also said that the Trump team had its own ethics plan, rather than the formal government one, leaving unclear whether all relevant transition aides would be eligible to receive full government briefings that included classified information. That caveat on the ethics plan dovetailed with reporting by the Guardian that the Trump team is planning for political appointees to receive temporary security clearances on the first day and only face FBI background checks after it had taken over the bureau. Trump’s lack of interest in engaging with the formal transition stems from the first Trump administration, when officials turned over transition team records to the Russia investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump has previously broken convention with the transfer of power. In 2016, his campaign organized what appeared to be a standard process, until Trump fired his transition team’s leadership after he won the election and cut off communications with the Obama administration. In 2020, Trump again seemed to follow standard procedure until immediately after the election, pressuring the General Services Administration to not recognize Joe Biden’s election win so his team could not access the federal financial assistance. Here is more on the Trump transition team finally signing a memo to start the process of transitioning from the Biden administration. Signing the MOU normally unlocks up to $7.2m in government funding to help staffing costs and other expenses, as well as the use of government office space through the nonpartisan General Services Administration. The financial assistance comes with strings attached – the transition team has to agree to disclose its donors and impose a $5,000 limit on contributions – and the agreement was supposed to be signed months before the election. The transition team is normally supposed to sign an ethics agreement, which paves the way for transition aides to start receiving government information such as classified briefings and the granting of security clearances. The announcement by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles in a press release suggested that the Trump team had negotiated its own language around some of those restrictions. While the Trump team was committed to making the identities of its donors public, and would not accept any foreign contributions, Wiles said that it would not be using any government money and its entire operation would be privately funded. Government ethics experts have previously noted that such an arrangement would allow people seeking to curry favor with the Trump White House to donate directly to him, raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest. A little more information now on that Bloomberg report that Trump is expected to name Jamieson Greer as the US Trade Representative. Greer, an attorney who has practised international trade law, served as chief of staff to the USTR Robert Lighthizer during the first Trump administration. Trump has already announced Howard Lutnick as his choice for commerce secretary. Lutnick will have “direct responsibility” for the Office of the US Trade Representative, he said last week. Three weeks after Nebraska voters overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana, the state moved a step closer to allowing it Tuesday when a judge ruled that the petitions that put the question on the ballot were valid, the Associated Press reports. The decision by Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong was a victory for advocates of medical marijuana, but opponents are likely to appeal it to the state supreme court. “To prevail in this action, the plaintiff and Secretary had to show that more than 3,463 signatures on the legalisation Petition and 3,357 signatures on the Regulatory Petition are invalid. The Plaintiff and Secretary are well short,” Strong wrote. Fewer than 1,000 signatures on each petition were shown to be invalid. A spokesperson for the Nebraska attorney general said the office’s lawyers were reviewing the ruling and considering whether to file an appeal. More than two-thirds of Nebraska voters supported legalisation at the polls on 5 November. The results are scheduled to be certified on 2 December. Here is Biden announcing that Israel and Hezbollah have accepted a ceasefire deal, which will commence at 4am local time on Wednesday: Bloomberg reports that Trump is preparing to announce Jamieson Greer as United States Trade Representative. It cites people familiar with the matter. Politico, in a previous article on who Trump might choose, wrote of Greer, “Despite helping to upend global trade paradigms, Greer is well respected by both parties in Washington, industry groups and foreign governments. Since leaving office, he has served as a point of contact in Washington for foreign dignitaries seeking insight about what a second Trump term would mean for trade. He is a partner for international trade at the King &amp; Spalding law firm.” Tim Walz accepted the symbolic presentation of a turkey Tuesday as he eases back into his duties as Minnesota’s governor following the Harris-Walz ticket’s defeat in the presidential election, the Associated Press reports. Unlike the Minnesota-grown turkeys that President Joe Biden pardoned at the White House on Monday, Walz didn’t pardon this turkey, he said, “because in Minnesota we know turkeys are delicious.” The 41.8-pounder (19 kilograms) named Tom was raised by Paisley VonBerge, a Future Farmers of America leader from Hutchinson, and it will star in her family’s Thanksgiving dinner. “After today, this bird will go back to my farm to be enjoyed the way that turkeys are intended,” Paisley said. “That is very Minnesotan,” Walz added to loud laughter. “We don’t hide the fact we love our turkeys.” Today So Far Thanks for joining us so far today. Here’s a short summary of the biggest headlines we’ve covered today: Speaking at an emergency gathering of the Canadian parliament today, prime minister Justin Trudeau urged unity while members of the country’s conservative and new democratic parties called for Canada First policies and preparations for a trade war in response to Donald Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs. Earlier in the day, Trudeau said he had “a good call” with the US president-elect. Meanwhile, Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum sent a letter to Trump, warning him that his pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada will cause inflation and job losses in both countries. “To one tariff will come another and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk,” Sheinbaum said at a press conference earlier today. Speaking from the White House, Joe Biden has announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. “Under the deal reached today, effective at 4am tomorrow local time, the fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border will end,” he said. “This is designed to be a permanent cesation of hostility.” The White House has confirmed that the incoming Trump administration has signed transition paperwork, called the White House memorandum of understanding. Trump’s team declined to sign a separate agreement with the General Services Administration, and negotiations are still ongoing regarding an agreement with the Department of Justice. Speaking in Eagle Pass, Texas today, Donald Trump’s incoming “border czar” promised to secure the Texas-Mexico border. Tom Homan praised Operation Lone Star, a $11 billion border security initiative, and pledged to fight Democratic governors and mayors who try to block Trump’s proposed mass deportations. A federal judge rejected Rudy Giuliani’s request to reschedule a January trial date for after Donald Trump’s inauguration. A day after Elon Musk claimed to have met with “senior military officers,” the Pentagon told reporters it was not aware of any meetings with Trump transition officials, the Washington Post reports. Research by ING has estimated that if the costs of the new tariffs are fully passed on to consumers, then Americans will face having to pay $2,400 more per capita annually for goods. The report says that also taking into account potential labour shortages due to Trump’s plans to crackdown on immigration – with a vow to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history” – there could be a 1% increase in inflation in the US. Donald Trump is expected to name Kevin Hassett to lead the National Economic Council, Bloomberg and Politico report. Hassett served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during Trump’s first administration and has supported Republican tariff proposals. The position does not require Senate confirmation. Speaking in Eagle Pass, Texas today, Donald Trump’s incoming “border czar” promised to secure the Texas-Mexico border. Tom Homan spoke to Texas State Guard members and state troopers alongside Texas governor Greg Abbott and the head of the US Customs and Border Protection union. “It’s a shame the taxpayers of Texas had to spend billions of dollars to do the job this administration would not do,” Homan said, referencing Operation Lone Star, a $11 billion border security initiative. Under the incoming Trump administration, Homan said “we’re going to secure this nation to the highest level ever seen.” Referencing steps Democratic governors and mayors are taking to prepare for Trump’s second presidency, and possibly block Trump’s proposed mass deportations, Homan said: “Don’t cross that line. Don’t test us.” The White House has confirmed that the incoming Trump administration has signed transition paperwork, called the White House memorandum of understanding. Trump’s team declined to sign a separate agreement with the General Services Administration, and negotiations are still ongoing regarding an agreement with the Department of Justice. White House spokesperson Saloni Sharma said the White House and General Services Administration “repeatedly made the case” to Trump’s team to sign the agreements beginning in September. Joe Biden and his chief of staff reiterated the importance of the transition agreements, which allow confidential briefings to begin, in a 13 November Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump and his chief of staff Susie Wiles, CNN reports. Biden’s chief of staff emphasized the importance of the agreement in a second meeting with Wiles on 19 November. The White House agreement “will allow for certain, authorized members of the Trump transition team to have access to agency and White House employees, facilities, and information,” said Sharma. By refusing to sign an agreement with the General Services Administration, the Trump transition team will forgo federal funding, equipment, office space and security. In an election post-mortem today, top Harris campaign officials said there was little else Kamala Harris could have done to win the 2024 election. Speaking on the podcast “Pod Save America”, David Plouffe, Jen O’Malley Dillon, Quentin Fulks and Stephanie Cutter said Harris couldn’t have distanced herself further from Joe Biden because she was loyal and faced backlash over inflation that’s hurt incumbent politicians across the globe this year. “She had tremendous loyalty to President Biden,” Cutter said. “Imagine if we said, ‘Well, we would have taken this approach on the border.’ Imagine the round of stories coming out after that, of people saying, ‘Well, she never said that in the meeting.’” Plouffe added that the campaign’s internal polling never showed Harris leading president-elect Donald Trump. “We didn’t get the breaks we needed on Election Day,” he said. “I think it surprised people, because there was these public polls that came out in late September, early October, showing us with leads that we never saw.” Fulks noted that Democrats could learn from how Republicans support their own, even amid controversy. “Democrats are eating our own to a very high degree, and until that stops, we’re not going to be able to address a lot of the things that just need to be said,” he said. During a thank-you call today, Kamala Harris told small-dollar donors that they helped to raise $1.4 billion over the course of her 107-day campaign. “The outcome of the election, of this election, obviously, is not what we wanted. It is not what we worked so hard for, but I am proud of the race we ran and your role was critical — what we did in 107 days was unprecedented,” she said. “The fight that fueled our campaign, a fight for freedom and opportunity, did not end on November 5th.” Harris’s running mate, Minnesota governor Tim Walz, joined the call and urged supporters to “find the place in your community to heal both yourselves and your community.” He acknowledged feels of grief that supporters might be feeling and added, “You did everything that was asked.” Donald Trump’s team has announced that it has signed transition paperwork with the White House, which the incoming administration appeared to be dodging after failing to sign the agreement by its 1 October due date. The agreement, which directs $7.2m in federal funding to the transition, requires the incoming presidential administration to agree to an ethics pledge and cap private donations. The announcement that Trump’s team had signed the memorandum of understanding with the White House came in a press release from Trump’s chief-of-staff Susie Wiles. “After completing the selection process of his incoming Cabinet, President-elect Trump is entering the next phase of his administration’s transition by executing a Memorandum of Understanding with President Joe Biden’s White House. This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power,” she said. Speaking from the White House, Joe Biden has announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah. “Under the deal reached today, effective at 4am tomorrow local time, the fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border will end,” he said. “This is designed to be a permanent cesation of hostility.” Explaining the terms of the deal, Biden said, the Lebanese army will take control of the region as Israel withdraws its forces over the next 60 days. Hezbollah will not be allowed to rebuild its infrastructure. “There will be no US troops deployed in southern Lebanon,” he said, adding that the US and France would continue to provide support to Lebanon. If Lebanon fails to abide by the terms of the agreement, Biden said, Israeli retains the right to defend itself. “Now Hamas has a choice to make,” Biden said, gesturing to the ongoing war in Gaza. “Over the coming days, the United States will make another push - with Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and others – to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza.” A day after Elon Musk claimed to have met with “senior military officers,” the Pentagon told reporters it was not aware of any meetings with Trump transition officials, the Washington Post reports. “The president-elect’s transition team has not contacted the department yet to conduct those transitions, so I’m not aware of any official meetings,” Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder told reporters. Donald Trump’s transition team has declined to sign paperwork that would require the incoming administration to agree to an ethics pledge and cap private donations, which has slowed the transition. Yesterday, Musk claimed to have met with “senior military officers today” in a social media post responding to a statement from Vivek Ramaswamy about government efficiency. “In a meeting with senior military officers today, they told me that it now takes longer to renovate stairs (24 months) in the Pentagon than it took to build the WHOLE Pentagon (16 months) in the 1940s!!” Musk wrote. Speaking at an emergency gathering of the Canadian parliament today, Justin Trudeau urged unity while leaders of two of the country’s largest industrial and oil-rich provinces raised concerns over US-Canada relations, Reuters reports. The premier of Ontario, the country’s industrial heartland, said Trump had good reason to be worried about border security. “Do we need to do a better job on our borders? 1,000 percent ... we do have to listen to the threat of too many illegals crossing the border,” Doug Ford told reporters. “We have to squash the illegal drugs, the illegal guns.” Ford has called on Trudeau to abandon the U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade deal in favor of a bilateral agreement with the US, and called Trump’s comparison of Canada to Mexico “the most insulting thing I have ever heard”. Likewise, the premier of the oil-rich province of Alberta said yesterday that Trump had valid concerns over border security. “We are calling on the federal government to work with the incoming administration to resolve these issues immediately, thereby avoiding any unnecessary tariffs on Canadian exports to the U.S.,” Danielle Smith said in a social media post. She added, “The vast majority of Alberta’s energy exports to the U.S. are delivered through secure and safe pipelines which do not in any way contribute to these illegal activities at the border.” A federal judge has rejected Rudy Giuliani’s request to reschedule a January trial date for after Donald Trump’s inauguration. The judge has ordered Giuliani to pay two Georgia election workers $148 million for spreading falsehoods after the 2020 election. The 16 January trial had been set to determine whether Giuliani would have to relinquish assets such as a Palm Beach condo and Yankees World Series rings to pay the judgement. “My client regularly consults and deals directly with President-elect Trump on issues that are taking place as the incoming administration is afoot as well as inauguration events,” Giuliani’s attorney Joseph Cammarata said. “My client wants to exercise his political right to be there.” “The defendant’s social calendar does not constitute good cause [to delay the trial],” US District Court Judge Lewis Liman said. He did suggest that he would be open to moving the trial forward a few days. Other members of Canada’s parliament are calling on prime minister Justin Trudeau to ready a “war room” for the coming battle over tariffs with the United States. “The only thing a bully responds to is strength. So where is our plan to fight back?” Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party, asked Trudeau. “Where is the war room?” “I don’t think the idea of going to war with the United States is what anyone wants. What we will do is stand up for Canadian jobs,” Trudeau said. “Stand up for the prosperity we create when we work together.” Meanwhile, members of Canada’s liberal and conservative parties are debating ways Trudeau could promote a “Canada First” policy or work collaboratively with “our US partner.” Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is discussing the United States’ proposed tariffs with the leader of the opposition, Pierre Poilievre, before the Canadian parliament. Poilievre has criticized Trudeau, calling on him to “put Canada first” in its relations with the United States and do more to fix Canada’s “broken borders” and “liberalization of drugs”. “The prime minister’s disastrous legalization and liberalization of drugs has the Americans worried,” Poilievre said. “Where’s the plan to stop the drugs and keep our border open to trade?” Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is expected to speak shortly at today’s gathering of the nation’s parliament, just a day after Donald Trump threatened to levy 25% tariffs against the US’s northern neighbor. Trudeau spoke with Trump earlier today, and said “it was a good call,” adding that they “obviously talked about laying out the facts, talking about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth.” Donald Trump’s team is discussing pursuing direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, hoping a fresh diplomatic push can lower the risks of armed conflict, according to two people familiar with the matter, Reuters reports. Several in Trump’s team now see a direct approach from Trump, to build on a relationship that already exists, as most likely to break the ice with Kim, years after the two traded insults and what Trump called “beautiful” letters in an unprecedented diplomatic effort during his first term in office, the people said. The policy discussions are fluid and no final decisions have been made by the president-elect, the sources said. Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. What reciprocation Kim will offer Trump is unclear. The North Koreans ignored four years of outreach by outgoing president Joe Biden to start talks with no pre-conditions, and Kim is emboldened by an expanded missile arsenal and a much closer relationship with Russia. We have already gone as far as we can on negotiating with the United States,” Kim said last week in a speech at a Pyongyang military exhibition, according to state media. During his 2017-2021 presidency, Trump held three meetings with Kim, in Singapore, Hanoi, and at the Korean border, the first time a sitting US president had set foot in the country. Their diplomacy yielded no concrete results, even as Trump described their talks as falling “in love.” The US called for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons, while Kim demanded full sanctions relief, then issued new threats. North Korea has sent troops to fight alongside Russia in its war with Ukraine. Donald Trump’s pledge to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports in his first day in office does not exempt crude oil from the trade penalties, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters today. Oil producers already warned that tariffs on crude would drive up the price of gas for US motorists, the FT reported earlier. “A 25% tariff on oil and natural gas would likely result in lower production in Canada and higher gasoline and energy costs to American consumers while threatening North American energy security,” Lisa Baiton, head of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, told the business-focussed newspaper. In the vagaries of the markets and geopolitics, oil prices rose earlier on news of Trump’s tariffs pledge, over predictions they would discourage production, thereby raising prices, but now have dropped slightly, Reuters reports, on news of a pending ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, apparently because Wall Streeters, leaping 10 steps ahead, imagine it could lead to a relaxing of sanctions on Iran and therefore a glut of oil supply, suppressing prices…. Hello, US politics blog readers, it’s been a lively day for news so far, and we’ll continue to bring you all the developments as they happen. Here’s where things stand: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he spoke to Donald Trump about potential tariffs on Canadian exporters to the US. This after Trump laid out his vision for tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China on the Truth Social social media platform last night, which would see the US’s neighbors to the north and south get slapped with 25% tariffs, special fees, essentially, on all of their exports to the US in the new administration. Trudeau said he had “a good call” with the US president-elect. Many today view leaders as seeing this more as the opening salvo of a negotiation than an ultimatum from Trump. Tom Homan, Trump’s pick for what would be a newly-created position of ‘border czar’ is visiting the US-Mexico border today with Texas governor Greg Abbott. Both republicans are fiercely anti-immigration in favor of mass deportation of undocumented people in the US, and are longtime Trump loyalists. Homan told Fox News that he is willing to jail the mayor of Denver, Colorado, Mike Johnston, for saying he would resist federal attempts in a Trump administration to round up people for deportation in his city. Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will attend Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the White House said. “The president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election. He and the first lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration,” the White House’s senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters yesterday. Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, suggests that the country could retaliate with tariffs of its own against the US and international observers believe such a stance could indicate that Trump faces a much different Mexican leader than he did in his first term, 2016-2020. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, whom Sheinbaum succeeded earlier this year, ended up quite chummy with Trump. They struck a deal in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border with the US – and received other countries’ deported migrants from the US – and Trump backed down on tariff threats against Mexico in return. Sheinbaum might not be so acquiescent. Sheinbaum said she will send a letter to Trump to warn him that his pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada will cause inflation and job losses in both countries. “To one tariff will come another and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk,” Sheinbaum said at a press conference earlier today. Trump argues that tariffs will not only bring more production back to the US but will also coerce Mexico and China, in particular, to crackdown on migrants heading for the US-Mexico border and on illicit fentanyl producers, dealers and smugglers who then get the addictive and dangerous opioid taken into the US for sale on the illegal market. Meanwhile a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said that the US should not “take China’s goodwill for granted” in counternarcotics cooperation and that “fentanyl is an issue for the US”. The Canadian province of Quebec’s premier, François Legault, says Canada must do “everything possible” to avoid Trump imposing a tariff of 25% on Canadian products. In a post on X, he said the move by Trump “poses an enormous risk to the Quebec and Canadian economies”. He calls for border integrity to be a federal government priority. Earlier, Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said tariffs would be “devastating” to workers and jobs in the US and Canada. Research by ING has estimated that if the costs of the new tariffs are fully passed on to consumers, then Americans will face having to pay $2,400 more per capita annually for goods. The report says that also taking into account potential labour shortages due to Trump’s plans to crackdown on immigration – with a vow to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history” – there could be a 1% increase in inflation in the US. Beijing has told Trump that “nobody will win in a trade war” after the president-elect vowed to sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products coming in to the United States from Mexico and Canada, with additional tariffs on China. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is addressing his nation and the world now over ceasefire talks that could end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken a little earlier, at a G7 meeting in Italy, said he was hopeful of a ceasefire and also that it could help bring on in Israel’s war in Gaza, following the attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023 that was lead by the Hamas group that controls the besieged Palestinian territory. Hamas and Hezbollah are powerful proxies of Iran in the Middle East. Both are categorized as terrorist organizations by the United States.

Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin has in a video released today personally invited incoming Trump administration officials and workers to move to Virginia instead of Washington DC, touting lower taxes and better schools. “To the new members of President Trump’s administration moving to the area, I want to personally invite you to make Virginia your home,” Youngkin said. “Virginia is right across the Potomac. We offer a great quality of life, safe communities, award-winning schools where parents matter.” Since US house representative Michael Waltz was tapped as Trump’s pick for national security adviser, Florida state senator Randy Fine announced today he intends to run for his seat to represent Florida’s 6th district. Trump wrote on Truth Social that Fine has his “Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, RANDY, RUN!” Trump added Fine “will be an INCREDIBLE Fighter who will work tirelessly with me to Stop Inflation, Grow our Economy, Secure the Border, Champion our Military/Vets, Restore American Energy DOMINANCE, Protect our always under siege Second Amendment, and Restore PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH.” Fine indicated his intention to be a vocal supporter for strong US-Israel relations should he be elected to Congress. “Donald J. Trump needs fighters who will Make America Wealthy Again, Make America Safe Again, and someone who will stand up for Israel. That is why today I’m announcing my candidacy for FL 6th Congressional District,” Fine wrote in Facebook post. Trump laid out his vision for tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China on the Truth Social social media platform last night, which would see the US’s neighbors to the north get slapped with 25% tariff on all of its exports to the US. “On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,” Trump wrote. Roughly 77% of Canadian exports go to the US, according to the Toronto Region board of trade. Trade experts warned of sweeping economic consequences for all those involved. Trudeau hopped on a call with the president-elect today, and afterward said “it was a good call,” adding that they “obviously talked about laying out the facts, talking about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth.” Homan was the architect of the family separation policy when he led ICE during Trump’s first presidential term, which meant authorities were permitted to separate parents and legal guardians from minors held in immigration detention so that they could prosecuted. When questioned about policies in the previous Trump administration that led to family separation in CBS interview, Homan said there was a simple solution: “Families can be deported together.” Trump’s pick for border czar, Tom Homan, is visiting the US-Mexico border today with Texas governor Greg Abbott. Both republicans are immigration hawks and longtime Trump loyalists. Homan told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he is willing to jail Denver Mayor Mike Johnston for protesting his mass deportation. The acting former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said: “Me and the Denver mayor, we agree on one thing – he’s willing to go to jail. I’m willing to put him in jail because there there’s a statute. It’s Title 8 United States Code 1324 (iii). And what it says is it’s a felony if you knowingly harbor and conceal an illegal alien from immigration authorities. It’s also a felony to impede a federal law enforcement officer.” Homan is also a former Heritage Foundation fellow and Project 2025 contributor. Donald Trump’s transition team is planning for all cabinet picks to receive sweeping security clearances from the president-elect and only face FBI background checks after the incoming administration takes over the bureau and its own officials are installed in key positions, according to people familiar with the matter. The move appears to mean that Trump’s team will continue to skirt FBI vetting and may not receive classified briefings until Trump is sworn in on 20 January and unilaterally grant sweeping security clearances across the administration. Trump’s team has regarded the FBI background check process with contempt for months, a product of their deep distrust of the bureau ever since officials turned over transition records to the Russia investigation during the first Trump presidency, the people said. But delaying FBI vetting could also bring ancillary PR benefits for the Trump team if some political appointees run into problems during a background check, which could upend their Senate confirmation process, or if they struggle to obtain security clearances once in the White House. Read more Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will attend Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, the White House said. “The president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whomever won the election. He and the first lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration,” the White House’s senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters on Monday. Deutsche Bank has published ten conclusions, ramifications and observations following Donald Trump’s announcement of the impending imposition of a 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese imports, that he intends to make policy when he formally enters the White House on 20 January. 1. Free trade agreements (FTAs) are not safe Canada and Mexico are part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which was negotiated by Trump himself. It is clear that even countries with existing agreements with the US can be subject to tariffs. 2. Right after the Treasury Secretary announcement Tariffs are being announced just a few hours after the nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. This is pushback to the argument that tariffs are taking a backseat to the Trump agenda. 3. The tariffs cover 40% of total US trade While only limited to three countries, the impact is economically large at it applies to America’s three largest trading partners after the Euro-area. 4. Presidential authority, for now It is explicitly mentioned that executive authority will be used to impose these tariffs rather than the legislative route. We suspect that the most likely avenue will the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). 5. Tactical and transactional, for now The announcement is only targeted at three countries and leaves the prospect of tariff removal open. There is no mention of tariffs as a strategic tool to deal with trade imbalances or as a revenue-raiser. The optimistic take is that this means that some of the most extreme scenarios under universal tariffs will not happen. The pessimistic interpretation (which we favour) is that this is an opening salvo and the targeted focus on immigration and drugs is required to trigger broad-based executive authority under the IEEPA. 6. Watch the China legislation in Congress Just last week a new bill was submitted to the Senate removing permanent trade relations with China and targeting 50%-100% tariffs. There is already a similar bill in the US House of Representatives. For us, whether the tariff discussion turns strategic via legislation is a big outstanding question to be resolved. 7. Beware complex supply chains EUR/USD is reacting with relief that no mention of European trade was made. But note for example that German car manufacturers have huge production capacity in Mexico that is then on-sold to the US. Also note the complex inter-play of Chinese and Mexico trade which makes the negative impact of tariffs on Mexico even bigger. 8. Canada most under-priced The Canadian dollar has had the largest risk-adjusted weakening move since the tariffs were announced. Canada is the most vulnerable developed market country to extra tariffs but also the least under-priced in terms of risks. 9. The softer the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of more tariffs The equity market reaction has so far been very benign, we would argue likely on the back of the transactional interpretation. That US domestic small-caps have been leading the recent market rally also helps reduce the impact. The first Trump administration showed that the more benign the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of further escalation. 10. Truth Social is the new avenue for announcements During the first Trump administration, it was Twitter. Market participants need to be watching the President’s new social media platform now. Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum’s suggestion that the country could retialiate with tariffs of its own could indicate that Donald Trump faces a much different Mexican leader than he did in his first term. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the former Mexican president, was a charismatic, old-school politician who developed a chummy relationship with Trump, according to Associated Press. The two were eventually able to strike a deal in which Mexico helped keep migrants away from the border – and received other countries’ deported migrants – and Trump backed down on the threats. But Sheinbaum, who took office in October, is a stern leftist ideologue trained in radical student protest movements, and appears less willing to pacify or mollify Trump, AP writes. Donald Trump has quickly tapped big donors and political allies for top posts to roll back environmental and health regulations, cut taxes and government spending in ways that will benefit key backers, say government watchdogs. Armed with blueprints to expand presidential power in aggressive ways and backed by a bevy of billionaire donors and ultra loyalists who helped him win, the president-elect’s transactional style of awarding powerful posts to backers such as X owner Elon Musk, or allies of others such as fracking mogul Harold Hamm, is seen as “unprecedented”, and will likely boost their bottom lines, say critics. Among the super-rich donors helping shape the president-elect’s administration, no one seems to loom larger than Musk, who gave some $200m to a pro-Trump Super Pac. Musk has become a ubiquitous adviser to Trump who tapped him to co-chair an outside federal advisory panel on “government efficiency”, an effort fraught with conflicts given the billions of dollars in government contracts that Musk’s companies now boast. Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum said she will send a letter to Donald Trump to warn him that his pledge to impose across-the-board tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada will cause inflation and job losses in both countries. “To one tariff will come another and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk,” Sheinbaum said at a press conference on Tuesday, Reuters reported. She said she would send the letter later in the day to the US president-elect urging dialogue and cooperation following his announcement on Monday. Sheinbaum added that her administration had always shown Mexico’s willingness to help fight the fentanyl epidemic in the US and that apprehensions of migrants at the border were down and that migrant caravans were no longer arriving at the shared border. Criminal gangs in Mexico were still receiving guns in the US, she said, adding that the region’s shared challenges required cooperation, dialogue and reciprocal understanding. “We do not produce weapons, we do not consume the synthetic drugs. Unfortunately we have the people who are being killed by crime that is responding to the demand in your country,” she said. Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, has warned that Europe must prepare for Donald Trump to impose hefty tariffs on its exports and stick together to combat any such measures. “We have to be prepared for the fact that something similar could also happen to Europe or Germany,” Habeck told a business conference in Berlin on Tuesday, AFP reported. Trump’s tariffs announcement on Monday indicates that his previous campaign threats to hit goods from across the world with higher tariffs should be taken seriously, he said. “The EU must react to this in a united manner (and) speak together as Europe,” he said, adding that EU leaders should seek dialogue before considering retaliatory measures. “It must be made clear that in the end everyone loses” from tariffs, including the US, he said. A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said that the US should not “take China’s goodwill for granted” in counternarcotics cooperation and that “fentanyl is an issue for the US”. The spokesperson was responding to US president-elect Donald Trump’s statement that he would be imposing tariffs of 10% on Chinese imports as a punishment for “massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States” from China. In 2019, at the behest of the US, China scheduled all forms of fentanyl, the only major country to do so on a permanent basis. Donald Trump’s planned tariffs on all products coming into the US from Canada, Mexico and China would have serious implications for American industries, the New York Times writes. Affected industries would include auto manufacturers, farmers and food packagers, which busily ship parts, materials and finished goods across US borders, the paper writes. Mexico, China and Canada together account for more than a third of the goods and services imported and exported by the US, supporting tens of millions of American jobs. The costs could be particularly high for the industries that depend on the tightly integrated North American market, which has been knit together by a free-trade agreement for over three decades … That, in turn, could cause spiking prices and shortages for consumers in the United States and elsewhere, in addition to bankruptcies and job losses. Scott Bessent, Donald Trump’s pick for treasury secretary in his upcoming administration, would be one of several officials responsible for imposing tariffs on other countries. Bessent has on several occasions said tariffs are a means of negotiation, according to Associated Press. In a Fox News op-ed last week, he wrote that tariffs are “a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives”. “Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to US exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.” The imposition of 25% tariffs on Canada, particularly if they come suddenly, would be shattering to the Canadian economy, writes Chris Michael. More than three-quarters of all of Canada’s exports go to the US – almost $600bn worth – including energy, lumber and auto parts. Successive decades of free trade have knitted the two countries together more or less seamlessly. Canada would also likely retaliate, imposing tariffs of its own on US goods, driving up the cost of imported American items. Making matters worse for Canadians would be if the Canadian dollar falls as a result – and it has already taken an immediate hit, dropping about 1 cent against the US dollar following Trump’s announcement. A 25% tariff on all goods would set off by far the largest trade war between the two allies – dwarfing the last one he started. In 2018, the first time Trump was president, he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium, before eventually relenting about a year later. Those tariffs pitted the US against all its major trading partners including the EU, China, Canada and Mexico. Trump has often attacked Canada’s own protectionist policies, including calling Canadian quotas in the dairy industry a “disgrace” and blaming it for widespread hardship among US farmers – even though the American problem has been persistent overproduction that leads US farms to dump tens of millions of gallons of surplus milk. In his first term, he pushed to renegotiate Nafta – the North American Free Trade Agreement – which many voters in the Rust belt states he won in 2016 blamed for gutting their manufacturing economies and sending factory jobs to Mexico and Canada. The three countries agreed on some substantial tweaks, and renamed the treaty the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA). That deal itself now looks to be in tatters. Quebec’s premier, François Legault, says Canada must do “everything possible” to avoid Donald Trump imposing a tariff of 25% on Canadian products. In a post on X, he said the move by Trump “poses an enormous risk to the Quebec and Canadian economies”. He calls for border integrity to be a federal government priority. Earlier, Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said tariffs would be “devastating” to workers and jobs in the US and Canada. Two-thirds of Americans think Donald Trump’s tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented, and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. Trump has called tariffs the most “beautiful word in the dictionary”, yet about 69% of Americans think tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices, according to the poll. The majority of Democrats (79%), independents (68%) and Republicans (59%) all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the US. Nearly the same percentage of respondents said that tariffs will have a significant effect on what they can afford. The Harris poll raises questions about the popularity of one of Trump’s key economic policy platforms. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump called for a broad 20% tariff on all foreign imports and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. Read the full story here: Donald Trump has used the fentanyl crisis gripping the US to support his ambition to impose trade tariffs on China. It gives the incoming US president an opportunity to both appear to be addressing the narcotics emergency, while also reinforcing one of his key aims in terms of US trade. China is the dominant source of chemical precursors used by Mexican cartels to produce fentanyl, while Chinese money launderers have also become key players in the international drug trade, US authorities say. The Biden administration has attempted to crack down on both but diplomacy has yielded modest results. That has frustrated some US security officials and China hawks, Reuters says in a detailed report, who say the pressure must be increased on Beijing. They say the quickest way for Washington to get China’s attention is to sanction Chinese banks doing business with money launderers and corrupt chemical sellers. Foreign banks hit with US sanctions can’t engage with American financial institutions or access the US dollar, severely curtailing their ability to transact business internationally. It’s a weapon that has been wielded against financial institutions in Iran and Russia, but never against banks in Mexico and China tied to drug trafficking. A plan formulated by David Asher, a top former US anti-money laundering official and circulated in Trump transition circles, calls for criminal indictments of major Chinese and Mexican financial institutions allegedly laundering money for the cartels; mass sanctions on Chinese companies and people implicated in the fentanyl trade; beefed-up bounties on most-wanted traffickers; cyber warfare against Mexican cartels; and a US intelligence agency focus on fentanyl that’s commensurate with the war on terrorist organizations. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to designate Mexico’s drug cartels as terrorist groups and harness the US military to destroy them. But it’s not clear if Trump is willing to move beyond tariffs on Chinese goods. There is growing consensus in Republican circles close to Trump that Beijing has exploited the synthetic opioid epidemic to harm Americans. They point to a bipartisan report issued in April by the House of Representatives’ select committee on China that calls that nation the “ultimate geographic source” of the fentanyl crisis. The report alleges that Beijing provides tax rebates to Chinese companies that export fentanyl chemicals. Beijing has repeatedly dismissed the claims in that report. The Chinese Embassy said “the idea of China using fentanyl as a means to strategically weaken the US runs completely counter to facts and reality.” In a series of posts on his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump has announced he will apply new trade taxes on a number of the US’s closest trading partners from day one of his second term. Trump has said that, as soon as he gets into office, he will impose a 25% tariff on “ALL products coming into the United States” from Mexico and Canada. He says the tariffs will remain in place until both countries clamp down on migrants and drugs crossing the border into the US. Trump also says he will impose a further 10% tariff “above any additional tariffs” on all products coming into the US from China. It was not entirely clear what this would mean for China as Trump has previously pledged to end China’s most-favoured-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first term. The reasons for the China tariff, Trump said, was their failure to curb the supply of drugs into the US. China is a major producer of the chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Joe Biden is to propose expanding coverage of anti-obesity drugs for millions on Medicare and Medicaid, which could cut out-of-pocket expenses for some by as much as 95%, a White House official said on Tuesday. This would enable more Americans to afford new weight loss medications that can help prevent type 2 diabetes and lower the risk of death and heart attacks by up to 20%, but cost as much as $1,000 a month without insurance coverage, Reuters reported. Current rules for the Medicare and Medicaid government health insurance programs cover the use of drugs such as Mounjaro, Ozempic and Wegovy for certain conditions like diabetes, but not for obesity as a condition on its own. A new proposed regulation, to be published by the Department of Health and Human Services later on Tuesday, would require Medicare to cover these drugs as a treatment for obesity, expanding access for an estimated 3.4 million Americans with Medicare. It would also ensure access to the medications for approximately four million adult Medicaid enrollees, the White House official said. Reuters reported earlier this month that intense demand for anti-obesity drugs has triggered supply issues, with many patients turning to cheaper compounded versions sold online. Away from the trade tariff news, Donald Trump is considering naming an “AI czar” in the White House to coordinate federal policy and governmental use of artificial intelligence, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing sources. Tesla chief Elon Musk will not be the AI czar, but is expected to be involved in shaping the future of the debate and use cases, the report added. Germany’s vice-chancellor Robert Habeck has urged the European Union to seek talks with the US to ward off a damaging trade war following Donald Trump’s vow to impose trade tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. Habeck says the EU must “respond united, and not tear itself apart into two or three blocs of countries but speak as a united Europe”. “We must make clear that ultimately, everyone loses: the United States, the United States’ economic area and Europe,” he said. Ontario premier Doug Ford says a 25% tariff on all goods imported from Canada to the US would be “devastating to workers and jobs” in both countries. “We need a Team Canada approach and response - and we need it now,” Ford said on X. He urged Justin Trudeau to call an urgent meeting with Canadian premiers. The head of Mexico’s Senate, Fernández Noroña, has responded to Trump’s vow by asking what tariffs Mexico should impose on the US to force people there to stop consuming drugs and illegally exporting weapons to Mexico. Mexico’s finance minister has previously warned that any taxes imposed on Mexican goods could trigger retaliatory tariffs. “If you put a 25% tariff on me, I’ll have to react with tariffs and I’m your main importer,” Rogelio Ramírez de la O previously said. Trump’s threatened new tariffs could violate the terms of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade, Reuters report. The deal, which Trump signed into law, took effect in 2020 and continued the largely duty-free trade between the three countries. During the rancorous talks leading to the USMCA, Canada and the United States at one point imposed sanctions on each others’ products. Trump will have the opportunity to renegotiate the agreement in 2026, when a “sunset” provision will force either a withdrawal or talks on changes to the pact. After issuing his tariff threat, Trump held a conversation with Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau in which they discussed trade and border security, a Canadian source familiar with the situation told Reuters. “It was a good discussion and they will stay in touch,” the source said. Trump could be counting on the threat of tariffs to prompt an early renegotiation of USMCA, said William Reinsch, a former president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “This strikes me more as a threat than anything else,” Reinsch said. “I guess the idea is if you keep hitting them in the face, eventually they’ll surrender.” Mexico’s lower house leader Ricardo Monreal, a member of the ruling Morena party, urged “the use of bilateral, institutional mechanisms to combat human, drug and arms trafficking.” “Escalating trade retaliation would only hurt the people’s pocketbooks and is far from solving underlying problems,” he said in a post on social media platform X. Trump’s announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 1.6% against the Mexican peso, while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures. S&amp;P 500 futures eased 0.1%. The US dollar also rose to its highest level since 30 July 30 against China’s yuan Donald Trump’s vow to impose 25% import tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, when he takes power in January has sent global stockmarkets into a spin, Mark Sweney report in the Business live blog. The US dollar rose but shares and European stock markets fell at the start of trading as investors worried about the ramifications of Trump’s threats. Copper prices fell, weighed down by a stronger US dollar and Trump’s pledge to levy more tariffs on Chinese products. Research by ING has estimated that if the costs of the new tariffs are fully passed on to consumers, then Americans will face having to pay $2,400 more per capita annually for goods. The report says that also taking into account potential labour shortages due to Trump’s plans to crackdown on immigration – with a vow to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history” – there could be a 1% increase in inflation in the US. James Knightley, ING chief international economist for the US, said: “President-elect Donald Trump has promised to implement sweeping new tariffs aimed at protecting American industries, promoting domestic manufacturing, and reducing reliance on foreign imports. “However, tariffs imposed during the first Trump term – and continued and extended under Biden – did not achieve all of the promised outcomes. Furthermore, our research shows that if the new tariffs are fully passed on, they could increase inflation and cost American consumers up to $2,400 per capita annually. The report points to policies implemented under the first Trump administration, such as a 20% tariff on all imported large residential washing machines introduced in 2018, which resulted in the retail cost climbing 12%. Beijing has told Donald Trump that “nobody will win in a trade war” after the president-elect vowed to sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all products coming in to the United States from Mexico and Canada, with additional tariffs on China. Trump accused China of failing to stop the number of drugs entering the US. China is a major producer of precursor chemicals that are acquired by drug cartels, including in Mexico, to manufacture fentanyl, a highly potent synthetic opioid. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said: “I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail … Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.” Liu Pengyu, a Chinese embassy spokesperson, said China had taken steps to combat drug trafficking after an agreement was reached last year between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping. “The Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against narcotics,” he said in a statement. “All these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality.” Trump also posted: “On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.” He cited what he called the “long simmering problem” of “thousands of people pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before”. Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, released a statement on Monday evening saying that the country places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of its shared border with the US. Trump and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke on Monday night about trade and border security, Reuters reported, citing a Canadian source directly familiar with the situation. Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican diplomat, said the decision would violate the revised free trade pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico, known as the USMCA, and said the new tariffs would “put North American relations in a downward spiral”. Mexico’s finance ministry said: “Mexico is the United States’ top trade partner, and the USMCA provides a framework of certainty for national and international investors.” A tariff is a tax placed on goods when they cross national borders. Import tariffs such as those proposed by Trump can have the effect of protecting domestic industries from foreign competition while also generating tax revenue for the government. But economists widely consider them an inefficient tool that typically leave consumers and taxpayers bearing the brunt of higher costs. Countries generally levy retaliatory tariffs of their own in response to tariffs such as those Trump is proposing, which can spark a trade war – as happened between the US and China during Trump’s first presidency."

          "headline": "Labor and the Coalition are closing in on a deal to pass a trio of controversial migration bills. What is in them?",
          "bodyText": "The Albanese government has a trio of migration bills before parliament to facilitate the removal of non-citizens from Australia, including paying third countries to take them and creating powers to confiscate mobile phones in detention. Labor has been accused of trying to out-flank the former home affairs minister Peter Dutton, and even of enabling a form of “human trafficking” by the campaign group Labor for Refugees NSW. On Monday the bills were listed to be debated on Wednesday and Guardian Australia revealed that the Coalition and Labor were closing in on a deal. On Wednesday the Coalition announced it would pass all three. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email What is in this package, and what new powers would the government gain? Migration amendment bill On 7 November the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, introduced the migration amendment bill, which he said would support his ability to make regulations reimposing ankle bracelets and curfews on people released from immigration detention, and “strengthen” powers to remove non-citizens. The bill does so by authorising the Australian government to pay third countries to receive non-citizens from Australia. In theory more than 80,000 people are susceptible to removal, although home affairs officials stress that the bill does not expand that cohort and most leave voluntarily. The most likely potential targets are about 4,452 people on bridging visas so they can make “acceptable arrangements to depart Australia”, 1,179 people in immigration or community detention, and 246 people released due to the high court’s ruling that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful. If people in that cohort refused to go to the third country, they could be redetained. The bill contains provisions making Australia immune from civil suits in relation to removals. The bill also expands the power of the minister to reverse a protection finding of a non-citizen on a “removal pathway”, which includes transitory persons brought to Australia from offshore detention and those whose protection visa applications were determined by the fast-track process. What concerns have been raised? The main concern expressed by stakeholders is that there are no legislated criteria limiting the third countries that Australia can do deals with to remove non-citizens. As a result there is no guarantee that they must be signatories to the refugee convention. This objection was expressed by the Law Council, the Refugee Council, the Human Rights Law Centre, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees and the Australian Human Rights Commission. In response, home affairs department officials told a hearing on Thursday that Australia was “committed to its international law obligations” and may as a matter of “practice or policy” insist that removal countries would have to be signatories to conventions on refugee rights. Labor for Refugees NSW &amp; ACT submitted to the inquiry that paying “third countries to accept people Australia wishes to deport … could be considered a form of people trafficking”. The human rights committee has warned that if the third country deals come with unreasonable conditions attached then non-citizens face lengthy spells in detention. The HRLC has warned that the latest regulations reimposing ankle bracelets and curfews could be unconstitutional for the same reason the high court struck down the first set: those conditions are punitive and can only be imposed by a court, not the minister. The government believes it has cured this defect by setting a more objective test for imposing the conditions. The minister must be satisfied the bridging visa holder “poses a substantial risk of seriously harming any part of the Australian community by committing a serious offence”. Immunity from civil suits is a concern because litigation is an important accountability mechanism. For example, negligence claims helped force the Australian government to bring sick people to Australia from offshore detention. Prohibited items bill On Thursday Burke introduced a bill that would allow drugs and mobile phones to be confiscated from non-citizens in immigration detention. The bill allows the minister to write regulations prohibiting items in detention if they are “satisfied that the thing is unlawful to possess in place or places in Australia or if the thing would pose a risk to the health, safety or security of a person in the facility or the order of the facility”. The bill includes safeguards that if a device is confiscated, detainees must be given “alternative means of communication” to obtain legal advice, contact family and friends, or communicate on political matters. Advocates have warned the bill will make it harder for people in detention to seek accountability for their treatment, including accessing legal advice at short notice. On Monday the shadow immigration minister, Dan Tehan, told the lower house that the Coalition will support the prohibited items bill without amendment. Deportation bill revived In March Labor introduced a bill that would force hundreds of non-citizens to facilitate their own deportation or face 12 months’ imprisonment. The bill requires non-citizens “to cooperate in efforts to ensure their prompt and lawful removal”, giving power to the minister to direct a non-citizen who is due to be deported “to do specified things necessary to facilitate their removal”. The bill also creates a power for the government to ban new visa applications from countries that do not accept removals from Australia, described by the Greens as a “Trump-style travel ban”. The Coalition and the Greens teamed up to delay the bill and send it to an inquiry. The opposition then recommended extensive amendments, including mandatory consideration of the best interests of children and diaspora communities before exercising new ministerial powers. These amendments are not part of the deal. Instead, the Coalition won a three-year sunset on the power for the minister to ban visa applications from a country, and a requirement to give reasons for such a designation."

          "headline": "Donald Trump’s trade tariffs could cost US consumers $2,400 a year – business live",
          "bodyText": "Stocks in some European and Asian markets took a hit as investors digested the ramifications of Donald Trump’s vow to slap a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on goods coming from China. Shares in companies with signifcant operational links to the nations in Trump’s line of fire were the hardest hit, such as automotive firms and alcohol producers. While in general markets in Europe and Asia were hit over fears that Trump could target more countries and spark a potential global trade war. The announcement, made on Trump’s Truth Social platform, saw the dollar jump 1.5% against the Mexican Peso, 1% against the Canadian dollar and hit a four-month high against the Chinese Yuan. Economists at IMG have estimated that if the full cost of the tariffs are passed on to consumers, then Americans will face having to pay $2,4000 more per capital annually for goods. An exclusive poll for the Guardian found that consumers agree, with two-thirds of Americans polled saying that they think Trump’s tariffs will mean higher prices. John Roberts, the boss of British online electrical goods seller AO.com, has said that if the tariffs on Chinese goods are implemented it could mean lower prices on electricals in the UK. “Fundamentally if less product is being made in China and shipped to the US then they will want to find another home for that output which might reduce prices for us,” Roberts said. Meanwhile, optimism amongst British retailers has hit a two-year low off the back of expectations of gloomy Christmas sales, and the prospect of the increase in Employers’ National Insurance contributions next April, according to the latest quarterly survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). And, the British government is expected to stick to headline targets for increasing electric car sales each year, but will consider adding extra loopholes to help carmakers, after a barrage of lobbying by the car industry. Keir Starmer’s spokesperson on Tuesday announced that the government will bring forward the consultation on the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate which will look at changes to the rules which impose fines of up to £15,000 per petrol or diesel vehicle sold above a quota. Carmakers have privately warned that they will miss the targets, forcing them to stump up millions of pounds to buy “credits” from rivals, or else pay the fines. Wall Street has opened with a mixed reaction from investors to Donald Trump’s announcement to put a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on Chinese imports. The Dow Jones was down 0.29% at the opening bell with biotech company Amgen (11.3%), retailer Best Buy (7.9%) and General Motors (6.6%) among the biggest fallers in early trading. The tech stock heavy Nasdaq opened up 0.28%, while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 rose 0.21%, as investors started to weigh the US president-elect’s plan to impose the new tariffs on his first day in the White House on 20 January. The British government is expected to stick to headline targets for increasing electric car sales each year, but will consider adding extra loopholes to help carmakers, after a barrage of lobbying by the car industry. Keir Starmer’s spokesperson on Tuesday announced that the government will bring forward the consultation on the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate which will look at changes to the rules which impose fines of up to £15,000 per petrol or diesel vehicle sold above a quota. Carmakers have privately warned that they will miss the targets, forcing them to stump up millions of pounds to buy “credits” from rivals, or else pay the fines. Business Jonathan Reynolds is expected to tell car companies that the government is listening to their concerns, at a dinner this evening hosted by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. The government is likely to stick firmly to its goal of phasing out new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030, and all hybrids by 2035, according to a person with knowledge of internal discussions. The person said the government is also very likely to stick to headline targets which mandate that sales of electric cars must account for 22% of new sales in 2024 for each manufacturer, rising to 28% next year and 80% by 2030, despite reports they could change. However, the government will consider changes to “flexibilities” that effectively allow carmakers to reduce the number of electric cars that they need to sell. Those loopholes include the ability to “over-comply” in later years to make up for a slow start in the coming two or three years, and lowering the average emissions of the fossil fuel cars they sell. The “fast-track” consultation is expected to launch before Christmas, before reporting back in the first few months in 2025 - faster than most policy consultations of that type. It is also expected to include details of which hybrid cars can continue to be sold after 2030. The expected changes to the ZEV mandate would come despite opposition from charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners, who argue that delays will hit investment and imperil emissions targets. Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK, a pro-battery car campaign group, said: The ZEV mandate is world-leading legislation that will put the UK firmly on the map with green tech investors and send a clear signal that the country means business when it comes to the global energy transition. Clean air and sustainable employment are surely the legacy we all want, and the existing zero emissions mechanisms is critical. Ten takeaways from Donald Trump’s new tariffs announcement Deutsche Bank has published ten conclusions, ramifications and observations following Trump’s social media posts about the impending imposition of a 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on Chinese imports, that he intends to make policy when he formally enters the White House on 20 January. 1. Free trade agreements (FTAs) are not safe Canada and Mexico are part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) which was negotiated by Trump himself. It is clear that even countries with existing agreements with the US can be subject to tariffs. 2. Right after the Treasury Secretary announcement Tariffs are being announced just a few hours after the nomination of Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary. This is pushback to the argument that tariffs are taking a backseat to the Trump agenda. 3. The tariffs cover 40% of total US trade While only limited to three countries, the impact is economically large at it applies to America’s three largest trading partners after the Euro-area. 4. Presidential authority, for now It is explicitly mentioned that executive authority will be used to impose these tariffs rather than the legislative route. We suspect that the most likely avenue will the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). 5. Tactical and transactional, for now The announcement is only targeted at three countries and leaves the prospect of tariff removal open. There is no mention of tariffs as a strategic tool to deal with trade imbalances or as a revenue-raiser. The optimistic take is that this means that some of the most extreme scenarios under universal tariffs will not happen. The pessimistic interpretation (which we favour) is that this is an opening salvo and the targeted focus on immigration and drugs is required to trigger broad-based executive authority under the IEEPA. 6. Watch the China legislation in Congress Just last week a new bill was submitted to the Senate removing permanent trade relations with China and targeting 50%-100% tariffs. There is already a similar bill in the US House of Representatives. For us, whether the tariff discussion turns strategic via legislation is a big outstanding question to be resolved. 7. Beware complex supply chains EUR/USD is reacting with relief that no mention of European trade was made. But note for example that German car manufacturers have huge production capacity in Mexico that is then on-sold to the US. Also note the complex inter-play of Chinese and Mexico trade which makes the negative impact of tariffs on Mexico even bigger. 8. Canada most under-priced The Canadian dollar has had the largest risk-adjusted weakening move since the tariffs were announced. Canada is the most vulnerable developed market country to extra tariffs but also the least under-priced in terms of risks. 9. The softer the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of more tariffs The equity market reaction has so far been very benign, we would argue likely on the back of the transactional interpretation. That US domestic small-caps have been leading the recent market rally also helps reduce the impact. The first Trump administration showed that the more benign the market reaction, the greater the likelihood of further escalation. 10. Truth Social is the new avenue for announcements During the first Trump administration, it was Twitter. Market participants need to be watching the President’s new social media platform now. Two-thirds of Americans think Donald Trump’s tariff plans will only add to rising costs if implemented, and many are planning purchases ahead of his inauguration anticipating higher prices, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. Trump declared on Monday evening that he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% on China, if they did not stop what he claimed was illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling. But although he has called tariffs the most “beautiful word in the dictionary”, about 69% of Americans think tariffs on imports will lead to higher prices, according to the poll. The majority of Democrats (79%), independents (68%) and Republicans (59%) all believe that tariffs will increase the prices of the goods they pay for in the US. Nearly the same percentage of respondents said that tariffs will have a significant effect on what they can afford. The poll chimes with reseaarch by ING published on Tuesday which predicts that the US president-elect’s 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China, could cost US consumers $2,400 a year. Optimism amongst British retailers has fallen to a two-year low, according to industry body the CBI. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that its quarterly survey of retailer sentiment has fallen to its lowest level since Novermber 2022, when consumers were hit by surging energy prices and markets reacted to former prime minister Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget. Retailers are expecting a gloomy Christmas forecasting annual sales growth to deteriorate, with volumes set to remain below seasonal norms. Firms also expect to scale back investment over the next 12 months, in part due to cost increases due to the increase in Employers’ National Insurance contributions announced in last month’s budget which come into force from April. Ben Jones, lead economist at the CBI, said: The last time retailers felt this gloomy was back in November 2022, at the peak of the inflation shock. The stark rise in Employers’ National Insurance next year will hit retailers hard. And the planned increase in business rates for higher-value properties will add significant operational costs for distribution centres. The chief executive of the UK water regulator has defended allowing the privatisation of water companies in the 1980s, despite criticism of their financial performance and environmental track record. David Black, the chief executive of Ofwat, defended the regulator’s record at a select committee on Tuesday following criticism it allowed water companies to load up on unsutainable amounts of debt, while failing to invest in infrastruture and continuing to spill sewage into rivers and seas. Asked by committee chair, the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael whether these issues show the privatisation model has failed, Black said: “I wouldn’t agree - it shows the need for strong regulation of the sector. It’s very clear the sector needs to change. That said it’s important to bear in mind the sector has raised over £240bn since privatisation and there has been significant reduction in leakage and there’s more to do. Customer bills since privatisation have increased but we have saved billions of pounds for customers at each price review.” He added that “we can point to real successes in the model since privatisation.” The water companies in England were privatised in 1989 and since then they have come under fire for presiding over leakages of tap water, sewage spills and a lack of reservoirs being built meaning the country is at risk of running out of water. The Labour government is currently running a review into the privatised model. Carmichael asked if the situation with Thames Water, the largest water company in England, which has been at risk of collapse due to its high levels of debt, illustrates an issue with the privatised model. Black said: “Thames Water very clearly have issues with their financial structures and we have taken action to make sure customers don’t bear the consequences. With privatisation we were always very clear that we might see companies fail, that’s why we have the special administration regime, we were always very clear it wasn’t Ofwat’s role to stop companies going bust it is our role to ensure customers are protected when they are unable to meet their obligations but the fact is the sector has raised finance.” John Roberts, the boss of British online electrical goods seller AO.com, said it was too early to tell if Donald Trump’s administration would follow through with its threat to slap more tariffs on Chinese goods, but such a move could mean lower prices on electricals in the UK. “Fundamentally if less product is being made in China and shipped to the US then they will want to find another home for that output which might reduce prices for us,” Roberts said. But he cautioned: “We are a long way from it happening and tariffs biting and the follow through so I personally wouldn’t read too much into [Trump’s threats].” “Donald is a deal maker and he is laying the ground for negotiation and he is not going to lay the ground by saying I am not going to put any tariffs. This is his opening gambit and it was always going to be sensational.” Roberts made the comments as he warned that UK chancellor Rachel Reeves’ budget would push up prices for UK consumers because it meant more cost for business. AO said direct and indirect costs would rise £8m, including higher payments for self-employed drivers as well as higher national insurance contributions and the minimum wage rises for employees. “I’m no economist, I’m a washer flogger from Bolton, but if you dramatically increase all the costs then prices will go up as night follows day. They have to.” He said he was concerned as “inflation hurts the people that can afford it the least the most.” The US president-elect’s social media post announcing 25% import tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, and 10% from China, when he takes power in January has sent global stockmarkets into a spin. Research by ING has estimated that if the costs of the new tariffs are fully passed on to consumers, then Americans will face having to pay $2,400 more per capita annually for goods. The report says that also taking into account potential labour shortages due to Trump’s plans to crackdown on immigration – with a vow to stage the “largest deportation operation in American history” – there could be a 1% increase in inflation in the US. James Knightley, ING chief international economist for the US, said: “President-elect Donald Trump has promised to implement sweeping new tariffs aimed at protecting American industries, promoting domestic manufacturing, and reducing reliance on foreign imports. “However, tariffs imposed during the first Trump term – and continued and extended under Biden – did not achieve all of the promised outcomes. Furthermore, our research shows that if the new tariffs are fully passed on, they could increase inflation and cost American consumers up to $2,400 per capita annually. The report points to policies implemented under the first Trump administration, such as a 20% tariff on all imported large residential washing machines introduced in 2018, which resulted in the retail cost climbing 12%. Unlike Halfords, which reported a £23m hit from tax rises in the budget this morning, Compass Group, Europe’s biggest catering company, talks about the “opportunity rather than threats” this brings to its business. Dominic Blakemore, the Compass chief executive, told analysts and investors that the “cost and complexity” of the increase in national insurance contributions for employers will pile pressure on many UK companies, and may prompt them to outsource catering to save money. “The NIC rate increase increases cost for everyone. We see an opportunity in first-time outsourcing.” He argues that Compass, given its size and presence in other countries, can manage those cost rises more efficiently. The company employs 55,000 people in the UK, and 580,000 globally. His comments came as the catering group reported a 10% rise in revenues to $42bn in the year to 30 September, while underlying profit before tax rose to $2.7bn from $2.4bn. Robert Habeck, Germany’s economy minister, has said that Donald Trump’s announcements about tariffs on products from China, Mexico and Canada should be taken seriously. A number of analysts have said that markets should view the US president-elect’s proposed tariffs more positively, given he has threatened a hike of as much as 60% on Chinese imports if the country doesn’t agree with his policies. However, Habeck said that Europe and Germany need to seek urgent talks with the US to head off a potential trade war and stand united. European markets and listed companies operating in sectors including automotive and alcohol are a “sea of red” this morning as investors react to the impact of Trump’s announcements, and the possibility other countries could be targeted with tariffs next. Shares in European brewers have been hit by Donald Trump’s threats to introduce aa 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada Trump, who posted the policy announcement on his social media site Truth Social, has also said that Chinese imports will be hit with a 10% tariff when he officially takes over at the White House on 20 January. Budweiser and Stella Artois maker AB Inbev and Heineken, which both have operations in Mexico, fell 2.3% and 2.2% respectively. Guinness maker Diageo, which also has operations in Mexico, was the biggest faller down 2.5%. Meanwhile, Campari fell 2.3%, Remy Cointreau slid almost 2%, Pernod Ricard fell 1.7% and Carlsberg dropped by just over 1%. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said that European stocks are a “sea of red” this morning following Trump’s policy-by-social media announcement. She pointed out that London’s FTSE 100 has proved to be the most resilient of the European markets as the UK is “expected to be shielded from the worst of Trump’s tariff plans”. Mohit Kumar, in the global economics team at Jefferies, sees the move by Trump as an “opening move for negotiations” given he has threatened that tariffs on Chinese imports could go up to 60%. Our view remains that tariffs will eventually not end up as bad as feared, but we will see increased uncertainty over the coming months. Waking up to check the tweets for any policy announcements could become the norm. Tariffs will further support the view of US over rest of the world from an investment perspective. Halfords could raise prices for car servicing and repair to help it cope with a £23m cost increase after the autumn budget, and called for more business support from the government. The cycling and motoring retailer, which has more than 12,000 employees, reported on Tuesday that the budget measures add £23m of direct labour costs, of which £9m was already included in its planning assumptions. Fears of a potential global trade war has fuelled a sell-off of European automotive stocks. Shares in Stellantis, the owner of brands including Fiat, Chrysler, Peugeot and Vauxhall, have been hit the hardest falling almost 6% in early trading. Germany’s Volkswagen fell 2.7%, Mercedes-Benz tumbled 2.2%, BMW dropped 2.4%, and luxury brand Porsche fell 2.3%. Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services, said that markets will have to “reattune” to Trump’s “frequently erratic” approach to policymaking. Trump’s promise overnight to implement tariffs immediately on taking office in January were no great surprise, though the fact that he is taking initial aim at Mexico and Canada as much as China may have surprised some, though it is in line with his narrative during the election. Still it serves as a reminder that markets will have to reattune themselves to his frequently erratic approach to policymaking, and his likely hefty reliance on executive orders where possible to circumvent the legislature. European stock markets have fallen at the start of trading as investors worry about the ramifications of Trump’s international tariff threats, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.5%. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks in London fell by 0.3% in early trading, while Germany’s DAX fell 0.5%. In France, the CAC 40 share index dropped 0.8% Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING, published a note saying that Europe will not be “breathing a sigh of relief” despite not being targeted by Trump in his first round of tariffs. That Europe was not mentioned in Trump’s first tariff post could perhaps be welcome news on the continent. Yet local policymakers will remain fearful that it will just be a matter of time before Trump turns his attention to the European auto sector or tariffs more broadly. In any case, the threat of further tariffs on China shows the direction of travel on world trade, which is bearish for the euro. Copper prices have fallen, weighed down by a stronger US dollar and US President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to levy more tariffs on Chinese products. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.6% at $8,990.50 per metric ton by 7am, while the most-traded January copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) closed down 0.3% to 73,740 yuan ($10,162.48) a ton, Reuters reported. Investor Bill Ackman said that markets should be up as Trump is using the threat of tariffs as a weapon to achieve wider US economic goals. “To be clear, according to Trump the 25% tariffs will not be implemented, or if implemented will be removed, once Mexico and Canada stop the flow of illegal immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S,” he posted on X. “In other words, @realDonaldTrump is going to use tariffs as a weapon to achieve economic and political outcomes which are in the best interest of America, fulfilling his America first policy. This is a great way for Trump to effect foreign policy changes even before he takes office.” Good morning, and welcome to our coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Donald Trump has kicked-off his long feared plan for new tariffs sending shockwaves through the markets. The US dollar rose and shares dipped after Donald Trump said he will impose additional tariffs on products coming into the US from China, Mexico and Canada. Posting on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said that when he becomes president on January 20th he will “sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders.” The levy on products from Mexico and Canada – and 10% on Chinese imports – saw the dollar rise almost 2% against the Mexican peso and hit a four and a half year high against the Canadian dollar. The US currency also rose to its highest level since July against China’s yuan as markets reacted to Trump’s comments. Most Asian equities declined with share benchmarks in Japan, Australia and South Korea all dropping. The news on tariffs reversed a 0.6% fall in the dollar index on Monday, following Trump’s nomination of hedge fund manager Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary, an appointment investors took as a sign that the president-elect’s policies may be moderated. Stephen Innes, managing partner, SPI Asset Manager, said: In a striking return to hardline policies, President-elect Trump has dramatically escalated tensions with a brash promise to impose a sweeping 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico the moment he reassumes office. This bold declaration shatters any lingering hopes that the new Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, might usher in an era of moderation. Initially hailed as a beacon of stability, Bessent’s influence now seems overshadowed by a resurgence of Trump’s uncompromising “America First” doctrine, which starkly excludes even the closest of allies from its protective embrace.

          "headline": "If so many experts oppose a social-media age ban, why is the government intent on rushing it through?",
          "bodyText": "A dominant theme of the hastily written submissions to the federal government’s one-day review of its social-media ban bill is that the process is far too rushed to consider its wide-ranging effects on all Australians. A year from now, every Australian logging on to Facebook, Instagram or TikTok may be confronted with a prompt that the company is requiring you to prove your age. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email But even that is just speculation. The bill that was introduced into parliament last week, and sent off to a committee for a single day – receiving over 15,000 submissions – contains no details about how it will work, only that the companies will be expected to take reasonable steps to ensure users are aged 16 and over. The actual detail will come later, through the completion of a trial of age-assurance technology in mid-2025. Then, through expansive powers, the minister for communications will determine what methods will be used and to which platforms they’re applied. Michelle Rowland’s Labor predecessor in the communications portfolio, Stephen Conroy, once said he had “unfettered legal power” and could make telecommunications companies “wear red underpants on [their] head” if he wanted. The social media sector might wonder if this is where these new powers may go. Elon Musk’s X has warned that these new powers could be weaponised by a minister, and could limit free speech. X and the Human Rights Law Centre have both raised questions over the lawfulness of the bill. We’re told in media interviews which platforms are in and which are out – such as YouTube – but that will be up to the minister to decide at a later date. The government has been at pains to say people won’t be required to prove their age via the government’s new digital ID, or that they will be required to hand over licences or passports to every social media platform. But there’s nothing in the legislation today preventing that. That was one of the key takeaways from the short four-hour hearing on the bill on Monday. It came after a question from one of the few sceptics of the legislation from the two major parties: the Liberal National party senator, Matt Canavan. However, the Coalition indicated on Tuesday it had secured agreement from government for amendments to the bill to prevent people being forced to hand over IDs to social media platforms. TikTok has said any requirement to hand over IDs is tantamount to requiring every social media user in Australia to have a licence to access social media. Having read through the vast bulk of the publicly available written submissions, it’s clear that most experts believe this is an ill thought-through policy which lacks evidentiary basis, likely won’t work, and will have wide-ranging ramifications for every social media user in Australia. One of the authors of the only major study on the effects of social media on teen mental health cited by the government doesn’t back the government’s ban. At the Monday hearing, there was only one witness in favour of the bill – and she had campaigned for it well before today. Everyone else who wasn’t a government agency or one of the politicians asking the questions was against the ban. It appears the legislation will fly through parliament after a week of consideration. Just over a year ago, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches, the government had suggested age-assurance raised too many privacy and security concerns for every Australian. Guardian Australia has revealed the eSafety commissioner’s own position has previously been that no country has been able to solve this problem. Nothing substantial in the technology has changed since then. So why the change? It appears to be the result of a combination of a months-long wedge from the opposition pushing the government to adopt the policy, public polling backing the ban, and a News Corp campaign that – in a Deidre Chambers-style coincidence – just happened to launch not long after Meta announced it would not enter into new deals to pay for news. On Tuesday, News Corp’s tabloid front pages across the major cities and an editorial in the Australian urged the parliament to pass the bill. Passing the bill now, and it not coming into effect until after the next election serves two purposes: it takes it off the table as an election issue; and it puts responsibility for implementation onto the next government. The concern over the bill from members of parliament has seen odd pairings: the Greens, One Nation, some teals, and others such as Gerard Rennick, and Coalition MPs who already had concerns over the eSafety commissioner’s powers. Some want more regulation to make the platforms safer for everyone, others want the digital public square to be more free of regulation. But on this at least they’re a unity ticket. However, they will probably not have the numbers to stop this going through before the end of this week."

          "bodyText": "Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has refused commit to reversing the rise in employers’ national insurance in the budget. (See 2.13pm.) Responding to her comment at a CBI conference, Labour said this meant the Tories were now implicitly accepting the need for the tax increases announced by the government. (See 3.06pm.) Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has told the CBI that she is ruling out a further rise to overall public spending and that “public services now need to live within the envelope that we’ve set”. (See 4.46pm.) Rupert Soames, the CBI chair, has accused the government of treating employers as a “cash cow” in last month’s budget, and urged ministers to water down plans for workers’ rights. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has said the UK’s flood defences are in the “worst condition on record” and promised the new Labour government has committed £2.4bn to upgrade them. There is more coverage on our Storm Bert live blog. Keir Starmer is under renewed pressure over electoral reform after dozens of newly elected Labour MPs signed up to a parliamentary group calling for the UK to move to a proportional voting system. Scottish Labour will force a vote designed to re-design the Scottish government’s winter fuel payments, despite them being cut because of a decision by the UK government, PA Media reports. PA says: Within weeks of taking office, chancellor Rachel Reeves set off a political firestorm by announcing the winter fuel payment would be means-tested, cutting spending and ultimately scuppering the Scottish government’s plan to offer its own universal counterpart. But last week, Scottish Labour announced it would bring in re-designed payments, which would lower the bar for those who would receive them if it won the 2026 Holyrood election. And today the party announced it would seek to bring the payments back by forcing a vote in Holyrood during stage three of the social security (amendment) (Scotland) bill. Amendments submitted by the party would require ministers to make regulations that would make all pensioners eligible for winter heating assistance, while also allowing for any payments made to be recovered if the recipient’s household income exceeds an amount set by ministers. Currently, winter heating assistance – as described in the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 which the current bill is designed to amend – is “assistance (which may or may not take the form of money) given by the Scottish ministers under section 24 to an individual to meet, or help towards meeting, the individual’s heating costs during the winter months”. The amendments would appear to make changes to the devolved benefit the Scottish government pushed back until next year after the chancellor’s announcement. Commenting on the move, the Scottish government’s social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said: This is hypocrisy on stilts from Labour. After betraying millions of pensioners by taking away their winter fuel payment, they now expect people to believe that they can be trusted to stand up for pensioners. Hamish Falconer, a Foreign Office minister, has said that if Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, were to visit the UK, a court would ultimately decide if he should be arrested because of the international criminal court warrant against him over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Falconer was responding to an urgent question from Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, who has strongly criticised the ICC’s decision. (See 1.13pm.) Explaining what would happen, Falconer said: In line with this government’s stated commitment to the rule of law, we respect the independence of the ICC. We will comply with our international obligations. There is a domestic legal process through our independent courts that determines whether or not to endorse an arrest warrant by the ICC, in accordance with the ICC Act of 2001. This process has never been tested because the UK has never been visited by an ICC indictee, if there were to be such a visit to the UK, there would be a court process and due process would be followed in relation to those issues. There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, two terrorist organisations. This government has been clear, Israel has a right to defend itself in accordance with international law, that right is not under question, and the court’s approval of the warrants last week do not change that. Patel said the ICC “appears to be drawing a moral equivalence between Israel’s war of self-defence and Hamas terrorism” and she said the only beneficiaries of the decision were Hamas. But Falconer urged her to respect the ICC. He said: Diplomacy will continue, regardless of the process of the ICC, but I had understood it to be the common position of this house that the international rule of law is an important commitment. The international criminal court is an important, the primary body, in enforcing these norms and the issues on jurisdiction and complementarity were heard by the pre-trial chamber, its three judges have issued their findings, and I think we should respect those. Q: What are your grounds for optimism? Reeves says she is hugely optimistic for Britain. The country has got so much going for it, she says. Government has to play a part. But businesses have to play a part too, she says. Government has to provide stability. And she says it has to remove the barriers that are in the way of growth. As chancellor, Reeves says she has to get the whole of government thinking about how it can remove barriers holding up investment. And that’s the end of the Q&amp;A. Reeves says public services now need to live within the envelope set. She says departmental spending limits for beyond 2026 will be set out in the next phase of the spending review. She goes on: But what I am really sure about … [is] that public services now need to live within the envelope that we’ve set. We will not be coming back to top up those budgets. UPDATE: Reeves said: We’ll be publishing the second phase of the spending review in spring next year. But what I am really clear about, and I’ve said it already a couple of times today, [is] that public services now need to live within the envelope that we’ve set. We will not be coming back to top up those budgets. We have set the envelope for public spending, and it’s through reform and through economic growth that we need to be able to properly fund our public services and to improve living standards for ordinary families. Q: [From ITV’s Joel Hills] A CBI survey says half of businesses might have to let people go as a result of the budget. Will you reconsider any of the measures? Reeves says she has made her decisions. She is determined to put the public finances back on a firm footing. Overall, the budget is good for jobs and good for growth, she says. Reeves is now taking media questions. Q: [From the Telegraph] Businesses are disappointed with the budget. Haven’t you betrayed them. And are you ruling out any more big tax rises on businesses? Reeves says she faced a massive hole in the public finances. In the last parliament people saw what happened when government did not address that. She won’t be that sort of chancellor, she says. She goes on: Public services now need to live within their means, because I’m really clear, I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more taxes … At this budget, we did wipe the slate team to put public finances and public services on footing, and as a result, we won’t have to do a budget like this ever again. And indeed, unlike the last government, I will only be doing one budget a year, so that this government can focus on what our number one priority is, and that’s growing the economy. Reeves says she had to “wipe the slate clean” with the budget. But she says she will not need to deliver another budget with tax rises like that again. You can be confident we’re not going to have to come back again and do another budget like this. So you can be confident about the tax rates we’ve set for this parliament, and public services now, these are within the means that we’ve set. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, tells the CBI that “everybody knows that that inheritance [at the time of the budget] was pretty dire in terms of the back hole in the public finances”. In line with the advance briefing, she says her critics have not been able to come up with alternative proposals. Q: How will people know if your plans are working? Reeves says she will be judged on whether the economy grows. And that will only happen if investment starts to happen, she says. I want you to judge this government on our number one mission, which is to bring growth back to the UK economy. We can’t do that overnight … But over this parliament, we going to return investment, we’re going to return growth to the economy, because, in the end, that’s the only way to ensure that Britain is competitive and to ensure that we pull our weight in the world to improve living standards for working people. At the CBI conference Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has just started taking part in a Q&amp;A. There is a live feed here. People who stay in Wales overnight, including children, are set to be charged a visitor levy under a scheme that could raise up to £33m a year to be ploughed back into tourism and culture, Steven Morris reports. The Welsh government’s news release about the visitor accommodation (register and levy) etc. (Wales) bill is here. Commenting on the plan, Mark Drakeford, the finance secretary in the Welsh government, said: We know tourism makes an important contribution to the Welsh economy and to Welsh life. We want to ensure its long-term sustainability. That’s why we believe it is fair visitors contribute towards local facilities, helping to fund infrastructure and services integral to their experience. Visitor levies are common around the world – benefiting local communities, tourists and businesses – and we want the same for Wales. Money raised through a levy would be retained by local authorities and reinvested back into their local areas to support local, sustainable tourism. It’s a small contribution that could make a big difference. The government has been criticised for the quality of the reports it has produced assessing the likely consequences of its employment rights bill. A series of impact assessments (IAs) were published last month. But the regulatory policy committee (RPC), a body set up to scrutinise the quality of impact assessments, has published a report saying the work by the government for this is “not fit for purpose”. It says: The RPC has assessed eight of the 23 individual IAs as ‘not fit for purpose’ and six of these are in the ‘highest impact’ measure category in the summary IA. The overall assessment for the bill IA is therefore ‘not fit for purpose’. Given the number and reach of the measures, it would be proportionate to undertake labour market and broader macroeconomic analysis, to understand the overall impact on employment, wages and output, and particularly, the pass-through of employer costs to employees. Commenting on the report, Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said: Labour’s impact assessment for their radical trade union charter has been rated ‘not fit for purpose’ by the government’s own regulator. But businesses up and down the country knew this already. Just like the national insurance Jobs’ Tax, this bill is the second wave of an attack on job creators. Keir Starmer is paying tribute to Prescott now. He says Prescott was the longest-serving deputy PM ever and “a politician for working people through and through”. In many respects, Prescott was ahead of his time, Starmer says. He championed causes like tackling climate change, fighting regional inequality, supporting the minimum wage, improving public transport, and building council houses. Prescott was “a skilled negotiator, sometimes with immense and perhaps surprising sensitivity”, Starmer says. He says Prescott had a talent for bringing people together who had different points of view. He was someone who was not in politics for himself, Starmer says. And he was someone who was a team player who would support a position in public, even if he had opposed it in private before the collective decision was taken. UPDATE: Starmer said: Make no mistake, [Prescott] did things his own way, and forged his own path, and in doing so, he brought about some of the greatest transformation this country has ever seen, the linchpin of New Labour, because beneath the pugnacious exterior, John was a skilled negotiator, sometimes with immense and perhaps surprising sensitivity. He had an incredible skill, which was the ability to bring people together from different starting points, whether that was his work on climate negotiations, or closer at home in his own party, to stand together in a better place. And that sums up another thing that the public, I think, sensed about John. He was not in it for himself. He was a team player, and he was proud to play for Team Labour, that was never more evident than during the campaign season, when it was time to bring out the battle bus, which has become a tradition our deputy prime minister proudly continued this year, because the Prescott Express was a morale boost to any campaign. It may have been arriving in a Tesco car park, but John was always met with a reception like Beatlemania and no wonder, the public were at the heart of John’s politics. And it’s clear the public had a particular place in their heart for him too, and that was key to his popularity. And indeed, after the famous incident, it was the public who came out swinging for him. In the Commons MPs are now paying tribute to John Prescott. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, recalls Prescott visting Hoyle’s constituency soon after Hoyle became an MP. He says there was so much pushing from reporters that a woman in the crowd broke her arm. Prescott insisted on going to visit her in hospital, Hoyle says. He says that is the sort of person he was. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank has published a paper suggesting two changes to the government’s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms that it says would make them fairer. The IFS is broadly supportive of what the government is doing, but it accepts that the change in inheritance tax rules has disadvantaged elderly farmers who, if they knew this was coming, would have already given away their farms to their children. Summing up the IFS arguments, David Sturrock, one of the authors of the paper, said: Inheritance tax [IHT] relief for agricultural and business assets favours those whose wealth is held in these forms rather than others. It also provides a tax incentive for agricultural land to be used by the wealthy as a way to avoid inheritance tax. That is unfair, inefficient and creates economic costs. Those objecting to the change claim that paying IHT will have detrimental effects on food production or the environment. But if government wishes to promote food production or certain uses of land, there are much better ways of doing so than through an inheritance tax break. It is also objected, as a matter of principle, that this could result in families having to sell up and move on from farms that have been in the same family for generations. That is an argument against inheritance tax in general – it can have the same effect on family homes, for example – rather than a strong case for protecting certain forms of assets specifically. The exact design of the tax change is important, and there are two mitigations which the government could consider. There is a good case for making unused portions of the new £1m allowance inheritable by a spouse or civil partner, as happens for the main inheritance tax allowances. In addition, current farm owners passing away in the next seven years (but after the new regime comes into force in April 2026) will not have had the opportunity to avoid inheritance tax by making lifetime gifts. If the government wished to give current farm owners the same opportunity to avoid inheritance tax as owners of other assets, it could, for example, make lifetime gifts of agricultural property made before a certain future date inheritance tax free, regardless of the timing of the death. Responding to the report, Tim Farron, the Lib Dem environment spokesperson, said The government hid behind the IFS to try and justify this disastrous policy. That very same organisation is now telling them that their own proposals need an overhaul. It would be beggars belief for the government to continue to push forward with these stupid plans. They need to swallow their pride, realise the damage this family farm tax will do and axe the tax. Labour claims the Conservative party is now implicitly accepting the need for the tax increases in the budget. Referring to the Kemi Badenoch’s speech to the CBI, and her refusal to commit her party to reversing the rise in employers’ national insurance in the budget (see 2.13pm), a Labour spokesperson said: After weeks of campaigning against it, Kemi Badenoch is now refusing to say whether she would actually reverse the employer national insurance rise. The opposition seem to finally accept that the damage they did to the economy made tax rises necessary - but the least the public deserve is an answer on what their actual position is. It’s no wonder there was nothing to trail from the leader of the opposition’s speech: she has nothing to say. While the Tories try and work out what they think, Labour is getting on with fixing the foundations and rebuilding the country. Simon Jack, business editor of the BBC, asked Kemi Badenoch about her claim that there was an alternative to the budget plans. (See 2.03pm.) If she did not agree with the taxes, what taxes would she raise instead? Or what services would she cut? Badenoch said she did not accept the premise of the question. She went on: We need to stop looking at everything as if it’s just a ledger where there’s taxes raised and services delivered. Not everything that government does is public services. We can do things better. We can redesign things. Badenoch suggested there was no need for government to set up a football regulator. Although this was just a “tiny thing”, it was an example of unnecessary, “burdensome” regulation. That is why I’m not talking about which tax will tweak here or which service we’re going to cut there. We need to completely change the way we talk about how our economy works. She said she wanted “deep, real [policy] reviews, asking the right questions, not just a policy tweak here or there”. She went on: If we’re going to rewire the state, we need to start from there and not just adjust little nods and levers on tax or insurance. Let’s think about everything from first principles. During the Q&amp;A after her speech Kemi Badenoch would not commit to reversing the rise in employers’ national insurance in the budget. Asked if she would give such a commitment, Badenoch said that, if a tax increase is not raising money, the Tories would reverse it. “One of the things that we’re going to have to do is rewire everything,” she said. But she said she would not “comment on every bit of micro-policy” now. However, she did say the fact so many firms are complaining about the tax, and saying that it will make employing people on low wages unaffordable, meant that the government should “look again” at the plan. And that would be something the Tories would look at when they started work on their policy platform, she said. UPDATE: Badenoch said: Where we can see that a change that has been brought in in the budget ... will not raise any money, we will change that. What I’m not going to do is comment on every bit of micro-policy. There will be different budgets, there will be new things that occur, the system may change. What I am starting with is principles, we believe that employer’s national insurance, while necessary to help us fund public services, is a tax on jobs. The fact that so many organisations – especially those that have people who are on the lowest wages – are saying that this is becoming unaffordable means that we should look again, and that’s one of the first things that we’re going to be doing when we start our policy platform. Badenoch ended her speech by referring to reports that, when Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, speaks to the CBI later, she will say no one has offered a good alternative to the proposal in her budget. Badenoch said: They will tell you there is no alternative, there is. We need an alternative strategy so we can finally unleash the power of business to make our country better. I believe in the immense power of business to do good. You may not be the public sector. But many of you deliver critical services for the public. So I will stand up for the values of business. It’s time to defend free enterprise and capitalism, to defend lower taxes, less borrowing and healthy, real competition. Badenoch said government could learn from business in adapting to change. Government itself must change, it must change what it does if growth is ever properly to return. We didn’t address this when we were in government and if Labour does not they will fail. Government is going to have to learn from business about how to work better quicker and be more responsive. We can no longer tolerate a situation where building roads takes decades. Where Treasury decision making means railways don’t get built. Where the planning system stops investments being made by you and your colleagues. Over the last two decades, you have all had to transform your business models to account for massive societal and technological change. It’s time that government does the same because what we have now isn’t working. Badenoch called for a rethink in the role of the state. We are trying to fix problems with the wrong tools. We are using a mindset and a paradigm that worked well in the late 20th century, but does not work well when we have aggressive competitor economies like China. And when there is rapid technological innovation, when our society is getting older and the birth rate is still too low, more quangos, more interference, more regulations, more laws will not fix that. We need to ask ourselves, ‘What is the role of the state? What can we do to create a level playing field and allow you to go out and fix those problems?’ Badenoch said she wanted politicians to cut back on regulation. Politics needs to accept boundaries. Every day in the legislature, someone has a great new idea that sounds nice in principle, but in practice, creates more red tape, more bureaucracy, more burden. The incentive for us as politicians is to keep announcing new nice things. But the way to fix things is not just about creating new laws. We must not be a bureaucratic state. We need to get a proper diagnosis of what is going wrong. Why is capital investment so low? Why is productivity still so stubbornly stalled? I have read endless reports and many reviews with all sorts of potential solutions improving skills or getting our pensions working harder for us, and we have brought in regulations and policies to address this. And yet, still, things are not getting better. I think we need to look again. So I’m not standing here telling you that I have all the answers. I am letting you know that I have seen the system from the inside and it is broken. Badenoch also said she wanted to take a new approach to growth. We have got to be more precise when we talk about growth. It is not just about increased GDP. It is not even just about increased GDP per capita. You can increase GDP by increasing immigration, but no one feels richer. In fact, some gets poorer. You can increase GDP per capita by getting more millionaires and billionaires to move to your country, but that won’t necessarily make everyone else better off. In fact, there are many studies that show even when nothing has changed, we are more likely to feel worse when we compare ourselves with those who are a lot wealthier than us. I am talking about real growth, growth that people can see, growth that people can feel, seeing an improved environment around them, as well as having more money in their pockets to spend, knowing that we have enough money to provide security, to protect our families, but also to protect our country in increasingly dangerous times … The bottom line is that economic growth is not the end in itself. It is a means to an end. The end is to make people’s lives better. Badenoch says, as leader of the opposition, she wants to start by setting out principles, not policies. So what are our principles? I believe that we need to have free and fair competition, not monopolies, not rent seeking, not corporatism, but in genuine competition that allows new entrants in and those who are no longer productive to evolve or leave the economy. That is what free enterprise is about. We Conservatives must be the party of business, not just big business, not just corporates, but small business, too. Every big business started out as a small business, and that is why I am so concerned that the burden on them is still increasing with taxes, corporation tax, employers’ national insurance and new regulations … So I am here to show you that I understand businesses values. I am not here to represent business interests. That’s your job. I’m here to let you know the Conservative party shares your values. I’m often criticised for talking about capitalism. Someone once told me that capitalism is old fashioned. I don’t think so. I think it is important that we explain what capitalism in a free market environment means. Capitalism is not a dirty word, wealth is not a dirty word, profit is not a dirty word. But we need to start explaining how these things deliver for the people out there people who often think that you are in it for yourselves. Badenoch says she has given the most important economic jobs in her team to people with business experience – Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, and Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary. Kemi Badenoch starts by asking how you can tell if a politician will do what they say they will do. She goes on: If you really want to know what someone is going to be like, look at what they did when they had the chance. And speaking to all of you today, not just as leader of the Conservative party, but as a former business secretary, many of you would have heard me talk about how we needed to deregulate, and you would have seen examples of how I tried to lift the burden on businesses. Badenoch says, as a minister, she opposed “well-meaning but burdensome regulation”. She says people often want the government to solve everything. But often government just needs to get out of the way, she says. This is a very difficult argument to make. People want the government to fix everything. They want the government to solve everything, and if you ever sound hesitant, then they will make you out to be a cruel, unfeeling person, as I have discovered, to my own personal cost. And this is partly how we have got ourselves into a state where debt is at record levels, and we are spending more on debt servicing than we are on health or on education or on defence. That needs to change. Kemi Badenoch will soon be giving her first speech to a CBI conference as Conservative leader. There is a live feed here. At 3.30pm a Foreign Office minister will respond to an urgent question tabled by Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, about the international criminal court’s decision to issue an arrest warrant for Benjamain Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, for alleged war crimes in Gaza. In an open letter to Keir Starmer about this yesterday, Patel said: The White House has ‘fundamentally rejected’ the ICC’s decision. Not least because this decision will do nothing to help secure the release hostages, get more aid into Gaza or deliver a sustainable end to the conflict. But, by contrast, the UK government’s response to the decision has been nonsensical. On Friday, the home secretary refused to say whether Mr Netanyahu would be detained if he travelled to the UK. This opens the farcical spectre of your government trying to sanction the arrest on UK soil of the leader of an ally of the UK, while you continue a diplomatic charm offensive with the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping. It falls to you to clarify the government’s position - now. The Government must make clear that it does not support an arrest warrant being issued which has no proper basis in international law. If the ICC is to regain any legitimacy, it must act within legal norms and correct this failure of leadership. The UK should lead the diplomatic pressure to bring about this urgent change. After the UQ there will be a statement from Steve Reed, the environment secretary, on Storm Bert. In a message yesterday on X, the social media platform that he owns, as well as promoting the petition calling for a UK election, the Trump ally and multi-billionaire businessman Elon Musk described Britain as “a tyrannical police state”. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, asked if Keir Starmer agreed with this, the PM’s spokesperson said he would not be drawn on individual comments. But he stressed Starmer’s commitment to law and order. Downing Street has defended Keir Starmer’s decision this morning to promote plans to make spiking a criminal offence (see 11.16am) – even thought it is already illegal. Although No 10 said in its news release that spiking will become “a new criminal offence”, not that it will become an offence for the first time, people following the news casually could be lulled into thinking the government is banning something that is currently legal. Starmer himself implied this earlier today when he posted this on social media. Spiking will be made a criminal offence. My government was elected to take back our streets, central to this mission is making sure women and girls can feel safe at night. Perpetrators of spiking will feel the full force of the law. Asked if this was misleading, the PM’s spokesperson told journalists at the lobby briefing this morning that the government was creating a new offence to “send a very clear signal” that offenders should expect punishment. He went on: This new legislation will also empower victims to report offences and give them confidence that the justice system will support them. When it was put to him that Starmer’s tweet implied spiking was not already illegal, the spokesperson said the PM was referring to a new offence being created. The spiking law is a good example of what the Economist’s Bagehot column described earlier this year as the “ban it harder” trend in British politics. “When it comes to tackling an injustice that is already against the law, the answer can be simple: ban it harder,” Bagehot wrote. On the subject of spiking in particular, the column said: Spiking, in which a victim’s drink is drugged in order to rob or assault them, is a terrifying crime. It was already prosecutable under seven separate offences before the Home Office proposed legal amendments in December 2023 to show “without any doubt, spiking is illegal”. But the reason why prosecutions are rare, and the true scale of spiking hard to define, is because hospitals do not routinely test for drugs in emergency wards. A new offence is unlikely to change that. The Foreign Office has announced a fresh wave of sanctions against Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers which it is using to try to evade international restricitons on its oil importants. In a news release, the Foreign Office said: Thirty ships in Russia’s shadow fleet, responsible for transporting billions of pounds worth of oil and oil products in the last year alone, have today been sanctioned by the UK. With half of the ships targeted today transporting more than $4.3bn worth of oil and oil products like gasoline in the last year alone, today is the largest UK package of its kind. The move will further constrain the Kremlin’s ability to fund their illegal war in Ukraine and their malign activity worldwide, and brings the total number of oil tankers sanctioned by the UK to 73, more than any other nation - demonstrating the UK’s leadership on tackling the shadow fleet. This is what Keir Starmer told ITV’s Good Morning Britain when asked about the online petition signed by 2 million people calling for an election on the grounds that “the current Labour government have gone back on the promises they laid out in the lead up to the last election”. Starmer said: Look, I remind myself that very many people didn’t vote Labour at the last election. I’m not surprised that many of them want a rerun. That isn’t how our system works. There will be plenty of people who didn’t want us in in the first place. So, what my focus is on is the decisions that I have to make every day. Calling for a general election now when we had one less than six months ago and when the government has a working majority of 163 is clearly bonkers. But the petition is attracting signatures because it is being strongly promoted by high-profile rightwinger provocateurs like the X owner Elon Musk and the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. Starmer agrees that shoplifting is a terrible problem. And he says he will come back on the programme in the future to discuss how well he is doing this. Q: The last time you were on this programme you said you would get your children a dog when you moved into No 10. Starmer says he was in negotiations on that. But they have got a cat, he says, called Prince. But Prince has not yet met Larry, the Downing Street cat, he says (implying Prince does not leave the family flat). He says he is worried that Larry would win in a fight. They end talking about Christmas, and cooking. Starmer says he does a lot of cooking, and that the dish his children like most is a pasta bake, with layers of sauce, with different cheeses. He likes to cook on a Saturday, he says. He says he is particularly proud of his tandoori salmon and tandoori Quorn. Q: Are you feeling the pressure? There is a petition signed by 2 million people calling for another election. Starmer says he is not surprised that people who did not support Labour in the first place want the election to be re-run. But that is not how the system worked. Q: Your approval rating is lower than Nigel Farage’s. That must be disappointing. Starmer says, if you take the difficult decisions first, it is inevitable some people won’t be happy. I’m not surprised, quite frankly, that as we’re doing the tough stuff, there are plenty of people who say, ‘Well, I’m impacted.’ Q: Is it harder than you expected? Starmer says he always knew this would be difficult. But he came into politics to take difficult decisions, he says. He says there are 7 million people on waiting lists. He wants to bring them down. Asked what his experience of government has been like, Starmer says he is taking the hard decisions first. I think anybody who’s turned around an organisation or a business will tell you, and they’re right, if you’re really going to turn something around, you have to do the hard yards upfront. Don’t look at a tough decision and then leave it for a year or two. So we’re doing the tough stuff. But in the budget, which is probably the toughest, I’m really pleased that we were able to put so much money into the National Health Service … Anybody watching this who uses the NHS will know we absolutely had to make that a priority. Starmer says halving violence against women and girls is one of the missions of his government. It will be hard, but he is determined to do it, he says. He urges people to text messages to British Transport Police on the 61016 number if they see a woman being harassed on a train. Q: Shouldn’t there be more police officers on the trains? Starmer says he cannot say every text sent to that message will prompt a response. But sometimes it has led to offenders being arrested getting off a train. Keir Starmer is being interviews on ITV’s This Morning. He is being asked about his plans to tackle spiking. He says he first announced he would make it a specific criminal offence in an interview on this programme 18 months ago. He says he is pleased to be back to say this is actually happening. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI chief executive, has given the government credit for “drawing the curtain on a near decade of instability at home”. But, in line with the advance briefing, she also used her speech to the CBI conference this morning to argue that the tax rises in the budget will harm business. She said: What really defines growth is the decisions made in boardrooms up and down the country. It’s CFOs [chief financial officers] asking, ‘can we afford to invest? Can we afford to expand? Can we afford to take a chance on new people?’ Well after the budget, the answer we’re hearing from so many firms is still ‘not yet’. The rise in national insurance, the stark lowering of the threshold, caught us all off guard. Along with the expansion and the rise of the national living wage – which everyone wants to accommodate – and the potential cost of the employment rights bill, they put a heavy burden on business. She also said that tax rises like this should never be imposed on business by surprise again. From now on, we need to shift from consultation to co-design. Tax rises like this must never again be simply done to business. That’s the road to unintended consequences. Instead, we need an elevated partnership for a higher purpose. There is more coverage of her speech on our business live blog. In her interview on the Today programme this morning Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, was asked about a call from UN Women UK for bystanders to be more proactive in intervening to protect women being harassed or threatened in public spaces. Asked if she she would advise people to intervene, Phillips replied: Yes, I would, but I would say always do it safely. If you say something in the street that’s really worrying you, you should ring 999. But what I would say is that you can definitely ask if somebody is all right in the street. There’s no active aggression in that. Phillips also said she was speaking from a club where staff were trained to intervene in this sort of way if they say men bothering women on the dance floor. She said there was nothing offensive about asking a woman if she was OK. MPs will have a free vote on assisted dying, the government is neutral, and that means cabinet ministers are on different sides of the argument. But when asked about this on LBC this morning, Jess Phillips, the Home Office minister, denied suggestions that this was causing acrimony. She said: I actually don’t sense a degree of tension. Those who have now become famous for their opposition to it, the likes of Wes Streeting, for example, I literally just text him and said, ‘Are we going for dinner this week?’, so even though me and him feel differently about this issue, it is a matter of conscience. The i has splashed today on the cabinet splits over assisted dying. It says 14 cabinet ministers support the bill, but eight are opposed. More than 20 police forces in England and Wales are sending plainclothes officers into bars to look out for predatory sexual behaviour, Keir Starmer is being told at the meeting in Downing Street he is hosting on spiking this morning. In a statement released in advance, assistant chief constable Samantha Millar, the National Police Chiefs’ Council violence against women and girls strategic programme director, said: Spiking is a complex offence to investigate as drugs can pass through the system quickly and there is often a lack of evidential opportunities, which is why quick reporting and early evidence gathering, including forensic testing, is key. Police forces across the country have been working proactively to stop spiking from happening in the night-time economy and improve feelings of safety for women and girls. This includes regular, targeted patrols of busy town centres and visiting organisations, such as universities, to raise awareness of the symptoms of spiking. Forces also work closely with bars, pubs and clubs to tackle spiking, and during the first national spiking police week of action in March, forces collectively visited over 1900 licensed venues to ensure that staff understood how to support victims. To coincide with the meeting, the British Transport Police says it is relaunching text-to-report number, 61016, which “is now free across all major networks, allowing women to discreetly contact British Transport Police for help if they are or someone else is being harassed on the train”. Russia and other adversaries of the UK are trying to use artificial intelligence to enhance cyber-attacks against the nation’s infrastructure, Pat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister, will warn at a Nato conference in London later today. Dan Sabbagh has the story. Good morning. There is plenty happening today. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, are both speaking at the CBI conference, where the CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith is warning about the impact of the budget on business. Keir Starmer is hosting a meeting at Downing Street about plans to protect women from spiking. “My government was elected on a pledge to take back our streets, and we will never achieve this if women and girls do not feel safe at night,” he says. There will be tributes to John Prescott in the Commons this afternoon. But one issue is going to dominate the week, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday, and already that is a big topic of discussion. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, has been giving interviews this morning and she told the Today programme she is finding it impossible to predict if the bill will pass the second reading vote. She said: We do not know how this vote is going to go. I literally couldn’t call it for you at the moment … Each week I think a different thing. Last week I thought it wouldn’t [pass]. This week I think it might. Honestly, I’ve learned over the years not to try and second guess parliament. Phillips is not the only person finding the vote hard to call. Eleanor Langford from the i has been keeping a tally of how MPs intend to vote and last night she published her figures on social media. Since the assisted dying bill was announced, I’ve been keeping a close eye on MP views I’ve found 207 supportive and 141 opposed... but there are still 291 we don’t know about (N.B. Can’t share full spreadsheet due to anon declarations. Total excludes Sinn Fein and Speakers.) I should underline that these figures are *not* a prediction of the vote, but an interesting look at the direction MPs are leaning With 291 MPs not stating a view at the time of writing, the vote very easily could go either way We’ll know the actual result on Friday afternoon According to Janet Eastham’s story in the Daily Telegraph today, supporters of the bill think it will pass – provided MPs who have said they support it are willing to vote for it. A source close to the MPs campaigning in favour of legalisation told The Telegraph: “If all the MPs who have said they support the Bill turn out and vote for it, then it will pass.” When MPs last voted on assisted dying, in 2015, the bill was easily defeated by 330 votes to 118. After the election many people assumed that the Labour landslide, and the drastic change in the composition of parliament, meant that there is now a majority for assisted dying. But in recent weeks there have been indications that opponents of the bill are gaining ground, in part because Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary (the two cabinet ministers who would have most responsibility for implementing assisted dying) have come out against it forcefully. In interviews this morning Phillips said she would be voting for assisted dying, as she did in 2015. She also rejected the suggestion that Mahmood’s criticism of the bill could be disregarded because it was motivated by religion (something Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor, suggested yesterday). Asked if it was wrong for Mahmood to impose her faith on others, Phillips said: She will make the decision about how she votes on assisted dying on a matter of conscience, just exactly like I will. How she comes to that and what moral code she uses to come to that will be exactly the same as the moral code that I use to come to that decision as well … I think that Shabana is making a decision on what she thinks is best for her constituents, like every constituency MP.

          "bodyText": "That’ll be all from me, with David Hytner’s report in. Thanks for joining! Ruben Amorim comes over to speak to the Sky pundits, including Roy Keane. He’s a very clear, direct talker. “It’s a tough league. “I think my players were thinking too much during the game. You can feel it. “It’s a tough match. We lost some balls without pressure and when you start a game like this, you score one goal, you have to control the ball, you have to control the tempo of the game. We cannot do it at the moment. “But they tried, they really, really tried. They want this.” Oh, and Ed Sheeran interrupts the conversation to get pally with Jamie Redknapp. Just a normal day in the Barclays. It wasn’t the most memorable game, United’s most lively moment saved for the second minute. Amorim is calling his players together, getting them to go an applaud the visiting supporters. Ipswich could well have had the win, denied by some excellent saves from André Onana. Not the dream start for Ruben Amorim, but no disaster either. 90+4 min: Muric holds on to Fernandes’ delivery. That should be that. 90+3 min: Amad bursts into life on the right, driving into the box, launching his stepovers before cutting in for a shot that is blocked away. United win a corner. 90+1 min: We have four minutes added on. Clarke hooks the ball from the centre circle to the right wing but sends it out, unable to cope with the pressure of the onrushing Mazraoui. 90 min: Hutchinson’s cross from the right causes little damage. 88 min: The home support bursts into noise, recognising one last push is required. 87 min: The free-kick is played short and eventually sees the subs work together with Clarke finding Chaplin inside the area, his shot from around 10 yards not finding the power or precision to trouble Onana. 86 min: Clarke is bundled down in midfield to win a free-kick from 30 yards or so. Mason Mount is on for Garnacho. 85 min: It’s not really clicking for either side, genuine chances a rarity. Garnacho’s cross from the left fails to find Højlund. 81 min: Liam Delap, after a very lively display, is off, as is Wes Burns. Conor Chaplin and Ali Al-Hamadi are on. 80 min: Mazraoui is down on the ground to prompt a pause in the game. 79 min: Fernandes lines it up, Amad next to him. The captain lets loose and is inches away … a dipping effort just wide of the post as Muric moved to his right. 78 min: Fernandes wins United a free-kick by the D, opening up a decent chance … 77 min: United work it patiently before Zirkzee, outside the area, on the right, launches a shot into Ipswich city centre. 75 min: Muric cleans up at the back after Zirkzee wins the ball off Davis on United’s right. The keeper’s clearance meets the body of the linesman, who deals with the blow gracefully. 73 min: Fernandes finds Garnacho on the left, the winger launching the stepovers before firing a cross in … there’s no red shirt on the end of it. 71 min: Delap, again, somehow carves out space in the middle with a neat flick and sets off before launching a hit over the bar. He’s a good watch, feisty to go with obvious talent. 69 min: Ipswich escape from the danger of the corner before Mazraoui silkily plays out from the back, leading to Højlund shaping up to shoot from the edge of the box … a wayward pass is the result when he should probably have had a crack. 67 min: Fernandes plays a cracking first-time ball down the left for Rashford to hop on to … he wins a corner. Amorim sees McKenna’s bet and raises, Højlund and Zirkzee on for Eriksen and Rashford. 65 min: Ipswich makes their first changes: Szmodics and Cajuste are replaced by Jack Clarke and Jack Taylor. 64 min: United fans chant Amorim’s name, bathing in the excitement of a new relationship. 62 min: It’s all a bit quiet again after the more enticing action in the first few minutes of the half. United are struggling to break into the Ipswich half and keep the ball there. 59 min: Amad is working hard from a defensive point of view, tracking a run into the United box to cut out the long ball. It’s a proper shift, being a wing-back. 57 min: Shaw is the left-sided centre-half, with Dalot continuing at left wing-back. 56 min: Time for a couple of tweaks. Luke Shaw returns after a long lay-off, replacing Jonny Evans. Casemiro is off for Ugarte. 55 min: O’Shea makes a fine block as Fernandes hits inside the area after playing a one-two with Rashford. 54 min: Cajuste saves Ipswich as United launch a counter, nailing a sliding challenge inside the area to deny Garnacho from letting loose. 52 min: Excellent from Delap who bats away pressure in the centre circle to turn and push forward before finding Burns the right. A cross comes in, Delap tries a back-flick at the near post but he can’t seem to beat Onana tonight. The United goalkeeper is big again, unable to be beaten, saving his side again. 50 min: Casemiro and Eriksen aren’t pleading for the ball when United’s backline have it; it’s hard to see how the visitors cut through Ipswich’s shape at the moment. 48 min: Ipswich get their passing game going as the crowd rediscovers its voice. 46 min: Casemiro plays a nice diagonal ball for Dalot to pick up on to before Fernandes slides in Garnacho inside the area … his ball in from the left is palmed away by Muric. United begin brightly. United get us going in the second half, no changes at the break. In comes an email with the subject line: ‘21 day cooling off period in contract.’ “When the next flight to Lisbon?” writes Aidan Adair. Tom Hopkins writes in on VAR’s little break from action: “Great to see that minor emergency dealt with so efficiently. Good process.” It’s Ipswich who look the better, more well-drilled side, their equaliser thoroughly merited. Welcome to Manchester (yes, I know this is at Portman Road), Ruben. 45+3 min: Delap bundles down Mazraoui on Ipswich’s left wing and there’s a bit of squaring up between the two. 45+2 min: Watching the replays of Hutchinson’s strike … there may have been a deflection off Mazraoui’s head that gave the ball an extra lift to beat the reach of Onana. 45+1 min: Ouch. Jonny Evans is down on the ground after Delap flies into him to try and win a header. 45 min: VAR’s back, and we’ve got three minutes added on. Ipswich are threatening … and here comes a stunner! Burns passes to Hutchinson outside the area, the 21-year-old’s back to goal. He turns and lets fly with his left foot, curling into the top left corner from 20-something yards. It’s well deserved for the hosts. 40 min: A stunning save from Onana! A long ball down the left is seized upon by Davis, who lays off to Delap in the middle, just the keeper to beat from a few yards – he opts for power over accuracy and the keeper makes himself big to deny an equaliser, the right arm flung out. 38 min: Tuanzebe v Garnacho is a good battle to watch at the moment, the former United defender refusing to let the winger out of his sight. 37 min: According to the TV comms, there’s a fire alarm at Stockley Park so VAR is not currently operational. The ref lets the captains know. 36 min: Ipswich look more dangerous than United … before Fernandes plays a zipping through ball for Garnacho to run on to. He can’t break free and shoot though. 33 min: Leif Davis, Ipswich’s left-back, is down with his right leg being seen to. He seems OK though. 32 min: It’s time for another Ipswich corner, Davis to swing in: he goes to the far post, it’s headed across goal, cleared to Hutchinson for a stinging strike inside the area. But the wall of red shirts cannot be broken. 30 min: Fernandes pulls off a fine self-nutmeg dummy to break free in midfield but the move ends with Dalot’s cross, cutting in from the left, finding Muric. 29 min: Hutchinson looks ready to hit it … and does with some venom … but it’s too central, straight into the hands of Onana. 28 min: Hutchinson turns in the middle of the park to get Ipswich flying forward and Delap wins a free-kick on the edge of the box after Evans gets in the way … 25 min: United do seem quite conservative on the ball at the back, trying to play around Ipswich rather than through them. They’re not finding any gaps to carve through the hosts. 24 min: Davis swings in an Ipswich corner from the right … Onana stands firm to collect. 22 min: Amad is back on his feet and heads away a cross before Ipswich’s Morsy takes down Garnacho in the middle of the park. 20 min: We’ve got time to take in the replays of the first goal: it was a stellar run from Amad down the right after playing a one-two. Rashford’s anticipation was important, too, getting on the end of a slightly scuffed cross. 19 min: Amad is on the floor, wriggling around in quite a bit of pain after feeling some Ipswich studs. 18 min: Garnacho beats Tuanzebe to the ball out on the left wing, feeds Fernandes who rolls it back to the Argentinian: a low, curling effort is sent wide. 15 min: Garnacho switches the ball to Amad who dinks the ball into Fernandes’ path before danger is snuffed out by Ipswich. Dalot seems to have a playmaking role out on the left, inviting pressure before playing a cutting pass into the middle. 14 min: Dalot takes a few years for a throw-in, inviting whistles from the home support. 12 min: Ipswich sit off as United play it around at the back. 11 min: Onana is forced into action for the first time in the game, getting low to his right to make a fine stop, denying Szmodics who went first-time from outside the area, the ball rolled in perfectly from the right wing. Ipswich look alive, despite their early misstep. 8 min: United play out from the back with De Ligt at the centre of the back three in this new formation. Evans pushes forward into the Ipswich half as part of United’s press but the hosts beat it and Burns fires in a teasing cross from the right that no-one can get on the end of. 6 min: Dalot skips down the left before finding Bruno in the middle with a fine pass. The lively Diallo then locates Eriken, who has a crack from the edge of the D … he shoots wide. 5 min: Ipswich have a corner headed away strongly by Casemiro. Well, that was quick. Amad Diallo, in at right wing-back, launches a rampaging run down the wing, dinks a cross to the near post and Marcus Rashford beats Arijanet Muric to the ball to slot in comfortably from close range. Amorim plays it cool with the celebrations. 1 min: United’s 3-4-3 has Dalot at left wing-back, with Mazraoui at right centre-back. Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United are underway. Ipswich kick things off. Touchline fashion watch: Ruben Amorim has the puffer parka zipped up. Let’s go! Before we get going, here’s Rick Harris: “It takes time to turn around the fortunes of any large underachieving business, so Ineos should be cut some slack surely? They couldn’t very well sack Ten Hag having not only won the FA Cup but having outplayed the PL Champions to boot, but they have acted decisively after giving him a reasonable number of games to demonstrate he was progressing. “Amorim will need time to get his style of play across and it remains to be seen if it will suit the players United have more than the whatever it was Ten Hag was trying to implement.” Managerial news from elsewhere: Alex Kamilewicz writes: “My heart believed it would turn around with each managerial appointment, but starting with the transfer botchings under Moyes my head believed we were in for a long run in the wilderness with no adequate replacement for Gill. “I now believe the choice of manager won’t necessarily make the whole difference as much as the organizational changes being made by INEOS (i.e. putting people who understand football in charge) will. Hopefully.” Tom F’s Gladiator II review is in: “I reckon Denzel Washington could get a tune out of this United squad.” Ruben Amorim has spoken to Sky Sports, and he’s honest: “I’m a little bit anxious because as a coach when you don’t know the league or you don’t know very well the team, you don’t know what to expect. “It’s a new life, let’s start with the small details. That’s what I want and I want my players to win the game, and they’re capable to do that.” Regular contributor krishnamoorthy v is ready for chaos: “While Amorim could not have asked for a better first match, I am wondering what would be the state of Man U fans should United manage to blow this.” “Yeah I’ve got hope, first impressions have gone down well with me,” writes Neil Carter. “Performs well in front of the press, looks very much at ease and smiles, this is a huge part of football these days. Along with keeping the talent engaged and happy. “The style of play seems set in stone and I’m interested to see how it goes, but the premier league being what it is (the hardest) I fear he may need a plan B or C if he’s gonna succeed. “For now I’ll be watching and won’t be getting carried away one way or another.” Ipswich make one change from the team that beat Spurs, Wes Burns replacing Ben Johnson. Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Alejandro Garnacho are in for United – I presume Marcus Rashford will play centrally as Rasmus Højlund is on the bench. Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia, all making their way back from injuries, could be called upon too. Here’s how we’re looking: Ipswich: Muric, Tuanzebe, O’Shea, Burgess, Davis, Morsy, Cajuste, Burns, Hutchinson, Szmodics, Delap Subs: Walton, Harry Clarke, Woolfenden, Chaplin, Taylor, Al Hamadi, Townsend, Luongo, Jack Clarke Manchester United: Onana, Dalot, Evans, de Ligt, Diallo, Casemiro, Eriksen, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Garnacho, Rashford Subs: Bayindir, Mount, Højlund, Zirkzee, Malacia, Antony, Shaw, Ugarte, Mainoo Which was the one where you thought it was all going to be OK again? I thought it with Louis van Gaal, just after he’d taken the Netherlands to bronze at the World Cup. I guess I thought it with Mourinho, too. And then Solskjær when he had his honeymoon phase. Oh well. Desperate for that sweet, sweet ‘Rise of Ruben Amorim’ content? Here you go: Right then, United fans, are you feeling it again? You know it, that dangerous thing that pops up every couple of years with the appointment of a new manager. Hope. This guy’s the real deal, you say and genuinely believe. Before you know it you’re 3-0 down at Brighton, the camera pans to Ferguson in the stands and the veterans are raging once again on The Overlap, inviting one of their old mates back to talk about the good times. Will Ruben Amorim change the story and somehow avoid all his hair growing grey by January? The answer begins at Portman Road against an Ipswich side that finally has a win on the board after beating Spurs before the international break. Kieran McKenna, linked with the United job in the summer, could well play the villain. Feel free to share your thoughts, queries, wisdom, reviews of Gladiator II, whatever you fancy."

          "headline": "Amorim’s Manchester United pegged back by Ipswich after rapid start",
          "bodyText": "It was plainly too good to be true. Or to last. There were 82 seconds on the stadium clock when the Ruben Amorim era at Manchester United was jumpstarted. The new manager had put his faith in Marcus Rashford in the No 9 role and it was United’s great enigma who put them in front. Rashford charged about in the early running, a point to prove. And yet it was the prompt for a slow retreat by United for the remainder of the first half. The structure was different, United set up in Amorim’s trademark 3-4-2-1, but the players were the same, along with plenty of the frustrations and faultlines from Erik ten Hag’s tenure. Control proved elusive. As it did so often under Ten Hag. Ipswich were the better team before the interval and the excellent Omari Hutchinson got the goal they deserved before the end of it with a shot from distance that took a deflection off Noussair Mazraoui. Ipswich had won for the first time this season at Tottenham before the international break. This was in point-gained territory for them. Not so for United. After all of the talking and, goodness gracious, there has been some talking, Amorim’s arrival feeling like the coming of the messiah, it was time for United to fire some optimism. They could not do it. They were a bit better in the second period but not hugely and it looked as though the players had too much to process in terms of instructions. It all became stilted. Then again, as everyone knows, least of all Amorim, it will take time. He has only had two training sessions with the full squad. United had risen one place in the table on Saturday without playing – evidence, the club’s support hoped, of Amorim’s magic – and there was always going to be a spotlight on his first starting XI. Amorim talked on Friday about the need to “adapt some players” because he did not have the right profiles for his three-at-the-back system and there were a few square pegs in round holes, especially the left-footed attacking midfielder Amad Diallo at right wing-back. Amorim did not have three fit specialist centre-halves – there were four out with injuries – and so it was the full-back, Mazraoui, on the right of the back three. Casemiro and Christian Eriksen in central midfield did not scream revolution. Or pace and intensity. Talk about the dream start, an element of vindication, because it was Diallo who made the goal. He moved smartly through the gears up the right wing and, having slipped a tackle from Jens Cajuste, his low cross was made to measure for Rashford. The travelling United fans had chorused Amorim’s name after 30 seconds. They belted it out on loop for the next couple of minutes. Ipswich stabilised. It was clear that Hutchinson had the beating of Casemiro and Jonny Evans, who played on the left of United’s back three. Hutchinson, in the right-sided No 10 role, was sharp with his turns and very quick. Amorim was a presence at the edge of his technical area. This is what coaching on the hoof looks like and it had to alarm him that United sank deeper. They looked to hurt Ipswich with long diagonal passes but it was the home team that took a grip on the midfield. The equaliser had been advertised, André Onana busy in the United goal. He had pushed away a first-time hit from Sammie Szmodics in the 11th minute but the big save came in the countdown to half-time. Leif Davis stepped inside Diallo and he waited for the move of Liam Delap, putting the ball on a plate for him. Eight yards out, Delap put his foot through it only for Onana to throw out a big right hand, Peter Schmeichel-style, to block. United’s reprieve did not last long. Inevitably, it was Hutchinson, checking away from Casemiro on the right-hand edge of the area, quick feet to the fore. His curler flicked off Mazraoui’s head to deceive Onana on its way in. United pressed more on to the front foot after the restart, although they might have conceded when Delap tricked away from Matthijs de Ligt and surged through the middle. De Ligt looked awfully slow. Delap went right to Wes Burns and sprinted to meet the cross, his spectacular flick kept out by Onana. Alejandro Garnacho had worked Arijanet Muric from a tight angle at the start of the second half. And there was the moment on 54 minutes when he led a break with Rashford available inside for the pass, Cajuste the only Ipswich defender. Garnacho looked for Rashford; Cajuste made the crucial interception. Amorim searched for the solution. He got Luke Shaw on at left centre-half for his first football of the season, ordering him to stay close to Hutchinson. Manuel Ugarte replaced Casemiro. It was Rasmus Højlund for Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee was introduced in the right-sided No 10 role, Bruno Fernandes dropping back into midfield. There was a late sighting of Mason Mount, who came on for Garnacho. United could not make it happen. Fernandes curled a free-kick inches wide and it might have been worse for them if the Ipswich substitute, Conor Chaplin, had shot either side of Onana from a cross by another replacement, Jack Clarke. Not for the first time, Onana stood tall."

          "bodyText": "Birmingham, Bristol and London City airports have reportedly been put up for sale by their Canadian pension fund owner as it looks to cash in on a resurgence in air travel after the pandemic. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP) is said to be in talks over a potential sale of its stakes in the UK airports to minority shareholders. The portfolio, which also includes Copenhagen and Brussels airports, is estimated to be worth more than £10bn. The minority shareholders have the right of first refusal for 30 days, but the move could prompt those smaller stakeholders to sell up instead. OTPP, which holds stakes ranging from 25% to 70% in each airport, has started to approach potential outside bidders including the Australian investor Macquarie in case smaller investors decline the offer, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the sale talks. Since the Covid pandemic, when travel restrictions grounded planes worldwide, airports have started to recover from the disruption, including Heathrow, which returned to profit in February and hit record weekly passengers in July. The revival has sparked interest from other investors, including rival Canadian pension funds. PSP Investments, which manages the retirement funds for the Canadian armed forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, bought the operator of Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports from Ferrovial and Macquarie in a £1.5bn deal earlier this month. The UK’s Labour government has been watching foreign investments closely, with hopes of replicating their successes with other projects, and ensuring that UKinvestors take a bigger interest in domestic assets so pensioners reap the benefits of any returns. The OTTP and PSP are two of Canada’s famed Maple 8 funds, which collectively manage about $2tn (£1.1tn) in taxpayer-backed pension schemes for teachers, municipal employees and healthcare workers. The Maple 8, created after a series of reforms to tackle underfunding in the 1990s, have become well known for investing in infrastructure schemes across the globe, including in the UK. The UK government is consulting on plans to merge local government retirement schemes and workplace pension programmes into a handful of the country’s own megafunds."

          "headline": "The assisted dying bill: safeguards are essential to prevent suicide",
          "bodyText": "Sonia Sodha makes an excellent point about the assisted dying bill in saying, “I’m not sure we can prevent people choosing assisted suicide because they feel they are a burden or would rather pass money on to their kids than spend it on care.” (The assisted dying debate: Charles Falconer and the Observer’s Sonia Sodha tackle the issues, Focus) We couldn’t, and that deserves more attention. Huge numbers of Britons would die voluntarily, refusing to be a trouble to others and to burden the state, if assisted dying became legal. We live in a society acutely aware of the pressures faced by the NHS, and the sense of being a burden would be felt the most keenly by the most helpless. If the assisted dying bill were to pass, they would know that all they had to do to end the feeling of guilt would be to die. The only sufficient safeguard for the vast majority of us is the law as it stands. It also motivates us to ask for better palliative solutions – and motivates the medical community to seek them. Marina Bowder Steventon, Abingdon, Oxfordshire As leaders of faith communities we wish to express our concern at the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, which will be debated by MPs on 29 November. We are aware of how complex and weighty this topic is. There are many dimensions to the bill, all of them of great ethical and practical importance. We hold in prayer all those across our country who may be personally affected, and our representatives in parliament with profound decisions before them. Part of the role of faith leaders in communities is to provide spiritual and pastoral care for the sick and for the dying. We hold the hands of loved ones in their final days, we pray with families both before and after death. It is to this vocation that we have been called, and it is from this vocation that we write. Our pastoral roles make us deeply concerned about the impact the bill would have on the most vulnerable, opening up the possibility of life-threatening abuse and coercion. This is a concern we know is shared by many people, with and without faith. In the UK, it is estimated that 2.7 million older people have been subjected to abuse; many of these may also be vulnerable to pressure to end their lives prematurely. Disability campaigners and those working with women in abusive relationships have also highlighted the danger of unintended consequences should the law be changed. The experience of jurisdictions that have introduced similar legislation, such as Oregon and Canada, demonstrate how tragic these unintended consequences can be. Promised safeguards have not always protected the vulnerable and marginalised. Even when surrounded by loving family and friends, people towards the end of their life can still feel like a burden. This is especially the case while adult social care remains underfunded. In this environment, it is easy to see how a “right to die” could all too easily end in feeling you have a duty to die. We are convinced that the current law provides much greater security for those who are vulnerable than the bill before parliament. A bill which MPs will have had only three weeks to scrutinise before they vote on it. The most effective safeguard against life-threatening coercion or abuse is to keep the law as it is. In supporting the state of the current law, we do not deny that some people experience a painful death, though we welcome the fact that these deaths are far less common than they used to be due to advances in palliative care. Over decades, we have witnessed how compassionate care, along with the natural processes of dying, allow those at the end of their life to experience important moments. We have seen relationships repair and families reconcile. We have seen lives end in love. Much can be lost by cutting these processes short. We believe that a truly compassionate response to the end of life lies in the provision of high-quality palliative care services to all who need them. While there are many examples of excellent palliative care in this country, it remains worryingly underfunded. Investment in palliative care is the policy of a truly compassionate nation. It is the way to ensure that everyone in society, including the most vulnerable, receive the care they deserve at the end of life.

The worry that assisted dying legalisation might allow people to be “coerced, pressured or nudged into killing themselves” is misplaced. Legalisation makes this less likely because it brings openness and requires two doctors and a judge to be sure that the terminally ill patient genuinely wants to die a few months early. Contrast that with the current situation where any assisted dying has to be given in secret with no professional approval or oversight. Generally, people giving assistance are not prosecuted, so the current law does not stop assisted dying from happening, it just prevents safeguards from being in place. Richard Mountford Hildenborough, Kent We write in support of the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill 2024. Our current law does not serve to safeguard the sanctity of life. By criminalising assisted suicide, it can cause people to end their lives before they require help to do so. Our law does not protect weak and vulnerable people: it requires people to take decisions about their end of life out of sight, alone and without the help of professionals. It encourages dangerous and traumatic attempts at suicide and denies many people dignity and autonomy in how they live out their final months of life. The bill will protect the vulnerable and the sanctity of life much more effectively than our current law. It will allow terminally ill people in the last six months of their life to make free, informed and settled decisions about their end of life through a robust process involving two doctors and a judge. The bill will strengthen the role of the criminal law: assisting suicide will remain an offence other than where assistance is offered through the new formal process. New offences will also be created. There is no reason to suppose litigation will broaden the ambit of the bill: every decision of the European court of human rights and of our domestic courts has said that this is an area which is a matter for parliament in which courts will not interfere. It is time for the sake of the vulnerable, for the sake of safeguarding the primacy of human life, and for the sake of constitutional good order that the law is reformed, and that decisions about end of life are brought out of the shadows.

For too long, the shame of sexual abuse has stuck to innocent victims. It belongs to the perpetrators, and those who could have stopped them but didn’t. Let’s hope this unprecedented decision of an archbishop to resign leads to others named in the Makin report to have the decency to follow Justin Welby’s lead. Instead of making prompt and necessary changes to improve safeguarding, I fear the Church of England will revert to its usual agonisingly slow decision-making processes that don’t seem to serve anyone. I hope I am proved wrong. Name and address supplied Farmers and inheritance tax Will Hutton articulated the good reasons why this tax should be introduced (“Farmers have hoarded land for too long. Inheritance tax will bring new life to rural Britain”, Comment). As always, farmers are never happy. While in the EU, they complained all the time about how the EU was not in their best interests. A large proportion of farmers then voted for Brexit. They are still not happy about any restrictions to exports. They are also not happy with the new system of funding for farmers. Now they are complaining about the introduction of inheritance tax. We all have to contribute to society and the reforms Labour is introducing will go towards the benefit of all people. Edna Johnston Newmarket, Suffolk As a farmer, I have worked seven days a week, rarely taken holidays, have had to rely on diversified income streams to pay the mortgage and any surplus has been invested in the farm, which was ultimately going to be sold to provide a house and a pension. At 80 acres, it is probably worth in excess of £1m, but it is more of a lifestyle than provider of a living. As a first-generation farmer, I could never have afforded to increase the acreage sufficiently to create a viable operation, and operating with scattered fragments of land is inefficient. I would like to invite Hutton to spend some time on the farm. Jonathan Murray Westerdale, Whitby, North Yorkshire The curse of celebrity authors In regard to Catherine Bennett’s article, the huge advances paid to celebrity “authors” drains the pool of money that publishers have to pay other, full-time authors (“There is a moral in Jamie Oliver’s story of stereotypical folk, just not one he intended”, Comment). I made a reasonable living writing more than 100 books for children, but couldn’t do it now because the money offered to middle-ranking authors has shrunk as the advances paid to celebrities have risen. When I retired I was being offered the same advances as at the start of my career 35 years earlier. Richard Platt Hastings, Kent Oxford tutors’ gig economy Anna Fazackerley is right about the Uberisation of academic staff (Oxford relying on ‘Deliveroo-style’ contracts with most tutorials not taught by full-time staff, News). Three main factors are at work. One, the corporatisation of the university has replaced the horizontal “republic of tutors” with a gulf between highly paid professors and senior managers and a reserve army of staff on casual contracts. Two, the sleight of hand that allows the temporary replacement of a permanent academic whose six or eight hours’ tutorial teaching per week (plus two courses of university lectures per year) is counted as full time, while the equivalent offer by non-permanent academics is counted as part time. Three, colleges do not recognise the University and College Union. Robert Gildea, Professor Emeritus of Modern History University of Oxford A single market is the key The lesson from Brexit for any government is the danger in making undeliverable promises and raising false hopes (“Closer ties with the EU is lever for economic growth”, Editorial). Labour needs to be transparent about the realistic, achievable economic benefits of its planned reset with the EU. As the editorial states, “achieving sufficient alignment to have meaningful impact on GDP could take years”. Whereas alignment is imperative, the economic benefits, although worthwhile, will inevitably be small in relation to the real game-changer: rejoining the single market or customs union. David Newens Great Linford, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire Tackling social anxiety Social anxiety and shyness are on a continuum: the former is more intense and persistent (“Ask Philippa: I find it hard to make friends – now my daughter does, too”, Observer Magazine, 10 November). For those experiencing such problems, there are treatments available, including within the NHS Talking Therapies programme, and cognitive behavioural therapy. People with social anxiety do not usually lack social skills, but anxiety can prevent them from expressing themselves naturally in situations they find difficult. We believe there should be more awareness of this treatable mental health problem. Sarah Peacey, trustee, Social Anxiety Alliance, London N14 All at sea in the Colosseum Wendy Ide thinks the idea of sharks in the Colosseum is silly (Gladiator II review – Paul Mescal fends off sharks, rhinos and a scenery-chewing Denzel Washington, New Review). However, aquatic games (naumachia) were common in Roman amphitheatres, although they were generally naval battles. The Romans weren’t familiar with sharks; catching and transporting them to Rome would have been problematic, but no harder than flooding and draining the Colosseum.

          "bodyText": "Twelve months on from Canada’s worst-ever wildfire season unfolding during a news blackout on Facebook, the nation has warned Australia about Meta’s “reckless” behaviour during “need-to-know situations”. An early start to Australia’s bushfire season is looming for swaths of the country, with large parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory, the south-west of Victoria and south-east corner of South Australia facing higher risk, according to an official assessment in September. In August 2023, negotiations between the tech giant and Canada’s government broke down as Justin Trudeau’s Liberals doggedly pursued news bargaining deal C-18, known as the Online News Act – similar to the one struck in Australia in 2021 following a seven-day news blackout. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The breakdown in negotiations resulted in Meta blocking all news sources on Facebook in Canada “recklessly and dangerously” as all 10 provinces and three territories in the country burned, Canada’s heritage minister, Pascale St-Onge, told Guardian Australia. “Facebook is leaving disinformation and misinformation to spread on their platform, while choosing to block access to reliable, high-quality, independent journalism,” St-Onge said. “Facebook is just leaving more room for misinformation during need-to-know situations like wildfires, emergencies, local elections and other critical times for people to make decisions on matters that affect them.” Misleading clickbait became prevalent as an area of 15m hectares – larger than England and 2.5 times the second-most destructive wildfire season in 1989 – burned across Canada, killing eight people and displacing hundreds of thousands. A spokesperson for St-Onge said Facebook had “continued to block news recklessly and dangerously” as the nation entered into another wildfire season in June of this year. “Canadians now can’t access or share vital information on social media at times when affected Canadians are checking in on loved ones and others are possibly evacuating,” the spokesperson said. The Australian government is negotiating with Meta after it declined to renew deals made under the news media bargaining code to compensate news publishers for news carried on Facebook and Instagram. The government may choose to designate Meta (force it into negotiations over compensation or face fines) which could prompt Meta to ban news altogether. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said the government was considering advice about the code and would “have more to say in due course”. “From local news and current affairs to vital emergency information, a significant and growing number of Australians use social media platforms to access news,” she said. “Australians should have access to quality sources of information online, including trusted news brands. This is especially important during natural emergencies.” In June this year, Meta told a parliamentary inquiry into social media “all options are on the table” when asked if it would pull all news from Facebook if it it was designated. The parliamentary committee recommended in its second interim report the government should consider imposing a “digital platform levy” – a kind of big tech tax - on companies such as Meta and Google. News content on Facebook in Australia has already become far less prominent, and Facebook removed its unsuccessful news tab. Anthony Albanese has also raised the possibility of a levy, with the prime minister saying the social media companies shouldn’t get a “free ride”. In early October, in response to questions on notice from the social media inquiry, Meta said only 3% of Facebook views were of news links, arguing that showed “access to news content is not the core reason people use Facebook” and that people could access news elsewhere. It also argued it combated misinformation with factcheckers, safeguards and measures to reduce its spread and availability, and removed disinformation and harmful misinformation. A spokesperson for Meta said there was “no change” to publishers’ ability to use Facebook, and no change to its Safety Check product, which allows users to let others know they are safe in a time of crisis. Other features include “access to authoritative information, including content from official government agencies, emergency services and non-governmental organisations”, the spokesperson said. Meta has also agreed to “help amplify official information for people in emergency situations like wildfires” and coordinate with the government to spread reputable information. Prof Dan Angus, director of Queensland University of Technology’s Digital Media Research Centre, said Meta slowly deprioritising news might be undetectable to the average user. “We’re creatures of habit … if all of a sudden tomorrow those platforms upend their algorithms and what content is featured, people might not necessarily know they need to change something because they’re not getting news in their feed any more,” he said."

          "headline": "Many protest movements of the past decade have backfired. What would it take for one to succeed under Trump?",
          "bodyText": "The day after Trump’s 2017 inauguration, the freshly minted junior senator from California addressed the crowd at the Women’s March in Washington. “Let’s buckle in,” Kamala Harris declared, “because it’s going to be a bumpy ride.” She wasn’t kidding. An estimated 470,000 demonstrators poured into DC that day, the pink tide of pussy hats (a defiant rejoinder to Trump’s endorsement of sexual assault) flooding the National Mall. With millions more attending simultaneous demonstrations around the country, the outpouring of resistance was dubbed the largest single-day protest in American history. For all of the event’s emotional power, however, once the chartered buses groaned back on to the Beltway, Trump settled into the White House and set about implementing his agenda. In that sense, the event was arguably a failure, comparable to a number of recent American mass political mobilizations that delivered less in the way of tangible change than their participants hoped. The wealth gap has widened considerably since Occupy Wall Street. The Dakota Access pipeline went online in 2017, despite the valiant efforts of Standing Rock’s water protectors. Many of the progressive gains in criminal justice reform made in response to the George Floyd protests were quickly rolled back. Not only is Atlanta’s Cop City still under construction, similar facilities have been approved around the country. And Israel continues its war on Gaza (having extended the theater to the West Bank and Lebanon), with the help of US-supplied weaponry, in defiance of the mass public outcry. So what gives? As the dazed and beleaguered liberal coalition ponders its future under a second Trump regime, activists might be forgiven for wondering whether taking to the streets en masse can ever make a meaningful difference. For the journalist Vincent Bevins, who has spent years studying grassroots political movements around the world – occasionally dodging teargas and water cannons to do so – and has witnessed many of them fail to deliver on their promise, the answer is complicated. On the one hand, he says, the American left may have no choice. “If celebrities and elite media and voting every two years were sufficient, we would have already won,” Bevins says, speaking by video conference from London. Characterizing widespread rejection of Biden-Harris-style liberalism as a wake-up call, he adds: “That the Democratic party has failed in such a consequential moment not only opens up space for pressure from below, but it makes it imperative.” But strategy matters, as Bevins’s extensively reported 2023 book, If We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution, makes all too clear. The collective exhilaration of mass popular action and the dashed hopes that often follow are hardly limited to recent US-based movements. Focusing on the 2010s, a decade that began with the Tunisia uprising and ended with the emergence of Covid-19, the book examines roughly a dozen mass protest movements, of which only two (in South Korea and Chile) led to the sort of change advocates envisioned. Nearly all of the remaining instances of high-profile mass protest – including those in Tunisia, Egypt, Hong Kong, Brazil and Ukraine – “experienced something worse than failure”, he writes. “Things went backward.” As If We Burn demonstrates, some of the same characteristics that allowed a series of people’s movements during the last decade to attract masses of supporters and destabilize the existing order – spontaneity, fuzzy objectives, a reliance on social media and an allergy to structure, central leadership and even designated spokespeople – also carried significant, sometimes fatal, drawbacks. This recipe can be “an incredibly explosive combination when what you need to do is get as many people on to the streets as possible”, he points out. “And these moments are experienced as euphoric victory for the participants. But it’s poorly suited for what comes next, which is filling the power vacuum that has been created or elaborating a set of demands.” While there is good historical justification for the left’s mistrust of organizational hierarchy – the authoritarian turn of the Bolshevik revolution makes for an enduring cautionary tale – the downside was seen in the ease with which the Muslim Brotherhood managed to usurp the loosely organized Tahrir Square protests in Egypt, or the way rightwing forces in Brazil turned the populist energy unleashed by the left in 2014 to their own ends. For domestic examples of the value of structure and discipline, one need only compare the success of the civil rights movement, with its clearcut demands, well-trained activists and strong leadership, with the ambiguous legacy of Occupy Wall Street. Occupy’s emphasis on “horizontalism” and consensus-based decision-making is often credited to the efforts of the late anthropologist and anarchist writer David Graeber, an enthusiastic advocate of prefiguration – the idea that a movement should model the world it hopes to create. And Occupy did so brilliantly. During my own visits to Zuccotti Park, I quickly learned to stop quizzing activists about their goals and to instead simply immerse myself in the enthralling if fragile utopia they had somehow conjured in a bleak stone plaza. In addition to reframing US political discourse around a powerful class-based critique, Occupy proved that an entirely different paradigm of human relations, based on direct democracy and mutual aid, could flourish if left to its own devices. In doing so, it provided inspiration for movements around the world. But of course Occupy wasn’t left to its own devices for long. As Bevins points out, genuine disruptions to state power nearly always prompt a violent crackdown. “There doesn’t even actually have to be a revolution for elites to launch a counterrevolution,” he adds. “They just have to think that their privileges are threatened.” That said, especially in the era of social media, violent government repression often leads to the opposite of its intended effect. In almost every case Bevins studied, “Viral images of police brutality cause a massive scaling-up of the protest” – a dynamic that played out during last year’s campus demonstrations on behalf of Palestine. This is the point at which the mobilization of more organized groups – churches, political organizations and especially unions – can prove decisive. While marches, encampments and various forms of civil disobedience are great at commanding attention, they rarely succeed on their own. Strikes, walkouts and boycotts, on the other hand, can cripple an economy – a reliable pain point for the elite class. “It’s often when the economy stops working that the existing leaders in capitalist systems really have to take notice,” Bevins says. In recent decades, the strength of the US economy – and the relative comfort it has afforded many of us – seems to have acted as a pressure valve, dampening the fervor of domestic protest movements. As much as progressives might wish for a better world, few Americans have so far been willing to take real personal risks to challenge the status quo. (And tweeting doesn’t count.) For many liberals, the anguish of the first Trump administration was mostly “affective”, Begins suggests – a sense of emotional discomfort brought on by “the stuff you had to see on the news”. He draws a contrast with the enormous hardship Brazilians suffered under Bolsonaro. “People that had jobs at a bank or in a restaurant were living on the streets with their families,” he recalls. “It was when governance became so obviously chaotic that he even lost well-off Brazilians in the large cities that his government began to fall apart.” Since the Great Depression, that kind of suffering has been fairly limited in this country, but the prospect seems less remote every day. “We’re in a world of polycrisis,” Bevins says. “We’re in a world of environmental collapse. We’re in a world where Donald Trump has promised change that is likely to be quite chaotic and unpredictable and dangerous.” If there’s a single lesson to be learned from the last decade of mass protest, he adds, it’s simply this: in an atomized, digitally mediated society that has left so many of us feeling alienated and adrift, transformational change will depend on solidarity, community and human connection. “I see people saying, don’t limit yourself to participation in politics, which amounts to pressing buttons in a voting booth every two years. Join a labor union, a social movement, a political party, a tenant union, a community organization, a book club. Literally anything is better than sitting at home and scrolling on your phone and getting mad at the news,” Bevins says. One opportunity will arise soon enough – another Women’s March is slated for 18 January. In addition to sending a message, it will rally the troops, provide inspiration and fellowship, and ideally give participants the chance to connect with or build the sort of focused, disciplined organizations that sometimes manage to force genuine change. “If groups get large enough and employ tactics like strikes or boycotts, or somehow make the reproduction of routine daily life impossible,” Bevins says, “they can really impose concrete costs on an existing political system. “The more that you are arm in arm with other human beings and able to act collectively and hopefully democratically,” he advises, “the better you’ll be prepared for whatever comes.”"

          "bodyText": "Probably you already know what this is. Probably before you read a word of it, you decided what it was, where you stand on it, how you’re going to feel about it. The headline, there’s your first clue. Maybe you recognised the name of the writer and drew your own conclusions. And of course there’s the Guardian masthead at the top, the world’s leading bat‑signal for wet liberals, so already there’s a self‑selecting audience there. Or maybe you came via a social media link that already told you what to expect. Necessary, vital, powerful. Great piece by so-and-so. A shocking antisemitic screed by an unashamed Jew-hater. Sides are taken. Feelings are felt. Minds are not changed. So we mumble things. We despair quietly. We watch our words, stay silent, or simply look away. Because to do otherwise is to run a gauntlet of threats, smears and abuse, a very public excoriation whose very purpose is to distract, divide, dishearten. Is starvation bad? Ack, it’s complicated. What about the bombing of hospitals or residential areas? Ah, right can of worms you’ve opened there. In the meantime almost two million people in Gaza are at risk of starving to death. In the meantime the Gazan ministry of health reported that 76 Palestinians were killed in 24 hours on Monday, but nobody seems to know who did it, or whose fault it was, or whether this is a welcome or unwelcome development. In the meantime the national security minister of Israel is promising the “voluntary transfer of all Gazan citizens”. But then in this particular space – the space where an unhinged ethnonationalist far-right government meets the soiled earth that used to constitute public discourse – nothing really means anything any more. Words can indicate anything you want. Actions have no consequences. The United Nations is bad, actually, and bombings are a form of defence, and newborn babies can be collateral damage, and the dead are not dead, because you cannot be human if you never existed in the first place. At which point, a little gauchely and with a deep reluctance: enter sport. Over the past 13 months, since the appalling attack on Israel by Hamas in October last year, sport has tried to present the smallest possible target amid the carnage that followed. The line is: there is no line. Occasionally a punishment beating would be handed out to an athlete who failed to hold this no-line line. Mainz sacked the winger Anwar El Ghazi for posting “stop the killing”. The Australia batter Usman Khawaja was banned from displaying the message “all lives are equal” on his shoes during a Test match. Otherwise, business as usual. But recent events have threatened this fragile omertà, a darkness lurking just beyond the windows that can no longer be ignored or held at bay. A series of coordinated attacks on Maccabi Tel Aviv fans at a Europa League game against Ajax drew international condemnation and almost ended up bringing down the Dutch government. There were scuffles and empty seats at a Nations League game between France and Israel, which Emmanuel Macron attended as an act of solidarity. And last Monday, there was global outrage at the killing of two Gazan footballers, Eyad Abu-Khater and Hisham Al-Thaltini, in Israeli air strikes. Obviously I’m joking about the last one. Nobody gave a shit about that. Or any of the 344 Palestinian footballers killed by Israel since last October, or the fact that teams from Israel’s West Bank settlements play in their domestic league in violation of Fifa rules, or that the Palestinian West Bank league has been suspended indefinitely. In the face of this, inaction begins to feel like its own conscious choice. It’s six months since Fifa promised a prompt ruling on whether or not to impose sanctions on Israel’s national team for the actions of its government, and we’re still waiting. It’s four months since Israeli athletes competed at the Olympic Games after the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, declared: “We are not in the political business.” It’s two months since a major Israeli assault on Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, destroyed the town’s main football stadium. I’ve been thinking a lot about hopelessness recently. Pretty much everyone I know is scarred and scared, bruised and hurting. And tired; so tired. Amid all this, the ruins of conventional politics, the desecration of our common ground, a stinging question: what hope can sport possibly have of making a difference? Can it ever be more than a cocoon, a means of escaping the real world rather than changing it? In other words: what are we all doing here? A “Free Palestine” banner at Celtic Park or the Parc des Princes; the 60,000 empty seats at the Stade de France last Thursday; a few small words of solidarity from a global icons like Coco Gauff or Lewis Hamilton or Kyrie Irving: does this mean anything, beyond what it is? Can this ever be more than flickering lighter flames in the teeth of an unstoppable, genocidal gale? Nobody knows. But we know, or we should know, right from wrong. Killing children is wrong. A government that declares some humans as more worthless than others is wrong. Presiding over a famine is wrong. How is this complicated? How is this the start of a debate, rather than the end of one? How is it remotely possible to frame this horrific extravaganza of violence as the benign option, and the resistance to it — even when it comes from Jews themselves — as some kind of sublimated hatred, rather than the simplest act of conscience there is? To resist this Israeli regime is not incompatible with resisting a Saudi World Cup or a Russian Olympic team or a Taliban ban on women’s sport. Indeed this is one and the same resistance: a resistance to the doctrine of untouchable power, a resistance to violence and othering as the solution to our common problems. And even if sport is a blunt and pointless tool of social change, it must nonetheless be deployed. Because there remains – even in this warped, fucked fairground mirror of a world – a thing called right and a thing called wrong. For the Palestinians sport has always been a form of expression, a place of wonder and play, a brief taste of freedom, a locus of international recognition, and so of course it cannot be allowed to live. Probably you’ve already decided what you think about this. But even one mind is worth changing, just as surely as one life is worth saving."

          "bodyText": "THE REAL QUIZ The countdown is on. Not to World War III, or to a former writer of this tea-timely email’s appearance on the Christmas Strictly, or even to Rúben Amorim’s first game as Manchester United manager. Nope, the ticking clock has been wheeled out to inform us that, at the time of writing, planet earth is precisely 23 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds and 0 sanity from Amorim’s first pre-match press conference as Manchester United manager. There has been plenty of hype around new managers before, particularly when José Mourinho breezed into west London in 2004, told everyone he was special and gave the assembled hacks a generous heads-up by informing them that Chelsea would win the Premier League title at Bolton on 30 April 2005. Amorim is surely the most hyped newbie since Pep Guardiola arrived in 2016 to wage war on stereotypes about water, wind, night-time and Stoke-on-Trent. But there is one difference. In 2016, typing ‘When is Pep Guardiola’s first Manchester City press conference?’ into Google would have produced nada. Zilch. Eff all. Try the equivalent for Amorim and your computer will turn into a 180°C oven within seconds. On a pure football level Amorim’s arrival is really, really exciting, especially as it is coupled with Guardiola’s decision to extend his Manchester City contract, an announcement that had a pretty clear subject: “Do you feel special, punk?” But the amount of content around his arrival is making us pine for the days of blissful ignorance and Elton Welsby introducing The Match on ITV approximately 30 seconds before kick-off. Back then, the game was the thing. Now it’s fighting for primacy with the endless news cycle. Don’t believe us? See if you can guess how many of these recent headlines we have made up: ‘Rúben Amorim’s ‘grandpa’ coach at Man Utd ‘can’t say two sentences in English’’ ‘Man Utd’s fans ‘jaded’ as Rúben Amorim predicted to ruin his career’. ‘Five things we learned from Rúben Amorim’s first training session’. ‘Rúben Amorim has ‘very own whistle’ as he calls time on Antony’. ‘Marcus Rashford gives three-word verdict on Rúben Amorim’s first Man Utd training session’. ‘Casemiro gives two-word verdict on Rúben Amorim’s first Man Utd training session’. ‘Rúben Amorim ‘will make exciting Man Utd request’ ahead of Ipswich debut – EXCLUSIVE’. ‘Supercomputer reveals how difficult Rúben Amorim’s first five games are at Man United – and how it compares to their Premier League rivals’. ‘Supercomputer predicts Rúben Amorim’s Spotify 2024 Wrapped playlist’. ‘Five things we learned from Rúben Amorim’s choice of trainers for this first training session’. ‘What Rúben Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation reveals about his preferred lovemaking technique’. None. They’re all real headlines. OK, the last three aren’t real, but that’s the direction of travel and we give it three more permanent United managers tops before they appear on Google. This desperate search for insight, clicks, exclusives, clicks, hot takes, clicks, clicks and clickityclickclickclicks is a symbol of a culture in which the actual football sometimes feels like an inconvenient interruption. This has significance far beyond the weary irritation of an email that just wants to go back to 2004 and hear the Franz Ferdinand album for the first time. Amorim is going to face a level of scrutiny – and, at times, a level of infantile questioning – that would break 99% of managers. How he handles it will permeate through the thing that still matters most, just about: the association football. It all starts at 2pm on Friday 4.30pm on Sunday.

          "bodyText": "When a political fighter leaves the arena, it’s often an enemy who confers the highest praise. As Bill Shorten farewelled the parliament just three days shy of 17 years since he arrived, it was Peter Dutton, his weekly sparring partner on Friday morning breakfast TV, who said what the prime minister and Shorten himself could not. “Knowing his intellect, his political capacity, the respect that he has for his value structure – he would have gone on to become a very good prime minister of our country,” Dutton said before breaking into a grin. “Fortunately, that was not the case, because we won the election.” The opposition leader’s reality punchline heralded laughter across the chamber and cut through all the things left unsaid. Dutton was unencumbered by the legacies of leadership battles won and lost that inevitably mute the glow of tributes from a rival on the same side. “The way that Bill Shorten came into this place was covered in glory in terms of his career,” Dutton told the House of Representatives after the former Labor leader, and then minister for the NDIS, had made his peace and said his goodbyes. “And he leaves this place covered in glory because of the sacrifice that he’s made, that his family have made, to causes that are important to him and that are important to our country.” Shorten had broken with tradition and placed his watching family first, not last, on his list of thank yous. He said he loved wife, Chloe, with all his heart, declaring she cast everything around her “in a golden light”. To the children, Rupert, Gigi and Clementine – the youngest of whom accompanied him through morning media interviews with enough panache to prompt baton-passing speculation – he said he was grateful for the unvarnished feedback and “incredibly proud”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Shorten noted that of 1,244 people who had ever served in the House of Representatives, only 216 had the chance of a formal farewell. To a chamber filled with colleagues of all stripes across the floor and supporters and observers of history in the galleries above, Shorten declared that “political life is indeed tough”. “Election defeat. Scandal. Illness. Section 44,” he said, reeling off the things which had sent others packing before they had this chance. “So I stand here, neither defeated nor disposed – lucky to have served, fortunate to be able to say goodbye and thank you.” Those acknowledged by name included his British bulldog, Walter, hinting at that truism that if you want a friend in politics, the canine variety is best. “Thank you, buddy, for your unconditional loyalty and being the best listener I’ve ever met,” Shorten said. He spoke of the event that made the then union leader known around Australia – the Beaconsfield mine disaster – and other industrial accidents that drove him to defend “the fundamental workplace right … to come home safely”. He noted a string of proud policy achievements – the national disability insurance scheme perhaps first among them. He declared that “some of your failures become the best of you” and that despite painful lows, he “would not hand back a single minute of a single hour of a single day” he’d spent in politics. There was only the barest reference to what would never be, with a reminiscence on the uproar that ensued when he tackled a sausage sandwich side-on. “You do regret your mistakes. You don’t forget your favours. Oh, what I would give to go back to election day 2016 and turn that sausage and bread and eat it a different way.” Shorten ran through his policy hopes and dreams with the urgency of someone passing the torch. He reflected on his English heritage and the precious gift of education – the field into which he goes next as vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra from February next year. Thanking a roll call of Labor heroes and the party he loved, he pointedly singled out his former deputy Tanya Plibersek for her “unwavering support”. The man who took Shorten’s job after a shock 2019 election loss and ran past him into office in 2022 said Shorten had done “big things, but he has also done small things that have made a big difference”. “No one worked harder to rebuild Labor in opposition,” Anthony Albanese said. “No one had given more of their time or energy to making the case for a Labor government.” The prime minister acknowledged the challenge that comes with an opposition leader’s job. “Bill did it with distinction,” Albanese said. “He did it with commitment. He did it with passion to make a difference and to endeavour, not once but twice … to take Labor back into government, because at the end of the day, if you are not in government, you can’t make a change to the country that you want to make.” Shorten ended with some advice to those he leaves on the leather benches, to be ambitious – including on tax reform and reconciliation – and optimistic about what they could achieve – and with a nod to Rudyard Kipling. “All our time here is finite,” Shorten told them. “Fill every unforgiving minute with 60 seconds of distance run. And I and the Australian people will be urging you on and wishing you well. And for the last time, I thank the house.” • Karen Middleton is Guardian Australia’s political editor"

          "headline": "Zelenskyy welcomes US decision to give landmines to Ukraine amid criticism from aid groups – Russia-Ukraine war as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s key events: In a video address on Wednesday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the US and Joe Biden for the provision of landmines to Ukrainian troops, calling it “essential … to stop Russian assaults”. In addition to the landmines – which aid groups have widely criticized due to their impact on civilians – the latest $275m US aid package includes drones, Himars ammunitions and artillery. Various aid groups have expressed criticisms to Agence France-Presse over the US’s decision to send landmines to Ukraine, the outlet reports. Alma Taslidžan of Handicap International said that they “cannot distinguish between combatants and civilians” while Tamar Gabelnick, head of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, called the US’s decision “unconscionable”. Four Latin American countries have issued a joint statement in which they called to “avoid actions that would escalate the arms race” in the Ukraine-Russia war, Agence France-Presse reports. The four countries – Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico – said that such actions would “aggravate the conflict”. Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, the Guardian understands according to multiple sources. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia’s border with Ukraine in what UK and US officials have warned was a major escalation of the nearly three-year-old conflict. US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed Kyiv employed US-made Atacms missiles to strike targets within Russia. The Kremlin stated that six missiles were launched at the town of Karachev, with fragments from one reportedly causing a significant explosion. Sergey Naryshkin, the director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, was quoted in Russian media on Wednesday as saying that attempts by Nato countries to strike inside Russia would not go “unpunished”. Elsewhere, the chief of staff in Belarus, Pavel Muraveiko, described US moves to allow Ukraine to deploy longer-range missiles and anti-personnel mines as “irresponsible”. Staff at the Irish embassy in Ukraine have been told to work from home as tensions continue to escalate in the region. It follows from the US shutting its own embassy in Kyiv because of a “potential significant air attack” by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s forces. Italy, Spain and Greece also closed their embassies in Kyiv today, according to Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. In the early afternoon, the Ukrainian air force told people to seek shelter because of a missile threat. Senior officials told people not to ignore the alert. That came shortly before Kyiv’s top military spy agency GUR issued a warning about a Russian psychological operation it said involved fake messages claiming to have been sent by the agency. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that Ukraine lost 400 service personnel on the Kursk front in the last 24 hours. The ministry gave a detailed list of western-supplied Ukrainian equipment it had destroyed. The claims have not been independently verified. Amnesty International has condemned the US decision to send anti-personnel landmines to Ukraine as part of the latest aid package, calling it “reckless” and a “setback” in the fight against the use of landmines. In a statement, Amnesty spokesperson Ben Linden said: “It is devastating, and frankly shocking, that President Biden made such a consequential and dangerous decision just before his public service legacy is sealed for the history books.” Linden urged Biden to reconsider the decision, adding: “Anti-personnel landmines are inherently indiscriminate weapons that maim and kill civilians long after conflicts end and shouldn’t have a place in the arsenal of any country. Even the ‘non-persistent’ mines are a threat to civilians.” The US is not a signatory to the 1997 Mine Ban treaty but has not exported anti-personnel mines since 1992. How might Russia respond to the UK and US letting Ukraine hit it with their missiles? The Guardian’s Julian Borger reports: The Kremlin has brandished its strategic arsenal before over the course of the Ukrainian conflict, in an attempt to deter western involvement. But for all the threats, the US has said it has seen no signs of unusual movement at Russian nuclear weapon storage sites, suggesting there has been no change in the physical positioning of tactical warheads. Most experts think use of nuclear weapons by Russia is unlikely for now, but have cautioned against complacency. Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said he did not believe that dropping a bomb in Ukraine was on Moscow’s list of options “primarily because it would not help achieve any military goals, and Russia is advancing at the moment”. Read the full explainer here: Four Latin American countries have issued a joint statement in which they called to “avoid actions that would escalate the arms race” in the Ukraine-Russia war, Agence France-Presse reports. The four countries – Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico – said that such actions would “aggravate the conflict”. The joint statement comes after Ukraine fired long-range, UK-made missiles into Russia for the first time since the war began in February 2022, prompting Russia to vow a response. In a video address on Wednesday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the US and Joe Biden for the provision of landmines to Ukrainian troops, calling it “essential … to stop Russian assaults”. In addition to the landmines – which aid groups have widely criticized due to their impact on civilians – the latest $275m US aid package includes drones, Himars ammunitions and artillery. “This marks the 70th defense package from the United States. Ukraine deeply values the bipartisan support from America and the decision of president Biden,” the Ukrainian president said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the US’s decision to provide Ukraine with landmines, Agence France-Presse reports. Calling the weapons – which have been condemned by international aid groups – “very important to stop Russian assaults”, the Ukrainian president said they would “really strengthen our troops on the front”. Describing the landmines, the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Wednesday that they “would self-activate, self-detonate and that makes it ... far more safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own”. Various aid groups have expressed criticisms to Agence France-Presse over the US’s decision to send landmines to Ukraine, the outlet reports. Speaking of the anti-personnel landmines, Alma Taslidžan of Handicap International said that they “cannot distinguish between combatants and civilians”. Taslidžan added to AFP: “In that sense, it’s unethical to use landmines.” Similarly, Mary Wareham, advocacy director of the arms division at the Human Rights Watch, told the AFP: “It’s just astonishing that the White House now appears to be walking back its own policy to transfer to Ukraine, which is a member of the treaty banning anti-personnel landmines.” Meanwhile, Tamar Gabelnick, head of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, called the US’s decision “unconscionable” and said it “represents a dangerous setback in the global fight against landmines”. Here are some images coming through the newswires in recent days from Ukraine: It is approaching 8pm in Kyiv and 9pm in Moscow. Here are the key developments so far today: Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, the Guardian understands according to multiple sources. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia’s border with Ukraine in what UK and US officials have warned was a major escalation of the nearly three-year-old conflict. The spokesperson for UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said his office would not be commenting on reports or operational matters. The Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use US-supplied antipersonnel landmines to help it slow Russia’s battlefield progress in the war, the US defence secretary said on Wednesday, marking Washington’s second major policy shift in days after it decided to let Ukraine strike targets on Russian soil with longer-range US-made missiles. US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed Kyiv employed US-made Atacms missiles to strike targets within Russia. The Kremlin stated that six missiles were launched at the town of Karachev, with fragments from one reportedly causing a significant explosion. In response, Russia has announced it is adjusting its nuclear doctrine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow would interpret any attack against it carried out by a non-nuclear state using weapons supplied by a nuclear state as a joint assault. Peskov also reiterated that a “freeze” of the conflict in Ukraine along the existing frontlines would be unacceptable to the Russian Federation. During his daily press briefing, Peskov declined to comment when asked about the US embassy closing in Kyiv, but said that Russia believed the outgoing Joe Biden administration had shown that it is fully committed to continuing the war in Ukraine and is doing everything possible to achieve that. Sergey Naryshkin, the director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, was quoted in Russian media on Wednesday as saying that attempts by Nato countries to strike inside Russia would not go “unpunished”. Elsewhere, the chief of staff in Belarus, Pavel Muraveiko, described US moves to allow Ukraine to deploy longer-range missiles and anti-personnel mines as “irresponsible”. Staff at the Irish embassy in Ukraine have been told to work from home as tensions continue to escalate in the region. It follows on from the US shutting its own embassy in Kyiv because of a “potential significant air attack” by Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s forces. Italy, Spain and Greece also closed their embassies in Kyiv today, according to Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. The UK and Moldova launched a new defence and security partnership on Wednesday in the face of threats from Russia, the UK government announced. The initiative was disclosed as British foreign secretary, David Lammy, visited the Moldovan capital Chisinau. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he opposed the US decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to attack inside Russia, because it will enflame the conflict, broadcaster CNN Turk cited him as saying on Wednesday. In the early afternoon, the Ukrainian air force told people to seek shelter because of a missile threat. Senior officials told people not to ignore the alert. That came shortly before Kyiv’s top military spy agency GUR issued a warning about a Russian psychological operation it said involved fake messages claiming to have been sent by the agency. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that Ukraine lost 400 service personnel on the Kursk front in the last 24 hours. The ministry gave a detailed list of western-supplied Ukrainian equipment it had destroyed. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukrainian military said on Wednesday that it shot down 56 out of 122 drones and two out of six missiles launched by Russia overnight. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian media, citing the defence ministry, reports that 44 Ukrainian aircraft-type drones were intercepted over Russia overnight. The Russian defence ministry claims that 20 of them were over Novgorod oblast, which is to the south-east of St Petersburg, and some considerable distance from Ukraine. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Wednesday it detained a German citizen who had been allegedly involved in organising the explosion at a gas distribution station in Kaliningrad in March this year and had been trying to enter Russia, according to state media. Russia detained the German national, named as Nikolai Gaiduk, on sabotage charges. Italian prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had opened cases against two people accused of spying for Russia “for the purposes of terrorism and subversion”. In a statement, the Milan public prosecutor’s office said that it was initiating criminal proceedings for suspected “corruption of (Italian) citizens by a foreign actor” against the two unidentified defendants. Italian prosecutors said on Wednesday that they had opened cases against two people accused of spying for Russia “for the purposes of terrorism and subversion”, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). In a statement, the Milan public prosecutor’s office said that it was initiating criminal proceedings for suspected “corruption of (Italian) citizens by a foreign actor” against the two unidentified defendants. They are suspected of having “collaborated with the Russian intelligence services to provide them with sensitive information” beginning in May 2023. That included photos of military installations and intelligence on drone and cybersecurity technicians, according to the findings of the initial investigation, with the pair receiving payment in cryptocurrencies in return, reports AFP. Searches unveiled the interest Russian intelligence services hold in mapping out the video surveillance systems of Milan and Rome, as well as the areas of those cities with no surveillance cameras, the prosecutor’s office added. In particular, the two offered taxi companies in Milan to equip their vehicles with cameras free of charge, with the aim – unbeknownst to the taxi drivers – of handing their footage over to Russia. Donald Trump’s re-election as US president has prompted fears that he will cut off US support for Ukraine, forcing it into peace talks with Russia that would culminate in a settlement on terms favourable to Vladimir Putin. In an interview with the New Statesman, David Lammy has argued that Trump would not go that far. That might sound like wishful thinking, but Lammy and Keir Starmer did have dinner with Trump in the autumn. Lammy discusses that too in the interview with George Eaton. Here are the key lines. Lammy argued that Trump would not accept a deal over Ukraine that would look like a victory for Putin. Asked about Trump’s stance on Ukraine, Lammy said: I’ve been a politician for 25 years and I understand the different philosophies at play. There’s a deep philosophical underpinning to friends in the Republican party that I’ve known for many years, thinking back to people like [former US secretary of state] Condoleezza Rice. Donald Trump has some continuity with this position, which is ‘peace through strength’. What I do know about Donald Trump is that he doesn’t like losers and he doesn’t want to lose; he wants to get the right deal for the American people. And he knows that the right deal for the American people is peace in Europe and that means a sustainable peace – not Russia achieving its aims and coming back for more in the years ahead.” US and Ukrainian officials have confirmed Kyiv employed US-made Atacms missiles to strike targets within Russia. The Kremlin stated that six missiles were launched at the town of Karachev, with fragments from one reportedly causing a significant explosion. In response, Russia has announced it is adjusting its nuclear doctrine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow would interpret any attack against it carried out by a non-nuclear state using weapons supplied by a nuclear state as a joint assault. But what exactly are Atacms, and why has their deployment unsettled Russia so deeply? The Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use US-supplied antipersonnel landmines to help it slow Russia’s battlefield progress in the war, the US defence secretary said on Wednesday, marking Washington’s second major policy shift in days after it decided to let Ukraine strike targets on Russian soil with longer-range US-made missiles. The US and some other western embassies in Kyiv stayed closed on Wednesday after a threat of a major Russian aerial attack on the Ukrainian capital. US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the change in Washington’s policy on antipersonnel landmines for Ukraine follows changing tactics by the Russians, reports the Associated Press (AP). Russian ground troops are leading the movement on the battlefield, rather than forces more protected in armoured carriers, so Ukraine has “a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians,” Austin said during a trip to Laos. The announcement came two months before Donald Trump moves back into the White House. Trump has pledged to swiftly end the war and has criticised the amount the US has spent on supporting Ukraine. Biden administration officials say they are determined to help Ukraine as much as possible before Joe Biden leaves office. Antipersonnel landmines have long been criticised by charities and activists because they present a lingering threat to civilians. According to the AP, Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, called the US decision “very problematic” because Ukraine is a signatory to an international convention opposing the use of landmines. Austin sought to allay concerns. He said: The landmines that we would look to provide them would be landmines that are not persistent, you know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate and that makes it far more safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own.” Austin noted that Ukraine is already manufacturing its own antipersonnel landmines. And the US already provides Ukraine with anti-tank mines. Russia has routinely used landmines in the war, but those do not become inert over time. Staff at the Irish embassy in Ukraine have been told to work from home as tensions continue to escalate in the region, reports the PA news agency. It follows on from the US shutting its own embassy in Kyiv because of a “potential significant air attack” by Russian president, Vladimir Putin’s forces. The closure of the US embassy comes after the first use of US-supplied missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia. According to the PA news agency, the Irish premier and minister for defence, Micheál Martin, said that “for the purpose of precaution”, Ireland’s embassy staff are working from home and not in the embassy building in Kyiv. “That follows consultations between different embassies across Ukraine at the moment, but there’s no plans of withdrawing staff from the embassy,” Martin said. He added: This is an abundance of caution here, but obviously the situation is escalated, and we believe Russia should stop this war. The amount of carnage in this war hasn’t got the proper headlines, but it’s absolutely unacceptable. I spoke to somebody who came back working with an NGO (non-government organisation) yesterday. He said to me that the level of fatalities of young soldiers on both sides is enormous, and it’s just an appalling lack of any moral compass that leaders can preside and president [Vladimir] Putin can preside over such carnage and it should stop.” He further stated that Putin is using migration as a war weapon. Martin said that the number of people seeking asylum, including from Ukraine, in Ireland is “unprecedented”. “I think in fairness, back in 2020 no one anticipated what has now transpired,” he added. “I think the government has behaved responsibly, this government has done anything we possibly can, and the government is moving towards a state accommodation approach.” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he opposed the US decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles to attack inside Russia, because it will enflame the conflict, broadcaster CNN Turk cited him as saying on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Such developments might bring the region and world to the brink of larger war, and both Russia and Ukraine should maintain restraint, Erdoğan was quoted as telling reporters on his flight from Brazil where he attended a G20 Summit. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, spoke with his counterpart in Kyiv on Tuesday where they discussed London’s plan to support Ukraine, reports the PA news agency. Healey told the House of Commons on Wednesday: We’ve seen over recent weeks significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on Ukraine, and Ukraine’s action on the battlefield speaks for itself. We as a nation and as a government are doubling down on our support for Ukraine and determined to do more. I discussed this with minister [Rustem] Umerov in a call yesterday where he talked about the robust response that Ukraine is making to recent Russian escalations. That’s the escalation in the attacks on Ukrainian cities and children, the escalation in attacks on their energy system and the escalation with deploying 10,000 North Korean troops in combat positions on the frontline. We discussed also our plans as the UK to support them throughout 2025. I remain committed to keeping parliament as fully informed as possible and the [shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge] and the House, I think, will understand the reasons why at this point, I’m not able to go into any further operational details.” Shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, had raised a point of order at the despatch box after “widespread reports in the media of Storm Shadow missiles being used in Russian territory for the first time”, when he asked whether the Commons had been notified of a future statement related to the conflict. Deputy speaker, Nus Ghani, said she was unaware of any indication of a future statement. The UK and Moldova launched a new defence and security partnership on Wednesday in the face of threats from Russia, the UK government announced. The initiative was disclosed as British foreign secretary, David Lammy, visited the Moldovan capital Chisinau, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The UK foreign ministry said the pact was about “building on extensive cooperation between the two countries and strengthening Moldovan resilience against external threats”. “Moldova is a vital security partner for the UK, which is why to reinforce their resilience against Russian aggression and to keep British streets safe, I am deepening cooperation on irregular migration and launching a new defence and security partnership,” said Lammy. Moldova has been looking eastwards with unease since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The war has forced millions of civilians to flee their homes in Ukraine, including tens of thousands to Moldova, with more than 50,000 Ukrainian children now living in the country, the UK statement said. Earlier this month, Moldova’s pro-European president, Maia Sandu, won re-election after a tense vote overshadowed by allegations of Russian meddling. It came just two weeks after a referendum in which Moldovans voted by a razor-thin margin in favour of joining the EU. The two votes laid bare divisions in the former Soviet republic, reports AFP. A large diaspora and those in the capital mostly favour joining the EU, while rural areas and the pro-Russian separatist regions of Transnistria and Gagauzia are against. In the early afternoon, the Ukrainian air force told people to seek shelter because of a missile threat. Senior officials told people not to ignore the alert, according to Reuters. That came shortly before Kyiv’s top military spy agency GUR issued a warning about a Russian psychological operation it said involved fake messages claiming to have been sent by the agency. GUR said in a statement: A message is being spread via messengers and social networks … about the threat of a ‘particularly massive’ missile and bomb strike on Ukrainian cities today.” Two Ukrainian military personnel told Reuters they received messages informing them that Russia would launch more than 300 drones and also use warships, warplanes and ground-based systems to fire missiles in a huge salvo. Reuters could not immediately determine how the messages were sent. One soldier said he received one from a friend, according to the news agency. The GUR spy agency said earlier that a Russian military command post had been “successfully struck” in the town of Gubkin in Russia’s Belgorod region, about 168 km (105 miles) from the border with Ukraine. Reuters reports that the statement did not specify who carried out the attack, when it took place or the type of weapon used. Ukraine has also used drones for deep strikes against targets in Russia. Bloomberg later cited a western official as saying Ukraine had fired UK Storm Shadow missiles into Russia. A spokesperson for prime minister, Keir Starmer, said his office would not be commenting on reports or operational matters. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv and Andrew Roth in Washington report on the use of Storm Shadow missiles Ukraine has fired UK-made Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for the first time since the beginning of the conflict, the Guardian understands according to multiple sources. The decision to approve the strikes was made in response to the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops on Russia’s border with Ukraine in what UK and US officials have warned was a major escalation of the nearly three-year-old conflict. The Guardian earlier this week reported that the UK would soon approve Storm Shadow missiles for use inside Russia after the US president, Joe Biden, agreed to do the same for the similar American Atacms weapon. It was not immediately clear what Ukraine used the Storm Shadow missiles to target. Unconfirmed images distributed via the Telegram messaging app appeared to show fragments of the missile at a location with the Kursk region. One weapons expert, Trevor Ball, formerly of the US Army said the images circulating did show Storm Shadow fragments though he could verify if they were current or old pictures. The strike came one day after Ukraine used US-supplied missiles to strike targets in the Bryansk region. Western officials have indicated that they’re specifically targeting the North Korean buildup in the region as well as infrastructure that may be used for a 50,000-strong offensive against a Ukrainian incursion into the region. Vladimir Putin has warned that the use of US and UK-made missiles inside Russia’s borders would be tantamount to Nato entering into a direct conflict with Moscow. Defence minister Guido Crosetto has reiterated his country’s support for Ukraine in parliament in Italy today. Reuters quotes the minister telling lawmakers in Rome: The government’s position has not changed, we believe it is necessary to continue providing support to Ukraine in line with what we have done so far in order to achieve … the conditions for a just and lasting peace In the UK, the prime minister’s spokesperson has declined to comment on media reports that UK-manufactured Storm Shadow missiles have been fired at targets within the Russian Federation. The spokesperson for prime minister Keir Starmer said his office would not be commenting on reports or operational matters, but the Guardian understands that the missiles have been used. Bloomberg also reported their use on Wednesday, citing an unnamed western official. Unconfirmed images distributed via the Telegram messaging app appeared to show fragments of the missile at a location within Kursk region. Britain had previously said Ukraine could use Storm Shadow cruise missiles within Ukrainian territory, but Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government had been pressing for months for permission to strike at targets inside Russia. One person has been reported injured in the Belgorod region by Ukrainian shelling. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that Ukraine’s foreign ministry has reminded embassies in Kyiv that the threat of an attack by Russia has been a daily reality for Ukrainians for over 1,000 days now, and said they are in constant contact with foreign partners regarding potential security threats. Tass, citing the governor of Kursk region, reports that two Ukrainian missiles have been shot down by Russian air defence in the region. The US’s move to allow Ukraine to use American supplied anti-personnel land mines comes despite the weapons being banned by scores of countries, including the UK. Downing Street would not be drawn on the US and Ukrainian positions on the use of the weapons but added in “terms of the UK’s position and the support that it provides, it’s in line with the Ottawa Convention” which bans land mines. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has confirmed that the Biden administration will allow Ukraine to use American-supplied antipersonnel land mines to help fight off Russian forces. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday during a trip to Laos, Associated Press reported that the shift in policy follows changing tactics by the Russians. Austin said Russian ground troops are leading the movement on the battlefield, rather than forces more protected in armoured carriers, so Ukraine has “a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians.” “The land mines that we would look to provide them would be land mines that are not persistent, you know, we can control when they would self-activate, self-detonate and that makes it, you know, far more, safer eventually than the things that they are creating on their own,” Austin said. Ukraine’s main directorate of intelligence has accused Russia of spreading misinformation that there would be a large-scale attack today in what it described as “a massive information-psychological attack” Reuters quotes the agency statement saying “A message is being spread via messengers and social networks … about the threat of a ‘particularly massive’ missile and bomb strike on Ukrainian cities today. This message is a fake, it contains grammatical errors typical of Russian information and psychological operations.” Earlier Italy, Spain and Greece followed the US in closing their Kyiv embassies over attack fears. The US embassy said it had received “specific information” of a potential significant air attack and would be closed. The UK embassy in Kyiv remained open, while Germany’s embassy remained open in a limited capacity. The air alert in Kyiv has ended. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has posted to social media to say that this morning he has spoken to Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk on the phone. Air alerts have been declared in Kyiv and a number of other regions. This happens quite regularly during the day, however due to the closure of embassies by the US, Italy, Spain and Greece in anticipation of an attack on Kyiv, there is a heightened sense of alertness. Andriy Kovalenko, from Ukraine’s national security and defence council has told news agency Ukrinform that Russia was “trying to sow panicky moods” among Ukrainians. Dan Sabbagh is in Kyiv for the Guardian The UK embassy remains open in Kyiv. In a statement, it said: The UK Embassy in Kyiv remains open. However, the safety of our staff and British nationals in Ukraine is paramount and we keep our embassy posture and travel advice under constant review. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that Italy, Spain and Greece have all also closed their embassies in Kyiv today. The US embassy earlier said it had received “specific information” of a potential significant air attack and would be closed. Suspilne reports that the intelligence indicates a combined drone and missile attack on the capital, and is not thought to be related to Russia’s change in its nuclear doctrine yesterday. Russia’s ministry of defence claims it has destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed that Ukraine lost 400 service personnel on the Kursk front in the last 24 hours. The ministry gave a detailed list of western-supplied Ukrainian equipment it had destroyed. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that a man faces up to nine years in prison after being arrested in Kharkiv for helping men eligible to be drafted into the armed forces escape Ukraine. The 43-year-old was paid to help people travel into Moldova. Many organisations this week have been marking the 1,000 day anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Fundraising platform GoFundMe has announced that since the beginning of the war more than £17m has been raised in the UK for Ukrainian causes, including media outlet the Kyiv Independent raising more than £1.8m to keep publishing during the conflict. More than 200,000 individual donations have been made to appeals mentioning Ukraine during the period. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Reuters reports, has said that Ukraine and Russia should focus on peace and show restraint. Turkey’s president also said that the US decision to allow longer range Ukrainian strikes on Russia would further escalate the conflict and prompt a Russian reaction. He said he opposed the move. Erdoğan has repeatedly tried to position Turkey as a mediator in the conflict, and has proposed a peace plan that would involve Ukraine delaying any moves to join Nato for at least ten years and freezing the existing frontlines. That would effectively mean Ukraine conceding territory to Russia, while Russia would have to accept it had not gained full control the four Ukrainian regions it claimed to annex in 2022. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian military said on Wednesday that it shot down 56 out of 122 drones and two out of six missiles launched by Russia overnight. The claims have not been independently verified. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has reiterated that a “freeze” of the conflict in Ukraine along the existing frontlines would be unacceptable to the Russian Federation. During his daily press briefing, Peskov declined to comment when asked about the US embassy closing in Kyiv, but said that Russia believed the outgoing Joe Biden administration had shown that it is fully committed to continuing the war in Ukraine and is doing everything possible to achieve that. Peskov said president Vladimir Putin’s itinerary had not been altered by the decision of the US that Ukraine could use longer range missiles against Russia, but has ordered security checks on critical infrastructure facilities, including the Crimean Bridge across the Kerch Strait. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying further quotes from Sergey Naryshkin, director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, about the country’s new nuclear doctrine. It quotes him saying that the new doctrine was met with “caution” by the west, adding: They understand that the adjustments announced by Putin largely devalue the efforts of the US and Nato to inflict a strategic defeat on our country, and the planned expansion of the list of grounds for the use of nuclear weapons effectively excludes the possibility of victory over the Russian armed forces on the battlefield. In its latest operational update, Ukraine’s army has said that on Tuesday there were up to 139 combat engagements on the front lines between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Sergey Naryshkin, who is director of Russia’s foreign intelligence service, is being quoted in Russian media as saying that attempts by Nato countries to strike inside Russia will not go “unpunished”. Local media reports that explosions have been heard in Kherson. This is not uncommon, as the Dnipro river, on which the city lies to the north, marks a frontline between Ukrainian forces and Russian forces, who occupy the southern portion of the Kherson region. The chief of staff in Belarus, Pavel Muraveiko, has described US moves to allow Ukraine to deploy longer-range missiles and anti-personnel mines as “irresponsible”, Reuters reports. In a television interview in France, foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot has dismissed Vladimir Putin’s approval of a new nuclear doctrine yesterday as rhetoric, and, Reuters reports, said “We are not intimidated.” The change in nuclear doctrine yesterday lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of nuclear weapons, with a significant development being that Russia says it now considers a nuclear response justified if it is on the receiving end of aggression by a non-nuclear power that is being aided by a nuclear power. The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Wednesday it detained a German citizen who had been allegedly involved in organising the explosion at a gas distribution station in Kaliningrad in March this year and had been trying to enter Russia, according to state media. Russia detained the German national, named as Nikolai Gaiduk, on sabotage charges. Authorities said he “is implicated in the March 2024 explosion at a gas distribution station” in Kaliningrad, the Russian region sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. The man had returned to Russia “to organise acts of sabotage on local energy infrastructure”, according to a statement by the FSB, which was quoted by news agencies. A video confession by the man was shown on state television. Russian media, citing the defence ministry, reports that 44 Ukrainian aircraft-type drones were intercepted over Russia overnight. The Russian defence ministry claims that 20 of them were over Novgorod oblast, which is to the south-east of St Petersburg, and some considerable distance from Ukraine. The claims have not been independently verified. A special hotline in place to deflate crises between the Kremlin and the White House, created after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, is not currently being used, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, as nuclear risks rise amid the highest tensions between Russia and West in decades, Reuters reports. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks, days after reports said Washington had allowed Ukraine to use US-made weapons to strike deep into Russia. Putin has altered Russia’s so-called “nuclear doctrine” several times since the invasion of Ukraine, without ever making good on nuclear threats. “We have a special secure line for communication between the two presidents, Russia and the United States. Moreover, even for video communication,” Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov told TASS state news agency. But when asked whether this channel is currently in use, he said, “No.” Ukraine used US Atacms missiles to strike Russian territory on Tuesday, taking advantage of the newly granted permission from the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden on the war’s 1,000th day. Russian diplomats say the crisis between Moscow and Washington now is comparable to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis when the two cold war superpowers came closest to intentional nuclear war, and that the West is making a mistake if it thinks Russia will back down over Ukraine. Some more information on the US embassy closure in Kyiv. Further to its post on X, the US Department of State Consular Affairs published a notice on the embassy website saying the closure was “out of an abundance of caution”. The US embassy in Kyiv has received specific information of a potential significant air attack on November 20. Out of an abundance of caution, the embassy will be closed, and embassy employees are being instructed to shelter in place. The US embassy recommends US citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced. The warning comes a day after Ukraine used US Atacms missiles to strike Russian territory, taking advantage of newly granted permission from the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden on the war’s 1,000th day. Dan Sabbagh is the Guardian’s defence and security editor, reporting from Kyiv Ukraine’s power network is at “heightened risk of catastrophic failure” after Russia’s missile and drone attack on Sunday, Greenpeace has warned, raising fears about the safety of the country’s three operational nuclear power stations. The strikes by Moscow were aimed at electricity substations “critical to the operation of Ukraine’s nuclear plants” and there is a possibility that the reactors could lose power and become unsafe, according to a briefing note prepared for the Guardian. Shaun Burnie, nuclear expert at Greenpeace Ukraine, said: It is clear that Russia is using the threat of a nuclear disaster as a major military lever to defeat Ukraine. But by undertaking the attacks Russia is risking a nuclear catastrophe in Europe, which is comparable to Fukushima in 2011, Chornobyl in 1986 or even worse. The pressure group called on Russia to immediately halt its attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid and for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to deploy permanent monitors in substations critical to the country’s nuclear plants. The IAEA conducted one inspection in late October, but has not committed to return. More on the news that Joe Biden has authorised the provision of antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine, which was first reported by the Washington Post. Here is some further context from the Post’s story: The Biden administration is deeply concerned about Russia’s assaults against Ukraine’s frontlines in recent weeks and sees a pressing need to blunt the advance, officials said. The Pentagon believes that the provision of the mines is among the most helpful steps the Biden administration can do to help slow Russia’s attack, officials said. One official said the type of antipersonnel landmine is “nonpersistent,” meaning that the mines self-destruct or lose battery charge to render them inactive within days or weeks, reducing the danger to civilians. The official said that Ukrainian policymakers had committed to not deploying the mines in densely populated areas. Arms control experts said that even nonpersistent mines pose a safety hazard. “Russia is attacking Ukrainian lines in the east with waves of troops, regardless of the casualties that they’re suffering,” one of the officials said. “So the Ukrainians are obviously taking losses, and more towns and cities are at risk of falling. These mines were made specifically to combat exactly this.” Some of 10,900 North Korean troops sent to Kursk have been fighting in elite Russian airborne and marine units against Ukraine, according to a lawmaker on the intelligence committee of the South Korean parliament. Park Sun-won, citing the South’s spy agency, said North Korea had also shipped additional arms for the war in Ukraine, including self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers. Park added that the North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui’s meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow this month was unusual in terms of protocol, and likely went beyond exchanging greetings, to cover more significant issues including a possible visit to Russia by Kim Jong-un. The spy agency was still trying to determine the exact number of North Korean troop casualties and whether any had surrendered amid conflicting information, Park said. The US embassy in Kyiv has received “specific information” of a potential significant air attack on Wednesday and will be closed, the US Department of State Consular Affairs said in a post on X. It recommended US citizens to be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced. The US president, Joe Biden, has authorised the provision of antipersonnel landmines to Ukraine, according to reports, in a step that will bolster Kyiv’s defence against advancing Russian troops but also attract criticism from arms control groups. Ukraine had committed not to use the mines in densely populated areas, an unnamed official told the Washington Post, which first reported the development. It comes as Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin – already angered by the Biden administration allowing Ukraine to use US-supplied longer-range missiles to strike targets deeper within Russian territory – formally lowered the threshold for Moscow’s use of its nuclear weapons. A hotline in place to deflate crises between the Kremlin and the White House, created after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, was not being used, the Kremlin said on Wednesday, amid the highest tensions between Russia and the west in decades. Putin has altered Russia’s so-called “nuclear doctrine” several times since the invasion of Ukraine, without ever making good on nuclear threats. North Korean troops have participated in some battles as part of Russia’s airborne and marine units, while Pyongyang has shipped additional arms including mechanised howitzers and rocket launchers to Russia, a South Korean lawmaker has said, citing his country’s spy agency. The agency was still trying to determine the exact number of North Korean troop casualties, Park Sun-won said. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told Fox News that his country “will lose” its war against Russia if the US cuts military funding to Kyiv. “If they cut, we will – I think we will lose,” said the Ukrainian president. “We will fight. We have our production, but it’s not enough to prevail. And I think it’s not enough to survive.” The US president-elect, Donald Trump, is a vocal sceptic of the billions that the Biden administration has given to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began in 2022. Trump’s surrogates have voiced vehement criticism of Biden’s decision to let Ukraine use US-supplied long-range missiles for attacks inside Russia, accusing him of a dangerous escalation. With Russia gaining ground, and increasing talk of negotiations, Ukraine is wary of being at a disadvantage when it comes to hashing out a peace settlement. Zelenskyy told Fox that unity between Ukraine and the US was “most important.” Trump, he said, could influence Vladimir Putin to end the war, “because he is much more stronger” than the Russian president. In other developments: The US called on Russia “to stop this bellicose and the irresponsible rhetoric”, but said it has not seen any reason to adjust its nuclear posture. US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said he was “not surprised” by comments by the Kremlin over the revised nuclear doctrine. The UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, also accused Russia of being guilty of making “irresponsible rhetoric”. In a direct message to the Russian president, Starmer added: “On day 1,000 of Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, I say again: ‘End the war. Get out of Ukraine’.” Ukraine fired US-made long-range missiles into Russia for the first time since the Biden administration lifted restrictions on their use. The target appeared to be an ammunition warehouse. Ukraine’s general staff said it hit a military arsenal of the 1046th logistics centre outside the city of Karachev without confirming the use of the missiles. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine launched six US-made Atacms missiles targeting the south-western Bryansk region overnight. It claimed that five of the missiles were shot down and another was damaged. It said debris from the rockets caused a fire at an unnamed military facility. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, did not directly confirm the missile attack targeting Bryansk but said: “We now have Atacms, Ukrainian long-range capabilities, and we will use them.” The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, appeared to suggest that Russia might respond with nuclear weapons if Ukraine used western-supplied missiles to strike targets inside Russia. The Kremlin said the purpose of its updated nuclear doctrine was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of retaliation for an attack on Russia or its allies. Russia’s revised nuclear doctrine declares that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The doctrine also states that an attack using conventional missiles, drones or other aircraft could be seen as justification for a nuclear response. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the Ukrainian attack was a clear signal that the west wanted to escalate the conflict. “Without the Americans, it is impossible to use these hi-tech missiles, as Putin has repeatedly said,” Lavrov said in Rio de Janeiro for the G20 summit. Ukraine’s western allies criticised the final G20 communique as inadequate for failing to highlight Russia’s invasion of its neighbour in 2022 as the conflict entered its 1,000th day. It was significantly weaker than that of the previous year, only highlighting humanitarian suffering in Ukraine and the importance of territorial integrity. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, marked the “grim” milestone of 1,000 days since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by saying that it has been “1,000 days too many of senseless pain and suffering.” A statement by Türk’s spokesperson on Tuesday said the OHCHR has verified that at least 12,162 civilians have been killed since 24 February 2022, among them 659 children. At least another 26,919 civilians have been injured, it said. Denmark is making a new donation of about €130m for development of Ukraine’s arms industry, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has announced. “And make no mistake, our support is long-term.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine and Denmark had created a “special model” to bring in investments from other countries."

          "headline": "Dutton’s position on international student caps ‘utterly reckless’, Giles says – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "That’s it for today, thanks for reading. Here’s a wrap of the main stories: Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, says Australia is “ready” for a second Trump presidency and he will work closely with the incoming administration; Opposition leader Peter Dutton’s position on international student caps is “utterly reckless”, the skills and training minister, Andrew Giles, says; The Victorian government announces it will spend $370m to build a massive solar farm and battery in Horsham, which will be able to power more than 50,000 homes and be wholly state-owned; Sydney trains will run on Thursday after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday; Crossbench senators are attempting to suspend standing orders in the upper house to force the Albanese government to better resource the procedure office, which helps parliamentarians with drafting legislation and amendments; Australia’s $50m Cop29 pledge is “nowhere near our fair share”, Greens senator says; and The share market has snapped its four-day winning streak, retreating from the previous day’s all-time high amid geopolitical jitters after Ukraine fired American-made ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time. We will be back here with more news tomorrow. Visa applications plunge in first quarter of 2024-2025 Visa applications have dropped by 28% for the first quarter of 2024-2025 compared with the same period in 2018-2019, the Department of Home Affairs has revealed, indicating current measures to reduce international student intake is working. An update on the federal government’s evidence level requirements released on Wednesday suggested there were “encouraging signs” in some offshore markets that the “quality” of foreign student visa applications had been improving, while refusal rates had also increased due to integrity measures to weed out non-genuine students. From today, student and provider risk ratings have been re-revalued under Ministerial Direction 107 to reward higher education institutions that showed improved performance in recruitment. As part of the rating, students from India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Columbia, Mongolia and Thailand are considered the highest risk (level 3), while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Fiji are at a level 2. Universities have bemoaned the continuation of Ministerial Direction 107, introduced in December last year as a de facto cap to reduce visa approvals among high-risk universities. The vice-chancellor of La Trobe University, Prof Theo Farrell, released a statement earlier today expressing his “deep disappointment” by the failure of the Senate to pass legislation for international student caps, which was to replace the directive. Ministerial Direction 107 is a blunt and opaque instrument that has caused financial havoc … it has led to a handful of very large metropolitan universities becoming even larger … At the same time, many smaller universities, mostly in outer metro and regional areas, have suffered catastrophic losses in student numbers. Aussie shares dip from peak as Ukraine strikes Russia The share market has snapped its four-day winning streak, retreating from the previous day’s all-time high amid geopolitical jitters after Ukraine fired American-made ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time, AAP report. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Wednesday finished down 47.7 points, or 0.57%, to 8,326.3, while the broader All Ordinaries dropped 50.1 points, or 0.58%, to 8,579.1. In currency, the Australian dollar was at an eight-day high against its US counterpart, buying US65.26c, from US65.08c at Tuesday’s ASX close. Family of Melbourne teenager fighting for life after feared methanol poisoning hopes for answers The family of one of two teenagers fighting for life in hospital after a suspected methanol poisoning incident in Laos hope authorities work out exactly what happened “as soon as possible”. Melbourne friends Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, both aged 19, had been staying at a hostel in Vang Vieng, north of the Laos capital, Vientiane, when they fell critically ill last week. They have since been hospitalised in Thailand, where their families have flown to be at their bedsides. You can read more on that story here: Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I’ll hand over to Nino Bucci to take you through the rest of our coverage this evening. Take care, and I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow. David Coleman says Coalition wants social media ban passed by end of year The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, has also been up on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing this afternoon, asked about the social media ban for under-16s – likely to be put before parliament tomorrow. Coleman said the Coalition would “work structurally with the government” and that he wants the bill to be passed by the end of the year. We will work constructively with the government and we will await the legislation when it is published tomorrow, but we want to get this done. Rio to take full control of uranium mine near Kakadu Mining giant Rio Tinto will shut down and rehabilitate a controversial uranium mine surrounded by the World Heritage Kakadu national park, AAP reports. Rio has announced it would compulsorily acquire the remaining shares it does not own in Energy Resources of Australia (ERA). The purchase will give it full control of the Ranger uranium mine, where rehabilitation activities have already started, and the nearby Jabiluka deposit in the Northern Territory, about 300km east of Darwin. The Rio Tinto chief executive of Australia, Kellie Parker, said the company would rehabilitate the Ranger Project Area to a standard that would establish an environment similar to Kakadu. She told the Australian Stock Exchange today: Our utmost priority and commitment is to complete this important rehabilitation project in a way that is consistent with the wishes of the Mirarr People. Proceeding with compulsory acquisition after participating for our full entitlement in the ERA capital raising underlines our commitment to Ranger’s rehabilitation. Rio said it did not intend to mine or develop the Jabiluka uranium deposit if its compulsory acquisition was completed. The skills and training minister, Andrew Giles, is speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing program about the legislation the government is attempting to pass during these last two sitting weeks. On the international student caps, he is asked what the next move is for the government, after the Coalition said it wouldn’t support the legislation? He responded: Peter Dutton has got to really offer a better and more convincing explanation of his position. It is utterly reckless and inconsistent with everything he has said. The best solution is that which is on the table. The best solution is the legislation that we have proposed and I am yet to hear a persuasive argument against it. Asked if he thinks there is a link between international student numbers and housing prices, Giles responded there was a “relatively small one”. Man dies after falling from electric skateboard in NSW A man has died after falling from an electric skateboard on the New South Wales Central Coast. The man reportedly fell about 6pm on Sunday near Umina Beach. Police said the 45-year-old was treated at the scene by paramedics before being airlifted to Royal North Shore hospital in a critical condition, where he later died. A report will be prepared for the coroner, police said, and anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. South Australia’s DV crisis line received record number of calls the day royal commission began work South Australia’s domestic violence crisis line received a record number of calls on 1 July – the same day the royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence began its work. As AAP reports, the Women’s Safety Services SA chief executive, Maria Hagias, told the commission’s first day of public hearings the system is in crisis because it doesn’t have the resources to handle the significant increase in demand. The state domestic violence hotline received a record number of calls on the day the commission started its work, and expected to receive 35,000 calls for 2024. Hagias said: We can only answer 70% of those calls … this is an extreme challenge and it takes a lot of courage for people to call in. When you can’t pick up that phone to support that person at that time, there are extreme frustrations, not only from people who are trying to call in, but also external stakeholders because they can’t get through. That puts significant stress also on our frontline staff … and when you can’t reach every person that calls, it is extremely distressing. Of the 70% of answered calls, another 55,000 calls are then made to support families. The demand is significant, and the system isn’t coping, and it’s at crisis point. Lifeline: 13 11 14 And with that, question time has wrapped up. The Liberal National party MP Garth Hamilton has got up and asked another question on – you guessed it – nuclear energy. The acting PM, Richard Marles, said he was happy to stay on this topic “all day and every day between now and the next election”. The Australian people understand that, as the leader of the opposition pursues this ridiculous policy, that the only people who will end up paying for it is them. Every step that we take is going to be about putting downward pressure on the costs that they experience, which is so very, very different to what this leader of the opposition represents … what this leader of the opposition represents is a material and present risk to the household budget of every single Australian. Rowland says social media ban will contain ‘robust’ privacy provisions Rebekha Sharkie from the Centre Alliance party has asked about the government’s plan to ban social media for under 16s – specifically, how age verification will be obtained. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, acknowledged that the policy is “contentious” and “one that has not actually been implemented at scale anywhere in the world”. The legislation that we will bring to this parliament will contain robust provisions as they pertain to privacy … this is precisely why we are undertaking the age assurance trial, which we funded in the budget. We will use this time during the age assurance trial, and I would point out that the legislation will contain a one-year implementation timeframe to ensure that these matters are of concern are ones that are properly examined and properly accounted for. I do want to make this message clear to the Australian people: this is not about government mandating any form of technology or demanding any personal information be handed over to social media companies. Coalition persists with questions on nuclear The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has asked the acting PM about a report from the US claiming a renewables-plus-nuclear electricity grid is cheaper than a renewables-only grid – because clearly, we were due for another question on nuclear. Responding to this, Richard Marles said the report would be “assessing an economy which already has a civil nuclear industry in place [and] where costs have already been put in place literally decades ago”. This seems to be the fact that has completely escaped those opposite, that in order for us to get to a point of having a civil nuclear industry, we would need to go through the process of establishing it – which is deeply costly. [It won’t be] the same as the calculation which exists in the United States or the United Kingdom or France, where they … have a civil nuclear industry already established, and those costs have already been sunk and are not priced into the future. But the reality of what we face is you can’t go out there and just magic the reactors, you’ve actually got to go and build them [and] that costs money, and the people who will pay for it are the Australian public. Infrastructure minister answers question on Middle Arm industrial project in Darwin Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown has asked whether the government would redirect costs for the Middle Arm hub to support clean energy projects instead. The infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said the government remains committed to Middle Arm and said: Let me just remind the House that this is an equity injection. It is not money that then can be transferred to other projects … The Australian government remains committed to Middle Arm, there are a number of processes that have to be gone through, through the environmental processes, through planning processes, as well, through Infrastructure Australia, and all of those are under way at the moment. But again, I say to the Greens, stop using politics constantly in these sorts of debates, stop using politics, because we know that Middle Arm actually does support renewable energy … and it also makes sure that we have a strong economic future for the Northern Territory. Nationals MP asks where is the housing for new immigrants Nationals MP Anne Webster has asked about housing and immigration. She claims that a new person is arriving to live in Australia every 44 seconds – where are these people meant to live? The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, responded that migration is “coming down because of changes that have been made by our government” and “if there is a single person in this parliament who is responsible for [the] broken [housing] system, he sits over there in the opposition leader’s chair”. She said the government arrived to office and found housing “in an absolute mess”, and said when the opposition was in government “they didn’t even have a commonwealth housing minister.” O’Neil took aim at the Liberals and Greens for not support its housing policies, and said: Now if only, Speaker, we had a parliament that actually wanted to work with us on this issue that affects millions of people … What we have is an opposition that knows only one word – no, no, no – to every single proposition that’s put forward. [The] Greens … talk a big game about housing, but when it comes time to make real change for real people, they say no too. So who would have thought the far left and the far right had so much in common in this country. Despite that opposition, we will work hard to make sure that we meet the housing needs of people in this country Marles says supporting a civil nuclear industry ‘makes no financial sense whatsoever’ The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked another question about – surprise, surprise – nuclear energy. He asked whether the government’s opposition to nuclear “has nothing to do with cost or time, but because of their political battle with the Greens in inner-city seats”? Richard Marles replied that “we do have a battle with the Greens political party, and we join that battle with relish”. Which really does stand in stark contrast to what we see from those opposite who, when it comes to housing, the environment or now immigration, are in the greatest love affair of all time with the Greens political party. I mean, I think Romeo and Juliet teaches us that love conquers all. But I definitely do not think that Shakespeare [could] imagine what was going on here. What we are seeing here is the most unholy alliance between the Greens and the Liberals. Marles echoed earlier comments, and said “the simple reason why we are not supporting a civil nuclear industry, it’s because it makes no financial sense whatsoever”. Marles on ‘crystal-clear articulation’ of Coalition philosophy While taking a dixer, Richard Marles pointed to some comments from the deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley yesterday in parliament, that “if you don’t pay for something, you don’t value it” – in reference to fee-free Tafe. You can read more on this in yesterday’s blog here. He said it gave “a crystal clear articulation of the philosophies of those opposite”, and said: This was exactly demonstrated when the leader of the opposition was the minister for health, when he tried to introduce a GP tax, when he tried to put a cost on the attendance at emergency departments right around the country, when he sought to increase the prices of basic medicines. And what he did as the minister for health, if given the chance, he would do as the prime minister across the board. Well, Mr Speaker, on this side of the house, we have a very different philosophy … Marles is asked again about civil nuclear industry Nationals MP Kevin Hogan has asked the acting prime minister whether the government signed an agreement under the Indo-Pacific economic framework that includes a cooperative work program to support the uptake of small modular nuclear reactors? Richard Marles said the opposition “crawl[s] to this topic through every different alleyway”, and repeated: But let me be really clear, what I can absolutely confirm is that this government is not going to be pursuing a civil nuclear industry … Kylea Tink asks about use of public money to pay interest on political party loans Independent MP Kylea Tink has asked the treasurer how the government can justify allowing public money to be used to pay the interest on political party loans, while ordinary Australians are struggling? The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said minister Don Farrell “has been working for some time in a consultative way to do what we can to make sure that our donations regime is as transparent as possible, and that we take responsible and necessary steps to lessen the impact of big money on politics.” He urged the parliament to support the government’s measures – meaning the electoral reform legislation. In a question time where the opposition seemed set to put more focus on to nuclear energy, shadow energy minister Ted O’Brien has gotten himself kicked out quite quickly, after a strange interjection. Asking acting PM Richard Marles about “global momentum for nuclear energy”, and his claim that the government “remain stubbornly in opposition of this proven energy resource”, O’Brien took his seat. “The answer is – it’s all about cost and it’s all about economics. We don’t have a civil nuclear industry in Australia today. It is a significant fact, an inconvenient truth,” Marles started to respond – before O’Brien made a noisy shouted interjection. Marles called it a “ridiculous display”. O’Brien was ejected by speaker Milton Dick under standing order 94a. Richard Marles criticises ‘ridiculous’ Coalition nuclear policy After Labor’s Catherine King took a dixer on policies to address the gender pay gap, shadow climate and energy minister Ted O’Brien asked why the government remains opposed to exploring nuclear as an option. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said it comes down to cost. He began giving an answer but had to stop twice due to interjections, and O’Brien was sent out under 94a. Marles got up for a third time, and answered: It is a ridiculous policy that has been put forward by those opposite, and it simply fails to ignore the convenient truth for those opposite – that we don’t have a civil nuclear industry in Australia today and to establish one from scratch, costs money, and takes time. It’s not that simple, although the leader of the opposition may think it’s that simple, because he thinks that the way it works is that you go up and burn uranium, that we go out the back, set up a bonfire, throw some uranium on it, and bingo, there’s renewable energy. But unfortunately, that’s not how it actually works. He said the government’s renewables policy “stands in stark contrast to the ridiculous antics that we see from those opposite.” The opposition leader Peter Dutton has opened question time with a question to Richard Marles, again asking why Australia didn’t sign up to a civil nuclear deal signed by the US and UK. Marles answered questions about this yesterday, and the UK government admitted Australia was mistakenly included on a list of countries expected to sign up to the deal: Marles responded that “there’s a very similar simple answer to that question – because we don’t have a civil nuclear energy country, and nor do we seek to establish one.” We don’t seek to go down that path, so we are not a part of that agreement. And if we did go down that path, as the leader of the opposition is suggesting, there would be no prospect of any piece of electricity entering into the grid for two decades. Just minutes into Question Time, before Marles even gave his answer, Spence MP Matt Burnell was sent out under 94a for interjecting. Question Time will begin in about five minutes’ time. Grab a coffee and stay tuned, we’ll bring you the latest here in a moment. Shadow treasurer replies to Chalmers’ statement on the economy Earlier, the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, delivered a reply to treasurer Jim Chalmers’ statement on the economy (which you can read about earlier in the blog, here and here). He argued the government, in its nearly three years in office, has “made bad decisions and had the wrong priorities” – pointing to the money spent on the voice referendum and “three expansionary budgets that have kept inflation higher for longer”. He outlined the economic approach the Coalition would take if elected to government, and said: We will get our economy back to basics – fighting high prices and interest rates first, winding back regulatory roadblocks, boosting productivity and delivering lower, simpler and fairer taxes. We will also stand up for consumers, small businesses and farmers by delivering stronger penalties for anti-competitive behaviour in the supermarket and hardware sectors. We will support Australians to build businesses, not bureaucracies. We will ensure that Australians have more affordable and reliable energy by rejecting the government’s reckless renewables-only approach. We will restore the dream of home ownership and unlock up to 500,000 homes by investing in shovel-ready infrastructure that will enable homes to be delivered faster. We will reduce migration and place a two-year ban on foreign investors buying existing homes. We will tackle union corruption that is continuing to drive up building costs. And, we will take action to make our communities safer, including online. Aemo confident power strains can be managed next week as heatwave sweeps east As noted in earlier posts, we’ve got the combination of warm weather lapping across most of Australia’s population centres over the next few days. The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued updated lack of reserve level 3 alerts for Tuesday evening in New South Wales, seeking extra generation (latest alert has the potential “interrupted” supply at 142 megawatts). To stress: the alerts are intended to prompt a market response and aren’t a prediction of blackouts. Aemo also indicates that one issue was a transmission one – and the resolution of that should ease the grid strain. In the meantime, AGL Energy has provided an update on what’s happening to its Bayswater coal-fired power plant in the NSW Hunter Valley. It’s a big one, with about 2715MW capacity when all four units are online. However, unit 2 is offline until early December (circa the 6th) for planned maintenance. Its unit 1 is working fine and its unit 4 is expected to return to full operation this evening. Unit 3, though, is the one that lately dropped out of service for unscheduled “tube leak repair” work, an AGL spokesperson tells us. It’s expected to be back within 14 days if not sooner. Nick Bryant: ‘It almost seems like Australia has lost the ability to do big things’ Wrapping up his appearance at the NPC, Nick Bryant argued that it “hasn’t been a great century for Australia” when asked about an increasing focus on leaders, rather than policy issues, in the country. Bryant said the century started great for Australia with the Sydney Olympics, but “it hasn’t been a brilliant 23 years since.” You have had this churn of prime ministers, a politics that is incredibly destructive and personalised and it almost seems like Australia has lost the ability to do big things any more. The reform era was always based on big things. The reform era has sadly been replaced by a revenge era and a retribution era. It’s trying to get back to the reform era, big ideas rather than small-target politics. An optimism, which strikes me as the greatest natural characteristic that Australia has – there is a reason why the cameramen of the BBC are Australians – because they are optimistic and they always think they can do stuff. I don’t see that as much in modern Australia as when I first came here. Former BBC foreign correspondent Nick Bryant on right approach to Trump: ‘Don’t be bullied’ At the National Press Club today, former BBC foreign correspondent Nick Bryant has been speaking and taking questions from the crowd. He was asked to weigh in on Kevin Rudd’s role as ambassador to the US, and said Australia should stand by him: You cannot let America have a veto over your diplomatic appointments. The other point is, you cannot show weakness at the start of a new Trump era, right? I watch many international leaders deal with Donald Trump and they adopted a swathe of different approaches. Shinzo Abe tried to befriend him on the golf course … but Trump was still hostile against Japan. [Emmanuel] Macron did a faux friendship thing … Malcolm Turnbull had the right approach. Don’t be bullied … That is the approach to adopt with Trump, don’t concede ground. Watch: Kevin Rudd says he’s ready to work with incoming Trump administration Earlier, we brought you comments from ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, saying he is ready to work closely with the incoming Trump administration. Here is a video of the full comments he made via video link this morning, to the Sydney International Strategy Forum: Just following on from our last post: Brain Tumour Alliance Australia says it uses shoes to get its message across, because shoes “clearly visualise that brain tumours affect everybody regardless of age, gender or background and provide a powerful and impactful message to parliamentarians and to society.” A Parliament House courtyard has been filled with the shoes of people affected by brain tumours, as part of an annual “head to the hill” event. Brain Tumour Alliance Australia hosts the awareness event each year to advocate to government, saying that brain tumour research remains significantly underfunded compared with other cancers. Mike Bowers snapped these photos from the event earlier: Victorian renewable energy park to be completed by 2027, Jacinta Allan says Dubbed the SEC Renewable Energy Park, premier Jacinta Allan said the project will be capable of generating around 242,000 megawatt hours of renewable energy a year, or enough to power 51,000 homes. It will consist of 119-megawatt solar farm and 100-megawatt two-hour batteries, which will be developed by Swedish company OX2. Allan said the local community will also directly benefit from the profits from the projects, via a fund to be set up by the SEC. She said $42,000 a year will be spent in the local area during the project’s construction and a further $70,000 every year once the project is operational. It is expected to be complete by 2027 and will provide electricity to Victorian government schools, hospitals and offices. The Victorian government has announced it will spend $370m to build a massive solar farm and battery in Horsham, which will be able to power more than 50,000 homes and be wholly state-owned. The premier, Jacinta Allan, visited the city in Victoria’s west to announce the solar farm today as the second investment of the state’s State Electricity Commission. At the 2022 state election, the Labor government committed to reviving the SEC, which for decades was the sole agency in the state for electricity generation, transmission, distribution and supply before it was privatised in the 1990s. Allan said the solar farm would be the first 100% government-owned energy generation project since the commission was privatised in the 1990s. International student cap would lead to rents falling by just $5 a week in metro areas, report says International students are being scapegoated by both major parties as responsible for the housing crisis without evidence, the Student Accommodation Council has warned. A report released by the council last week found international students made up just 6% of the rental market and had a minimal presence in areas popular with families. It suggested capping international students at 270,000 per year, as Labor has lobbied for, would reduce their rental share by less than 1% – leading to lowered rents of just $5 a week for metropolitan areas. This week, the Coalition announced it would not support Labor’s cap on foreign students, with Peter Dutton maintaining yesterday “there is accommodation being taken up at the moment by international students that I believe very strongly should be occupied by Australian citizens”. The minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, pushed Dutton on his stance during Question Time, stating: If anybody is thinking because of the rate of immigration, they are having trouble getting into a home, just know the leader of the opposition has decided to make that worse. Student Accommodation Council executive director, Torie Brown, said while politicians were quick to blame international students for the housing crisis, it didn’t “reflect reality”. We need to address decades of structural failures across our housing markets and not unfairly pin the blame on a single group. International students only make up six per cent of the rental market – heavily weighted towards CBDs – with 73% of local government areas having an international student concentration of less than 1%.” Sydney train strike: all you need to know For all the Sydneysiders following along with today’s blog: here is everything you need to know about the train shutdown this weekend, with this explainer from Luca Ittimani: More on Jim Chalmers’ second ministerial statement on the economy Continued from the previous post: The Reserve Bank, though, has headline CPI rising by the middle of next year because they have to assume energy and other rebates expire – until the actual policy changes. As we have said often, it’s hard to believe pre-election campaign promises from both major parties won’t promise sizable “cost of living relief”. As for growth, Chalmers says: Treasury is expecting a gradual recovery in the economy driven by rising real incomes thanks to our cost-of-living relief, jobs growth and progress bringing inflation down. What we won’t see is a third consecutive budget surplus. That’s because government spending is rising but also because Australia’s exports of dirt (often red, as in iron ore, or black rock, with coal) won’t be delivering the budget upgrades of yore. In fact, iron ore prices are down 30% or more so far in 2024. But at about US$100 a tonne (as it was this morning), the commodity is still well above the conservative US$60/t average used by Treasury in its budget forecasts. So it’s likely we’ll get some revenue upgrades – unless China’s economy hits the proverbial wall – in the current budget. Just not as large as in previous budgets. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is giving his second ministerial statement on the economy from noon, and it offers a “stocktake” on global and domestic conditions – and a bit of sneak peek at next month’s Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (Myefo). As you might expect, it’s a generally upbeat speech, listing “significant progress” in fighting inflation, repairing the budget (and a few reforms) while Chalmers remains “optimistic” about the future. There’s not a lot of hard new numbers, though, it may be the first outing I’ve seen of a “1,000 jobs a day” created since the Albanese government took power 30 months ago. (We’ve known about the million jobs … though they may downplay that bit because we might yet get a few months of job cuts before they go to the polls.) Anyway, the inflation outlook will be largely in line with the May budget forecasts (with headline CPI falling to 2.75% by next June, and remaining there until the following June, before ebbing further in subsequent years to 2.5%). Canavan says Dutton did not ask for abortion bill to be removed Matt Canavan continued, from the previous post: I have this very simple, shared with Senator [Alex] Antic, very simple position on these issues, that any human being, no matter what their age, no matter what their state of health in this country, deserves to have care. That is all my bill does. Doesn’t change abortion procedure. Doesn’t restrict abortion procedures. It simply says that everybody, every Australian, deserves to have medical care appropriate to their circumstances. I will always defend that. Asked if Peter Dutton had asked them to remove the bill, Canavan said: “No one has done that.” We’ve got a great tradition in our party of respecting each other’s views. I do respect other views on this, but I would never seek to remove a Greens bill that took an opposite position than me on these issues. I have no problem debating my position but obviously the Greens are scared of a discussion. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan says he won’t back down after the Greens sought to remove his abortion-related bill from the Senate notice paper, accusing the minor party of seeking to “silence debate”. Canavan, the maverick Queenslander, said the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has also not asked him or fellow co-sponsor, Alex Antic, to remove their “children born alive” bill from the Senate. Guardian Australia’s Karen Middleton reported overnight that the Greens senator Larissa Waters was seeking to have the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill discharged from the notice paper, where it has sat – without debate – for some time. Dutton told Coalition MPs in a party room address two weeks ago that they should avoid public debate about abortion, with concern the issue may have cost them seats at the Queensland state election. Asked about Waters’ push and the status of his bill, Canavan said: “The status of it is it’s on the notice paper.” This is an attempt to censor and silence debate … but obviously I do actually welcome the opportunity that Senator Waters has given me to state again that there are around two babies a week in this country born alive following a termination procedure. Canavan was at a press conference with Antic and the American free speech campaigner Michael Shellenberger, discussing the government’s misinformation bill – which is in danger of going down in flames, with little support on the Senate crossbench thus far. Coalition bill on McPhillamys goldmine rejected by Senate The Coalition is livid that its bill on the McPhillamys goldmine was rejected by the Senate this morning, with Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price accusing the Labor government of seeking “to keep Indigenous Australians disadvantaged in order to better control them”. Now to recap, this is the proposed goldmine at Blayney, in central west NSW, which was put in jeopardy after a decision by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to prevent a tailings or run-off dam being built in one part of the project. It came after a Wiradjuri elder lodged an application to protect Aboriginal heritage from being destroyed. The Coalition has been continually outraged over the decision, citing a combination of local economic benefits and criticism of how the environmental consultation process was carried out, including concerns raised by other local local Aboriginal land council groups. The Coalition had put up a Senate bill which sought to prevent “the minister from making a declaration that would affect the construction or operation of a goldmine in the Blayney goldmine area.” But it was quashed at the second reading stage of debate, negatived 24-27 in a Senate vote today. Shadow ministers Jonno Duniam, Susan McDonald and Price gave a press conference shortly afterward, again criticising the original decision and how Plibersek came to it. McDonald claimed the government wasn’t doing enough to support mining, but Price – the shadow Indigenous Australians minister – raised concerns about the loss of income for local Aboriginal people. She said: They’re not doing anything to benefit Indigenous people in this country, and so in this situation, it’s whole communities that are missing out. This government is completely against ensuring that Indigenous Australians can benefit in any economic way going forward. But that’s not surprising to Labor, because Labor like to keep Indigenous Australians disadvantaged in order to better control them, in order to gain power and keep the little people down. I mean, why would they? Why would they allow for a development like this to take place, which would mean opportunity, which would mean jobs for the Indigenous community in the area, and more broadly, the wider community. Government’s spending and donation cap bill receives second reading The government’s controversial spending and donation cap bill has just received a second reading in the House of Representatives. The independent MP Kate Chaney is moving amendments that remove provisions on spending caps and increased public and administrative funding. Chaney says these are the “most offensive parts” of the bill. She says: The way this legislation is drafted, any ads that are not for the individual but for a party are not counted within the [$800K] divisional cap, so a party incumbent could outspend a challenger many times over … This is not a level playing field. Chaney argues that in a “cost-of-living crisis” the government should not be increasing public funding of elections by $40m: Parties are able to make a profit in unwinnable seats and shift that money to where they are being challenged … It gives them a war chest to fight any new challengers. It’s fine for me – I’m an incumbent. But it’s not fine for anyone new, who thinks we need new ideas and new ways of being represented in our politics. This reduces competition, and it’s not on. The independent MP Kylea Tink is now speaking in support of the amendments. ‘Wave of heat’ to elevate fire risks and electricity demand, meteorologists say We’re not officially in summer for another week and a half but for many in Australia’s south-east, it will certainly feel like it in the coming days. Dean Narramore, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, says day- and night-time temperatures will be as much as 8-14C warmer than usual for this time of year: We’re going to see the heat really start increasing across South Australia tomorrow, and then continue building there and into Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales Friday and through the weekend. Some areas will endure a low-intensity heatwave although pockets can also expect severe conditions. As mentioned in our earlier post, the tail end of the warmth – what the Weatherzone senior meteorologist Ben Domensino dubbed a “wave of heat” – will also push up electricity demand. Domensino said: It’s probably the warmest burst of heat that we’ve had [so far this warming season], because the dew-point temperatures will be increasing as well. There’s a bit of moisture in the atmosphere, which will make it feel quite muggy with this hot weather. It’ll feel quite warm. Air-conditioning demand will likely be high. Relatively light winds will also mean there probably won’t be a lot of windfarm electricity generation, Domensino said. The lack of wind, though, will also mean fire danger levels – apart from the Eyre Peninsula and some other parts of South Australia – won’t be quite as elevated as they might otherwise have been. Chalmers outlines plan to encourage more women to study economics Last night the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, addressed the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, revealing a plan to encourage more women to study economics and take up economic leadership roles. Chalmers said he has put on the agenda for the next meeting of state and territory treasurers next week: Exploring ways we can work together to lift barriers to the study of economics. The role treasuries can play, as stewards of the discipline, in making the profession more inclusive. How we can bring a broader range of views and perspectives into future public policy and advice. How we increase the number of women in economic leadership positions at all levels of government, including by exploring more robust and regular reporting. Chalmers also discussed some of the causes of alienation in politics: But underpinning, if not undermining, all of our efforts across all of these policy areas is the sense laid bare in the final report of the Covid review that there has been an erosion of trust in institutions, like governments. As Mark Butler said when we released that Covid report, it is going to be a long, hard road to get trust to the level it was before the pandemic. It’s easily lost and hard to build it back up … The loss of trust is not just from Covid, though, that’s just one of three shocks in 15 years – The GFC before it and an inflation spike exacerbated by two wars – Which have created economic and social undercurrents that revealed themselves around the world over this longer period, and not just recent weeks in US politics. These undercurrents have created a sense of alienation. Earlier this morning, some parliamentarians in Canberra attended the lighting of the giving tree in the marble foyer of Parliament House. Each year, Parliament House raises money for two charities through the giving tree. The president of the Senate, Sue Lines, and the speaker, Milton Dick, switched on the lights and announced the 2024 charities just earlier. And Mike Bowers was there to capture all the action: Leading economic indicator reports strongest result since July 2022 We’ve noted in a couple of places (such as here) that the worst of the economic slowdown is probably behind us (unless there is some nasty surprise looming). The solid labour market, tax cuts that are flowing and easing inflation suggest things are starting to look up. (Corporate failures, a lagging indicator, might have a way to rise further, though.) The Leading Index published by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute adds to the signs of a possible upturn gaining momentum. The index moved firmly into positive territory last month (going from -0.2% in September to +0.26%), and is now at its highest level since July 2022’s 0.63% reading. Back in mid-2022, the burst of economic activity after Covid-19 was fully under way, Ryan Wells, a Westpac economist, said. The index’s return to positive territory was “broadly consistent with Westpac’s view that the pace of [annual] economic growth, having hit a nadir of 1.0% in the middle of the year, is set to pick up pace, reaching 1.5% by year-end and 2.4% by the end of 2025”, Wells said. Not quite economic nirvana, mind, but something of a soft landing particularly if the Reserve Bank starts to cut interest rates from early 2025 (as Westpac predicts for February). Of course, if the leading index keeps rising, the RBA might think it’s too early to cut. Anyway, it all keeps a few pundits in business. 90% of industrial gas use can be electrified or regassed with green hydrogen: report Earlier today, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and Lock the Gate launched a report commissioned from Springmount Advisory called Turning Down the Gas, which found that at least 90% of industrial gas use can already be electrified or regassed with green hydrogen, and technology solutions are rapidly being developed for the remaining 10%. It found gas demand could decrease 216 petajoules by 2035, including by: Replacing gas use in manufacturing with electricity using technology that is commercially available today would reduce demand by 112PJ. Doing the same in commercial buildings would reduce gas demand by 25PJ. “Regassing” and substituting metals smelting and refining, iron and steel manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing with green hydrogen would cut gas use by 62PJ. If gas use were reduced by this much, wholesale gas expenses would be reduced by at least $2.5bn, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 11m tonnes each year. The national secretary of the AMWU, Steve Murphy, said: Australia must prioritise our finite and precious gas resources to support the industries that employ hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers and that underpin every aspect of Australian life, from food production and health, to infrastructure and household goods. There is a clear national interest in ensuring that local manufacturing industries are supported and thrive as the world decarbonises. We commissioned this report because it is clear to us that the interests of gas companies are cutting across the interests of Australian workers, Australian industry, our rightful place as the leader in our region for a fair and just industrial transition. I’m a firm believer that we can meet our commitments to climate action and create secure jobs in manufacturing if we make those two goals a national priority. Government senator says motion in Senate was about creating conflict Back in the Senate, the emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, said she was disappointed crossbenchers chose to create conflict over discussion after being caught off-guard by a surprise suspension to the standing orders this morning. Those on the crossbench are frustrated with the amount of legislation the Labor government is attempting to push through the Senate this sitting fortnight. In particular, they’re concerned the drafting office – which supports them with amendments – is overloaded and under-resourced. McAllister stood up to say the government would not support the motion, saying it was not the appropriate place to raise it. She said: The appropriate place to raise this is either through discussions, informally, or through referral to the appropriations committee, which is the entity which oversees the budget for the Senate. And it is disappointing that the matter is instead being raised in this way, without notice, without discussion, and suggests that the people who are seeking to resolve it are not, in fact, seeking to truly resolve it, but actually to escalate a conflict, where a better and effective way of doing it would be through conversation. As McAllister delivered her response, Jacqui Lambie can be heard on the parliamentary broadcast interjecting off-microphone. Ultimately, the motion passed but unless the government actually allocates extra resourcing, that’s where it ends for now. But not before Lambie gets the last word: So for the last two years, we’ve been telling you this is a problem. So to come in here and act like everything’s all kosher and it’s fine and that we haven’t been doing anything for two years – now, I intend to come back in here tomorrow and do this again tomorrow morning, unless something is done today. Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, says Australia is “ready” for a second Trump presidency. Rudd gave a speech to the Sydney International Strategy Forum this morning via video link, and said the embassy had been working over the course of the last year to “ensure that we were well prepared for this moment” – meaning the US election outcome. And the bottom line is, we’re ready. The team here at the embassy and the government of Australia are ready to work closely with the new Trump administration to continue to realise the benefits of what is a very strong economic and security partnership. Rudd said that Australia’s bilateral relationship with the US “has never been more relevant, or more important”, in this “age of strategic competition”. We live in a world of many challenges and we are clear that the region we want, the interests we have and the values we share require and call for our two nations to work together. And that is what we will continue to do with President Trump and his incoming administration. We here at the embassy in Washington look forward to contributing to that in the future. Rudd made headlines this month after deleting tweets he previously made about Trump, saying it did not reflect the views of the Australian government. Shortly afterwards, a senior Trump adviser reposted Rudd’s congratulatory statement to Trump on social media with a gif of an hourglass. Back in the Senate, and Greens senator Larissa Waters has accused the Albanese government of trying to curb the power of the crossbench in the Senate by “diminishing” their resourcing. Some of the independents banded together to suspend the standing orders to raise the resource issue within the drafting office, with senators warning the office couldn’t cope with the workload. For non-government senators, the office helps draft its amendments to bills. Waters said: When the drafters say to us, ‘look, we’re really sorry, but we’re slammed. There’s not enough of us to do the work that you need us to do, because the government haven’t [sic] given us the staff to do that work’. It’s not their fault. It’s the fault of the government not hiring enough people to do the work to help the Greens and the crossbench fix the government’s weak legislation. The ACT senator David Pocock added: When you cannot get amendments that are based on what you’re hearing from experts – when they have concerns about a government bill, when you’re hearing from people that you represent and you want to move amendments that reflect that, and you’ve got a government that seems intent to drop hundreds of pages of legislation, forgo all parliamentary scrutiny and ram it through, and you cannot move amendments – this is not good for our democracy. The Liberals supported the suspension, so Lambie was able to move the motion. More than 100 Sydney train services cancelled or delayed yesterday amid industrial action Back at the press conference on Sydney Trains, a spokesperson said more than 100 train services were cancelled or delayed across Sydney yesterday. I know that created and continues to create inconvenience for passengers as they move around the network. Please be assured that our teams are doing their very best to keep the system running reliably. He said there were cancellations on the intercity line, particularly services coming in from Gosford and Newcastle, and buses were replacing the Blue Mountain services for three hours today as a result of industrial action. Our teams are doing their best and we ask passengers to please be respectful of our staff, they are doing everything they can to help passengers navigate the challenging period. Crossbench senators are attempting to suspend the standing orders in the upper house in order to force the Albanese government to better resource the procedure office, which helps parliamentarians with drafting legislation and amendments. The motion, moved by Jacqui Lambie and co-signed by David Pocock, Lidia Thorpe, Fatima Payman and Larissa Waters, calls on the government to urgently hire more legislative drafters in the Department of the Senate before any “further controversial bills” are brought forward. First up to speak is Lambie, who describes the under-resourcing as “absolutely disgraceful”. We can’t get our stuff drafted, and you’re trying to throw through 20 bills in a fortnight? What is wrong with you? … The lack of resourcing is an absolute choke on democracy. The legislation that the government is trying to jam through is massive and has serious consequences. Other independent senators are getting up to speak. NSW transport minister addresses media amid strike affecting Sydney trains The NSW transport minister, Jo Haylen, has been speaking to reporters in Sydney after the announcement that Sydney trains will run tomorrow, after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday. You can read more on this earlier in the blog, here. Speaking just now, Haylen said: The actions are still in place for Friday and Saturday, causing potential massive disruption to our network and meaning that people cannot get where they need to go. The only way to keep our network running and to make sure people can get where they need to go is for the union to withdraw their industrial actions that are currently in place for Friday and Saturday. That remains our ask of the unions. She said the government would continue to meet with union leadership, but her responsibility is to “make sure that we can keep the travelling public up-to-date”. … to give them as much notice as possible and to do everything I can to minimise disruptions and keep our network running, while also continuing our negotiations and conversations with the unions to reach agreement. Instagram users will be able to refresh algorithm, Meta says Two days after a parliamentary committee recommended that users be able to have more control over their algorithm, Instagram has announced it will roll out a way for users to reset their algorithm that recommends content to them. In a blog post today, Instagram’s parent company Meta said the new feature will be rolled out in the coming weeks, and allow people, with a few taps, to reset what Instagram shows them in explore, reels and their feed: Your recommendations will start to personalise again over time, showing new content based on the content and accounts you interact with. When resetting, you’ll also have the option to review the accounts you’re following and unfollow any that share content you no longer want to see. Resetting the algorithm was one of the key recommendations of the parliamentary committee examining social media’s report, released on Monday. However, the recommendation went further including allowing users to opt out of the algorithm altogether. It’s one of a number of moves Meta has made in recent months to respond to increased political scrutiny on the impact platforms are having on society, including recently the introduction of Instagram accounts for teens with more restrictions over who they can follow, who can message them and what they can see. The committee, notably, did not recommend banning under-16s from social media, which the government is planning to legislate, instead calling for a report on the outcome of a trial of age assurance technology to be provided to the parliament when it is completed in mid-2025. The law academic Anne Twomey has written a piece for Guardian Australia, arguing that aspects of Labor’s electoral reforms are vulnerable to constitutional challenge. You can read her full piece below: Earlier this morning, we reported that Australia has pledged $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world’s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown, at the Cop29 summit. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says this funding is a start, but “nowhere near the fair share for a country which is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas”. This pledge risks becoming a token gesture if the Albanese government continues to approve new coal and gas mines that will keep exacerbating climate driven disasters which results in the loss and damage suffered by the Global South. The climate crisis is having a severe impact on Pacific nations who did nothing to create this disaster, yet bear the burden of the damage caused. Pacific nations need real and strong action from countries like Australia – that means ending new coal and gas, not pouring fuel on fire by opening the floodgates for fossil fuel projects. Anthony Albanese has met with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil. During the leaders’ opening remarks for their 10th meeting since May 2022, Anthony Albanese said India and Australia could build a “stronger, safer and more prosperous future for citizens in both of our countries”. The two discussed “increasing two-way trade, business engagements and market access for goods and services” as well as security in the Indo-Pacific region. Albanese said the countries would renew their defence and security pact next year after it was first signed in 2009. While no specific threats or countries were mentioned by name in the official statement, both leaders touched on their mutual interest in maintaining regional security and stability. Modi said: Friends, we have been working together to promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and we will continue to do so. We have stressed on dialogue and diplomacy to solve global conflicts and tensions. Albanese said: Prime minister Modi and I have also committed to developing a joint maritime security collaboration roadmap, including to deepen maritime domain awareness. Australia’s relationship with India is stronger, deeper and more consequential than ever before. Independent Tasmanian MP disappointed state government walking back plans for mandatory pre-commitment card The independent Tasmanian MP Meg Webb was on ABC RN earlier this morning, discussing the state government’s decision to walk back plans for a mandatory pre-commitment card. Yesterday, Tasmanian parliament moved to debate a motion of no-confidence in the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, after the government failed to vote it down. Webb said she had suspected the government would walk away from the card, and “unfortunately, yesterday, what came out was a firm indication that they are entirely abandoning … that card.” They’re not using that language. They’re saying it’s deferred indefinitely. But the reality is, if you’re deferring something and then you’re not continuing to work on it, you’re actually abandoning it. Before working in parliament, Webb worked for Anglicare. She said it is “insidious” the way poker machines are placed into local suburbs in Tasmania: We see that placed into our poorest suburbs where people are most vulnerable, because they’re already under financial stress. They’re most vulnerable to becoming addicted to these machines. They take millions and millions of dollars out of our poorest communities. And of course, it’s not just the person who has developed a problem with their poker machine use losing all their money, it’s actually having catastrophic losses, losing their housing. It also breaks up families. The impact flows out from that person. Albanese says Australian jobs were focus at G20 summit The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has shared some images from G20 to X and said the summit was “all about creating jobs in Australia.” Inflation is a global problem, and it requires a global response. And Australia’s relationships around the world matter. Here at this summit in Brazil, I’ve been able to meet with leaders to work on solutions to our shared challenges. Addressing supply chain issues that have pushed up prices, global action on climate change, and the opportunities that clean energy provides to our economies were key points of discussion. Summits like the G20 are all about how we can make sure that everyone benefits from economic growth. By making Australia’s voice heard, we can shape solutions that benefit Australians. Coalition nuclear costings to be released ‘very soon’, Littleproud says David Littleproud was pushed for when the Coalition will release the costings for its nuclear energy plan, and he responded: “Very soon.” We made it clear you will see it well before Christmas and well before the election. Nationals introduce bill to implement national standard for organic products The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, was also on ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning, when he spoke about the party’s decision to introduce legislation ensuring organic products in the supermarket are actually organic. He claimed that imported products can have as little as 2% organic material, so “Australian consumers are being misled about the standards they are consuming”. We’ve taken the unprecedented step of introducing a bill ourselves to bring in a national standard for organics … We think farmers should be protected in knowing what is being imported. You can have confidence in Australian produce, but it will also give us the export advantage where it is costing our farmers hundreds of thousands of dollars individually each time they go to crack a new international market. Littleproud said he would have no issue with the government changing a couple of words and reintroducing it in their name if that’s what is required to pass the changes, because “this is beyond politics”. If the Albanese government won’t do this, then we’ve made it as a significant commitment that it will be one of the bills to be reintroduced under a Coalition government. The bill was introduced to parliament yesterday. The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued an alert about a possible blackout for some customers in NSW next Tuesday evening – a fairly rare warning. To be clear, an Aemo alert is NOT a forecast of what’s to come but a call to the market to respond. As of this morning, the supply gap is a bit under 400 megawatts from 4.30pm to 8pm. (Aemo uses AEST time, hence the adjustment to the note in X post below.) The so-called lack of reserve level 3 is a bit of a rare thing. According to Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at UNSW, there has only been one other such alert issued for NSW since 2019 (excluding the market chaos that triggered a suspension in 2022). Across the national electricity market, there have only been 14 LOR3s across the five eastern states (only Western Australia and the Northern Territory are not in the Nem), McConnell says. Part of the issue is an expected spike in power demand as an early season heatwave sweeps across the east. Western Sydney will have had five days with maximums in the 30s by Tuesday, with the CBD forecast to reach 31 on that day too. There’s also a prediction of relatively little wind. However, the coal-fired power plants aren’t looking in good shape. AGL’s Bayswater unit 2 is offline for major maintenance until 8 December. Its unit 3 was also shut for unplanned work, according to WattClarity, an energy website. Other units offline include Vales Point 6, Eraring 3, and Tallawarra 1 (a gas-fired plant), so there’s 2,630MW unavailable. There are also other Aemo alerts at a lesser LOR2 level for both next Monday and Tuesday for NSW. It will be interesting to watch if the market does respond to the Aemo alerts – or whether other action might need to be take (ie turning off big power users). Littleproud says Coalition’s alternative plan on international student numbers will be detailed before election The leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning about the Coalition’s decision to oppose government legislation capping international student numbers. He was asked what the Coalition’s alternative plan is, if they’re not backing the legislation? Littleproud said “you’ll see our detailed caps before the election”. We made it very clear we don’t intend to hide anything … We intend to reduce our migration and determine who comes to this country, the skills they have and where they should live … He said that state and local governments need time to build housing supply and “they need the human capital” to do so: So let’s get our migration working for Australia and making sure we get the settings right, and give the state local government some time to build some homes and give some hope to young people that they might own a home in Australia one day. Independent MP urges federal battery rebate scheme The teal MP Kylea Tink has called on the Albanese government to back a federal battery rebate scheme to support households and small businesses invest in battery storage technology. In a joint statement with Solar Citizens, she says a well-funded rebate scheme, supported by a target of 1m batteries nationally by 2030, would “also create new, well-paid green jobs in our suburbs and towns”. With over 8,000 people calling for a federal battery program, it’s clear voters want the government to support the rollout of small-scale battery storage solutions and it makes absolutely no sense that energy and climate change minister Chris Bowen has to date ignored the petition from Solar Citizens. More than 8,000 people have signed a Solar Citizens petition calling for a federal subsidy to drive the rapid rollout of small-scale battery storage. The statement notes modelling by the Australian Energy Market Operator, showing the equivalent to 1m household batteries are needed nationally by 2030 to harness the rooftop solar uptake and stabilise the energy grid. But household batteries remain the only technology in Aemo’s roadmap without a federal government policy to drive delivery, the statement says. Solar Citizens’ national campaigns director, Joel Pringle, says solar batteries typically cost more than $10,000, with payback periods ranging between five and 10 years. With the current cost-of-living crisis, batteries are often not an affordable option and that’s why government financial support for batteries is needed. Sydney trains will run on Thursday after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday, AAP reports, amid an ongoing wage dispute with the government. A months-long dispute between the NSW government and the state branch of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union escalated yesterday when the transport minister, Jo Haylen, announced no train services would run for four days: But early this morning Transport for NSW said it had agreed with the union to run services on Thursday, a relief for Pearl Jam concertgoers who would have had to find alternative transport to Sydney Olympic Park in the evening. A spokesperson said: At this stage the RTBU has not agreed to lift their industrial action they have planned for Friday through to Sunday. The notified bans in place by the union will bring the heavy rail network to a shutdown on Friday, Saturday, and through until Sunday morning this weekend. Haylen is hoping the concession will give the union and the government more time to come to an agreement before the weekend. She told 2GB: It gives us another day to continue our negotiations and hopefully get people where they need to go. But the union industrial action is still planned for Friday and Saturday and we know that’s going to have a massive impact on millions of people who rely on these train services. One-third of young Australians say they are willing to lie, commit violence, send threatening messages to MPs or vandalise government offices in support of a cause they care about. As AAP reports, a new survey by the Susan McKinnon Foundation quizzed 3,000 voters across Australia on their attitudes to political polarisation and social cohesion. The majority, 55%, said Australia has become more divided compared to five years ago, with 27% saying they feel the country is extremely or very divided. Generational differences about how to deal with views on social justice were stark, with between 2% and 4% of people over the age of 55 backing similar responses to their young counterparts. One in three generation Z voters and a quarter of millennial voters said they were prepared to support actions including encouraging or using violence, sending threatening or intimidating messages to members of parliament, damaging property, vandalising government offices and lying to advance a cause they cared about. The program lead at the Susan McKinnon Foundation’s McKinnon poll, Matt Crocker, said the survey reflected “some emerging areas of concern”. While young people have always been passionate for social change, younger people appear more willing to support some practices that can undermine safety and circumvent our democracy. The high level of support for some of these practices is surprising and concerning. A bare majority of Australians believe both extreme left views (51%) and extreme right views (53%) are a serious threat to the country. However, the research also found that those with stronger political views were more likely to blame the other side. It found that 76% of those on the left were much more likely to think extreme right views were a problem, while those on the right (71%) were much more likely to think extreme left views were a problem. Marles says the cost of online scams is rising On ABC RN, the acting PM was asked about the latest Australian Signals Directorate findings that cybercriminals are using fake QR codes or sophisticated AI scams to trick Australians into giving up their private details or downloading dangerous files. Richard Marles said the ASD is seeing reports every six minutes, and the cost of each of those attacks is going up: We are worryingly seeing an increased focus by both cybercriminals and state actors on our critical infrastructure, and that’s something which has become much more prevalent in the course of the last year … One of the actions that we take is attribution. We have raised attribution in respect of China, in respect of Russia, in respect of Iran. We do so very carefully in circumstances where we can, but attribution is an important tool that we have applied more in the last year than we have ever done. Marles says government will raise Gordon Ng sentence with Chinese government Richard Marles was also asked about news that 45 pro-democracy activists were arrested in Hong Kong, including the Australian-Hong Kong dual national Gordon Ng, after the city’s largest national security trial. He said the government is “very concerned”, specifically about the sentence applied to Ng, and “we will continue to make representations in respect of the sentence”. But beyond that, as you say, we are very concerned about the application of the national security law in Hong Kong, and obviously in terms of how it’s been applied to Gordon Ng, and that’s a point that we made when the original conviction occurred … [This is] a matter that we will continue to raise with the Chinese government in all of our advocacy, and this is a consular matter which is front and centre in terms of the way in which we are engaging with China. Will the government seek to reopen the embassy in Ukraine? Richard Marles said it was “something we want to do”. We’ve been wanting to do it for some time. We do have our ambassador in the region, who operates out of Warsaw. This is a matter of making sure, obviously, in the context of a war zone, that we can open this in a manner which is safe for all of those who would be in the embassy. And so this continues to be a work in progress around how that can be done, but we are engaging closely with Ukraine. Marles weighs in on latest developments on war on Ukraine Richard Marles also spoke with ABC RN just now, asked about the latest developments out of the war in Ukraine. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons after the Biden administration’s decision to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russian territory with US-supplied longer-range weapons. Asked for his reaction, Marles told the program: It’s completely reprehensible on the part of Russia. I mean, there’s only one country which is talking about using nuclear weapons, and that’s Russia … Russia’s cooperation with North Korea, such that we now have North Korean troops massing on the Ukrainian border, is an appalling escalation in what is already an appalling conflict … What’s at issue here is the global rules-based order, which is very much in Australia’s national interest, and that’s why we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes for this conflict to be resolved on its terms. So you don’t see it as a dangerous escalation from the US to allow Ukraine to use these missiles to strike on Russian territory? Marles said this was Ukraine defending itself: Ukraine is the country that was attacked. It was Russia which crossed the border into Ukraine and began this war, and Ukraine has a right to defend itself. It’s not Ukraine who’s talking about an escalation to a nuclear level … at every point it is Russia which is escalating this. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier and was asked about the Coalition’s attack on the government for not joining a US-UK civil nuclear deal (as we flagged earlier). Marles said the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is “intentionally seeking to conflate two ideas here and, frankly, spread a form of misinformation really”. We don’t have a civil nuclear industry. This is an agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States to cooperate in respect of their civil nuclear industries. It is simply not an agreement which would apply [and] sits completely separately to what we are doing with the UK and the US in relation to Aukus, which is an agreement that is proceeding very well. Marles said what is “embarrassing” is Dutton’s proposition that “Australia should walk down from where we are now in having no civil nuclear industry, to trying to acquire one”. That is embarrassing because it would be pursuing for Australia the single most expensive form of electricity on the planet, like $1,200 on each and every household’s budget power bills, that would be the increase by walking down that path. We wouldn’t see it for a couple of decades and even when it came into place, it would contribute at most about 4% to the power grid. Putting that proposition in front of the Australian people, that is what’s embarrassing. Clean Energy Council data shows surge in renewables since 2015 has reduced relative emissions by 30% Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, was up on ABC RN earlier this morning to discuss its new report – showing a surge in renewables since 2015 has reduced emissions by 30%, relative to if Australia had remained reliant on the 2015 fleet of power stations. This morning, he told the program this was a good news story for the sector: About five years ago, we were at around 15 or 16% of the grid coming from renewables. Today, we’re over 40% and by the end of next year, we’ll be pretty close to 50%. So a pretty dramatic increase in the amount of renewables in the grid, which is obviously great for emissions, it’s also great because coal-fired power stations are starting to close down, they’re starting to get less reliable, and that renewable electricity is also [helping keep] power prices down and keep the lights on. Thornton said the data shows the importance of having confidence about the future and “all political parties having a clear vision and … being aligned on targets”. Where they’ve got that sort of certainty, then investors will put significant money on the table, and that rate of renewables accelerates. Where there’s uncertainty about the future, then the rate of new investment tends to slow down. Cost of living, cybersecurity and AI top ethical considerations for Australians: report The Governance Institute of Australia’s 2024 ethics index shows that cost-of-living pressures and concerns about cybersecurity and AI are the top ethical considerations for Australians. Based on a survey conducted with Ipsos, Australians perceived supermarket pricing as the most unethical behaviour (-50) while perceptions of GPs who don’t offer bulk billing have also fallen further (-33). In terms of government promises ahead of the next federal election, Australians ranked affordable housing, renewable energy and grocery prices as their top three campaign topics. But the Governance Institute CEO, Megan Motto, said clear differences emerge when examining election promises by party preference: Liberal voters favour nuclear power, while Labor voters focus on affordable housing, renewable energy and union actions. There is also a significant difference in perceptions of US relations based on the election result. Fire services (76), nurses (75) and ambulance services (74) were seen as the most ethical jobs, while real estate agents (-18), federal politicians (-15) and state politicians (-6) were seen to be the least ethical. The report also found that the ethical obligation for organisations to tackle climate change, even if it results in reduced profits or job losses, has increased significantly over the past year. The ANU’s National Dictionary Centre has selected the portmanteau – or blended word – “Colesworth” as its word of the year, highlighting the perceived duopoly of Australia’s largest supermarket retailers Coles and Woolworths. A senior researcher at the centre, Mark Gwynn, says the phrase has been around for a number of years but usage has spiked recently as ordinary Australians vent their frustration at the increasing prices of food staples and questionable pricing practices. Aussies walk out of the supermarket with less after paying more, but then hear news of massive profits in the supermarket sector. And with official investigations into some of the pricing practices at Australia’s two largest supermarkets, it’s no wonder that ordinary shoppers have become cynical. The blend of the supermarket names Coles and Woolworths into Colesworth provides a succinct way of referring to both supermarkets while at the same time hinting at the negative aspects of what is perceived as an unfair duopoly. Some other words on the shortlist were breaking (in reference to Raygun’s Olympic appearance), climate trigger, ute tax (a derogatory term for the new fuel efficiency standard) and YIMBY (yes in my back yard). Oxfam reacts to Australia’s Cop29 pledge Oxfam Australia has welcomed the government’s Cop29 pledge of $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world’s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown. Oxfam said its new research shows a 700% increase in the number of people impacted by climate disasters in the Pacific region this decade, compared to the previous decade. Its climate policy and advocacy lead, Julie-Anne Richards, welcomed the pledge, but said the funding must also be included in the new global climate finance goal for developing countries, which is a key demand of the Pacific and one Australia is yet to support: If climate change losses and damages are not included in the new global climate finance goal, the new fund for responding to loss and damage risks becoming an empty vessel. The danger is that developed country governments will prioritise meeting the new and ambitious climate finance goal, and will not prioritise a fund that doesn’t count towards it. If Australia is to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pacific, we must ensure the region gets the funding needed to recover from and build back better after climate change impacts, and Australia must be an important contributor alongside the global fund designed for this purpose. Coalition continues attack on government over nuclear deal decision The Nationals senator Matt Canavan was up on the Today show earlier this morning, continuing to criticise the government for not signing up to a civil nuclear deal signed between the US and UK. As Adam Morton reports, the UK government has conceded Australia was mistakenly included on a list of countries expected to sign up to the deal. Yesterday in parliament the acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said the deal goes to nuclear reactors which provide energy to electricity grids, and “we do not have that in this country, and so as a result … this agreement is not relevant to Australia”. But today, Canavan is insisting Australia should have joined, telling the program: I don’t want to concern you, Karl [Stefanovic], but you’re sitting only 30km from a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. We have some of the best nuclear scientists in the world. And sure, it doesn’t produce nuclear energy, but it produces some of the world’s best nuclear medicines. And because of that expertise, we have always been involved in these international developments to look at new nuclear technologies which might help us make better nuclear medicines in the future. And of course, the current government is buying eight nuclear submarines. And so why shouldn’t we be involved in an international discussion about nuclear technologies? What the hell is going on? Canavan argued that the prime minister should “recall Chris Bowen here and override this for our national security”. It seems like it’s been a decision made by just the energy minister. Has this been considered by the cabinet? Has this been considered by the whole of government? Because there are a whole lot of other questions that arise here about why the government is making this decision. The only explanation is they’re doing so for pure domestic political purposes. Gender pay gap data reveals Australia’s female CEOs paid $170,000 less than men on average Circling back to Jim Chalmers’ economic statement to parliament today, one of the claims he’ll make is that the gender pay gap is at a record low. According to government figures today, the pay gap is 21.1%, an improvement on last year’s figure (21.7%). However, when the pay of chief executives and heads of business is included, the figure is higher at 21.8%. Our story today leads on the gap in top pay with women CEOs earning $170,000 less than male counterparts. Here’s the full story: The number of vacant rentals nationally has jumped to its highest level since July 2023, according to the latest PropTrack Market Insight Report. The report found that the national rental vacancy rate increased by 0.19% points (ppt) in October to 1.36%, as capital city vacancies rose 0.33ppt year-on-year, while regional areas saw a 0.13ppt decline over the same period. A healthy vacancy rate is widely regarded to be 3%. REA Group senior economist Anne Flaherty said: Rental conditions improved in all capital cities and regional markets over October, with the national vacancy rate now 0.21ppt higher than at the same time last year. Despite the improvement, rental supply remains well below pre-pandemic levels, with 35% fewer properties available for rent. While rental supply improved across both capital city and regional markets in October, there has been greater relief for renters in cities. Over the past year, vacancy rates in capital cities rose by 0.33ppt, while the combined regional areas remain 0.13ppt lower than a year ago. Compared to March 2020, there were 45% fewer properties available for rent in Australia’s regional areas compared to a 32% drop in the capital cities. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties as we reach the halfway point of the second-last sitting week of this year. You’ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest today – Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Sarah Basford Canales. Let’s get started. The politics of Australian electoral reform – Full Story podcast Big money and politics seem to go hand in hand, but the government wants to pass new electoral reform laws that they say will keep cashed-up donors out of federal politics. The detail has independents and minor parties crying foul. In today’s Full Story podcast, Guardian Australia chief political correspondent Paul Karp speaks to Reged Ahmed about why Labor and the Coalition have been accused of cooking up a “secret deal” on new electoral rules. Another area where the two main parties agree in theory is international student caps. But they’ve managed to fall out a bit. Our explainer today looks at what’s behind the stoush. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today deliver an economic statement to parliament setting out the progress the government has made on key indicators and causes for optimism about the economy and the budget. In advance excerpts released by his office, Chalmers will claim that inflation has more than halved, real wages are growing again and the economy is expanding. He will say that one million new jobs have been created and that two huge deficits have been turned into two substantial surpluses. At every stage we have been upfront about the nature and magnitude of our economic challenges. Even with very substantial progress in the aggregate numbers, we know that doesn’t always translate to how people are faring and feeling day-to-day. We’re not pretending its mission accomplished – it isn’t. We are realistic about this, but optimistic too. Today as I provide a stocktake of the global and domestic economy preview the mid-year update which we will hand down in December. And outline our policies and plans. I will explain why that very cautious confidence and emerging optimism is welcome and warranted. Of course the bit they’ve given us doesn’t tell us what’s in the mid-year economic update. You’ll just have to tune in at midday, and then again in mid-December for that. It’s forward sizzle. It’s the advent calendar approach, you can’t have all your chocolates at once. More on the record number of GPs in training The RACGP president, Dr Nicole Higgins, said the increased number of GPs in training is a reflection of how the government has provided the college with the flexibility and the funding to accommodate prospective trainees. Higgins praised the government’s rapid support for requests including funding for accommodation, travel and childcare that allowed the college to place 177 general GPs in training in rural communities that had not had a registrar in years. However, she warned the government must make lasting investments to tackle Australia’s GP shortage and ensure Australians can see a GP regularly: This 20% growth in GPs in training is a sign the GP workforce is recovering. But it can’t be taken as a sign the job is done. The story we’ve been told, and that we’ve often told each other as GPs, is one of general practice in decline. These training results show us we can turn that around with the right investments, because funding general practice gets results. The college is calling on the government to link the allocation of government-subsidised medical places to a target of 50% of graduates training as GPs, fund 500 more training program places for the RACGP over the next five years and ensure GPs in training have equal pay and work entitlements to other medical specialists in training. A record number of GPs will be trained in 2025, the first time in years the specialty has filled all its training positions, which will go some way towards addressing Australia’s GP shortage. A government report in August, which found that a shortfall of more than 5,000 GPs was expected in the next decade, was the latest in a number of warnings that as more Australians live with chronic conditions, not enough medical graduates are choosing general practice as a career. However, the Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) has today confirmed the trend is turning around, with 1,504 junior doctors having accepted specialist training through the college’s program. It represents an increase of 20% – or 249 trainees – on 2024. The signs are also positive for the regional and remote areas the government report found were most at risk from the shortage, with 844 trainees accepting a general training pathway, 583 a rural pathway, and 77 composite rural placements. Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Emily Wind takes the reins. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has declared the landmark Paris agreement “is working” as it had brought the world back from “the brink of catastrophic 4C warming”, but argued countries must set the most ambitious emissions targets possible for 2035 to limit worsening global heating. Speaking at the Cop29 summit in Baku, Bowen also pledged $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world’s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown. Reaction coming up. KiiS FM, the radio station that is home to the graphic and at times derisive Kyle and Jackie O show, this year attracted the biggest share of listeners aged 10 to 17, Guardian Australia can reveal. That is more than 200,000 children and teenagers listening to the station in Sydney alone. But despite children being exposed to inappropriate material on the station’s top-rating show, the Australian Communications and Media Authority has failed to launch its own investigation into the program. A record number of GPs will be trained in 2025, the first time in years the specialty has filled all its training positions, which will go some way towards addressing Australia’s GP shortage. More details coming up. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will spruik the government’s economic achievements in parliament today. He will claim that inflation has more than halved, real wages are growing again and the economy is expanding. He will also claim that the gender pay gap is at a record low although there is a little bit more to those figures than meets the eye as our story on the subject reveals. More coming up."

          "headline": "Play prompts Welsh children to demand apology for black boxer denied title shot",
          "bodyText": "The creators of a play telling the shameful story of how the black boxer Cuthbert Taylor was prevented from competing for a British title because of his colour hoped it would give audiences pause for thought. But they have been overwhelmed by the passionate reaction of young theatregoers who have launched a campaign demanding a formal apology from the sport’s governing body. Hundreds of children from south Wales, where Taylor lived, have written letters to the British Boxing Board of Control calling on it to formally apologise for one of the sport’s enduring wrongs. More than 300 children from 13 schools have so far sent letters and emails to the board after watching the play, The Fight, and they have been backed by Welsh politicians including the country’s culture minister, Jack Sargeant. Although Taylor competed as a flyweight for Great Britain at the 1928 Olympics, his potential was never completely fulfilled because of the colour bar. The bar, which ran from 1911 to 1948, said fighters had to have “two white parents” to compete for British titles. Born in 1909 in Merthyr Tydfil to a father of Caribbean descent and white Welsh mother, Taylor was not allowed to fight for a title. Young people from schools in south Wales decided to call for an apology after watching the Neath-based Theatr na nÓg’s retelling of Taylor’s story. One of the letters to the board reads: “We think that it is unfair that Cuthbert Taylor and other boxers without white, British parents were not allowed to fight for the British title. The colour bar was horrendous, horrific and disgraceful. It was not right then and it is not right now.” It adds: “It was probably his dream to be the British boxing champion, but your colour bar stopped his dream from coming true.” Schools that have written to the board include Cwmnedd primary in the Neath Valley, St Joseph’s Catholic junior, Port Talbot; Ysgol Gymraeg Santes Tudful in Merthyr Tydfil and Llanfaes community primary in Brecon. The number of schools involved continues to grow. Aisling Brady Saunders, the deputy headteacher at St Joseph’s, said: “It was entirely the children’s idea to pen letters – they feel very strongly that Cuthbert Taylor, his surviving family and all boxers affected by the colour bar rule should have an apology.” Geinor Styles, the writer of The Fight, said she had suspected the story would be compelling to young people. She said: “We have seen the power that true stories can play in overturning injustices, like the Post Office story. The Fight has been a humbling experience for us all, observing schoolchildren not only engage in a live theatrical performance but inspired to take positive action. “I am surprised how the children have taken the initiative here but I have always believed that theatre has the power to change lives and this is a fine example. I would hope this will be a tipping point for an apology. After all, an apology costs nothing.” Taylor’s grandson Alun Taylor said: “Our grandfather was denied his basic human rights because of the colour of his skin. Theatr na nÓg is giving him a voice, and in doing so they are giving our family a voice as well.” Sargent said: “I am in full support of the pupils. I have requested a formal apology from the BBBC.” A letter from the board to another of the schools, Ysgol Gymraeg y Cwm, acknowledges receipt of the letters and says: “We will be in contact again. Please pass on our thanks to the children.” In response, the board said boxing was one of the “most diverse and inclusive sports” in the UK and acknowledged that the colour ban was wrong, but it declined to apologise. It said: “Of course, the board acknowledges that the implementation of the ‘colour bar’ was discriminatory, and the board accepts this was wrong. Indeed, the British Boxing Board of Control condemn in the strongest terms the colour bar that existed in professional boxing between 1911 and 1948.” But it said: “The suggestion of holding the current British Boxing Board of Control responsible for the decisions of past board members is deeply unsatisfactory. It is our view that any apology to the Taylor family regarding Cuthbert Taylor should be government-led as the ‘colour bar’ was imposed at the request of the [UK] government.” The Fight has been performed to more than 4,600 children at the Dylan Thomas theatre in Swansea and this week is being staged at Theatr Brycheiniog, Brecon."

          "headline": "Constitution Hill’s gallops ‘defeat’ prompts mixed messages before return",
          "bodyText": "As Nicky Henderson said one thing about Constitution Hill after his exercise gallop at Newbury on Tuesday morning, the betting markets said another. That just added another twist in the buildup to his much-anticipated return to action at Newcastle in 11 days’ time. The unbeaten winner of the 2023 Champion Hurdle finished a half-length behind Sir Gino, his galloping companion, his first trip to a track since February. While Henderson said “he’s ready for action” and insisted that the seven-year-old’s huge talent “is still there”, he had drifted from odds-on to odds-against for the Fighting Fifth Hurdle on 30 November within an hour of crossing the line. Perhaps there was just too much anticipation in the air as Constitution Hill prepares for a potentially career-defining season, too much eagerness for a clear sign that he will pick up where he left off – an effortless success in Kempton’s Christmas Hurdle on Boxing Day. He did not accelerate five lengths clear of Sir Gino on a tight rein, but that was never likely to be the plan and there were no obvious signs of disappointment or concern from Henderson or Nico de Boinville, Constitution Hill’s regular jockey. Nonetheless, one bookmaker shifted him from 4-7 to 13-8 second-favourite for the Fighting Fifth, behind Willie Mullins’s Mystical Power at 6-4, while he is now as big as 3-1 (from around 7-4) to win a second Champion Hurdle in March. Henderson was adamant his stable star will have nothing to prove at Newcastle, despite an 11-month break since his last competitive start and a minor bout of colic and a wind operation in the interim. “Sprinter Sacre had a bad heart,” Henderson said. “This horse has had nothing wrong except for bad luck. There is nothing wrong with him. “If you don’t have surgery [for colic], it’s irrelevant. The Fighting Fifth was abandoned [last year], he went to Kempton at Christmas and, if you think about it, he only missed one race, which is the Champion Hurdle. He hasn’t died, he hasn’t been anywhere. He hasn’t been injured. He just missed a race. “You have got to get it out of your head that he has been missing or ‘will he come back?’ Sprinter had been ill for a year and a half, that was a comeback. This horse isn’t coming back, he ran at Christmas.” Henderson also suggested that Sir Gino, an unbeaten four-year-old who is second-favourite for next year’s Arkle Trophy Novice Chase without having jumped a fence in public, is “a machine” and “the only horse that can do that to Constitution Hill”, which will heighten anticipation for Sir Gino’s planned debut over fences at Kempton on Monday. “He is serious,” Henderson said. “He was the tragedy of last season, that he could go to Cheltenham [for the Triumph Hurdle in March]. That is as good a four-year-old as I have seen. Shishkin, Altior, Sprinter Sacre, they all went over fences much later. He’s four, but he’s got the size and scope of a chaser and he has been brilliant schooling.” Constitution Hill was something of a guest star among the horses exercising at Newbury, an annual event to promote the track’s Coral Gold Cup meeting on 29 and 30 November. Among the likely runners is Paul Nicholls’s Caldwell Potter, a €740,000 purchase for a syndicate that includes Sir Alex Ferguson at a major dispersal sale this year. He could make his debut for Nicholls in a novice chase at Newbury on Friday. “I’m glad we didn’t run him in the spring, he’s a different animal now,” Nicholls said. “He’s had a nice prep, looks good and we are itching to get him going.”"

          "headline": "Trump allies attack Biden for allowing Ukraine to use US missiles inside Russia",
          "bodyText": "Allies of the president-elect, Donald Trump, have lashed out angrily at Joe Biden for his decision to permit Ukraine to use long-range US missiles to launch attacks inside Russia for the first time, in what the Kremlin has termed an “escalation” in the war. Key Trump surrogates, including his son Donald Trump Jr, hardline congressional Republicans, and other backers have accused Biden of seeking to spark “world war three” before Trump’s presidential inauguration in January. “The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,” wrote Donald Trump Jr on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term, who was seen as a potential candidate for secretary of state, wrote: “No one anticipated that Joe Biden would ESCALATE the war in Ukraine during the transition period. This is as if he is launching a whole new war. Everything has changed now – all previous calculations are null and void.” Other Republicans to sound off included the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and the Utah senator Mike Lee, who said: “Joe Biden has just set the stage for World War III. Let’s all pray that it doesn’t come to this.” A state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, defended the decision during a press briefing on Monday, saying: “[The] American people elected Joe Biden to a four-year term, not to a term of three years and 10 months, and we will use every day of our term to pursue the foreign policy interests that we believe are in the interests of the American people.” Discussions had been ongoing for months between the White House, the state department and European allies on whether to allow strikes into Ukraine. Currently, the decision to allow limited strikes using the US-supplied Atacms missiles would permit the Ukrainian army to target Russian military infrastructure in the Kursk region where the US has said that more than 10,000 North Korean troops have joined Russian forces preparing a counter-offensive to force Ukrainian troops out of the region. The decision by the White House will set up a dilemma for the incoming administration on whether to immediately roll back the authorisation after Trump’s inauguration or retain it as a potential bargaining chip in the negotiations the president-elect has said he wants to hold in order to end the fighting. While Trump and his allies have broadly denounced increasing military support and financial aid for the Ukrainian government, analysts said it was unclear whether Trump would move immediately to repeal the decision regarding long-range missiles. “On the first day they could announce, ‘We are suspending this authorization pending a review of Ukraine policy,’” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a thinktank based in Washington. “But that would engender a lot of criticism and revive all these stories about some deals with Putin.” He said it was not a foregone conclusion that Trump would immediately repeal the decision. “One is just the political cost isn’t worth the gain, but Trump’s also a deal-maker, and that would be to give away something without getting anything for it … to start off with a concession is just bad negotiating tactics.” The White House decision may also prompt European allies with similar restrictions on the use of their long-range missiles in Ukraine to follow suit. The UK is expected to supply Storm Shadow missiles for use by Ukraine on targets inside Russia following the Biden decision with Keir Starmer, the prime minister, saying at the G20 summit that the UK needed to “double down” on its support for Ukraine. Germany has maintained its position not to supply Ukraine with long-range Taurus missiles, while the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had already said Paris was open to consider greenlighting the use of its missiles to strike on Russian soil. Theresa Fallon, the director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels, said that there were mixed reactions among European military officials, with some worried about the potential for an escalation, while others were “happy … that Ukraine could now use the equipment without one hand tied behind their back any more. But this decision came late, very late, [Ukraine] needs to be able to defend itself, and use this equipment for what it was designed to do. But we should keep in mind it is not going to be a game changer and more equipment is needed.” “I can’t predict what Trump will do,” she said. “But … once these things are in place, there is a momentum to continue to use them. It may be hard to put it back into the box. But on the other hand, if there is not a resupply of missiles then the use of them for targets in Russia will have run its course.”"

          "headline": "Budget tax rises could push more firms into trouble, says insolvency specialist",
          "bodyText": "Higher employment costs as a result of the budget may push more British businesses into financial difficulty, according to the UK’s largest insolvency practitioner. Begbies Traynor said increased employment costs, as well as higher interest rates, would extend a period of “elevated insolvency levels”, in a statement to the stock market on Monday. The Labour government last month raised taxes on business steeply to cover the cost of increased spending on the NHS, schools and the armed forces in its first budget for 14 years. Rachel Reeves’s decision to raise employers’ national insurance contributions provoked a chorus of protests from businesses. Unlike corporation tax, a rise in national insurance contributions affects every business with employees, whether profitable or not. The prospect of higher government spending is also expected to prompt the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer in an attempt to keep inflation below its 2% target. Higher borrowing costs tend to lead to more corporate insolvencies. Ric Traynor, the executive chair of Begbies Traynor, said: “Additional headwinds for UK business from increased employment costs and the prospect of higher for longer interest rates are likely to extend the period of elevated insolvency levels, increasing the need for advice and support from our insolvency and business recovery professionals.” Traynor, who co-founded the business in 1989, said insolvencies had run “at heightened levels for the last 18 months or so. We see that continuing maybe for another year.” The UK government’s Insolvency Service said last month that company failures had fallen 7% to 1,973 in September compared with last year but “the number of company insolvencies remained much higher than those seen both during the Covid-19 pandemic and between 2014 and 2019”. There were 4,400 company insolvencies in the third quarter of 2019, compared with 6,000 in the same period in 2024. “It’s across the board,” Traynor said, with construction companies, retailers and the hospitality industry particularly affected. Those businesses tend to be cyclical, with demand falling as interest rates rise and economies slow. “Certainly higher interest rates have been the major factor in terms of the increase in numbers,” Traynor said. “Suddenly they find themselves in a position where the debt is no longer cheap” and lenders call in loans. Begbies Traynor is seen as one of the main beneficiaries of higher insolvencies, as companies turn to it for advice on restructuring or bankruptcy proceedings. It reported revenues and profits before tax up 16% in the six months to the end of October compared with last year. However, despite its position as the archetypal “countercyclical” business, the share price of the company, listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim), has fallen by more than a third from its peak in the summer of 2022. Traynor ascribed that in part to investor caution over inheritance tax changes that affect Aim shares. The company said its employment costs were expected to rise by £1.25m because of the increase in employers’ national insurance contributions."

          "bodyText": "German politicians used to know where they were with their voters. If they gave you one term in power, they were likely to offer a second serving and quite possibly third and sometimes even fourth helpings. Konrad Adenauer, the Christian Democrat who was the first chancellor of West Germany, had more than 14 years in the role. The social democrat Helmut Schmidt clocked up more than eight. Helmut Kohl, whose captaincy encompassed the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, was at the helm for 16 years. It was seven for Gerhard Schröder and 16 for Angela Merkel. Chancellor of Germany used to come with lots of job security. Read those numbers and weep, Olaf Scholz. The recent implosion of his “traffic light” coalition is to be followed by early elections. Given how he’s polling, it will be a huge surprise if Herr Scholz is returned as chancellor. He won’t have managed to get to the end of one term, never mind enjoy the multiple ones awarded to most of his predecessors. Chalk that up to another lash of the anti-incumbent fury that has been raging around the world in this year of many elections. We’ve seen Japan’s Liberal Democrats put in their worst performance in a quarter of a century. South Africa’s ANC lost its majority for the first time in 30 years of full democracy. Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party went to the polls in India seeking to achieve a “super-majority” only to be shorn of one. Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance didn’t fare well in the national assembly elections that he rashly called in June, while Poland’s hard right Law and Justice party was booted out of power last year. In this context, Kamala Harris’s defeat by Donald Trump is not perhaps such a total shocker. Less a case of American exceptionalism, more an example of the US conforming to a global trend. The anti-ruler rule is not completely cast iron. In Mexico, the presidency was retained by the incumbent party. In Indonesia, the presidential election was won by the defence minister, amid complaints from the opposition that it wasn’t a fair fight. These are exceptions. The anti-incumbent tidal wave of the past 12 months has manifested itself in places as diverse as Argentina, Austria, Botswana, South Korea and Sri Lanka. The trend is so unmistakable that you can probably see it from outer space. It is certainly visible to, and being twitched over, by Number 10. Labour was the happy beneficiary of anti-incumbency at the July election when the intensity of the loathing for the Conservatives buried them under a landslide defeat. After barely four months in the saddle, now public opinion is bucking like a bronco against Labour. One face of the fury is coming to town borne on tractors as protesting farmers plan to mass on the streets of London. Incumbency, often in the past held to be an advantage when it came to winning elections, is now a serious liability. The wave is sweeping away governments of right, left and centre. It is happening pretty much regardless of longevity, location or ideological complexion. It is coming after you whether you are a charismatic leader or a technocratic one. It is hitting parties that were dominant for decades, as in South Africa and Japan. It is also besetting parties that came to power relatively recently, as in Germany. It is not so long ago that Herr Scholz was being held up, in some Labour circles, as a role model for Sir Keir. Now, not so much. A conventional explanation would say the unpopularity of the German social democrats is mainly down to the woes of the country’s economy, quarrels over which collapsed the coalition. But “it’s the economy, stupid” won’t do as a sufficient account for what happened to the US Democrats. Ms Harris was rejected even though she was a high-profile member of an administration that created a lot of jobs and had the best growth rate in the G7. Yet many Americans said they weren’t feeling it in their own pocketbooks and what the Democrats’ campaign most lacked, notes one Labour strategist, “was any sense of a plan to make people feel personally better off”. Phobia towards incumbents in the western democracies is connected to the stagnation in living standards that has persisted in most developed countries since the financial crisis. Politicians find it very hard to persuade people to feel well disposed towards government when they are not feeling happy about their own circumstances. Discontent has been exacerbated by the post-pandemic spike in inflation. Funnily enough, people really hate it when their groceries suddenly cost a lot more. This isn’t rocket science: voters who feel they’ve been made poorer tend to hand out a beating to whoever is in charge. Sir Keir’s people might note that this makes it extra-lethal when politicians look out of touch. Endorsements of Ms Harris by countless wealthy celebrities didn’t swing it for her with American voters who felt their living standards had been squeezed. Rishi Sunak would have sacked his helicopter pilots and gone everywhere on a scooter had he been more alive to how corrosive it is to look remote from the everyday experiences of the public. The freebies saga damaged the Starmer government’s reputation because there was no good answer to the question the typical voter asked themselves: why isn’t the prime minister paying for his clothes and family treats like everyone else has to do? It has just been reported that permanent migration to OECD countries reached a new record last year with the numbers of temporary migrants and asylum seekers also rising sharply. The damage done to the US Democrats by hostility to cross-border population flows illustrates another factor in the unseating of incumbents. There is no challenge that makes Number 10 more apprehensive than keeping Sir Keir’s promises to “control the borders”. He’s taking a risk making it his self-described “personal mission to smash the people-smuggling gangs”. If the government doesn’t succeed, the prime minister is going to directly own the failure. But his allies argue that trying to avoid talking about difficult subjects, “hiding under the table” as the Democrats did, just makes voters angrier. Borders are a big obsession with the recast team in Downing Street. So is another b-word, “bills”. One of Number 10’s responses to anti-incumbency will be to talk less about the “five missions”, a concept that Labour MPs complain has never caught the imagination of voters, and focus more intensely on living standards. The improvement in median incomes in the UK has been so meagre since 2009 that earnings growth over the past quarter of a century was probably the slowest in more than 200 years. If you want a core explanation for why so many voters have been feeling so down on politicians for such a long time, then this is good place to look. “Growth, growth, growth” is supposed to be Labour’s remedy to rescue Britain from the doom loop of suppressed living standards, high taxes and poor public services. So it is not glad tidings for the cabinet that the economy barely expanded at all in the first three months of the government’s life. Some business leaders are blaming the long period of fear-fuelled uncertainty in the run-up to the budget. Some ministers will tacitly acknowledge that they overdid the doom and gloom. They had better be sure that they are putting in place the right planning reforms, infrastructure investments and industrial strategies to lift growth off the floor. If they can’t improve Britain’s economic performance, they aren’t going to be able to achieve any of their other ambitions either. In the first flush of victory in July, many Labour people thought they had time on their side because the size of the parliamentary majority could be interpreted as a 10-year mandate for Sir Keir’s “decade of national renewal”. The paucity of the vote share was a warning against that kind of complacent thinking. An analysis by Labour Together, the influential campaign group, rightly cautions: “This Labour government has been cautiously hired, on a trial basis, liable to prompt dismissal if it deviates even slightly from its focus on voters’ priorities.” Some, even from within the party’s own ranks, are already catastrophising that this is doomed to be a one-term administration. It is way too early to forecast that the Starmer government is destined to suffer that fate. But the Labour leader and his cabinet must try to learn from the growing heap of cast-aside incumbents if they are not to be added to it. • Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"

          "headline": "Bushfire evacuations in Victoria’s west as conditions prompt catastrophic danger warnings",
          "bodyText": "Several communities in Victoria’s west have been urged to evacuate as firefighters work to control a number of bushfires. A short-lived heatwave has brought hot, dry and windy conditions to much of southern Australia, with total fire bans in place and some areas experiencing catastrophic fire danger. An emergency warning was issued for parts of Dereel, 33km south of Ballarat, on Saturday afternoon. The Country Fire Authority (CFA) warned of an out-of-control bushfire at Camms Road, with residents between Geggies Road and Gumley Road urged to leave immediately “before conditions become too dangerous.” A watch and act warning has been issued for the nearby towns of Barunah Park, Mount Mercer, Rokewood, Shelford, Warrambine, with residents urged to leave immediately with the bushfire under way. Further south, around 200 residents in the town of Gellibrand, 24km south of Colac, were told to leave immediately. A bushfire at Railway Line Road, Kawarren is not yet under control, and travelling in a southerly direction towards Frys Road. “Don’t wait, leaving now is the safest option,” the CFA said. “Conditions may change and get worse very quickly. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay. By choosing to stay, you and your family may be at risk of serious injury or death.” A similar warning was issued for Kadnook, Powers Creek, with an out-of-control bushfire burning in a blue gum plantation. Earlier, forecaster Jonathan How from the Bureau of Meteorology said the combination of high temperatures and gusty winds was driving up fire dangers on Saturday, particularly across South Australia and Victoria. Across these states – and New South Wales and Tasmania – temperatures were six to 12C above average for this time of year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “Thankfully, it’s not going to be a long-lived heatwave [and] it’s just going to be that one day for most people today,” How said, ahead of warm and humid conditions in the tropics pushing wet weather over Australia from Saturday night. In South Australia, temperatures were climbing to the high 30s and low 40s on Saturday, with a top of 40C forecast at Whyalla and Murray Bridge, 39C at Port Augusta and 38C at Renmark. Adelaide was forecast to reach 36c. The state’s Country Fire Service warned of catastrophic fire danger for the eastern Eyre peninsula and Yorke peninsula, with most of the southern and coastal districts experiencing extreme fire danger. Total fire bans were in place for Saturday across much of the state. “Extreme fire danger means that if a fire were to start, it would become very dangerous very quickly,” How explained. “Catastrophic is the highest fire danger rating [and means] that if a fire does start, it will be extremely dangerous and difficult to control.” Melbourne and central parts of Victoria had a high fire danger, while Mallee and Wimmera to the north-west had an extreme fire danger and total fire bans in place. The bureau was forecasting a maximum of 37C at Mildura, 36C at Shepparton and 35C at Bendigo, while Melbourne was set to reach a top of 34C. According to Weatherzone, there have been severe rain deficits this year in most of southern and eastern South Australia, and in large swathes of Victoria. This includes Whyalla, under a catastrophic fire danger rating on Saturday, which has received just 118mm of rain this year – less than half of what is expected by this point. Hobart was expected to reach 25C on Saturday, above average for the Tasmanian capital, with Sydney at a similar top of 24C. How said there was a risk of dry lightning on Saturday through NSW and northern Victoria, bringing the risk of starting fires."

          "headline": "The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup",
          "bodyText": "The Outsider by Jane Casey (Hemlock, £8.99) Tangentially related to Casey’s series featuring police officers Maeve Kerrigan and Josh Derwent, The Outsider focuses on Maeve’s former lover, the undercover police officer Rob Langton. When his prompt action helps to save the life of the crime boss he is tailing, Rob finds himself at the heart of a notorious criminal family. Patriarch Geraint Carter likes to keep people close, and his luxurious country mansion is inhabited by his adult children and their spouses, as well as senior staff members. It’s a macho world where the women, particularly the cowering wife of Geraint’s violent cokehead son Bruno, are essentially captives, and where Rob must continually prove his loyalty. This becomes increasingly difficult when Geraint joins forces with powerful rightwing conspirators intent on stirring up anti-immigrant sentiment by causing carnage in a public place – and the more Rob knows, the more danger he’s in if he’s rumbled … Pacy, gripping and tightly plotted, this book works both as a standalone and as a way into Casey’s excellent series. White City by Dominic Nolan (Headline, £20) Dog-whistle politics and undercover policing were quite as dangerous in 1952 as they are today, as Dave Lander, who reports to the flying squad while working for the gangster Billy Hill, discovers when he becomes embroiled in the latter’s plot to rob a mailvan in the West End. The “Eastcastle Street job” actually took place – the stolen money, which would be worth about £10m today, was never recovered, and nobody was ever charged – as did the Notting Hill race riots of 1958, which form the background to the book’s second half. Billy Hill, like many of the characters in this superb evocation of a postwar London struggling to emerge from the ruins, really existed. The slum landlord Peter Rachman, socialite Lady Docker, crime reporter Duncan Webb and many more rub shoulders with the invented characters as Nolan deftly intertwines Lander’s narrative with that of Addie, whose Jamaican postman father goes missing after the heist, and disillusioned Notting Dale-dweller Claire, whose husband disappears at the same time. The Sequel by Jean Hanff Korelitz (Faber, £9.99) When widow Anna Williams-Bonner dazzles the US literary world with a novel inspired by the death of her much-lauded writer husband Jacob, the ease with which she is published and publicised is a source of resentment to less well-connected writers. However, this is the least of her problems – it very quickly becomes clear that things are not quite as they appear: there is something fishy not only about Jacob’s apparent suicide, but also about the origins of his most famous book and the real story behind the manuscript he plagiarised. A woman used to being overlooked and underestimated, Anna is not only talented but ruthless as hell and prepared to go to Tom Ripleyesque lengths to protect herself. Plenty of twists here, as well as a mordantly satirical look at the business of writing and publishing: wannabe authors, look away now; everyone else, buckle up and enjoy a smart, funny and deliciously dark thriller. The Fate of Mary Rose by Caroline Blackwood (Virago Modern Classics, £9.99) Another dark gem, this time a very welcome reissue of a 1981 novel by Caroline Blackwood (1931-1996). Coldly selfish Rowan Anderson’s marriage is a union in name only. He spends his time in London, paying only grudging, sporadic visits to the Kentish village where his wife Cressida lives with their young daughter, Mary Rose, and, while there, he escapes to the pub as often as he can. Punctiliously domestic, Cressida’s life revolves around the child, but when six-year-old Maureen Sutton from the nearby council estate is raped and murdered in the local woods, she becomes fixated on the case, endlessly regaling Mary Rose with the gruesome details and locking her in the bedroom for safety. As Cressida’s obsession grows, Rowan maintains a wilful blindness to female vulnerability, but when she accuses him of the crime, he realises that, having got blackout drunk on the night in question, he has no recollection of his actions. An unsettling and, at times, almost unbearably creepy tale, with a genuinely shocking ending. Ink Ribbon Red by Alex Pavesi (Michael Joseph, £18.99) Pavesi’s debut, Eight Detectives, was an elaborate “puzzle mystery” of the Golden Age type, employing the metafictional device of narratives within a narrative. His second novel involves a not-dissimilar conceit: at a weekend birthday party in a country house, old friends from university are required by the host to write murder mystery stories featuring one of the group as the killer and another as the victim – names to be drawn from a hat – which, given that many of them have dirt on each other, soon brings skeletons tumbling out of closets … As long as you accept Ink Ribbon Red for what it is and don’t look for emotional depth, it’s fun, if sometimes difficult to follow – although even with this proviso, a more-than-usually-hefty suspension of disbelief is called for as the characters are all so utterly perverse it’s hard to imagine them remaining friends with anybody, let alone each other."

          "bodyText": "The Football Association and the Football Supporters’ Association have launched investigations after England supporters complained of being treated like animals by police before the Nations League match in Greece on Thursday night. Lee Carsley’s team were supported by 3,500 travelling fans but the atmosphere darkened outside the away end before kick-off. Supporters spoke of an inadequate turnstile operation and said riot police used shields and teargas to rearrange the queue. Images have been circulated of officers wearing gas masks. “It’s been mental,” Jack Loftus, who travelled to the game from Telford, told PA Media. “They went to adjust the queue at the front to make it narrower and longer and just did it with force. They were pushing the crowd amongst the fence. They ultimately treat us like animals, then they’ll act the victim if there’s retaliation.” The FSA’s Free Lions embassy posted on X: “Unfortunately, once again, we are having to ask England supporters to send in their witness accounts to ourselves regarding the situation outside of the Athens Olympic Stadium. “Despite being told how things would operate in advance, to see the exact opposite occur in some cases, and to see the treatment of our fans by local police using shields and teargas to do something as simple as rearrange a queue, is so incredibly frustrating. On a night where we had a great result on the pitch, there is still clearly so much needed to do off it to ensure our supporters aren’t put in unjustifiably dangerous situations.” A Free Lions representative called the situation unnecessary and added that it initially heated up as fans queued at the first ticket check point, with police using shields to rearrange the line. Hundreds of fans missed kick-off. The FA is gathering information. “We are aware that some of our fans had a difficult experience outside the ground and are obtaining more information on exactly what happened,” an FA spokesperson said. The England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) said: “FA security, ESTC staff, the UK Police and the FSA were all on hand to witness these incidents and will work together to document and address the issue further with the appropriate authorities.” It invited fans affected to share their experiences. Uefa is awaiting further reports before deciding whether to take action. England moved top of Nations League Group B2 after a 3-0 win. They host the Republic of Ireland on Sunday."

          "headline": "MaddAddam review – an epic dance through Margaret Atwood’s dystopia",
          "bodyText": "It makes complete sense that Wayne McGregor would be attracted to Margaret Atwood’s MaddAddam trilogy, the story of a scientist who engineers a perfect race of people. McGregor’s own choreography so often seems an attempt to transcend the limitations of the body, embracing technology, streamlining the messiness of fallible humans. To stage Atwood’s complex world is a colossal challenge, but McGregor revels in a big vision. He has made a ballet that’s epic, ambitious, flawed, in parts inspired, in others wanting, often beautiful and not for a moment boring. MaddAddam was premiered by National Ballet of Canada in 2022 to mixed reviews, and it has had some tweaks for this European premiere by the Royal Ballet, including a voiceover by Tilda Swinton (McGregor’s never less than high-end when it comes to collaborators), which goes some way to quelling narrative confusion. McGregor (with dramaturg Uzma Hameed) is never interested in just rehashing a story across three acts. The source material is a prompt, a proposition to bounce off, although there’s plenty of Atwood’s prescient books (Oryx and Crake, The Year of the Flood and MaddAddam) in here. The first act finds Snowman, AKA Jimmy (Joseph Sissens) up a tree, after a global pandemic-fuelled apocalypse, which has been bioengineered by his best friend, Crake (William Bracewell in black-clad tech guru mode), in parallel with the creation of a new, more innocent race, the Crakers. Past and present blur. Another survivor, Toby (Melissa Hamilton) duets with a distant, now unreachable lover (Lukas B Brændsrød) and rocks some of designer Gareth Pugh’s eclectic postapocalyptic fashion: a dusky pink jumpsuit and a rifle. Ravi Deepres’ projections bring startling visions, imagined and all too real. The second act rewinds and fast-forwards, presenting character after character – including the gene-spliced hybrid creatures pigoons – more of a roll call than an exploration, and misses some potential dramatic crunch points. The final act projects itself beyond the books into a speculative future and the mythmaking of the next generation, some of this cleverly done. It’s a lot to digest in real time. What is never in doubt is that the dancers are incredible. McGregor has had a long relationship with this company, and movement that once could have seemed awkward or extreme, is now utterly natural in their bodies. Sissens thrives in the loose-limbed, ranging imagination of his choreography, the most human character and the most multiplicitous in his movement. There is a well-drawn trio for Jimmy, Crake and Oryx (Fumi Kaneko) that illustrates the changing calibration in the triangle of love, trust and need between the three of them. At this stage the romantic sweep of Max Richter’s score becomes exultant, as if the trio are caught up in their own hubris. There is exciting dancing from the men in the second act when the music turns to juddering electronics and the dance to ultrafast chaîné turns and rocketing leaps. This is a ballet that is trying to do so much. You applaud its wild aspiration, it enthrals in the moment, but it leaves a flicker of unfulfillment, because its creators are only human after all. Buckle up for the ride and revel in the dancing of these impeccably engineered bodies. • At Royal Opera House, London, until 30 November"

On this occasion, though, Borthwick is absolutely within his rights. Inside the last fortnight the shape of the game has tilted significantly, with the odds now in favour of athletic kick chasers who have greater freedom than ever to make life a misery for full-backs underneath high balls. The latter can no longer be protected by loitering defenders “holding their line” or artfully blocking onrushing players looking to challenge in the air. Cue more aerial competition, more pressure, more knock-ons and more incentive for teams not to indulge in anything fancier than a succession of garryowens. It is not unlike changing the lbw law on the eve of a major cricket Test series and the consequences are already reflected in England’s team to face South Africa. As recently as March, England dropped Freddie Steward because they wanted to develop a more joined-up attack and pose more of a threat with ball in hand. Now George Furbank is on the outer again and “Safe Hands” Steward is back, specifically because of his ability to defuse high bombs from kick-happy opponents. Rugby’s tentative age of enlightenment has not lasted too long. Which potentially creates a perception problem that goes beyond one or two coaches having to revisit the drawing board. Nor is it what World Rugby ideally wanted to hear on the same day it plucked an Australian, Brett Robinson, from its sorting hat to be the organisation’s new chair, with the specific aim of spearheading its efforts to make the game sexier to the casual fan. Typical of rugby, you might think. Memories of last week’s brilliant 10-try contest with Australia are still fresh, the world champion Springboks are in town and what happens? The sport’s unerring ability to tweak a law interpretation only for that change to have completely unintended side effects is clearly alive and kicking. No wonder an affected coach such as Borthwick, who likes to plan everything in minute detail, is so exasperated. “It is certainly not the direction we’ve been trying to take our game in,” he confirmed, choosing his words with studied care. Having stuff of this nature dumped on him from a great height undoubtedly makes an already tough job even harder. Every self-respecting top coach, suggests Borthwick, will now take a similar view and instruct their sides to kick more often. When it comes to selection, creative types will start losing out again to big stoppers. And if everyone simply hoofs the ball in the air and feeds off the resultant crumbs, rugby will lose out both in terms of tactical variation and charm. The aforementioned Robinson, a narrow winner by 27 votes to 25 over France’s Abdelatif Benazzi for the World Rugby chair, will be among those monitoring the situation closely, with a decision on the permanent acceptance of the new 20-minute red card also having been postponed for now pending a full analysis of its impact on the current Autumn Nations Series. The immediate question, though, is whether any of this boosts the chances of an English victory on Saturday. The Springboks, with their top names mostly all back, currently seem to have the answers to pretty much every question. Will they be greatly bothered that Ben Spencer, perhaps the best kicking scrum-half in the Premiership, has been dropped and replaced by Leicester’s Jack van Poortvliet after a couple of tight English losses? Hardly. Will they be encouraged by the injury absence of Tom Curry and Manny Feyi-Waboso? Almost certainly. Potentially the only individual, Steward aside, who might force a little recalibration is Curry’s replacement, Sam Underhill, whose tackling will help shore up England’s defensive system. Amid all the chat about a rematch of last year’s World Cup semi-final, however, it is worth noting that England have only five surviving starters from that game. It will not be as easy as simply replicating what worked in the Stade de France that night. And maybe the team sheet is a red herring anyway. After a flurry of close defeats, there is an argument that what England mostly require is an overdue change of luck. It has not, admittedly, been much in evidence so far this week: even the team’s media officer, having initially gone down with food poisoning, now has flu. Welcome to top-level coaching where expecting the unexpected is all part of the job."

          "headline": "Gas prices at one-year high in Europe amid Russian supply threat",
          "bodyText": "Europe’s gas market rose by as much as 5% on Thursday to its highest price in a year after one of the continent’s biggest gas traders said that there could be a halt on gas supplies from Russia. Austrian gas trader OMV has said that a court decision awarding the company compensation after its dispute with a subsidiary of Russia’s Gazprom could lead the state-owned gas giant to halt supplies. Gas prices on Europe’s main gas market jumped to more than €45 a megawatt hour for the first time since November last year amid fears that Europe could face higher risks of tight gas supplies this winter if OMVs gas supplies are cut off. In the UK the price of gas on the wholesale market price climbed by almost 3% from its close on Wednesday to trade at just more than 114 pence per therm by Thursday morning. Europe’s gas market prices remain well below the historic highs of over €300/MWh in August 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier in the year OMV was awarded €230m ($243m) under International Chamber of Commerce rules after its row with Gazprom over its supply contract. It plans to recoup this amount from Gazprom by withholding its monthly payments for gas, but this could prompt the Russian company to halt deliveries. Tom Marzec-Manser, the head of gas analytics at ICIS, told the Guardian that the situation could come to a head as early as next week when OMV’s next monthly payment is due. “OMV may withhold this next payment, which would be around €213m, but this could trigger Gazprom in cutting that contract off immediately. The live OMV contract is just under half the gas that is transiting Ukraine currently,” he said. Typically about 38m cubic metres of Russian gas enters the EU via Ukraine every day, and OMV’s deal would see almost 17m cubic metres a day flow into Austria. The company said that it would be able to continue delivering gas to its customers even in the event of a potential gas supply disruption from Gazprom Export by tapping alternative sources. Separately, Austria’s energy minister, Leonore Gewessler, said the country’s gas supplies were secure because it had been “preparing for a possible supply disruption for a long time” and its gas storage facilities were full. “Austria can and will manage without Russian gas,” Gewessler wrote on X. “Nevertheless, it is clear that a sudden interruption in supply could cause tension on the gas markets.” Before the court ruling gas market analysts at Rystad Energy had expected gas prices to fall due to widely available gas supplies across Europe and in the global market. The International Energy Agency has predicted that fossil fuels will become significantly cheaper and more abundant by the end of the decade because companies are producing more oil, gas and coal than the world needs. In its monthly oil market report, published on Thursday, the global watchdog said the world’s oil supply will outstrip demand as soon as next year even if the Opec oil cartel and its allies keep a lid on their production due to rising oil production from countries including the US outpaces sluggish demand. This should bring down the price of petrol and food, according to the World Bank. At the moment Europe is well supplied with gas due to “materially stronger” flows of gas into the continent from Norway and weaker overall gas demand due to strong renew ables over the year, Rystad said. Rystad’s data shows that the continent’s imports of gas on seaborne vessels, known as liquified natural gas, rose 17% in October compared with the month before to help restock gas stores for the winter but this was still 16% lower than last year, reflecting weaker demand as a result of strong renewable energy generation this year. Russia’s supply of gas to Europe plummeted after the Kremlin launched an invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. The remaining pipeline flows over Ukraine are expected to end in December, when a transit agreement with Kyiv expires."

          "bodyText": "Any chance of a second opinion? Afraid not: it’s terminal. At 2pm on Thursday 14 November, BBC medical soap Doctors airs its last ever episode. After 24 years of aches, pains and plot twists, Mill Health Centre in the invented West Midlands town of Letherbridge will close its surgery doors for the last time. At least fans – it averages 1.6 million viewers a day – can console themselves with Doctors: A Celebration, which airs directly afterwards. To mark its demise, we’ve selected the best TV soap operas we’ve loved and lost. Our ground rules for inclusion are that there were two or more episodes a week (hence Holby City and Howards’ Way don’t qualify) and had a domestic setting (ruling out The Bill and other workplace procedurals). From daytime fillers to primetime flops, here is our rundown of dearly departed soaps, ranked from worst to best … 20. Eldorado (1992-1993) One of the most mocked flops in BBC history. In an attempt to repeat the success of EastEnders, the BBC launched another soap starting with E, this one set in an expat community on the Costa del Sol (its working title was Little England). Cue a £10m shambles. Scenes in Spanish baffled viewers. Acting was wooden. Location shooting in villas made dialogue echoey and inaudible. Don’t even get us started on middle-aged Bunny and his 17-year-old bride Fizz. BBC One boss Alan Yentob axed it within two weeks of taking over. 19. The Young Doctors (1976-1983) At my signal, unleash aspirin! Russell Crowe made his acting debut in this medical saga about the lives and loves of staff at Sydney’s Albert memorial hospital. It became an ITV afternoon staple, meaning a generation watched it while sick and off school. It was ultimately canned to make room for cricket in the Channel Nine schedules. The Young Doctors holds the unwelcome distinction, rare among long-running Aussie shows, of never winning a single award. Testament to its quality. 18. Sunset Beach (1997-1999) Masterminded by soap supremo Aaron Spelling, this California melodrama was shallow, shiny and shameless. Sunset Beach peddled outrageous plotlines (hot tub fights! Evil twins! Secret turkey-baster impregnation!) and featured knowing celebrity cameos from the likes of Jerry Springer. When it won a cult following on Channel 5, it became the only US daytime soap to become a hit in the UK. 17. Triangle (1981-1983) What could be more glamorous than a soap set on a North Sea ferry? Sailing from Felixstowe to Gothenburg, Amsterdam and back, it was supposed to be a British take on The Love Boat. Unfortunately, grey skies made it look depressingly gloomy and the crew all got seasick. Larry Lamb was the hunky chief engineer; Kate O’Mara the resident minx – memorably sunbathing topless on what was clearly a freezing cold deck. Terry Wogan had a hoot mocking it on his Radio 2 breakfast show. Anchors away. 16. Take the High Road (1980-2003) The late queen mother was a fan of this kilt-clad soap about the fictional village of Glendarroch. It was set around a picturesque estate on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond, with lairds, livestock, purple heather and a fiddly, folky theme tune. Most ITV regions dropped it in the mid-90s when its title was shortened to High Road but it retained a loyal fanbase in Scotland and Northern Ireland until it took the low road to the TV afterlife. 15. Angels (1975-1983) Part of a long line of medical soaps – Dr Finlay’s Casebook, A Country Practice, Emergency Ward 10 and General Hospital almost made our cut – this female-led mould-breaker was dubbed “the Z-Cars of nursing” and followed student nurses at the fictional Saint Angela’s in Battersea, later relocating to Birmingham’s Heath Green hospital. Its gritty authenticity was thanks to the cast working on real NHS wards to get hands-on experience. Producer Julia Smith and script editor Tony Holland later reunited to create EastEnders. 14. Sons and Daughters (1982-1987) It’s hard to believe now but, at its peak, this Dallas-inspired spin on Romeo and Juliet notched up six million viewers on daytime ITV. It followed the romantically tangled lives of two Australian families – the wealthy Hamiltons from Sydney and the working-class Palmers from Melbourne. Its arch villain was scheming matriarch Patricia “Pat the Rat” Hamilton; when leading lady Rowena Wallace decided to quit, they simply had her character fly to Rio for extensive cosmetic surgery and return as a different actor. 13. Albion Market (1985-1986) Pitched as a northern version of EastEnders, which launched on the BBC six months earlier, ITV’s effort was set in a covered market in Salford – and proved about as thrilling as that sounds. Storylines were hard-hitting but action became mired in the day-to-day tedium of stallholders. The cast included Anthony Booth, father-in-law of the future prime minister, Tony Blair, as the pub landlord. It was axed after exactly 100 episodes. 12. Melrose Place (1992-1999) An early hit for the king of high-end trash, Darren Star (of Sex and the City and Emily in Paris pedigree), this Fox soap about hot young things living in the titular West Hollywood apartment complex was enjoyably over the top. It was populated by fashion designers, heart surgeons, ad execs and aerobics instructors, with Heather Locklear having a ball as a Joan Collins-style superbitch. Part of the Beverly Hills 90210 franchise, it spawned its own spin-off: the even more telegenic Models Inc. 11. Park Avenue (1988-1992) The world’s first and only teletext soap ran on ITV’s service Oracle. Six to 10 pages of text would appear daily at 4pm. Each episode began with a “Story so far” catchup, before launching into a heady brew of sex and scandal in the fictional town of Parkfield. It riffed on topical events, and fans could vote on outcomes to storylines. Despite the niche format, it ran for 1,500 episodes, coming to an end when Oracle shut down. 10. Night and Day (2001-2003) Comparisons to Twin Peaks and a Kylie theme song? No wonder this stylish 00s mystery soap became cult viewing among teens. When a girl from Greenwich disappears on her 16th birthday, the lives of the families on her street become darkly intertwined. Buffy-influenced experimentation with frozen time, flash forwards, memories and ghosts made this refreshingly edgy fare. Familiar faces in the cast included Clarke Peters, Shane Richie, Lesley Joseph, Glynis Barber and Bradley Walsh. 9. Families (1990-1993) An attempt to mix the sunny escapism of Australian soaps with homegrown familiarity, this Granada crossover followed two clans – one in Cheshire, one in Sydney – connected by an adulterous jetset businessman. Created by the late, great Kay Mellor, gritty storylines covered such topics as murder, incest, drugs and sex work. The talent wasn’t too shabby either: Russell T Davies was one of the writers, while a teenage Jude Law starred for two years. 8. Falcon Crest (1981-1990) The so-bad-it’s-good-CBS supersoap was basically “Dallas with grapes”. It revolved around feuding family factions in California’s fictitious Tuscany Valley. As tyrannical wine-making matriarch Angela Channing (Oscar-winner Jane Wyman) presided over her vineyard empire, the fine vintages were washed down with vats of backstabbing, bed-hopping and a seemingly endless supply of children born out of wedlock. Cheers! 7. Family Affairs (1997-2005) Former Channel 5 director of programmes Kevin Lygo damned this soap with faint praise, saying: “If you forced yourself to watch it, you’d be surprised. It’s not as bad as you think.” Kicking off the channel’s launch night lineup, Family Affairs hit headlines for featuring a flash of naked bum. It shared west London locations with police stalwart The Bill, while a young Idris Elba was a regular at riverside bar The Lock. It had a higher density of LGBTQ+ characters than any other British soap, was praised for its diverse cast and won awards for an NSPCC-backed paedophilia storyline. 6. Peyton Place (1964-1969) Widely acknowledged as the first primetime US soap, this landmark ABC series aired in black-and-white for the first half of its five-year run before switching to new-fangled colour. Inspired by Coronation Street, it was set in a seemingly idyllic New England town – which, naturally, was a hotbed of love, lust, dark secrets and simmering tensions. The starry cast included Mia Farrow, Gena Rowlands, Leslie Nielsen and Ryan O’Neal. Producer Paul Monash refused to admit it was a soap, calling it a “high-class anthology drama”. So a soap, then? 5. Revelations (1994-1996) “When the Church of England started ordaining women, I thought ‘Yes! We can do a lesbian vicar!’” Co-created by Russell T Davies, this raunchy late-night romp was a trailblazing treat. As the title implies, it was religious-themed but in a camply iconoclastic way, focusing on the family of a priest (Paul Shelley) and his wife (Judy Loe, mother of Kate Beckinsale). That female vicar was the first openly gay character written by Davies, who went on to create Queer As Folk and It’s a Sin. 4. Dynasty (1981-1989) Alongside Dallas, the epitome of shoulder-padded primetime 80s excess. Aaron Spelling’s addictively camp classic chronicled the gilded existences and epic feuds of a super-rich Denver family, headed by oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe), who “lived and sinned” in a 48-room mansion. It was most memorable for the bitter rivalry between Blake’s ex-wife, Alexis (a never better Joan Collins), and his secretary turned current spouse, Krystle (Linda Evans). A catfight in a koi pond, a plane crash, a wedding massacre and an evil Krystle doppelganger were some of its wildest moments. 3. Crossroads (1964-1988, 2001-2003) It’s best known nowadays as the wobbly setted West Midlands saga parodied in Victoria Wood’s Acorn Antiques – but at its height Crossroads was huge, pulling in a peak of 15 million viewers. It centred on the fictional Crossroads motel, run by Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon, whose unceremonious sacking was recently the subject of its own drama, Nolly). Kitschy, creaky and melodramatic, it was like a Brummie telenovela. Benny Hawkins, Amy Turtle, Shughie McFee, Adam Chance … the characters’ names alone are enough to prompt a nostalgia rush for those of a certain age. 2. Dallas (1978-1991) Sue Ellen’s trembling lips! Bobby in the shower! Set on the sprawling Southfork ranch and in the offices of the family company, Ewing Oil, the CBS smash followed the power struggles and torrid private lives of Stetson-wearing, bourbon-guzzling Texas tycoons with names like Digger, Dusty and Punk. At the centre of the action sat malevolent magnate JR Ewing (Larry Hagman), a Shakespearean baddie for the TV age. The “Who shot JR?” cliffhanger became a global obsession, as did the bonkers plot twist when the entire previous season was all a dream. 1. Brookside (1982-2003) The all-time best soap that is no more. The much-missed Merseyside saga was created by Grange Hill’s Phil Redmond and was similarly socially aware. Beginning on Channel 4’s launch night, “Brookie” ran for two decades, but its heyday was the late 80s and early 90s, when eight million viewers made it the station’s top-rated show. It made history by airing the first ever pre-watershed lesbian kiss, between Anna Friel and Nicola Stephenson. Sue Johnston and Ricky Tomlinson played a married couple long before The Royle Family. Landmark storylines included an armed siege, a body under the patio and sibling incest. The final episode saw villainous drug dealer Jack Michaelson – a play on the name of Channel 4 boss Michael Jackson, who axed the show – being murdered by residents."

          "headline": "Shell’s successful appeal will not end climate lawsuits against firms, say experts",
          "bodyText": "A court ruling in favour of Shell does not spell the end of climate litigation against companies, legal experts have said. The oil and gas company celebrated on Tuesday when it won an appeal against a landmark climate judgment by a Dutch court. In 2021 a lower court ruled that Shell must cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels. It was the first such ruling against a company in the world, and led to a growing trend of lawsuits against corporations. However, the Dutch court of appeal ruled that, while Shell did have a “special responsibility” to cut its emissions as a major oil company, this would not be achieved by imposing a specific legal goal. Milieudefensie, the NGO that brought the claim, was disappointed with the ruling because it rejected its key demand. However, the lawyer Roger Cox said he could see a number of important points to build on in the NGO’s legal battle against large polluters. “The court makes it abundantly clear that not only countries, but also companies, have a responsibility to reduce their emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement,” said Cox. Thom Wetzer, an associate professor of law and finance at the University of Oxford, believes this leaves the door “wide open” for future litigation against corporations in the Netherlands and beyond. The appeal court found no solid basis on which to order Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by the end of the decade. Shell successfully argued that the target was based on a global average and did not take into account the fact that the company did not sell the most polluting fossil fuel, coal. Nor was the court persuaded by Milieudefensie’s suggestions of more tailored emissions reductions for oil and gas. But the court agreed in principle that it was able to order companies to meet absolute emission reductions. Joana Setzer, an associate professor at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, said this laid the basis for future claims, particularly once the EU set clear pathways for emission reductions in particular sectors. Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at Grantham, said he believed scientists had an important role in this. “Research in this field is advancing rapidly to bridge the gap between global emissions reduction goals and specific actionable targets.” The court stressed that business environmental rules were getting tougher. Both the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive and its later corporate sustainability due diligence directive (CSDDD), which was finalised earlier this year and takes effect from 2027, impose climate-related obligations on companies such as Shell. According to Wetzer, the original Shell ruling was an important catalyst in changing the political landscape, “which led business to support the CSDDD codification in an attempt to gain legal certainty”. Setzer said these rules provided a more robust framework for holding corporations accountable but the court made it clear that they were not exhaustive. “This creates space for litigants to argue that companies must go beyond baseline regulatory compliance to fulfil their human rights and environmental responsibilities.” The court affirmed that corporations had responsibilities to respect human rights. More than 20 legal cases are examining this issue in relation to climate change, and Fred Kelly, a senior associate at law firm Peters &amp; Peters, expects the judgment to prompt more. Another point of contention was the extent to which companies should have to cut emissions from their suppliers and customers, also known as “scope 3” emissions. The court accepted Shell’s arguments that the specific target Milieudefensie had requested might not contribute to global climate efforts, because any oil or gas it chose not to sell may simply be sold by another company. But Wetzer said that this left the door open for legal claims if companies did not have, or failed to adhere to, more direct scope 1 and 2 emissions. It may even leave room for more nuanced scope 3 claims focusing on fossil fuel production. Although it would not impose a specific obligation on Shell to cut its emissions, the court said it was “reasonable to expect oil and gas companies to take into account the negative consequences of a further expansion of the supply of fossil fuels for the energy transition also when investing in the production of fossil fuels”. It said that Shell’s plan to develop hundreds of new oil and gas fields despite the International Energy Agency having warned against investments in any new fossil fuel extraction “may be at odds with this”. Wetzer said he saw this as a “strong hint” that Shell’s fossil fuel exploration and development should have limits, while Setzer anticipated that the ruling could inspire more project-specific cases. “The court’s critique of Shell’s new fossil fuel investments aligns with the argument that such projects are fundamentally at odds with the Paris agreement,” said Setzer. “Project cases, like the legal challenge to the Rosebank oilfield in the UK, are increasingly paving the way for courts to demand that emissions from fossil fuel use be fully considered before approving high-emitting projects.” Companies are not off the hook, said Wetzer. “Although the pathway to injunction-based cases of the Shell type succeeding may be a bit longer and bumpier than some might have hoped, it is definitely there. So, as before, companies should act in anticipation of this norm being enforceable or face significant legal risk.”"

          "headline": "Canadian minister says ‘not everyone is welcome’ amid Trump migrant threat",
          "bodyText": "Canada’s immigration minister has said “not everyone is welcome” in the country as officials brace for an increase of migrants when Donald Trump returns to the White House with a pledge to carry out mass deportations. The minister’s warning, seven years after Justin Trudeau promised that “Canadians will welcome” asylum seekers, reflects a stark shift in tone amid waning support for immigration and refugee resettlement in the country, according to migration experts. Trump has pledged to enact the country’s largest mass deportation when he takes office in January. The senior official helping to oversee the policy, Tom Homan, said Monday the incoming administration will target those living illegally in the US who they consider a public safety threat. But the effect of these policies is widely expected to prompt many people in the US without documentation to flee north and cross unpatrolled areas of the 5,500-mile border. Speaking to the Globe and Mail, immigration minister Marc Miller said his government would “always be acting in the national interest … to make sure that our borders are secure, that people that are coming to Canada do so in a regular pathway, and the reality that not everyone is welcome here”. During Trump’s first term in office, tens of thousands of Haitians fled to Canada after the president ended temporary protected status for the group. At the time, Trudeau posted on social media: “To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.” Canada’s federal police say they have plans to deal with a fresh increase in crossings that have been “several months” in the making. Deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland said her government “absolutely recognize[d] the importance to border security and of controlling our own border, of controlling who comes into Canada and who doesn’t”. But migration experts said the government’s tough messaging on border security in advance of a possible humanitarian crisis reflects an abdication of its moral responsibilities and of the refugee convention. “Canada’s first and only response to what might be persecution in a neighbouring country is, ‘How do we prevent people from escaping to our country?’ It’s certainly familiar, unsurprising and disappointing,” said Audrey Macklin, a law professor at the University of Toronto. Under the refugee convention, a country cannot turn away an asylum seekers if they they have a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin. Until 2005, people attempting to claim asylum could make claims at ports of entry, but a US-Canada agreement pushed by Canada made it more difficult. That pact, the Safe Third Country Agreement, allowed Canada could send claimants back to the US and vice versa. “The idea was, you’re not sending them back to the country where they fear persecution. You’re just sending them to the United States. Baked into agreement is idea United States is a safe country for people to seek and obtain refugee protection,” said Macklin, who previously served as a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board. Recent changes to the agreement have made it harder to make asylum claims when travelling from the United States to Canada, meaning families will take increasingly dangerous routes – an “immense job stimulus program for smugglers”, said Macklin. Under the current rule, a person can make an asylum claim if they remain undetected in Canada for 14 days. “Canada and the United States have created a market for smugglers by making it impossible to ask for refugee protection at a port of entry, because if they could, if people could do that, they wouldn’t need they wouldn’t use smugglers,” said Macklin. “And now people are going to have to pay the smuggler to hide them for 14 days.” Macklin said Canada should revisit the agreement if it wants to deter people from taking dangerous journeys north. “If anybody actually cared about harm to asylum seekers, if anybody was absolutely concerned about their wellbeing, they wouldn’t force them into a system where they’re required to use the services of smugglers or traffickers take risky routes that risk them being injured, freezing limbs and other forms of danger, they would see the the Safe Third Country Agreement is designed to inflict harm,” she said. “What we’re seeing now is the entirely predictable outcome of a deliberate, intentional policy that Canada pursued for decades.”"

          "bodyText": "A two-year-old who drowned in a pool while his mother looked at her mobile phone and cared for another infant two metres away highlights the need for close supervision around water, a Victorian inquest has heard. The boy had been playing in a toddlers’ pool adjoined to an adult pool at Crown Towers, a luxury hotel in central Melbourne, in 2021 when he slipped and fell into the deeper pool. Coroner Sarah Gebert said CCTV footage showed he struggled for more than two minutes while his mother used her mobile phone in the toddlers’ pool nearby and minded her 12-month-old nephew. Her son then floated to the surface. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The boy, known as Master K for the inquest, was undiscovered by the mother and other pool patrons for more than nine minutes. “Master K’s tragic death and the circumstances of his drowning highlight the need for close supervision of young children, especially in and around pools,” Gebert said in her findings. “This is a safety message that is consistently repeated by a number of child and water-related authorities. “I convey my sincere condolences to Master K’s family for their loss and acknowledge the profound grief caused by the passing of such a young child.” More than 40 Victorian children aged under four have drowned since 2010 because of inadequate supervision, Gebert found. As part of the investigation, Gebert analysed data which showed that between 1 January 2010 and 31 March 2024, there were 47 drowning deaths of children aged between newborn and four years of age in Victoria. In 43 of these deaths, inadequate supervision was a factor, she found. Of the 47 deaths, children aged one year represented the highest age group of drownings, with 16 deaths, followed by two-year-olds with 11 deaths. In 11 of the 47 cases, Gebert found, coroners previously made comments relating to the specific dangers faced by young children in the context of water safety. Gebert directed the findings be provided to the Royal Children’s hospital, Ambulance Victoria, the Commission for Children and Young People, Kidsafe Victoria and Life Saving Victoria. She also noted that the Office of Public Prosecutions had advised Victoria police that charges for child homicide in circumstances of criminal negligence should not proceed in the circumstances."

          "headline": "What is voter certification – the process that Trump targeted in 2020?",
          "bodyText": "With voting completed in the US presidential election, election officials across the country will now turn to certifying the results before the electoral college meets in December and Congress certifies the vote in January. Until the 2020 election, few paid attention to certification, which was seen as a bureaucratic way of officializing the results of the election. But after 2020, Donald Trump and allies, who questioned the election results, targeted the certification process as a way of causing confusion. In advance of the presidential election, there were deep concerns that the former president and allies would try and block certification of the election results, starting at the local level. Trump’s victory in the election means that there likely won’t be an effort to block certification of the presidential results. But there still are some close US Senate and House races that could prompt battles over certification. Experts say it is clear that certification is not discretionary and those who refuse to certify could face criminal penalties. What is certification? Certification refers generally to the process of making the election results official. The process works differently in each state. Election results are unofficial until they are certified. It takes place after a canvass, the process that takes place after every election to aggregate all of the ballot totals, resolving outstanding disputes over challenged or provisional ballots and reconciling any discrepancies or inconsistencies. Officials investigate any discrepancies, if they exist, in vote totals. The process varies by jurisdiction, but there is usually a board of people which then votes to certify the election. Various state laws make it clear that this is a ministerial responsibility and that officials cannot refuse to do so. For a statewide election, results are certified at both the local and state level. Is certification when disputes over election results are resolved? No. The canvass and certification process is aimed at reconciling vote totals and getting an official count. The process may identify abnormalities that could become the basis for an election contest or challenge later. State laws allow for separate legal processes outside of the certification process to challenge election results. These typically take place in the courts. What happens if an official or a board refuses to certify? Most boards certify the vote on a majority vote, so a single member refusing to certify wouldn’t block certification. But if a majority of the board refuses to certify, a secretary of state or election watchdog group would likely sue them to get a court to force them to certify. Watchdog groups have already warned that those who refuse to certify will face criminal charges. Could an effort to block certification actually work? No. If there were substantial irregularities in an election that could affect the outcome, it would be resolved in court. Experts are confident that the winners of elections will be the ones seated. Despite that confidence, there’s still concern that refusals to certify will allow people to continue to question the election results and seed further doubt about the election. What happens after certification? In a presidential election, there are additional steps after states certify the vote. In nearly every state, the winner of the statewide vote gets all of the state’s electors to the electoral college. A new law, the Electoral Count Reform Act, requires the governor of each state to certify the list of their state’s electors no later than six days before the electoral college meets. This year, that means the electors will be finalized by 11 December and the electors will meet in state capitols across the country on 17 December. Once the electors meet and cast their votes, they transmit them to the National Archives in Washington. Congress will oversee the counting of the vote on 6 January 2025 to make the results official. The constitution says that the president of the Senate – the vice-president – will oversee counting of the votes. That means that Kamala Harris will oversee the counting of the vote this year. Harris, who conceded the election to Trump on Wednesday, said in her concession speech that she “will engage in a peaceful transfer of power”."

          "headline": "Trump’s White House circle takes shape amid fears over extremist appointments",
          "bodyText": "Donald Trump’s second administration has begun to take shape amid fears over extremist appointments and how far right the US will go while Republicans control the White House and probably both chambers of Congress. The range of names being put forward varies from members of Trump’s inner circle to the world’s richest man, tech mogul Elon Musk. Alongside plutocrats and technocrats are hardline ideologues on immigration and foreign policy and the controversial figure of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a leading vaccine conspiracy theorist. On Thursday, Trump made his first appointment, naming Susie Wiles, a co-campaign chair, White House chief of staff. Hailing Wiles, 67, as “tough, smart, innovative … universally admired and respected”, Trump reveled in naming “the first-ever female chief of staff in United States history”. The daughter of an NFL legend, Pat Summerall, Wiles has worked on Republican campaigns since the days of Ronald Reagan. But she faces a thankless task. Chief of staff is a hugely demanding role, both gatekeeper and adviser. Trump’s first four-year term featured four: Reince Priebus, John Kelly, Mick Mulvaney and Mark Meadows. None flourished. Before this year’s election, Kelly went so far as to say on record that Trump praised Adolf Hitler and met “the general definition of a fascist”. Publicly, Wiles is a woman of fewer words. On election night, in his victory speech, Trump called her “the ice baby”. The Trump transition team is co-chaired by Howard Lutnick, chief executive of the finance giant Cantor Fitzgerald, and Linda McMahon, the World Wrestling Entertainment impresario who led the Small Business Administration in Trump’s first term. As ever, speculation is rife about top jobs. Given campaign promises including mass deportations of undocumented migrants and pardons for January 6 rioters, the role of attorney general is perhaps attracting most attention. Mike Davis, a lawyer and former Senate aide, is constantly linked to the role. This week, Davis made headlines by threatening Letitia James, the attorney general of New York who brought successful civil cases against Trump and his company and who has said she will “fight back” as Trump returns to power. “Let me just say this to Big Tish James,” Davis told the podcaster Benny Johnson. “I dare you to try to continue your lawfare against President Trump in his second term. Because listen here, sweetheart, we’re not messing around this time. And we will put your fat ass in prison for conspiracy against rights, I promise you that.” Davis has also asked a January 6 conspiracy theorist for “pardon and commutation lists” and said of Trump’s opponents: “I want to drag their dead political bodies through the streets, burn them, and throw them off the wall. (Legally, politically, and financially, of course.)” Praised by Donald Trump Jr as “the tip of the spear defending my father” and “exactly the type of fighter that I’d like to see involved in a second Trump administration”, Davis would seem guaranteed to quash both criminal charges hanging over Trump and sentencing for his 34 criminal convictions in his New York hush-money trial. However, Davis himself has owned up to being deliberately outrageous – telling Politico: “It’s hilarious that it’s so easy to trigger [Trump’s opponents and the press]. I’m obviously trolling them.” The Guardian understands Davis has told allies privately and publicly he does not want to be attorney general, a sentiment relayed to Trump. Many observers are looking to Mike Lee, the Utah senator who was eagerly involved in Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, for attorney general. John Ratcliffe, Trump’s former director of national intelligence, and Texas attorney general Ken Paxton – like Trump a scandal-magnet, impeached and indicted – are also in the running. Sources advised paying close attention to names discussed for deputy attorney general, given the DAG’s role in running the Department of Justice day to day. Mark Paoletta, a lawyer and Catholic hardliner close to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas and his wife, the rightwing activist Ginni Thomas, was said to be in the frame. Paoletta – who was general counsel for the Office of Management and Budget has in the first Trump administration – is also linked to the top job. Other figures from the first administration are linked to roles in the second. Many have links to Project 2025, a policy planning effort co-ordinated by the hard-right Heritage Foundation that produced the Mandate for Leadership, a 900-page compendium of extreme proposals. Chapter authors now contenders for Trump jobs include Christopher Miller, who was acting defense secretary during the Capitol attack; Russell Vought, Trump’s chair of the Office of Management and Budget; Peter Navarro, a trade adviser who went to prison for contempt of Congress; and Roger Severino, formerly a senior official at the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump has said he will give Robert F Kennedy Jr a prominent role in health policy, as some sort of “czar” if not health secretary. Kennedy ran for president as an independent before backing Trump. He is also a vaccine conspiracy theorist and a supporter of removing fluoride from public drinking water, positions that prompt alarm among public health advocates. After Trump indicated he was open to Kennedy’s wish to ban vaccines, Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and faculty member at the New England Complex Systems Instute, said simply: “I’m saddest of all for the kids who soon may not get vaccines to save their lives from preventable diseases.” Musk, owner of X, Tesla and SpaceX, backed Trump’s campaign and has said he expects a role in slashing the federal budget. Rather less wealthy figures likely to hold influence as advisers if not cabinet appointees include Stephen Miller, the far-right immigration hawk; Kash Patel, who ended the first Trump term at the Pentagon; and Johnny McEntee, who went from “body man” to purge-planner in the first Trump White House. For secretary of defense, Trump is believed to be considering Christopher Miller, the former special forces officer and Project 2025 author whose actions (or lack of them) on January 6 were scrutinized by the investigating House committee. Names in the Pentagon frame also include Mike Waltz, a Florida congressman and former Green Beret, and Mike Pompeo, a soldier and congressman who was CIA director then secretary of state last time. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, is widely touted for secretary of state. This week, Rubio told CNN: “I always am interested in serving this country.” Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee senator and former ambassador to Japan, is also reported to be under consideration to be Trump’s top diplomat. Richard Grenell, formerly ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence, is reported to covet the role too. Fox News reported that Grenell could become national security adviser. Robert O’Brien, the sixth and last man to fill the role in Trump’s first term, is also a possible pick to return. Elise Stefanik, the New Yorker in Republican House leadership, is reported to be a possible ambassador to the UN. Numerous plutocrats, among them the hedge fund billionaire John Paulson, have been suggested for treasury secretary. Robert Lighthizer, a veteran whose last role was US trade representative, likely to be an important post given Trump’s obsessions with China and tariffs, is also in the picture. Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor Trump considered for vice-president before picking the Ohio senator JD Vance, is reportedly well placed for interior secretary. Amid ceaseless speculation about Trump’s plans, sources told the Guardian to keep in mind that Project 2025, though deeply alarming to progressives in calling for purges of federal workers and attacks on minority rights, is most likely something of a red herring – a new version of policy plans produced by the Heritage Foundation since the days of Reagan and never implemented fully. The America First Policy Institute, set up by Stephen Miller and with McMahon chairing its board, is much more closely involved with transition plans. Also at AFPI is Chad Wolf, formerly acting homeland security secretary and a contender this time. Mass deportations – and housing migrants in camps – were a key part of Trump’s pitch. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke favorably of Tom Homan, previously acting director of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. A Heritage fellow and Project 2025 author, Homan told this summer’s Republican national convention in Milwaukee he had “a message for the millions of illegal aliens who Joe Biden allowed to enter the country in violation of federal law – start packing, because you’re going home.” Homan was also reported to have accepted an invitation to a white nationalist conference hosted by Nick Fuentes, the Holocaust denier and Hitler admirer who dined with Trump and Kanye West at Mar-a-Lago in 2022. On Thursday, Homan told Fox News he had “not politicked or asked … for a cabinet position”, and that no offer had been made. But he added: “President Trump knows if he needs help securing that border I’m standing by. If he needs help running a deportation operation, I am standing by.”"

          "headline": "New film unravels mystery of the Russian ‘spy whale’",
          "bodyText": "When a white whale, mysteriously kitted out with covert surveillance equipment, was first spotted in icy waters around Norway five years ago it seemed like an improbable chapter from a spy thriller. But working out the true identity and secret objectives of this beluga, nicknamed Hvaldimir by the Norwegians, quickly became a real-life puzzle that has continued to fascinate the public and trouble western intelligence analysts. Now missing clues have surfaced that finally begin to make sense of the underwater enigma. The makers of a new BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, believe they have traced the beluga’s probable path and identified its likely mission. Hvaldimir, whose nickname is a combination of hval, Norwegian for whale, and the first name of Russian president Vladimir Putin, has regularly been described as a Russian “spy whale”. After all, the harness it wore bore the words “Equipment of St Petersburg” and seemed designed to carry a small camera. But the film uncovers new evidence that he might have been trained as a covert “guard whale”, rather than being sent out to sea to conduct maritime espionage. “Our latest findings about the potential role that Hvaldimir had been trained to do bring us closer to solving the mystery,” said Jennifer Shaw, director of the film, which airs on BBC Two on Wednesday. “But they also prompt many further questions about what Russia might be seeking to guard in the Arctic, and why.” After 10 months of research into the strange history of marine mammal training, the documentary team met one of the last remaining veterans of an early US Navy programme run from Point Mugu in California. Former dolphin trainer Blair Irvine, now in his 80s, explained how he had developed the programme. “Swimmers create bubbles, bubbles cause noise. The dolphin’s hearing is extremely sensitive and in this context it was unfailing,” he said. Irvine and his team trained dolphins to swim like sentries, listening out for intruders. They would push a paddle with their rostrum, or snout, to sound an alarm if they detected noises. The Soviet Union soon launched its own programme using similar techniques. A phalanx of dolphins is thought to have guarded the Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea. Kept in floating cages, they were trained to warn of the approach of any underwater saboteurs. The documentary includes evidence given by whale expert Dr Eve Jourdain, who details patterns of behaviour she had observed while watching Hvaldimir in Hammerfest harbour in 2019. She had seen the whale swim right up to touch the cameras being carried by anyone who tried to swim close by. “It was obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target,” Jourdain told the film-makers. Shaw told the Observer that the whale found on the Norwegian coast had shown every sign of having been recruited as part of a security patrol. “As we sat interviewing Blair Irvine in America, thousands of miles away from Hammerfest, it dawned on me that I might be sitting opposite the man who had devised the exact training system Hvaldimir had been conditioned by, albeit 50 years later.” In the 1980s, as the strategic importance of the Arctic grew during the Cold War, a new branch of the programme was launched in the northern Russian city of Murmansk. Here, Shaw suspects, these mammals were used to guard the ballistic missile submarines of the Northern Fleet. A former Soviet dolphin trainer and nuclear submarine commander Volodymyr Belousiuk, who was stationed in Murmansk at this time, reveals in the documentary that instructors turned their attention to whales because dolphins became ill in sub-zero temperatures. “We knew we wanted to uncover more about the true identity of the whale,” said Shaw. “It’s a mystery that has captivated people around the world. But it also gave us an opportunity to explore the history of marine mammal training within the military – something that few people are aware of as it has been steeped in secrecy for decades and many of those who knew the truth are sadly no longer alive.” The collapse of the Soviet Union saw funding for marine mammal programmes reduced, but the appearance of the “spy whale” was one of several signs of reinvestment. Imagery of a Russian Navy base at Olenya Guba revealed the presence of two large floating pens containing “white spots” thought to be belugas. Hvaldimir was found dead earlier this year by two men fishing in Risavika Bay, southern Norway. Police opened an investigation after animal rights groups claimed he had been shot. However, an autopsy showed he had died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

          "bodyText": "Wednesday 9 November 2016: a misty, drizzly day in Washington DC, an overwhelmingly Democrat city in trauma after the shock victory of Donald Trump in the election the previous day. A Washington rarity, a declared Trump supporter, was among a group of guests for lunch in the residence that day. I took him aside and asked whether Trump would be as radical and disruptive as the giants of American political journalism were predicting. “Not at all,” he said: “I know the guy. All that red meat was just for the campaign. I expect him to govern as a mainstream Republican.” Fast forward to London, Wednesday 6 November 2024. I’m speaking at a business dinner about the election outcome and what will come next. I mention Trump’s commitment to levy 20% tariffs on all imports into America. One participant says he has just spoken to a friend in Arizona who knows Trump personally. This friend has said: “It’s not about instant action. Trump will use the tariffs as a threat, to persuade countries to act to get trade flows into balance.” Another participant says: “Trump has won his second term now. So he doesn’t need to fight any more. Surely he’ll calm down and focus on his legacy?” There are a hundred questions to ask about this election. Why were the polls so wrong, again? Why was Joe Biden ever allowed to run, and wreck the field for others, when he was so transparently past it? Why did Kamala Harris do so catastrophically badly among Hispanic and African-American men: is it really just because she is a woman? And what does it say about western democracies that the most important election of all has been won by a man for whom the truth is a distant land, seldom visited? But the most immediate question for the UK is – how should the government prepare for Trump 2.0? Trump is profoundly unpredictable. He thrives in, indeed deliberately creates, chaos and disorder. It is impossible to be sure about how he will behave, what tone he will strike, when back in the Oval Office. But those predictions around that London dinner table of a new, mellow Trump backing away from his campaign rhetoric strike me as a triumph of hope over experience: the lesson of his first term is that he mostly does what he says he is going to do. The British government has made an intelligent start, thanks in part to some brilliant work by the Washington embassy: the phone call after the assassination attempt, the dinner in Trump Tower. But Trump expects people to pay court to him; rewards don’t generally follow. So the groundwork, though necessary, guarantees nothing. Challenging times lie ahead, especially on climate change, tariffs and Ukraine. On climate change, Trump will take America out of the Paris deal, and step up exploitation of oil and gas. The world is already disastrously behind the curve on reaching net zero by 2050: US withdrawal from Paris will make this worse. Though it won’t undo all the damage, the partial remedy here is to work with individual US states, notably environmentally aware California. On tariffs I expect the exact opposite of a mere threat. I think Trump will impose tariffs on all US imports immediately and say: “If you want them lifted, offer me something to rebalance trade”. The EU will almost certainly retaliate; and the UK will face a difficult decision. Do we match EU retaliatory tariffs? Or do we seek a bilateral deal, like a free trade agreement? I think an FTA would be on offer from Trump, as in 2017: but the top US demand, as was the case then, would be unrestricted access to the UK market for the low-cost products of the US agricultural sector, hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken included. So the stark choice would be: side with the EU or sacrifice our agriculture? On Ukraine, to the extent there is a Trump plan, it seems to involve a ceasefire, creation of a demilitarised zone between the two frontlines, and the opening of negotiations on a permanent peace deal. But JD Vance has suggested that Russia might keep the territory it has captured, and Ukraine might have to promise never to join Nato. In short, it would look like a defeat. I cannot see Zelensky accepting it, and I would expect him to appeal to Europe to backfill for American weapons subsequently denied. So another difficult decision for the prime minister: try to rally Europe to reject US ideas and increase support for Ukraine, or pack up our tents, accept defeat and go home? Three points leap out of this bleak analysis. First, the Democratic party is continuing to misread the American electorate. The biggest issue in this election was always going to be “the economy, stupid”, after the ravages of inflation over the past four years. Yet they never had a coherent, convincing plan, and Harris was never able to escape from the shadow of the Biden record. Instead they led with issues like reproductive rights, seemingly oblivious to the damage this was doing to their standing in the once-loyally Democratic but also socially conservative Hispanic community, which in the event went massively for Trump: 14 points up on his 2020 result. There are lessons here for centrist parties across Europe: focus on the concerns of the broad mass of the electorate, not the issues that energise your base: in short, stop talking to yourself. Second, we are likely to shortly face some pivotal decisions about whether we side with Europe or an isolationist and protectionist US. And on these two issues our beliefs and values point towards Europe. In this context, the government’s painfully slow and minimalist approach towards the UK/EU reset isn’t good enough. We need the UK/EU security pact soon, so that we have the structures and processes in place with which to manage the issues coming down the road. And we need stronger bilateral partnerships with France and Germany, notwithstanding the current political mess in the latter. And third, the government needs to brace itself for the inevitable storms ahead. Back in November 2017, out of a clear blue Washington sky, Trump retweeted some Islamophobic videos by a far-right group called Britain First, ambushing Theresa May on an African tour. Pressed by the British media to comment, she said that the president “had been wrong to do this”. Trump initially responded angrily, saying May should concentrate on fighting “radical Islamic terror” in Britain, but he later, in an interview with Piers Morgan, retracted and half apologised. And though they were never soulmates, in subsequent encounters there was an undercurrent of respect from Trump. The lesson: sucking up is seen as weakness, straight talking may initially prompt a sharp response, but ultimately wins some respect. In which context, the storm clouds are already gathering on one headline issue. Since his election success, Trump has reaffirmed his intention, as his first priority, to deport 10 million illegal migrants. Imagine how this is going to look: the midnight knocks on doors, the children torn from schools, the deportation camps, the legal challenges, the fraught negotiations with the countries to which they will be returned. The 2018 “children in cages” story went global: this will be bigger. And imagine the interventions in prime minister’s questions, not from Kemi Badenoch, but from Keir Starmer’s own backbenchers: does the prime minister condemn these inhuman policies? Not easy. Kim Darroch was British ambassador to the US between 2016 and 2019"

          "bodyText": "For anyone who has recently spent their morning commute nestled under a stranger’s armpit, it may come as a surprise to hear that passenger numbers on public transport have not returned to pre-Covid levels. What Transport for London calls “ridership” has remained stubbornly stuck at about 90% of the levels seen before the pandemic. A similar picture prevails for light rail and tram systems across the rest of England, as a result of fewer people travelling daily to and from their workplaces. More than four and a half years after the first Covid lockdowns kept workers in the UK and other western nations at home, the story told by transport companies appears to reflect how the world of office-based work has changed – it seems for good. However, the end of the school summer holidays brought a flurry of announcements from large employers, which have begun to summon staff back to their desks. Last week, supermarket chain Asda became the latest to toughen up its office attendance requirements, making it compulsory for thousands of workers at its offices in Leeds and Leicester to spend at least three days a week at their desks from January. The retailer, which has been struggling with falling sales, announced the change along with job cuts and a restructuring, saying the return to office working would bring it “in line with our competitors and the wider market, allowing us to build high-performing teams with a collaborative culture and respond to what our business needs the most”. Speaking to the Observer, Asda’s retail-veteran chair, Stuart Rose, who is currently running the supermarket, went beyond the company’s official line. Lord Rose, who used to run Marks &amp; Spencer and Topshop, said having large numbers of staff based at home was “not a satisfactory way of working, particularly in an industry which is a fast-moving consumer goods industry. “It’s not always as efficient with those teams working together in terms of online, in terms of Zoom calls,” he said. Rose added that in his personal view, demand for hybrid working had swung too far in the workers’ favour. “Hybrid working wasn’t invented in the pandemic,” he said. “It has to fit the business’s needs.” As a sweetener for those based at its Leeds headquarters, Asda has promised to “improve the working environment” with “a better catering offer, an on-site Asda Express, a more welcoming atrium, more meeting spaces, quiet-space working pods, upgraded toilets, new chairs and redecoration”. Asda’s shopfloor and warehouse staff, meanwhile – like many others in service jobs – have not had the luxury of doing their work from dining tables or home offices. But those who are able to carry out their roles remotely have, in recent years, begun to regard flexibility over where they work as a right rather than a perk, and may feel that it will take more than an office refresh for them to give that up. The latest back-to-office mandates are just the latest skirmishes in the post-Covid clash between employers – keen to pack out their workplaces again – and their staff. The new world of work pits employees – who have grown accustomed to the flexibility of spending at least some of the working week at home or in another remote location, with the accompanying perceived improvement to their work-life balance – against organisations, which extol the benefits of the creative collaboration fostered by bringing teams together in their expensive office spaces. Among the strictest back-to-office mandates so far has come from online retailer Amazon. Its chief executive, Andy Jassy, announced in September that it was summoning its workers back to the office five days a week from the new year. Jassy said the previous requirement for three days a week in the workplace had only “strengthened our conviction about the benefits” of being in the office. The response to the change has been “mixed”, conceded Jennifer Salke, the global head of Amazon MGM Studios in a recent interview with the Observer, although she described this as simply a return to pre-Covid ways of working. “We want people to feel connected to a team,” Salke said. While Amazon is among the few organisations calling for full-time office attendance, its stance highlights how the balance of power appears to be swinging back towards employers. This shift comes despite warnings from some economists, including Stanford University professor Nicholas Bloom, that forcing employees back to the office could prompt some of the most talented to pursue better opportunities elsewhere, potentially leaving companies with a workforce most suited to heavy office attendance, which “skews slightly younger, male, [with] less diversity and disability”. Ever since the pandemic, the financial sector has been among the most keen to get staff back to their desks. Spanish-owned bank Santander has now told its 10,000-strong UK workforce that they will be expected to be in the office for at least 12 days a month from January, as opposed to the previous, less formal, requirement of between two and three days a week. Accountant PwC has warned it will clamp down on remote working, while its rival Deloitte has said it would no longer conduct remote interviews for graduates. The public sector is not exempt from the back-to-office trend either. In recent days, the government has reaffirmed previous office-attendance guidance, requiring most of the UK’s 500,000 civil servants to spend at least 60% of their time (or three days a week) in a government building or on official business – an approach described by the Cabinet Office as “comparable to other large private and public sector employers”. Employers of all kinds may be starting to firm up post-pandemic workplace rules, especially if they are finding the economic environment more challenging. Yet this may pose its own challenges when trying to recruit top talent, or graduates just starting their careers. Almost half (49%) of UK graduates said they would not apply for a job that did not offer hybrid working, according to a survey by flexible workspace provider International Workplace Group (IWG), while a further 18% said they would need to seriously consider such a role. Hybrid working was also considered as important as a competitive salary by more than half (54%) of the 1,000 graduates or final-year university students surveyed by IWG, many of whom view it as equivalent to a 13% increase in salary, because of savings made on travel and housing. The aversion to commuting – both for its cost and duration – could likewise play a significant role in putting workers off spending more time in city centre offices. The flexibility offered to new recruits and graduate trainees may differ from that permitted for existing staff who have office-based employment contracts. While the issue of forcing staff to return to the office has rarely been put to the legal test, a case earlier this year resulted in the courts finding in favour of the employer. A judge ruled that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was within its rights to refuse the request of a senior manager to work from home full-time, saying the organisation was “right to identify weaknesses with remote working”. Elizabeth Wilson, who had worked entirely from home since the start of the pandemic, took her case to an employment tribunal after the FCA turned down her flexible working request. The battle between employers and staff over where they work may only just be getting started."

          "bodyText": "You certainly don’t need to spend a fortune to have a fun and romantic time, whether it’s your first date or the 101st. There are lots of things you can do that are either free or won’t break the bank. 1. Take the plunge The benefits of cold water swimming have been well-documented, with evidence that it boosts everything from immunity to mental health. Advocates also suggest that the shared sense of euphoria you get once you re-emerge can help foster new connections and create a bond. Warm up afterwards by surprising your date with a flask of hot chocolate. Remember: if you’re going wild swimming rather than heading to your local pool or lido, check The Rivers Trust sewage map or the Surfers Against Sewage website and app. Nothing kills an amorous mood quicker than a floating turd … 2. Have a winter picnic Embrace the Norwegian concept of friluftsliv (“free-air life”) and dine outside regardless of the weather. Bundle up in your best “gorpcore” attire (where outdoor gear is incorporated into everyday fashion) and head to your nearest picnic spot - your local park is fine. Bring a flask of homemade soup and warm savoury pastries, and a blanket to snuggle under. 3. Head to a pier Watching the sunset from a seaside pier is always romantic. And even better on a cold winter’s day while sharing a box of hot, salty chips. There are about 55 piers in the UK, most of which were built by the Victorians, so you can admire pretty ironwork detailing and ornate pavilions. At 155 years old, Clevedon in Somerset is Britain’s only Grade I-listed surviving pier and overlooks the Severn estuary. In Norfolk, Cromer’s pier opened in 1901, while Bangor Pier in Wales, which first opened in 1886, boasts vintage penny slot machines. One pound buys five old penny tokens – enough to give you ample turns to hook a duck. 4. Go ‘leaf peeping’ Admire the seasonal colour changes of foliage as you take a long walk. If you want to venture further than your local green space, websites such as Walking in England and Ordnance Survey have plenty of suggestions for free routes. Download the Woodland Trust’s free tree identification app to help distinguish your crack willow from your white willow, and a birdsong app such as Warblr for some competitive sound-spotting. 5. Swoon over art For centuries, artists have been creating paintings, sculptures and drawings to try to capture the complexity of love. You can visit some of the most romantic, erotic and heartbreaking artworks for free. Swoon in front of John Gibson’s marble sculpture depicting Cupid and Psyche at London’s Royal Academy, or feel all the feels as you stand in front of Rossetti’s Dante’s Dream that imagines him beside the deathbed of his unrequited love at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. 6. Upgrade your TV night Turn a TV binge into an at-home spa session by picking up a couple of sheet face masks for cheap online or at your local pharmacy. Let them sink in as you enjoy a homemade cocktail such as a picante, which requires just three ingredients: tequila, coriander and chilli. Tie a ribbon around the stem of the glass to feel like you’re sitting in a fancy bar rather than lounging on your sofa. 7. Visit a historic site History is hot. Just think of all those passionate Viking courtships and illicit affairs during the Age of Enlightenment. English Heritage’s website has a list of historical sites that are free to explore, including the standing stones at Avebury, an 18th-century English baroque country house on the Isle of Wight, and lots of castles and abbeys. 8. Check out a cemetery A wander around a cemetery is definitely going to be more memorable than your standard dinner and drinks. Although on paper it might sound a little morbid, where else is better to prompt a deep discussion of the big things like life and death? Sure, you’ve got famous burial grounds such as London’s Highgate cemetery where Karl Marx and Catherine Dickens lie (adult tickets cost £10), but a free visit to your local graveyard could prove just as fruitful for inspiring conversation. From unmarked headstones to declarations of devotion, prepare to go deep. 9. Free lectures It may not sound very sexy, but a heated political debate or energising sociological discussion could add some much-needed stimulation to a long-term relationship or, for those in the early days of dating, help suss out if your values align. The British Academy runs a series of free lectures delivered by academics around the country. Or check out your nearest university, as it is likely to run events, some of which may be free to attend."

          "headline": "Trump’s trade tariffs: how protectionist US policies will hit German carmakers",
          "bodyText": "In 1964 the new US president was angry about European trade. Specifically about chickens. In response to Europe’s poultry trade barriers, Lyndon B Johnson imposed a 25% tariff on light trucks. That “chicken tax” is still in place 60 years later. The rules have contributed to the Ford’s F-Series pickup truck’s unbroken 42-year run as the bestselling vehicle in the US, and have locked European manufacturers out of a hugely profitable market for two generations. The chicken tax could also serve as a model for Donald Trump’s second term in the White House. The US president-elect’s promise of imposing baseline tariffs of 10% on all goods imports has already sent shivers around the world’s manufacturers. Few industries are more exposed than Germany’s carmakers: the share prices of Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche have dropped by between 4% and 7% since it became clear on Wednesday morning that Trump would win the US presidency. Tariffs are applied on the cost of goods when imported. If a 10% tariff were then passed on to American buyers, Audi’s US bestseller, the Q5 SUV, would cost about $3,500 extra on top of its $45,400 starting price. But just when German industry needs a strong advocate, its government has fallen into turmoil. The coalition led by the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, collapsed on Wednesday after three years in power, casting doubt over who will lead Europe’s largest economy as the EU prepares for trade negotiations with Trump. Trump’s love of tariffs is no secret. He recently told Bloomberg: “To me the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.” And he has been categorical about his intentions to slap tariffs on EU imports. “They don’t take our cars, they don’t take our farm products, don’t take anything. You have a $312bn deficit with the EU. You know, the EU is a mini – but not so mini – is a mini-China,” Trump said during his campaign. The German car industry would immediately be affected by tariffs, compounding an already dire situation for the likes of VW which is wrestling with deep cost cuts. The US is VW’s second largest export market after China; the group sold 713,000 vehicles in the US in 2023 of which 243,000 were manufactured in Germany, primarily premium and luxury vehicles. Hildegard Müller, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), said the US remained “very important for Germany as a production location”. However, she noted that the US “has been increasingly focusing on its own interests for several years now, and this trend will probably continue”. Müller called on Berlin and Brussels to “build on their joint strengths with the US in economic policy” to create prosperity between allies on both sides of the Atlantic. In the same way as China has begun investing in Europe – particularly in Hungary – Germany has been investing in the US as it became more protectionist under Trump 1.0 and Joe Biden. Last year a record 908,000 German-branded vehicles were manufactured in the US, half of which were exported. Carmakers’ responses to tariffs will depend to a certain extent on their factory footprints. The BMW chief executive, Oliver Zipse, shrugged off the tariff threat on Wednesday. “In the United States, I would think we almost have a perfect setup for the time to come,” he said, arguing that BMW already made its most popular US-market cars there. “There is some natural cover up against possible tariffs or whatever.” Yet the German car manufacturers’ existing factories in the US do not appear to have readily available spare capacity to simply absorb production shifted from Germany to avoid tariffs. Volkswagen had capacity for another 20,000 cars on top of the 160,000 produced last year at its sole US car plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, according to the automotive data company MarkLines. Mercedes-Benz has about the same spare capacity in Alabama, where it made 280,000 cars in 2023. BMW might be able to produce another 40,000 in South Carolina on top of last year’s production level of 410,000. Even if carmakers can shift production to the US – to the likely delight of Trump – it would horrify many Germans. About 780,000 people are employed in the politically powerful German automotive industry. They will not let work move abroad without a fight. “It will lead to shifts in production,” said Rico Luman, an economist at ING, an investment bank. “It may get more regionalised also from a strategic point of view. That’s not good news for the sector in Germany.” The tariff threat could hardly come at a worse time for German workers, with manufacturers across the world complaining of falling profits, and Europe dealing with a flood of electric vehicles from China. Volkswagen – already planning to close German factories for the first time ever – is particularly vulnerable. Its Audi and Porsche subsidiaries have big US sales but no factories there, and VW imports thousands of its smaller, cheaper cars from Germany. Morningstar DBRS, a credit rating agency, said starting more American production was “a transition that would likely be costly and take years to become operational”. Trump’s victory has therefore rattled German trade unions. IG Metall, which will play a key role in the VW negotiations, said the US election was “a clear message to Germany and Europe to further develop their own strengths, resilient relationships with each other and with other countries”. The union said Germany’s government needed to invest to strengthen industry – a distant prospect, with its own election likely in March. It is not just German carmakers who will be watching Trump nervously, with a threat of 100% tariffs on imports to the US from its free-trade partner Mexico. The three big carmakers in Detroit are General Motors, Ford and the Chrysler owner Stellantis (which also imports cars from European brands such as Peugeot and Fiat). Together they produced 1.6m cars between them last year in Mexico, according to MarkLines. Europe’s manufacturers made 800,000 in Mexico, while Asian companies produced 1.4m. “Everybody hates taxes and tariffs,” said Adrian Mardell, the chief executive of JLR, which owns the Jaguar, Land Rover and Range Rover brands. Britain’s largest automotive employer exports a quarter of its output to the US. “This is the environment we are in. Of course all of us would dislike an environment where we go into larger tariffs.” There have already been indications from countries outside Europe that Trump’s tariffs could achieve the most obvious goal: wresting back jobs from abroad. South Korea’s trade minister said on Wednesday he expected companies from his country to invest more in the US if Trump imposed higher tariffs. A person close to Toyota said steep tariffs by Trump on Mexican imports could prompt the automaker to move production of a vehicle like the Tacoma pickup to San Antonio, Texas. A Toyota spokesperson declined to comment. Trump has other ideas to help the American car industry. He has said he planned to begin rescinding Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department rules that force companies to lower their average emissions – on his first day in office. He is considering removing tax breaks for US-made electric vehicles, a bête noire for him despite his friendship with Elon Musk, the chief executive of America’s dominant electric carmaker, Tesla. Those plans are supposed to help Detroit’s big three. However, analysts led by Chris McNally at Evercore ISI, an investment bank, said the changes would cost General Motors $3bn and Ford up to $1bn in lost subsidies. There is a consistent irony in Trump’s automotive proposals: while carmakers in Europe will suffer under tariffs, and rivals in China are already essentially locked out of the US market, American businesses will also face steep costs, and consumers are likely to see increased prices. That has been the effect of the chicken tax. Europe’s carmakers may have been locked out to the benefit of US workers, but Americans have paid more for their pickup trucks. • This article was amended on 9 November 2024 to clarify the VW export figures to the US. Also, tariffs are applied on the landed cost of goods at ports, rather than the retail price, so a 10% tariff on Audi’s US bestseller, the Q5 SUV, would cost an extra $3,500, not $4,500 as stated in an earlier version."

          "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, here’s today’s main stories: The London stock market has closed for the evening, with the FTSE 100 down 68 points of 0.85% at 8072, its lowest closing level in three months. Oil is ending the week with losses; Brent crude has dropped by 2.5% today to $73.68 per barrel. Fears of disruption from Hurricane Rafael are a factor. Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com, cites disappointment about the scale of the latest rescue package from China, this time focused on local government debt. The renewed decline in oil prices comes as hopes fade over the possibility of providing more support packages for the Chinese economy, which reinforces concerns about the future of demand for crude from its largest importers. The declines also come amid concerns about the effects of Trump’s policies that could weaken the Chinese economy and deepen those concerns. The Standing Committee of the Chinese Legislative Council, after its meeting that lasted throughout the working days this week, approved a package equivalent to $1.4 trillion as part of a debt swap program. However, the disappointment comes with the lack of disclosure of financial measures to support the economy directly, and the debt swap measures will only push the maturity dates of the debts forward, according to what was reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing economists. Adding to these disappointments, concerns about China’s economic recovery could intensify if Donald Trump returns to the White House next year. It didn’t do Kamala Harris much good, of course, but apparently US consumer confidence rose at the start of this month. The index of consumer sentiment producer by the University of Michigan, and just released, has risen to 73.0 this month, up from 70.5 in October. Inflation expectations dipped, to the lowest since December 2020, with people anticipating inflation would be 2.6% in a year’s time, down from 2.7% last month. Surveys of Consumers director Joanne Hsu explains: Heading into the election, consumer sentiment improved for the fourth consecutive month, rising 3.5% to its highest reading in six months. While current conditions were little changed, the expectations index surged across all dimensions, reaching its highest reading since July 2021. World food prices rose last month to their highest level since April 2023, driven by an increase in the cost of vegetable oils. The United Nations’ world food price index, which tracks the price changes in various edible commodities, increased by 2% in October to to 127.4 points last month from a revised 124.9 points in September. The report found that the prices of all food categories rose, apart from meat. The Vegetable Oil Price Index jumped by 7%, with prices reaching a two-year high, due to higher costs for palm, soy, sunflower and rapeseed oils. Dairy prices rose 1.9%, which the UN attributes to pricier cheese and butter prices, and seasonally low milk production in Western Europe. Cereal prices rose by 0.8% in the month, with costs pushed up by “concerns over unfavourable weather conditions affecting winter crop sowing in several major northern hemisphere exporters” The UN adds: Additionally, the re-introduction of an unofficial price floor in the Russian Federation and rising tensions in the Black Sea region exerted upward pressure on prices. The US stock market has hit fresh record highs at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 index have both hit record intraday peaks. The S&amp;P 500 is up 7.7 points or 0.13% at 5,980, putting the 6,000-point mark in sight for the first time. Investors still seem upbeat about US stocks following Donald Trump’s election win, anticipating deregulation and tax cuts… Veteran investor Carl Icahn says he’s not seen such an unbalanced stock market many times before. Presenting Icahn Enterprises’ third-quarter results today, Icahn says: “I strongly believe that our portfolio – both for the investment segment and the controlled businesses – has significant opportunities ahead. Rarely have I seen a stock market with such extreme valuations – with some companies trading at unjustifiable premiums and others being massively undervalued. These undervalued situations have created great opportunities for activists. To take advantage of these opportunities when they occur, we have always maintained a war chest of liquidity. That “war chest” is currently made up of $2.3bn of cash and cash equivalents. But Icahn is using some of it to extend his stake in oil refinery business CVR Energy. He’s also halving the dividend paid to investors in Icahn Enterprises, from $1.00 per depositary unit to $0.50, to help fund the CVR deal and keep that warchest stocked… Meanwhile in Canada….. fewer jobs were created last month than expected. The northerly G7 member added around 15,000 new jobs in October, fewer than the 25,000 which economists expected. Canada’s employment rate fell 0.1 percentage points to 60.6% and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.5%. Employment rose by 25,000 (+1.8%) in October among male youth aged 15 to 24, while it fell among women aged 55 and older (-15,000; -0.8%), Statistics Canada reports. Notably, the labour force participation rate – which measures the proportion of people either in work or looking for a job – dipped for the fourth month running. Yesterday, the Bank of England showed that it expects Rachel Reeves’s budget to add almost half a percentage point to inflation at its peak in just over two years’ time. That’s due to measures such as the addition of VAT to private school fees and the £1 increase in the bus fare cap to £3, plus the assumption that the long-running fuel duty-freeze will end (although Reeves extended it last week). Today, the central bank’s chief economist says it must look beyond the temporary inflation boost from last week’s budget. Huw Pill has explained that it’s important to focus on anything that might add to longer-term price pressures. In a briefing to businesses, Pill says: “To a large extent, we will have to look through and interpret [the measures in the budget] in a way that allows us to have a good sight of these underlying and more persistent components of inflation that really have to be the focus of what’s driving our policy decisions.” Richard Molyneaux, JLR’s finance chief, also called for changes to the UK’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which threatens fines if carmakers do not sell an increasing proportion of electric cars each year. He said that while “everyone is aligned to the destination” of shifting to electric cars, weaker growth in electric demand should prompt the UK to re-examine the ZEV mandate. He said: It’s clear that it’s going less quickly than hoped. The details of the ZEV mandate, they probably do need to adjust to reflect this reality. He said the government should shift from “penalisation” through fines towards incentives to make it more attractive for carmakers to make the move. The boss of Land Rover manufacturer JLR has said the company is opposed to tariffs, after Donald Trump won the US presidency for the second time promising levies on all goods imports. Adrian Mardell, JLR’s chief executive, said that the company would be “resilient” if tariffs were increased, although he added that he was hopeful that future policy “isn’t quite what it’s being said today”. The British carmaker, which is owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, exported 95,000 cars to the US in the year to March, more than a quarter of all the cars it produced. Those exports would face a 10% tariff if Trump follows through on a repeated pledge to impose a “baseline tariff” on all goods. Mardell expressed his objection to increased taxes on business during the UK budget, as well as the prospect of “potentially even more significant” changes ahead in response to a question about Trump. Speaking as JLR unveiled a profitable quarter to September (see earlier post), he said: Everybody hates taxes and tariffs. This is the environment we are in. Of course all of us would dislike an environment where we go into larger tariffs. The company said it was too early to say whether it would raise prices or seek to start producing vehicles within the US if tariffs were imposed. Shares in UK retailers have dropped this morning, as they continue to count the cost of last week’s budget. Marks &amp; Spencer (-4.5%), JD Sports (-2.7%) and Tesco (-2.5%) are all among the fallers on the FTSE 100 today, pulling it down to a three-month low. On the smaller FTSE 250 index, bakery chain Greggs (-6.8%) and pub group Mitchells &amp; Butler (-6.7%) are also weakening. Companies across the economy have been adding up the cost of Rachel Reeves’s decision to lower the earnings threshold at which employers start paying national insurance contributions from £9,100 to £5,000, and increase the rate from 13.8% to 15.0%. M&amp;S said it faced a £60m bill, while Sainsbury’s is facing a £140m cost. It’s not just retailers, of course; BT said the measures in the budget would cost it £100m. while Serco flagged a £20m bill this morning. And supermarket chain Asda has just warned that it also faces a £100m bill from tax changes in last week’s Budget, which could lead to higher prices. As the Bank of England explained yesterday, there are four ways that companies can deal with the increase in NICS contributions. They could raise prices, they could swallow the cost through lower profits or becoming more efficient, they could raise wages by less than otherwise, or they could cut staff. Asda’s chairman Lord Stuart Rose has called the increase in employer taxes is “a big burden for business to carry”. Rose says it is likely to lead to higher prices in the shops: “We are a very efficient industry, as retailers. We will do everything we can to mitigate this cost. “But of course, you can’t deny it will probably be inflationary to some degree. We’re just working through the details of that now… We’re looking at the impact.” Prison contractor Serco is also among the stock market fallers, after being hit by a double-whammy of bad news. Serco told shareholders this morning that it had failed to retain a key contract with the Australian Government’s Department of Home Affairs to provide onshore immigration detention facilities and services for detainees held there. Ths contract will run out on 10 December. Had Serco won it again, it would have bene worth £165m of revenue in 2025 and £18m of underlying operating profit. Serco also reported that the UK government’s changes to employer national insurance contributions will cost it around £20m per year. Shares are down 10%, at the bottom of the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies. Britain’s stock market has dropped to its lowest level since the market wobble this summer. The blue-chip FTSE 100 share index is down 72 points today, or -0.9%, at 8068 points. That’s the lowest since 8th August, and the index’s fourth daily fall in a row. Miners are still among the top fallers, reflecting concerns that China’s latest stimulus measure isn’t beefier. Housebuilder Vistry is now down almost 20% after it issued a second profit warning in as many months and said cost overruns on building projects were worse than previously thought. UK supermarket chains Tesco (-2.9%) and Sainsbury’s (-2.5%) are also among the fallers; yesterday, Sainsbury’s warned that it will face a £140m bill from changes to employer national insurance contributions [NICs]. Land Rover maker JLR has reported a 10% year-on-year drop in quarterly profits after shortages of aluminium held back production. Sales dropped by 6% to £6.5bn in the quarter ending in September compared with a year earlier, while profit before tax - excluding some one-off items - was £398m, the company said today. Despite the supply chain difficulties, it marked two years of profits for Britain’s largest automotive employer, which has undergone a turnaround programme to try to earn more money from each car it makes. Those efforts appear to have paid off as JLR has avoided the steep fall in profits experienced by several manufacturing rivals. Stellantis and Nissan this week announced thousands of job losses, but JLR said that it was continuing with a £500m investment in upgrading its factory at Halewood, Merseyside. The company said the aluminium shortage was only temporary, and that it still expected to make revenues of £30bn this year. Adrian Mardell, JLR’s chief executive, said the company was still seeing “strong global demand for our products”. JLR has been slower than rivals to switch to electric production, which could make it difficult to meet emissions targets, but has meant it is much less exposed to slowing growth in demand for electric cars. Mardell said: JLR has delivered a resilient performance in [the second financial quarter], resulting in a 25% increase in first half profits year-on-year. Our teams responded brilliantly to the aluminium supply shortages we experienced in the quarter, so we could deliver as many orders as possible to clients. Back in the UK, the government has been told it could offer its own low-cost baby formula under a brand such as the NHS to combat the high prices and lack of choice in the market. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said another “backstop” measure could be for the government to regulate and set a price or profit-margin cap on retailers as a way to bring prices down for parents more quickly. The potential measures formed part of the CMA’s interim report on the infant formula market after the watchdog identified that a lack of competition in the market had led to soaring prices, taking advantage of an ingrained belief among parents that higher cost equates to better quality for their children. The CMA report set out a number of potential recommendations including extending the ban on the advertising of infant formula to follow-on formula, or going as far as “prohibiting all brand-related advertising”. We’ve had a lot of stimulus moves from China in recent weeks, culminating with today’s £1tn plan to bail out local governments... which Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says is a disappointment. Brooks says: The bulk of the stimulus is linked to local government. Beijing has agreed to raise the debt ceiling from local governments to 35.5 trillion yuan, which will allow them to swap ‘hidden debt’ to the tune of 6 trillion yuan. There is also another 4 trillion yuan of special 5-year bonds that will be available to local government. The news has fallen flat with financial markets. Chinese stocks are lower, the CSI 300 is down more than 1%, and European stocks are lower across the board. The S&amp;P 500 is expected to open above the key 6,000 level, which is a further sign of American exceptionalism and the US’s immunity to the rest of the world’s woes. There is a risk off tone to markets today, bond yields are lower across the board and oil and some industrial metals are also lower today. The problem with China’s stimulus measures is that they are not stimulus. They are essentially a debt swap to shore up local government’s finances. The market reaction shows that traders do not see these measures as boosting consumption, and instead they are designed to stop a financial crisis domestically in China. The Chinese Ministry of Finance’s announcement today of 10 trillion yuan of new measures to alleviate local government debt issues (see earlier post) is a “decisive move to address local government debt woes”, says Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING. Song says the plan will free up local governments to drive “forceful” fiscal policy for Beijing: Other than the obvious impact of addressing short-term debt risks, arguably the most important aspect is that it will free up local governments to once again implement stimulus measures where appropriate and necessary. These measures will likely take time to roll out, but today’s moves at least set the foundation for further fiscal stimulus rollout. Indeed, the press conference also signalled that China would be implementing a more “forceful fiscal policy” next year. Though it was not explicitly addressed, it is likely that local governments and SOEs will play a large role in the moves to stabilise the property market in the future. We anticipate there will be direct acquisitions of unsold homes to coordinate with the earlier PBOC [central bank] policies to expand the re-lending programme to banks. Mining companies listed in London, who are sensitive to China’s growth prospects, are among the fallers on the stock market this morning. Copper producer Antofagasta are down almost 5%, followed by Rio Tinto (-3.9%) and Anglo American (-3.6%). AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says: “After a hectic week investors had more to digest in the form of further Chinese stimulus but what has been announced so far doesn’t seem to be moving the needle and the risks to China from a second Trump presidency are now overshadowing efforts to get the economy moving. The question on investors’ lips will be whether this encourages Beijing to unveil a bolder package of measures. “Asian stocks sputtered overnight and the UK-listed miners who are reliant on China for much of their demand were also on the back foot. Yesterday’s cut to UK interest rates doesn’t seem to have yet filtered through to borrowers. Data provider Moneyfacts reports that the average rate on two-year loans is unchanged this morning, while the five-year equivalent is slightly higher: The average 2-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.42%. This is unchanged from the previous working day. The average 5-year fixed residential mortgage rate today is 5.14%. This is up from 5.13% the previous working day. China’s currency, the renmimbi, weakened after Beijing announced its new 10 trillion yuan package to refinance local government debt. The renmimbi is down 0.3% at 7.168 to the US dollar. That may suggest that this morning’s announcement is seen as underwhelming; though there’s no suggestion that this is the end of Beijing’s efforts…. On Wednesday, after the US election, the renmimbi tumbled from 7.09 to 7.21, before recovering a little. Back in China, a 10 trillion yuan (£1trn) program to refinance local government debt has been reportedly rolled out. It’s a sign that Beijing is taking steps to support its economy, before Donald Trump takes office. According to the Xinhua News Agency, Chinese lawmakers have approved a State Council bill to raise the ceiling on local government debt by 6 trillion yuan (about £650bn). This will allow local officials to swap hidden debt for newly issued bonds. Local governments will also be able to tap another 4 trillion yuan (£430bn) set aside for new special local bonds for the same purpose. The move could cut systemic risks in the Chinese economy. Finance minister Lan Fo’an told a briefing the plan was: A major policy decision taking into consideration international and domestic development environments, the need to ensure the stable economic and fiscal operation, and the actual development situation of local governments. At the other end of the FTSE 100, housebuilder Vistry have tumbled 15% after its build cost crisis deepened. Vistry told shareholders this morning that the review into cost errors at its South Division shows the problem is worse than expected. Vistry has added £50m to its total estimate of the impact to its profits over the next three years, taking the total to £165m. Its review into the problems shows that “insufficient management capability, non-compliant commercial forecasting processes and poor divisional culture” led to the company’s staff messing up costings. In the City, shares in British Airways’ parent company have jumped over 7% after it reported strong results this morning. IAG are leading the FTSE 100 risers after posting a 7.9% increase in revenue in the third quarter of the year, with operating profits up 15.4% to just over €2bn. Luis Gallego, IAG Chief Executive Officer, says: “We achieved a very strong financial performance in Q3 2024, with a 15.4% increase in operating profit compared to the same period last year and improving our margin to 21.6%. This is due to the effectiveness of our strategy and Group-wide transformation. “We are also delivering on our commitment to provide sustainable returns for shareholders. “Demand remains strong across our airlines and we expect a good final quarter of 2024 financially.” Investors have also been digesting the consequences of a second Trump term. The discussion around what trades work best with a Trump administration centers on three points, Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY, told clients: Tax cuts = higher deficits. Trump policy shifts from the current government will revolve around taxes – expected to be lower thereby increasing the government deficits and borrowing needs. Tariffs = inflation. Investors also fear the role of tariffs as they are expected to disrupt global trade and supply chains as they did in 2016-2020 with risk of inflation and less investment. Deregulation = more lending. The markets also see Trump pushing for less regulation by government – leading to easier lending as capital requirements drop, along with more pressure on the FOMC to ease. Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey is concerned that new tariffs could cause a ‘fracturing of the world economy’. Speaking to LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr yesterday, after cutting UK interest rates, Bailey explained that growth would suffer: ‘What I would call fragmentation of the world economy, the world economy sort of breaking up is not a good thing, it’s a bad thing… Tariffs is one of the things that can cause that sort of fracturing of the world economy… Open trade really stimulates growth. Adam Smith taught us this, open trade is good for growth. Now, there are risks attached to it, and we have seen those risks, so there are obviously risks. We saw it with the impact of the Ukraine War, that if you’re overly dependent on one part of the world for something, obviously, if it gets disrupted, that can have a bad effect. So, diversification, spreading your sources of things, and trade is sensible and good. But if the world becomes more closed the cost of trade goes up – protectionism, that’s not a good thing.’ Wang Dong, a professor of international relations at Peking University, has warned that “Trump 2.0 is likely to be more destructive than the 2017 version.” In a pre-election interview with Chinese media, Wang said: “Compared with his first term in office in 2017, Trump’s views in his second campaign in 2024 have not changed much, but the domestic situation and international environment have changed dramatically … during the Trump 2.0 period, China and the United States are likely to have constant friction and conflict”. Here’s our new analysis of how China is preparing for the return of Donald Trump: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Two days after the US election result, countries around the world are digesting what impact Trump 2.0 will have on their economies – especially if the president-elect kicks off a trade war. China would obviously be in the firing line, given Donald Trump’s suggestion he could slap a 60% tariff on Chinese imports at the US border. And with that in mind, presumably, China’s ambassador to the United States has warned that there are no winners in tariff or trade wars. Ambassador Xie Feng also warned against wars over science, technology or industry, in a speech at a U.S.-China Business Council dinner on Thursday seen by Reuters. Xie encouraged U.S. companies to invest and operate in China, and said he was looking forward to strengthening dialogue and cooperation on global challenges such as climate change and artificial intelligence. Striking a concilliatory pose, Xie argued for the merits of partnership: “China and the United States can achieve many great and good things through cooperation, and the list of cooperation should be stretched longer and longer.” “The more success stories of mutually beneficial cooperation, the better.” “Cooperation”, though, wasn’t top of the agenda during Trump 1.0; in 2018, Washington imposed trade sanctions on China, including restrictions on investment and tariffs, prompting tit-for-tat retaliation from Beijing. This time round, China’s president Xi is presiding over a far worse domestic economy; if Trump imposes new tariffs, analysts reckon it could affect $500bn worth of Chinese goods. ING’s global head of macro, Carsten Brzeski, predicts that the Trump administration will initally focus on domestic policy, including immigration and extending/expanding tax cuts, before turning to trade issues…. Brzeski told clients: We think the earliest timing for tariffs to be implemented is the third quarter of 2025. China would likely be impacted first, with a gradual series of tariffs introduced on different products from other countries coming in later. Tariffs would be a blow for US consumers – already reeling from the global spike in inflation in 2022 and 2023 – as they’ll be passed on by importers. Last night, America’s top central banker said the US economy was performing well, with stronger growth than other major economies, falling inflation and a solid jobs market. Jerome Powell also insisted he would not resign if Trump asked him to leave his role, following reports that some of the president-elect’s advisors would like Powell to resign. Asked it he would quit if asked by Trump, Powell responded with a blunt “no”. Powell also said the White House demoting Fed governors from their leadership roles is “not permitted under the law”.

          "bodyText": "It’s no exaggeration to say e-bikes are having an extended moment globally. In Australia, e-bikes now make up about 50% of total bike sales through retailers, according to Peter Bourke from Bicycle Industries Australia, with approximately 250,000 e-bikes sold in the past year. For many people, however, the upfront cost remains a barrier, with quality e-bike brands selling for anywhere between $5,000 and $10,000. But there is a way for you to join the ranks of those effortlessly sailing up hills for a fraction of that price. If done through a reputable store, converting your push bike into an e-bike can be as simple as adding a battery, engine, controller and enhanced components. What are the benefits of converting? Rev Bikes in Nunawading, in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, has been specialising in e-bike conversions for over a decade. According to the company’s founder, Rebecca Lee, most bikes can be converted for under $1,000 if you want to do it yourself, or about $1,300 to have it done for you. Lee says the key benefits of converting your old bike include value for money (especially if you already have a decent bike), the fact that you can customise the e-bike just how you like it, and that you will end up with a much lighter bike than many new e-bikes currently on the market. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email She says many people choose to get their bikes converted in-store rather than DIY because they usually don’t have the right tools to do it at home. Doing a dodgy job on the conversion can make the bike dangerous if inadequate brakes are left on the bike, or if the battery isn’t properly attached or is a poor-quality product. “Buying a kit from local sellers with years of experience, who can support the install and provide alternative parts if required, gives the peace of mind that the system will be reliable and safe,” says Lee. “Sellers who offer kit options prompt the enthusiast to consider which components they actually want or need for their specific bike. Clear instructions should be provided by sellers at a minimum, as well as detailed video guides – [these] are helpful because every bike is different, and they will often throw up unexpected challenges.” A dream come true For Dennis Moll, a longtime mountain bike rider who lives in Ballarat in Victoria, getting a new e-bike was cost prohibitive and would have meant selling one of his beloved bikes. “I’ve been riding mountain bikes for 21 years, but a little while ago I started thinking of getting an e-bike,” he says. “But all the e-bikes that I was considering buying were quite expensive.” Moll had no experience converting a conventional bike into an e-bike and didn’t even know if it could be done. “I already had a bike that I loved, so turning it into an e-bike was a dream come true,” he says. After doing some research, Moll decided to get his old mountain bike converted in store. He says the shop he chose did a great job and sent him photos throughout the process to ensure he was happy with the layout of the conversion. “Since I’ve received my new e-bike, I haven’t looked back,” he says. Considering a DIY conversion at home? Unless you are an experienced bike technician and have some of the tools and expertise to do so, it’s recommended to get professionals to convert your bike in store. However, for those wanting to attempt to do it yourself, there are plenty of Australian businesses that will post you the kit. The process varies depending on whether you get a mid drive or hub motor for your bike: mid drives require removing your pedals, cranks and bottom bracket to install the motor in their place, while hub motors involve the replacement of one of the wheels, tyres and tube, gear cassette (if rear wheel) and rotor for installing disc brakes. Both systems also require the addition of a few sensors, such as a pedelec (crank cadence sensor) for the hub motors and a speed sensor and gear shift cutout sensor for some of the mid drives. There are the display and other controls (such as brake cutouts and maybe a throttle) for the handlebars, and most importantly, the mounting of a battery somewhere on the frame (it depends on your bike, but most mount in the triangle, where your water bottle would normally go). Most reputable suppliers will provide detailed instructions and a video guide, but unless you have the right tools and expertise, you may find it simpler to let the mechanics in the store do the conversion for you – it will be worth the extra investment. Remember to take fire safety precautions E-bike conversions are far more likely to be involved in house fires than manufactured e-bikes. According to Fire and Rescue NSW, cheap, unprotected, and second-hand batteries used in DIY projects have led to severe fires causing significant loss. Like all E-bikes, exercise caution when charging. This includes charging in an open area like a garage away from exits, and not charging when you’re asleep or not at home. It’s also important to only use an approved charger that matches the battery. Beware dodgy e-bike conversions According to Bourke, there is something of a wild west scenario emerging, with dodgy e-bike conversions sometimes falling foul of the law. Under Australian law, e-bike motors must cut out when bikes reach 25km/h. New South Wales is implementing better regulations around e-bikes, including penalties for those exceeding speed limits and ensuring that batteries and electronic components meet the Australian standards. “The problem is that there are currently no national uniform regulations in place for e-bike conversion,” says Bourke. “We’d like to see national regulations to ensure a safe product for both riders and other road users.”"

          "bodyText": "West Ham will review Julen Lopetegui’s position if they lose at home to Everton on Saturday. Although the hope is that the manager will turn the situation around, he is under increasing pressure after a poor start and another setback would leave him hanging by a thread. There have been mixed signals over Lopetegui’s immediate future and the sense at the start of this week was that the Everton game was not viewed as make or break. David Sullivan, West Ham’s majority shareholder, has a history of sticking by his managers. But the club are hugely alarmed to be only six points above the bottom three after last weekend’s defeat by Nottingham Forest. At the minimum it is believed that losing again would prompt West Ham to use the international break to line up short- and long-term candidates to take over. A potential issue for West Ham is a lack of obvious replacements for Lopetegui, who has struggled to introduce his style of play since replacing David Moyes in the summer. They have previously been lukewarm on Graham Potter, the former Chelsea manager, and the level of their interest in the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic remains unclear. Terzic and Potter are out of work. West Ham, who overlooked Hansi Flick and Paulo Fonseca when they appointed Lopetegui, are believed to have made background checks on Sebastian Hoeness, Kasper Hjulmand and Roger Schmidt. Hoeness is regarded as an unrealistic target given that Stuttgart are in the Champions League. However the fact that internal analysis is being conducted is a sign that Lopetegui needs a win against Everton, who are two points behind West Ham. Focus has also fallen on the technical director, Tim Steidten, after West Ham’s transfer business. The club spent more than £100m on signings last summer but are yet to see a return on their investment. West Ham have struggled defensively and have been predictable in attack, and discipline has been a problem. Edson Álvarez, the Mexico midfielder, picked up his second red card of the season against Forest and Mohammed Kudus will be suspended until December after being hit with an extra two-match ban for his behaviour during last month’s 4-1 defeat by Tottenham. Kudus missed the Forest and Manchester United games after an initial three-match suspension but the winger, who was due to return after the visit from Everton, has been given an additional punishment and fined £60,000 for clashing with Micky van de Ven and Richarlison. Kudus will miss the trip to Newcastle on 25 November and the home game against Arsenal on 30 November and not be available until West Ham visit Leicester on 3 December. West Ham have been fined £30,000 for failing to control their players. Meanwhile Enzo Maresca has admitted Cole Palmer is a doubt for Chelsea’s game at home to Arsenal on Sunday. The attacking midfielder was hurt by a poor challenge from Lisandro Martínez during Chelsea’s draw with United and is yet to train this week."

          "bodyText": "What a day it’s been! We’re putting the live news blog to bed shortly but before we do, here’s what’s been keeping us busy – besides the monumental news coming from the US: The body of a boy, believed to be that of the 11-year-old who was swept out to sea on the New South Wales coast on Sunday, was found. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie disclosed 16 flight upgrades on Qantas and Virgin flights going back to 2015 – then apologised for “deficiencies in disclosing” those upgrades. The opposition responded to the high court’s striking down of ankle bracelets and curfews imposed on indefinite immigration detainees. The minister for home affairs then claimed the measures could be used after being adjusted. Josh Creamer, the chair of Queensland’s truth-telling and healing inquiry, spoke about the decision to put the process on “hold”. Labor said a “dangerous anti-abortion bill” should be withdrawn. As voting in the US was nearing a close, investors started to price in a second Donald Trump administration. On the subject of Trump, prime ministers Scott Morrison, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott all weighed in on his extremely likely win. And, Guardian Australia watched on as the mood plummeted at a US elections party in Sydney. Thank you, as ever, for joining us today. We’ll be back with the latest news bright and early tomorrow. Police officer seriously injured after being hit by allegedly stolen car in Melbourne Police used “stop sticks” after a stolen vehicle was seen on Aviation Drive in Diggers Rest at about 1.30pm. Police said the driver and his male passenger sped off in the car and hit a male senior constable, who was taken to hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Police said the vehicle was dumped at a shopping centre – understood to be Watergardens – in Taylors Lakes. The two men were arrested inside the shopping centre. The incident is being investigated. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Former prime minister Tony Abbott has congratulated Donald Trump on his now-extremely likely presidential win. Abbott said via X that self “belief is what the West needs right now”: Morrison says Trump ‘very positive’ about Aukus pact Circling back to Scott Morrison’s views on a second Donald Trump presidency. Speaking with the ABC a short while ago, the former prime minister said he was “very positive” about Aukus. I’ve never understood why people would doubt that [Trump] wouldn’t support it. It’s a good deal. He was very committed to the alliance. It’s very clear that the US interests are heavily aligned with resisting the PRC, taking over China, taking over Taiwan … All the other conflicts we’re seeing at the moment are just horrendous and awful, but in terms of their global implications, nothing compares with the fall of Taiwan to the PRC. I mean, the point of Aukus is to resist that aggression coming out of China, amongst many other things, and if you have that strong deterrent, then you don’t have to use it and but you have to be determined and clear about your willingness to put this in place. And weakness is not something that I’ve ever associated with Donald Trump. Speaking about former PMs as ambassadors to the US, Morrison said he had “no interest in taking on such a role”. Employment agencies paid irrespective of role in finding job seeker work Secretary of the department of employment and workplace relations Natalie James has said providers receive public funds “irrespective” of how much they’ve helped the jobseeker find work: We distinguish, and a participant would definitely distinguish, between when they feel like they’ve been helped to get the job and when they haven’t. Our outcomes payment system doesn’t. Our outcomes payment system makes the payment to the providers irrespective of the contributing factors to the job being secured. It’s always operated that way. Payment flows irrespective of the degree of assistance provided. Bridget McKenzie apologises for ‘deficiencies in disclosing’ flight upgrades Nationals senator has now apologised for failing to disclose 16 flight upgrades she received over the last nine years, including two that came just weeks before she recently claimed to have never received a single upgrade. After her earlier belated disclosure of 16 flight upgrades between 2015 and this August, the Nationals senator has now shared a personal statement to the media. “I have never sought free upgrades, which has been affirmed by the airlines to the extent of their records,” she said. Deficiencies in disclosing these matters do not meet the expectations of the Australian people and the parliament and were an oversight on my part, and for this I apologise. Her statement says three flights upgraded to business class over the last two years - including in July and August this year – came “due to my frequent flyer status while travelling on parliamentary business, upgrades which I did not seek.” “Qantas has advised of upgrades on five personal flights to or from New Zealand between 2016 and 2018 which were not previously declared. There was also a Qantas domestic upgrade in January 2015,” she said. Virgin Australia has advised that, as a member of The Club since 2013, seven domestic flights were upgraded between 2015 and 2019. No upgrades were issued by Rex Group to the extent of their records going back to 2013. McKenzie said she “will continue to prosecute the Albanese Labor government’s failure to ensure greater competition in the aviation sector on behalf of all Australian travellers”. Speaking with the ABC, the former prime minister Scott Morrison said Donald Trump would be a positive force for global security: This was a very difficult climb for the Democrats and vice-president Harris. Then you have Donald Trump, who is like unlike any other politician you will ever come across, and I can say that with some experience having dealt with both President Trump and President Biden. I think what he brings now is an assertiveness and a strength to the role, which I think will have a very positive impact on global security issues … That means getting in a position of strength and then getting the right outcome, the idea of just fighting to fight tomorrow with no real intent or resource to fight to win – that isn’t a good outcome for global peace and a good resolution in Ukraine, either. I think that is a recipe for calamity. I think President Trump will bring a fresh take on that. And frankly, we need a few fresh takes on some of these challenges, whether it’s there, or in the Middle East. The Nationals senator has just disclosed 16 flight upgrades on Qantas and Virgin flights going back to 2015, which she had failed to declare over the last four parliamentary terms. As we brought you earlier, the opposition transport spokesperson had found more than a dozen instances where she had not disclosed flight upgrades as required by parliamentary rules on her register of interests. Her office had been expected to update the register after she had run a self-audit of her own travel schedule – and that update has now come, showing 16 flight upgrades, including five personal trips to or from New Zealand. We are awaiting a statement from her office, but we understand McKenzie will stress that none of the upgrades were specifically requested by her, and that several of them came due to her membership of Virgin’s elite airline lounge club, or her Qantas frequent flyer status. However we understand also that five trips between Australia and New Zealand – one in 2016, four in 2018 – were personal trips. McKenzie’s update to the register, which has just arrived on the parliament’s website, shows two Qantas flight upgrades in July and August 2024 which she said was due to her frequent flyer status. Just last week, McKenzie told Sky News: “I’ve never sought one [a flight upgrade] … I haven’t been offered one.” The update also shows seven Virgin flight upgrades between 2015 and 2019, which she said were “provided within membership of Virgin ‘the club’ allocation’”. NSW Police investigate body found in car in Sydney’s south New South Wales Police said emergency services were called to Durham Street, Hurstville, at about 5:15 on Tuesday after reports of a concern for welfare. Officers found a dead woman in the passenger seat of a vehicle, the police said in a statement a short time ago. The woman, who is yet to be formally identified, is believed to be aged in her 40s. Police established an investigation into the incident and a 46-year-old man was arrested at a home at short time later. He was charged with contravening an AVO, taking and driving conveyance without consent of owner, Drive whilst Disqualified second offence and breach of bail. No charges have been laid over the woman’s death. He was refused bail and appeared in local court today, where he was refused bail to reappear on 19 November. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Police seek information on alleged fraudsters posing as psychics Police are re-appealing for information as investigations continue into alleged fraudsters who posed as psychics. New South Wales Police said Strike Force Recycling was established in July 2024 to investigate after a number of people reported they had paid money to people claiming to be psychics. Police said a woman, 48, and a man, 50, were arrested on 8 August. Both remain before the courts. Police appealed to identify a third woman they believe may be able to assist with inquiries. They said she had a Mediterranean appearance, was believed to be aged in her 40s, about 150cm tall, had a large build and spoke with a Romanian accent. At about 9:30am today, police executed a search warrant at a storage unit in Victoria Ave, Chatswood. Police said that during the search, officers seized antique statues, an antique sword, crystal ball and second world war collectors’ memorabilia, including a suitcase and a firearm magazine. Anyone with information about the woman is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. US Democrats in Australia ‘know the drop is coming’ Nervous hope is mixing with anticipatory dread among Americans watching the US election results come in at the Kent St Hotel in Sydney. Emily, who is visiting Sydney, says the energy has shifted at US election watch party, hosted by Democrats Abroad. At midday, “it was buzzing,” she says. “Like before a really fun concert starts, something anticipatory.” But I think the reality is starting to set in. It is a little bit like dread, holding your breath. It’s like when you are on a rollercoaster, you know the drop is coming. Job providers accused of harassing jobseekers over payslips The government is investigating four job providers for regularly harassing jobseekers for payslip information. Earlier this year a Guardian Australia investigation found providers regularly harass jobseekers to get payslip information. Under questions from Senator Penny Allman-Payne, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations said the department has started investigating providers, which it would complete by mid-November. It could not name the four providers until it was finished. Deputy Security Tania Rishniw: One of the things that we have done now in terms of payslips is we have a specific line in terms of the customer service line that any complaint about payslips automatically gets referred to our complaints team, to be looked at, to be investigated, to make sure that those complaints are taken seriously. We’ve updated guidelines for providers that make it absolutely clear that there are consequences. Australia’s red centre is roasting A large swathe of inland Australia is sweltering today, with five states forecast to hit 44C. Thargomindah in Queensland and White Cliffs in New South Wales surpassed that, both reaching 45.1C. Meanwhile, thunderstorms are on their way for almost all of NSW: Greens call for ban on MPs getting free flight upgrades The Greens say federal parliament should implement “a blanket ban on MPs requesting or accepting free flight upgrades”, which they want to apply to both personal and work travel. The party’s transport spokesperson, Elizabeth Watson-Brown, claimed the move would restore trust and integrity in how politicians deal with the aviation sector. “Banning free flight upgrades would help curb any potentially inappropriate behaviour from MPs and prevent airlines from wielding undue influence over political decisions,” she said in a statement. Watson-Brown said it was “completely understandable for people to be questioning Qantas’ relationship with the very same MPs and Ministers that regulate them.” In a cost-of-living crisis that’s seeing people across the country struggle to pay for food and rent, MPs on generous salaries don’t need to be getting freebies when they travel. Rangers have increased patrols and warned visitors to be vigilant after Sunday’s attack, which marked the 21st dingo incident at K’gari, formerly Fraser Island, in 2024, AAP reports. The man was walking from his car to a picnic area at Lake McKenzie when a tagged female dingo suddenly ran at him from behind, rangers say. The dingo bit the man on the right calf, causing a minor puncture wound. The dingo retreated when he turned around and kicked sand at it. Rangers responded quickly and “observed the dingo continuing to walk around the car park and loiter close to vehicles and people for about an hour before it returned to the bush,” Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service senior ranger Linda Behrendorff said. A four-year-old girl was flown to hospital after she was bitten on the chest while a group was fishing on the island, north of Brisbane, in August. Behrendorff said visitors should only use fenced picnic areas when eating or preparing food and should not take food or drinks to the lake’s shores. “Visitors and residents are also reminded to remain vigilant of their surroundings at all times, keep children within arm’s length, never walk alone and carry a stick at all times,” Behrendorff said. Fraser Coast Mayor George Seymour has previously called on the Queensland government to consider restricting families to camp inside fenced areas on K’gari after a rise in incidents. A quarter of job providers underperforming The department of employment and workplace relations is up in senate estimates where the discussion is focusing on the performance results of providers. Job providers receive millions of dollars in public funding to help jobseekers get into work. The most recent data has shown 44 providers out of 178 received a low-performance rating. Low means providers are “not meeting the department’s expectations”. In comparison, just 15 received a high performance. NSW Libertarian party’s US election function in full swing In his Uncle Sam outfit and sneakers, Jim Sternhell is one of the more colourful characters among the crowd at the US election watch party in New South Wales parliament. Increasingly excited attenders at the pro-Trump crowd have sought out Sternhell for selfies as the results roll in. The state’s Libertarian party, hosting the event, has already called the election for Trump, but Sternhell is not yet as optimistic, fearing election interference by the Democratic party: There’s a whole array of tricks they can do both before, during and after. The dentist and One Nation member has only a tangential connection to the US, spending four months in Arizona as a boy and with one of his daughters now living in the US, but he’s concerned about the election because of what it means for climate change – which he says is a hoax. Sternhell, who is mulling running for office in his local electorate of Wentworth in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, has popped up in his distinctive outfit at past rallies for Trump and the Conservative Political Action Conference. He’s also a regular attender at anti-climate action rallies and protests against what he describes as “anti-radical Islam”. Tony Burke addresses high court ruling on ex-immigration detainee monitoring The minister for home affairs has responded to the high court’s decision to quash the Albanese government’s ankle bracelet and curfew regime for former immigration detainees. In a statement released a short time ago, Burke indicated he intended fix the problem: The Australian government is taking immediate steps to protect community safety following the high court’s ruling in the YBFZ case. Regulations are now being finalised that will allow for an adjusted process for electronic monitoring devices and curfews to be used. I will sign off on these regulations later today. Tomorrow I will introduce new legislation to support those regulations. The legislation will also strengthen the government’s power to remove people who have had their visas cancelled to third countries. The government has also boosted personnel and resources for Operation Aegis in order to keep the community safe. The number of officers has been increased by 66%. The government imposed strict conditions on the NZYQ cohort because community safety is our top priority. We argued strongly in the high court to keep electronic monitoring and curfews in place. The court’s decision is not the one the government wanted – but it is one the government has prepared for. Burke closed by once again assuring the public that the “security and safety of the Australian community will always be the absolute priority for this government.” The body of a boy, believed to be that of the 11-year-old who was swept out to sea on New South Wales’ Central Coast on Sunday, has been found. A short time ago, NSW Police released a statement: A body, believed to be that of a boy missing at The Entrance, has been located today. About 5.15pm on Sunday, emergency services responded to reports a child had been swept into the ocean while attempting to cross The Entrance Channel. An extensive multi-agency search for the missing boy was subsequently conducted, with ongoing taskings continuing today. About 2.30pm today, emergency services were called to The Entrance following reports a body had been located in the water. While the body is yet to be formally identified, it is believed to be that of the missing boy. The boy had been visiting the Central Coast from Sydney with his father and three siblings. The police said a report will be prepared for the Coroner. Despite no official election outcome as of yet, New South Wales Libertarian MP John Ruddick has declared Donald Trump has won the US election, getting cheers from the 50 or so attenders at his watch party in state parliament: The NSW Libertarian party is going to make history around the world. We are calling this election for Donald Trump. Donald Trump has won. And I can say this is the greatest comeback in history since the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Ruddick told the crowd he hoped to hear from “president-elect Trump” soon and asked: Do we want to continue to watch Fox [News] or do we want to watch them cry on CNN? The crowd cheered as the results for the key swing state Georgia, where Trump is now leading 51%, appeared on screen – a CNN presenter said the count in some states would not be completed today and would continue tomorrow, drawing some boos and shouts of: “That’s a steal!” Thank you, as ever, Tory Shepherd. Let’s get straight on with the rest of the day’s (non-US election) news… I’m going to leave you with Daisy Dumas for the rest of the afternoon. I may need a shower, some white noise (read: wine), and some dog time after that QT. See you tomorrow! That’s another question time over, and it had the scrappy feeling of the last day of school. But it’s not! It’s back on tomorrow, then there are two more sitting weeks before the end of the year. Labor ‘considering a whole range of possible reforms’ on childcare, Chalmers says The independent MP Kylea Tink is asking the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, about abolishing the activity test for childcare. Chalmers says: We are big believers in the social and economic value of early childhood education and care. We see it as a gamechanger for families, and for the economy more broadly … we are considering a whole range of possible reforms as part of our commitment to try to get the system as close as we can to something which is a bit more universal. He says early childhood education and care has been “at the very core of our agenda”, that the government has invested in cheaper childcare and lifted subsidies. “We’re also delivering a 15% pay rise for our early childhood educators,” he says. In case you’ve strayed from the Guardian’s live US election blog, it’s worth noting that the money is moving in the direction of a victory for Donald Trump. The US dollar, for instance, is rising against other currencies, including the Australian dollar. The US dollar gain against the Mexican peso is 2.5%, presumably because there’s a greater chance of tariffs or some other punishment if Trump takes office. He’s made various threats against the US’s southern neighbour over the years, such as promising to get them to pay for a wall that for the most part never got built. Part of the appeal of a Trump win is the promise of lower corporate taxes than would happen if vice-president Kamala Harris were to win a promotion to the top job. As things stand, the latter is looking a longer shot as the counting proceeds. Australian stocks are higher, too, lifting more than 1.1% for the day. As mentioned earlier, Australia’s Treasury has provided advice to the Albanese government about what a Trump administration might mean. Higher tariffs, particularly against China, won’t help Australia, and they may prompt higher US interest rates than otherwise would be the case. The latter is one of the reasons why the US dollar is rising. How to price in the effects of other Trump policies – such as dismantling key government agencies – is anybody’s guess. Bulk billing was ‘in freefall’ under Liberals, health minister says The Liberal MP Paul Fletcher has asked about bulk billing rates, saying it was 88% under the Coalition and 74% under Labor. The health minister, Mark Butler, says bulk billing was “in freefall” when the Liberal party was coming to the end of its time in government. He says the figures Fletcher was using included Covid vaccinations and consults for Covid vaccinations, which “artificially boosted” the bulk billing rates under the former government: The former government did not include transparent data on bulk billing. They artificially inflated it with Covid vaccinations and the rest. The second thing is the trajectory was clear. And he calls Fletcher the “worst health minister in the history of Medicare” and Sussan Ley the “second worst” for freezing Medicare. Promotion still sinking in for Australia’s new defence force chief The new chief of the defence force, David Johnston, is appearing at his first Senate estimates committee hearing since taking up the position in July, but it seems the promotion hasn’t quite sunk in. Ahead of making an opening statement, Johnston identified himself. “Good afternoon senators, thank you for the welcome. Vice-admiral – er – Admiral David Johnston, chief of the defence force,” he said, to chuckles from the committee. “Slight upgrade there, mate,” the committee chair, Raff Ciccone, quipped. “It takes some changing,” the admiral replied, before going on to talk about the difficulties in recruitment and retention of defence personnel. Free Tafe is doing its job, minister says The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, is asking about fee-free Tafe. “How many have resulted in no qualification being delivered?” she asks. (If you remember yesterday she asked the same question and it became a barney about how long Tafe courses went for, with Labor saying most take up to three years, so can’t have finished because the program hasn’t been going that long.) The skills and training minister, Andrew Giles, says it takes four years to get the data. “What the data says is that free Tafe is doing its job,” he says. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is up talking about the “reckless arrogance of the opposition leader, and the comical cluelessness … of his offsider”. His major focus, he says, is “the fight against inflation”. And he says the RBA’s Michele Bullock made three major points, that inflation is the highest priority, and that when it comes to inflation “public demand is not the main game”. And third, that “inflation has fallen substantially from its peak in 2022 and its coming back to target in a reasonable way”. He’s really been having a crack at Taylor all week – he’s just accused him of “chirping away” in an “incoherent way”. Opposition repeats ‘weak and incompetent’ line Here’s the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, using the “weakest and most incompetent” line again. But Speaker Milton Dick’s been doing his homework, referring to previous rulings by speakers. After looking at those precedents, he again asks Taylor to remove that part of his question (without ruling it out of order). The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, in the name of seeking “clarification”, says something something “weak” something something “incompetent”. It’s almost like they think the more often they say the words the more they’ll stick (something that does, in fact, happen). Dutton wants a ruling on “weak” and “incompetent”. “It’s not a personal reflection on the prime minister,” he says. “It is a description of the government.” Also (I’m paraphrasing): “They said it first.” And Taylor. Again. Teal MP links US election to question about real-time donation disclosure The independent MP Kate Chaney is up now, saying Australia “is not immune to the mistrust we see in the US”. There is increasing suspicion that politicians are acting in the interests of airlines, fossil fuels or gambling companies, unions or a political party instead of all Australians. Voters deserve to know who is funding all political candidates before they vote. Will the government legislate real-time donation disclosure in time to make our next federal election transparent? There was jeering and heckles from the floor, and Speaker Milton Dick intervened again. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says democracy is something “that must be cherished and must be nurtured and cannot be taken for granted”: I can confirm that I’ve been working as the leader of the government to increase transparency, including on funding issues, and indeed, I [had] just this morning, another constructive discussion with the minister for the special minister of state, Senator Farrell, about these issues. We believe in lower donation thresholds, and have done that and took that to an election. He says he’s “not picking” on Clive Palmer but that his company’s donations distorted the political system and says something must be done. He says some of the crossbench have “very strong views” about the timing of changes. He also mentions “some of the backers” of the crossbench having opinions. Tense moment between Labor minister and Fatima Payman in Senate estimates There was a tense moment between the Labor minister Murray Watt and former Labor senator Fatima Payman in the employment hearing of Senate estimates just before the lunch break. Payman, who quit Labor earlier this year to sit as an independent, asked Watt – the employment and workplace minister – about salaries of administrators appointed to the CFMEU. Reading from a “leaked document” purporting to show the payments made to those administrators (Watt said he wasn’t aware of their individual salaries), Payman asked: Do you know how many fee-paying members it takes to cover the salaries of these three officials? Watt responded: No, but I dare say it’s pretty similar to the members’ contributions that were needed to pay the salaries of two former officials who are facing corruption charges in NSW right now. Payman: I’m talking about these three officials, and on my calculations it would be almost 2,000 members’ hard-earned fees that they’re paying their dues, just to employ your hand-picked bureaucrats. How can the government justify this program of jobs for mates at the expense of workers? Watt responded: I’m not sure who’s supplying these questions to you Senator Payman. Payman interjected: Don’t insult my intelligence and being able to put questions to the government, minister. That’s really not fair. After a brief interlude from the Labor committee chair, Tony Sheldon, the hearing got back on track. Watt referred back to his previous public statements about protecting the interests of union members. Josh Creamer, the chair of Queensland’s truth-telling and healing inquiry, has spoken about the decision to put the process on “hold”. Despite repeated requests, Creamer has yet to receive a call from the minister, Fiona Simpson, or premier, David Crisafulli. The inquiry received a brief letter from Simpson at 6.49pm on Monday, he said. “I request further truth-telling sessions, notices, hearings and other work of the inquiry be placed on hold, until such time as the government repeals the act,” Simpson wrote. Creamer will meet Simpson tomorrow, he said: People have said to me, this is like the chief protector days, a single person deciding what’s best for every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island person in the state. The government has previously signalled its intention to repeal the Pathway to Treaty Act in one of the two sitting weeks of parliament this year, making it one of the government’s first acts. Crisafulli, who voted for the original bill, called the inquiry “divisive”. Creamer said: Ceasing the inquiry’s work in this way continues 165 years of government failing to listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Creamer said pausing the inquiry left it unable to provide “support to our participants who are no doubt hurting through this process”, in violation of its trauma-informed process mandated in its terms of reference. Liberal MP echoes ‘incompetence’ line in interest rates question The Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie echoes Taylor’s line on weakness and incompetence despite Dick’s quite heartfelt plea about the language used in the house. After more discussion over the words used, McKenzie repeats the rest of Taylor’s earlier question about interest rates (without repeating the weakness and incompetence line). The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, refers to comments from the RBA’s Michele Bullock, saying “we still have inflation coming back to target in a reasonable way”: She also went on to say … the fact that inflation, now for the last year, has only been 2.8% is actually real for people. They are seeing lower petrol prices. They are seeing lower electricity prices. So this is good for people. Real incomes are rising again. As inflation is declining and wage growth is a bit higher than that, and you’ve got the tax cuts, real incomes are rising again. That is what governor Bullock had to say yesterday. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, echoes Albanese’s words (except for a bit about Albanese being invited into Biden’s home). “Our relationship with the United States will endure, it will strengthen,” he says. “We want to see a safe environment in which people can vote and we want to see the best outcome for the US.” Albanese pays tribute to outgoing president Joe Biden The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is paying tribute to the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, saying he met him within 48 hours of being sworn is as PM. “I’ll never forget the genuine warmth of Joe’s welcome,” he says, and talks up the future of the alliance. Turnbull’s little gaffe in Trump’s favour Another little nugget from the former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s earlier appearance on ABC television – while he was typically, eloquently scathing of Donald Trump, he did make a little gaffe in Trump’s favour. Turnbull was saying the president of the day would need to certify that the US does not need the Virginia-class submarines in order for Australia to receive them, adding that the US is “producing half as many as their navy needs to sustain them”. “He’s got to say –” Turnbull started. “Or she?” David Speers interjected. “He or she has got to say it would not detract from the underwater capabilities of the US Navy …,” Turnbull went on. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, responding to Taylor, is giving what is by now his well-rehearsed speech that Labor “turned two big Liberal deficits into two substantial Labor surpluses, and that’s helping in the fight against inflation”. They’re “cleaning up the mess” of the previous government, he says, and has a crack at Taylor over the figures he’s using: If he was honest … he would say that what he’s doing once again … he’s literally trying to confuse people and trying to confuse the underlying measure and the headline measure. The Reserve Bank targets the headline measure, and they say in their new forecast that they’ll hit the new the midpoint of the target band on the headline measure in June of 2025. “We’re going to get through this, don’t worry,” the speaker, Milton Dick, says, adding that he will allow the question but wants the house to be careful with the language it’s using. For everyone’s benefit, if we could reframe language to be more factual and to be on point, I think question time would be a better thing. A point Taylor ignores, repeats his original point, and asks about Labor’s “reckless spending” driving up interest rates. And it’s question time! The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, is first up, calling the government “the weakest and most incompetent since the Whitlam government”. Speaker Milton Dick (again) calls on him to lose the “descriptors”. Dick says it’s a “slippery path and a race to the bottom” and puts him in a difficult position to argue for such language. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, wants to know what standing order Dick’s using, but he’s grandstanding: If you can’t describe a government in terms it should be described in, I don’t understand how it is we can have a breach of the standing orders. Dick says he was calling for dignity, rather than ruling the question out of order. What an illuminating start. Trump supporters watch US election at Parliament House At the US election watch party in NSW Parliament House, Liberal party rank-and-file members Jamie and his wife, who preferred not to be named, are hopeful Donald Trump will win the presidency but are worried there will be electoral “cheating”. Jamie said: While Kamala’s ahead in certain states, they’ll just keep counting. The couple were “devastated” by the results in 2020’s presidential election and are happy to be watching the results with fellow Trump supporters, a few of whom are wearing Maga hats. The pair live in Sydney’s inner west, in Anthony Albanese’s electorate of Grayndler, where they say they feel unsafe to proclaim their support for Trump. Jamie’s wife said: It’s great we’re seeing people walking around with Trump hats on. They’re taking their life into their own hands in the city … We would probably be killed or our lives would be made a misery if people saw us in Maga hats. The pair have been long engaged in Australian and American politics and are frustrated by Australia’s political disengagement, citing immigration rates, the development of offshore windfarms and the nation’s acquiescence to vaccine mandates during the pandemic. Jamie’s wife said: It frustrates the hell out of me … Australians sitting around, watching sport, drinking beer, talking about climate change, all this sort of rubbish. They’re just not seeing what’s really going on here, are they? The pair heard about the watch party through an organisation called the British Australia Community, which they first encountered at an event with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson earlier in the year. Turnbull says Trump ‘doesn’t pay a lot of attention’ to advisers More from former PM Malcolm Turnbull – he warned that Donald Trump’s behaviour with foreign leaders is different to what one might expect from a president. Speaking with the ABC’s David Speers just now, he said: You know, a regular president or prime minister will have staff and advisers and a whole official system that you can interact with. Now, with Trump, he will have those people, but he doesn’t pay a lot of attention to them. So the advocacy really is down to the prime minister or the counterpart. When asked about ambassadors’ roles under Trump, Turnbull again suggested things will not be in keeping with usual diplomatic modus operandi: Joe Hockey worked really hard, was a good ambassador. [He] tried to engage … but he had nothing to do with the critical negotiations with Trump. And that’s no reflection on him. I don’t think that any ambassador will. Katherine Deves says ‘angry’ Americans will vote Trump in At a pro-Trump watch party in New South Wales’ Parliament House, dozens of Australians have taken their seats alongside some state politicians to watch Fox News as the US election results roll in. A few attendees are wearing red Maga hats and one woman wears a T-shirt showing Trump’s shooting with the words “God bless President Trump” – a proud Redbubble purchase. The Libertarian party has booked out parliament’s theatrette, with about 200 expected to drop by over the afternoon. Libertarian MP John Ruddick, sitting in the front row, says: I’m hoping that we can save western civilisation and that Trump can prevail … Trump’s not a libertarian but Kamala is very much a supporter of very big government [and] the puppet of the military industrial complex. From NSW, Liberal frontbencher Damien Tudehope, One Nation MP Tania Mihailuk and Libertarian party president Ross Cameron have showed up, while former federal Liberal MP Craig Kelly and Katherine Deves, who ran for the Liberal party in 2022, have also dropped by. Deves predicts an “angry” American people will vote Trump in: You’ve got tens of millions of migrants coming in, who are unchecked, unvetted, crime is through the roof, and you’re seeing the whole woke agenda with respect to transgenderism and critical race theory. Nacc received 3,189 referrals of suspected corrupt conduct in 2023-24 The National Anti-Corruption Commission decided not to investigate 221 instances of potential corrupt conduct in its first year of operating, while moving forward with 26 probes, acknowledging its decisions may sometimes be “unpopular”. The federal integrity body’s annual report for 2023-24 provides a snapshot of its first full year. It shows the Nacc received a total of 3,189 referrals of suspected corrupt conduct. In 221 cases, the referral passed the triage stage but didn’t proceed to investigation because there were “insufficient prospects of finding corrupt conduct, or the matter was already being adequately investigated by another agency, or a corruption investigation would not add value in the public interest”. The report’s release comes a week after the Nacc’s decision not to start a corruption investigation into robodebt royal commission referrals was “affected by apprehended bias”. The report, which was written before the watchdog’s watchdog made the finding, acknowledged the decision would be unpopular. The Nacc commissioner, Paul Brereton, wrote in its foreword: Since commencement, we have been committed to carrying out our work in good faith, with integrity and in the public interest. That does not mean that our decisions will always be popular; often they will not. Making decisions that we believe to be right, though they may be unpopular, is what integrity requires of us. The Nacc also reported the average time for assessing referrals was 125 days. As no corruption investigations were completed within the reporting period, it could not measure the average time to finalise an investigation. Malcolm Turnbull says Australian leaders will need to ‘stand your ground’ when dealing with Trump Malcolm Turnbull is giving his two-cents’ worth on the unfolding US election results. Speaking with the ABC in Washington DC, the former PM says the night is so far “pretty much as advertised, a neck and neck race. And it’s too early to tell.” Turnbull says that Australian leaders will need to approach Donald Trump – should he become president – with strength and “stand your ground”. My advice is that you should not do what everyone will tell you to do, which is to suck up to him. The newspaper columns are full of people – not all of them are grifters, but a lot of them are – who say that you have to suck up to him and flatter him and, of course, people typically do that to guys like Trump because they’re big, bullying … narcissistic. So if all you want is a photo-op … you can do that. If you want good outcomes, in my case for Australia, you have to stand your ground and make a case. And I did so on a number of issues and incurred his displeasure, famously, over the refugee deal. But I got the outcome Australia needed. Severe weather warning from BoM Heat, storms and fire: the Bureau of Meteorology has provided its latest severe weather update. High temperatures across much of the country’s east over the next day or two are forecast to give way to milder conditions in the south-east towards the weekend. Greg Jericho has cast a steely eye over Labor’s student debt policy and says: Governments should subsidise things that are good and which benefit society – and tax things that are bad and make society, the economy and the planet worse. Ben, an American student currently at the University of Sydney, says he hopes no violence follows the US presidential election. He is watching the results roll in at a Democrats Abroad watch party at Kent Street Hotel, Sydney. He says: I thought it would just be fun to come meet other people and watch the election together in a more vibrant atmosphere. People are a little tense. People are worried about it but, you know, its lively and people seem to be excited … [I] hope things go really well but I’m still nervous. I just, I hope it goes smoothly. I hope there’s not violence or anything, because I’ve heard a lot about that. It would be really cool to see the first woman president. I’m really excited for that. So hopefully that’s the outcome. That’s what I’m hoping for. Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson was “fired for banging on about his book” during a guest appearance on Channel 4’s coverage of the US election, apparently. Yes, this is the Australian politics blog – but there’s a connection … Other Channel 4 panellists include Stormy Daniels, Rufus Wainwright, Brian Cox, Sean Spicer and one Malcolm Turnbull, former Australian prime minister. Now that’s a lineup. American expats ‘nervous’ about US election result Alex Webb and Jialin Wu are watching the US presidential election results roll in at the Kent Street Hotel, Sydney, wearing Harris 2024 merchandise and American flags. Webb, an American living in Australia, says the pub feels nervously optimistic. “After 2016 everybody’s nervous,” Webb says. He is hoping for a “landslide Kamala victory”. “I’m looking forward to celebrating the first female president.” Cost of living increases slowing sharply, ABS says The ABS has issued some cost of living data this morning, and generally pressures appear to be easing. Employee households’ living costs rose 0.6% in the September quarter, or about half the 1.3% increase last quarter, the ABS said. There’s a range of impacts, though, with households with employees facing higher costs of living (mostly because of their exposure to higher mortgage rates). As fixed-rate loans expire and they are repriced at a higher interest, those mortgage payments have been increasing. Against that, automotive fuel and electricity prices have been easing back – the former because of a slide in global oil prices, and the latter because of government rebates (especially in Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania). “Electricity costs for Employee households fell by 20% compared to households receiving government payments, which fell by around 10%,” said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. The best off, at least in terms of cost of living increases, are age pensioners and self-funded retirees. Their costs rose 0.3% in the quarter, or a quarter of the pace of the previous quarter. As it happened, we flagged the case for the worst being over in terms of cost of living increases recently here: The opposition has responded to the news that the high court has struck down the harsh regime of ankle bracelets and curfews imposed on non-citizens released from indefinite immigration detention. The shadow home affairs minister, James Paterson, the shadow immigration minister, Dan Tehan, and the shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, said in a statement it was an “embarrassing loss for the Albanese government” and that the government should introduce legislation in response today, and explain what they will do to “keep the Australian people safe”. They said the effect would be that “dangerous non-citizen offenders” would be free in the community: This loss compounds the failure of the Albanese government to use the preventative detention powers the parliament rushed through almost 12 months ago to re-detain any high-risk offenders. The government repeatedly assured us that the amendments they drafted were constitutionally sound, and as recently as Monday in Senate estimates promised they had comprehensive contingency plans in place if they were unsuccessful in this case. ‘The fate of western democracy is on the line’: Sydney pub fills with American expats watching US election Hope, an American-Australian dual citizen is watching the US presidential election results roll in among others at a watch party at the Kent Street Hotel, Sydney, this morning. She says: This is a super important election, and I either wanted to celebrate with people who would be as excited as I am, or cry with people who are going to be as devastated as I will be. The event was organised by Democrats Abroad Australia and Sydney Expat Americans. Hope, who volunteers with Democrats Abroad, says: I really think the fate of western democracy is on the line with this election. This isn’t just about America, but also I’m enraged on behalf of women and minorities and the republic and the constitution and Australia as a country that always follows America culturally and politically. Watching Australia shift over further and further to the right over the last 40 years that I’ve been here has just been so sad. Hope’s friend Amy is visiting from America. “We voted early so that we could watch this together,” she says. Amy says the energy in the Sydney pub is optimistic: This could be the end of democracy. I mean, we are all voting, I never thought it would happen in my lifetime, but we are all voting to avoid an autocracy … but we are hopeful. Australians and American expats gather in Sydney pub before US election results American flags are strung up in rows to the ceiling of the Kent Street Hotel in Sydney this morning. As CNN’s live US election coverage plays from screens throughout the pub, dozens of are gathering to watch – some are in shirts with Kamala Harris logos, others wear badges with Democrat slogans. Hundreds are expected to join the watch party by lunchtime, Jasper Lee, the chair of Democrats Abroad Australia, says. The event is organised by Democrats Abroad and Sydney Expat Americans. Lee says there is an energy of excitement this morning: There’s certainly anxiety, but it’s a good kind of anxiety. We’re all hoping for a good result. I think that Australians, like Americans, understand the stakes of this election, what exactly Donald Trump promises to do to the United States and the world. And I think that they feel very similarly to us. Kennedy schtum on advice over education debt cut impacts The Liberal senator Jane Hume has been pressing the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, and fellow Treasury officials in Senate estimates about the impacts of the Albanese government’s plans to cut student debt on $16bn in loans by 20%. Hume tries to provoke a response by citing economists such as Chris Richardson, who said it was a “fairness fail”, while others cited called the plan “an abominable idea” or that there were many good ways to spend $16bn. Kennedy declines to take the bait, saying, “I’m not an economic commentator”. Hume says, “but you’re an economist”, to which Kennedy responds a tad sardonically: “I am, thank you, yes”. As to the wider effects, a colleague of Kennedy’s (I missed his name) said: “We don’t think the effects are going to be substantial on inflation.” Ankle bracelet ruling a ‘victory for fundamental freedoms’, lawyer says The Refugee Legal executive director, David Manne, who acted for the plaintiff YBFZ in his high court case has commented on the ruling striking down electronic monitoring and ankle bracelets. Manne told Guardian Australia: This is an important ruling, it underscores the bedrock principle that the government doesn’t have the power to punish people by stripping them of fundamental rights of freedom and dignity. The invalidity of the curfew and electronic monitoring is a victory for fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. Everyone, whether citizens or non-citizens, should have the same protections of freedom and dignity under the law. The curfew and ankle bracelets constitute punishments which seriously infringe our client’s liberty, and the government doesn’t have power to do that. Under our constitution only courts, and not the government, can impose punishment. Manne said the ruling means that everyone in the cohort released from immigration detention because their removal is not practical “will no longer be able to be held in their houses eight hours a day and subject to the invasive humiliation of ankle bracelets”. He called on the government to abide by the ruling immediately and remove the conditions from everyone on bridging visa Rs. He said: After they are freed from immigration detention they will not be subject to further punishments, [which make] it impossible to lead ordinary lives let alone to get a job, nor be under constant fear if they’re late home by one minute or don’t recharge the bracelets they’ll be imprisoned for a minimum of one year. UBS shifts back its guess on when the RBA will start cutting rates As mentioned, the big four banks still have February as the time when they think the Reserve Bank of Australia will start cutting its cash rate. Yesterday’s comments from the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, sounded to this correspondent as more “hawkish” than that (barring some global surprises). Among the big four, NAB perhaps is the most uncertain about its February guess on a rate cut: Overall the path to a February rate cut which had already narrowed following recent data, looks even more narrow following today’s presser. CBA, which lately pushed its forecast of a December rate cut back to February, is also wondering if another shift might be needed: Our base case sees the RBA on hold until the February 2025 board meeting when we expect the RBA to commence an easing cycle. The risk clearly sits with a later start date for the first interest rate decrease. ANZ and Westpac also have February as their first RBA cut. UBS, an investment bank, has had one of the better prediction records. Its chief Australian economist, George Tharenou, was on a streak of about a dozen correct RBA rate calls, when he stumbled. Anyway, he’s pushed back his call until May: Thereafter, we still see the RBA easing cycle to be relatively gradual with -25 basis points per quarter, to a terminal low of 3.10% in Q2-26 (was 2.85%). So, the “higher for longer” mantra for rates might become “not dropping as low as hoped”. Of course, a lot might happen between now and June 2026, so nobody really knows. Encrypted messaging app Session criticises ‘wildly overreaching powers’ of Australian law enforcement Earlier we brought you comments from the Australian federal police (AFP) about its approaches to the encrypted messaging app Session that resulted in the company shifting operations to Switzerland. The AFP said the agency was doing its job, and there was child abuse material being shared on the app. The Session director Alex Linton has responded in a statement today. He said Session understands the AFP work and has attempted to explain the limited capacity for Session to assist in investigations – due to how the app works. However, given neither the organisation nor employees have been subject to any investigation, it remains unclear how an interaction such as an unannounced visit to the home of an employee was either helpful or appropriate. Still, the true problem stems from the wildly overreaching powers which Australian law enforcement agencies possess. These powers will intimidate and discourage anyone building or offering privacy technology to Australians, and whether it is the spectre of backdoor legislation or an actual notice forcing a company to compromise its own encryption – the result is these skills are leaving the country and Australians less safe online. The barrister who has agreed to represent Bruce Lehrmann in his appeal against his defamation loss wishes to remain unnamed until the court sets a date, to avoid being trolled or harassed, the federal court has heard. In April, Justice Michael Lee found Lehrmann was not defamed by Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson and last month the former Liberal staffer was granted the right to appeal against the judgment. At a case management hearing this morning, Lehrmann’s lawyer Zali Burrows said the barrister’s name was confidential until a formal date was set. “Until I have the hearing date for the appeal, and I have formally briefed him, he wishes to remain unnamed, just on the basis he doesn’t wish to be trolled or harassed, for example, as I’ve experienced,” Burrows said. Justice Wendy Abraham asked Burrows to write his name on a piece of paper and hand it to her and to Sue Chrysanthou SC, representing Lisa Wilkinson. The date for the appeal is yet to be determined but will be in the second half of 2025. Following on from that story I mentioned earlier by Sarah Martin, here’s the video of the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young on what she described as Kyle and Jackie O’s “revolting, sexist, racist, misogynistic, divisive” content: Pill testing to go ahead at Schoolies despite LNP promise to drop scheme AAP reports that pill testing will proceed at the popular end-of-year Schoolies event on the Gold Coast after the Queensland government backflipped on its hardline stance. The former Labor government committed $80,000 for the free and confidential service to be rolled out for the first time at the annual event attended by thousands of teenagers and young adults. The Liberal National party vowed to dump the scheme prior to winning power at the state election in October. The health minister, Tim Nicholls, confirmed on Wednesday that pill testing would go ahead given the event was just a few weeks away. A spokesperson for Nicholls said: Our position remains that there is no safe way to take drugs and pill testing sends the wrong message. The contract for pill testing at Schoolies this year was a contract led by the previous government. After taking advice so close to the event, the only short-term option is for the department of health to honour the contract for this year’s event. The Australian Medical Association Queensland president, Nick Yim, welcomed the government’s decision to allow pill testing at Schoolies. He told ABC Radio: This demonstrates the current government is keen to seek advice on issues and pill testing was one of those issues. He called for pill testing to become permanent at the event to prevent injury or death to curious school leavers. Queensland, the ACT and Victoria are the only jurisdictions to have legalised pill testing, but it could be revoked in the sunshine state under the LNP government. The former government had committed $1m over two years to fund pill testing, with fixed sites established in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Its first pill-testing service was rolled out at the Rabbits Eat Lettuce festival over Easter weekend in 2024, when 250 people had substances assessed. It followed calls for increased standardised pill-testing programs at festivals after the deaths of Dassarn Tarbutt, 24, and Ebony Greening, 22, at the 2019 edition of Rabbits Eat Lettuce. Schoolies takes place on the Gold Coast from 16 November to 1 December. Aged care and childcare workers underpaid, Treasury boss says The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, says aged care and childcare workers were underpaid. Senate estimates, so far, hasn’t spent a lot of time on inflation, and the RBA’s likely stance that interest rate cuts are still some way off. (See here from yesterday.) Markets, for instance, only estimate there’s about a one-in-four chance of an interest rate cut by February. The big four banks have had that month – two RBA meetings away – as when they expect the first cut to land. (I expect they will push that back.) Anyway, the Liberal senator Jane Hume has been picking up on the weak productivity growth, which is also a worry to the RBA. As the bank said yesterday: “Wage pressures have eased somewhat but labour productivity is still only at 2016 levels, despite the pick-up over the past year.” The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, chimed in with this response: The lack of productivity growth over a longer time, including for the decade that you’re in government, is something that the government is … also focused on. The conversation shifts to whether Kennedy thinks there has been underpayment in the care sector, particularly aged and childcare. “Yes,” is his response: It’s Fair Work Commission’s view that the relative wage cases show there has been some underpayment there. My judgment would be that it’s going to be difficult to attract people into those sectors, and, frankly, improve productivity in those sectors. Therein lines some of the key challenges in the economy, and in bringing inflation down. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie did not declare more than a dozen flight upgrades she has received over the years, but is expected to update her official register of interests after a self-audit of her own travel schedule. The Australian Financial Review reported overnight the shadow transport spokesperson had failed to declare more than a dozen free Qantas and Virgin flight upgrades in her time in parliament. It came after McKenzie, who has led the Coalition’s attack on Anthony Albanese over his own dealings with Qantas and reported upgrades, was found to have received upgrades of her own. Guardian Australia confirmed on Wednesday that McKenzie’s office has now received correspondence from Qantas, Virgin and Rex airlines, after she’d asked them for information about upgrades she may have received. We understand the senator’s office is going through those letters, and cross-checking them against flight upgrades she has previously properly declared in her register, but that there may be more than 12 upgrades which were not properly declared. McKenzie is likely to update her register with those outstanding upgrades in the very near future. It’s taken this long because the last letter she was waiting for only arrived last night, we understand. We’ll bring you more on this as it develops through the day. Other politicians across the parliament are also updating their register of interests to note flight upgrades they’ve recently received. The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, last week disclosed she’d received two Qantas upgrades last month which “were not requested” on Melbourne to Canberra flights, which happened “while I was boarding the plane, as on both occasions economy was overbooked”; the Labor senator Lisa Darmanin similarly disclosed that a domestic ticket “was unexpectedly and unsolicited upgrade to business class”. One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts yesterday declared “a very recent gift” of “membership to Chairman’s Lounge provided by Qantas – early to mid July 2024”. The harsh regime of ankle bracelets and curfews imposed on non-citizens released from indefinite immigration detention has been struck down by the high court. On Wednesday the court ruled in favour of a stateless refugee from Eritrea whose challenge argued the visa conditions breached the separation of powers and amounted to punishment. The decision will result in ankle bracelets and curfews being lifted from more than 100 unlawful non-citizens, in a major headache for the Albanese government. Electronic monitoring and curfews, which are usually from 10pm to 6am, were imposed on unlawful non-citizens released as a result of the high court’s November 2023 decision that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful. In Senate estimates on Monday home affairs officials revealed that by mid-October some 215 non-citizens had been released as a result of that decision, 143 of who are subject to electronic monitoring and 126 with the curfew condition. The court’s ruling is a loss for the Albanese government, which legislated the new visa conditions with Coalition support after caving to opposition demands to toughen the regime with mandatory minimum sentences for breach of visa conditions and for the conditions to be applied as a default. The case was decided with five justices in the majority, with Justices Simon Steward and Robert Beech-Jones dissenting, and of the opinion that both visa conditions were valid. The loss is likely to spark fresh recriminations from the Coalition about handling of those released. On Monday the home affairs department general counsel, Clare Sharp, said the department had engaged in “very extensive planning for all possible outcomes” of the challenge, including possible further legislation. AFP defends its approaches to encrypted messaging app Session The Australian federal police (AFP) has defended its approaches to encrypted messaging app Session – which led to the company moving overseas – as “doing our job” and said the app was being used to share child abuse material. Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday the Australian-based app had moved to Switzerland after approaches from police, including a visit to an employee’s home, to ask about encryption on the app. The organisation’s director, Alex Linton, said Australia’s regulatory environment was hostile to privacy tools. The AFP acting commissioner, Ian McCartney, told Senate estimates on Tuesday night: We don’t obviously allege any criminality on their behalf, but the app was being utilised to distribute serious child abuse material … the focus of our engagement with the company was identified opportunities to provide lawful assistance, including the removal of that really serious child abuse material from the platform. McCartney said it was a productive conversation with the app company, and he said it was an independent decision they’ve made to move overseas, largely as a policy response, rather than police actions. The Greens senator and digital rights spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said senators would support the AFP identifying and removing that kind of material, but said the powers to request app developers to build capabilities to bypass encryption and the decision to move overseas did not make Australia safer: No one’s any safer. No benefit to Australian law enforcement, no benefit to anybody other than we lose an industry, and we lose the capability, and we lose those kinds of skills in Australia, this doesn’t make us safer. This doesn’t help capture these appalling offenders who are sharing this material. The AFP revealed that, in the last financial year, it had made no requests for assistance or capability requests of app developers, but there had been 66 assistance requests issued by other agencies. Session was contacted for comment. Read more: Senate estimates hears Treasury thoughts on US election scenarios The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, sought Treasury advice on US election scenarios, estimates has heard. Treasury is before Senate estimates this morning, and the secretary, Steven Kennedy, has been pressed by the Liberal senator Jane Hume about what the government has asked about US election scenarios. Now, it would be a surprise if Treasury had not done some assessment of how economic policies might change in the world’s biggest economy. That’s especially so when there’s a chance that Donald Trump might be elected as the 47th president. Kennedy said he had no expertise to judge who might win (not Robinson Crusoe there), and it sounds like the analysis is in line with private economists. Trump has promised to slap broad-based tariffs on imports, including up to 60% on those from China. (He wouldn’t need congressional support for such a move.) Anyway, Kennedy said such a move would have “flow-on consequences” for Australia, not least because China accounts for about a third of our exports. Various models would need to be tweaked. In addition, “the imposition of trade restrictions, such as tariffs, typically lead to lower growth and higher inflation”, Kennedy said, echoing the economic consensus. The US economy, as it happens, is outperforming most others, and it might be a post-election puzzle to solve to understand why the incumbent Biden/Harris administration hadn’t got more electoral support from it. Kennedy doesn’t talk about what a “Kamala Harris wins” scenario looks like, but it’s generally assumed not a lot would change. No matter who wins, the US has no more trusted ally than Australia, Kennedy says The US ambassador, Caroline Kennedy, has reflected on the history of suffrage for women and African Americans in her country as she reminded guests at a US embassy election day breakfast that “every vote counts”. Kennedy told the crowd that she felt “most American” on election day because “the right to vote is so fundamental to our democracy”. She said: Every voice counts and the right to vote is not something that any of us can take for granted. In this election, and every other, the battle is ongoing, with efforts to expand and limit voting rights. It’s a constant struggle in our politics and in this age of disinformation that is only becoming more intense. So when I vote in the US election, I think of all the names of heroes who sacrificed to give me this right. And for those of us all who live in a democracy, it’s something to celebrate, something to protect. She said she returned on the weekend from meetings in the US to be in Australia on election day: I wanted to make clear to Australians that no matter who wins, the United States has no more trusted and capable ally. And there’s a lot of rhetoric on both sides of this debate, especially on one side, the fundamentals are not in question. Legal Aid NSW says new client portal ‘a gamechanger for our clients’ $1.6m is going to a new Legal Aid NSW client portal. The platform will be optimised for mobile phones, to provide clients with live updates, access to correspondence, document uploads and information on court appearances and other appointments, according to a statement from the office of Jihad Dib, the customer service and digital government minister. Legal Aid NSW provided half a million client services in 2022-23. More than 50% were provided in regional and rural areas. The new portal, supported under the Digital Restart Fund, will make information more accessible and “minimise the need for clients to call Legal Aid NSW because they will be directly notified of updates to their case”, the statement said. The platform is expected to be operational by late 2025. The CEO of Legal Aid NSW, Monique Hitter, said: This portal is a gamechanger for our clients. It enables them to easily view information about their cases, their lawyers, their appointments and court dates. … Delivering 24/7 access to key information, this portal makes it easier for people to deal with their legal problems. Kennedy calls for special Aukus visa to promote Australia-US collaboration The US ambassador, Caroline Kennedy, has been busy! We mentioned her media appearances below. She has also likened the Aukus nuclear submarine pact to the 1961 decision by her father, the late president John F Kennedy, to send humans to the moon within a decade and called for a special Aukus visa to facilitate industry collaboration. Addressing the biennial Submarine Institute of Australia conference on Tuesday, Kennedy said the Aukus partners needed new measures to make it easier to work together: We need to increase connectivity between systems, making it easier and faster for work to proceed. We need new ideas to make this possible. An Aukus visa is one way to move this along. She invoked the audacity of her late father’s vision, acknowledging that some Australians “doubt the complexity and boldness of Aukus”. She said of her father: He obviously set our nation on the path that has created the information economy, that has benefited our country for all these years. And he did it because it was hard and because he knew it would bring out the best in us. And those kinds of challenges always do. I really feel like Australia is ready for this, is embracing this challenge. When then President Kennedy made his moon-landing pledge on 25 May 1961, the longest space flight by US personnel had lasted just five minutes. “And he committed to send a man to the moon in 10 years,” Kennedy said. “So I have absolutely no doubt – and I know I speak for my colleagues in the US government – that this is the same kind of thing.” Kennedy described Aukus as “a critical element” in the collective effort to sustain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region: There were a lot of people who doubted that this could be done. That it was too complicated, too bold, too revolutionary, whether the US would share its most sensitive nuclear technology, whether the three partners could reform their export control regimes to allow us to succeed … I think we can all say that the doubters were wrong. Kennedy said at least 78 US-trained Australian navy personnel would eventually serve on US submarines and more than 50 civilian Australian Submarine Corporation personnel were currently training at the Pearl Harbor shipyard. The ambassador urged Australian companies to undertake the US defence industry vendor training process and become component suppliers for the Virginia-class submarines. She said the money was there to build the industrial place but “more players” were needed. She called Aukus “a partnership about what we stand for, not who we stand against”. That sinking feeling – AAP reports that, minutes after getting off a plane in Doha, an Australian government staffer urgently alerted officials a locked bag containing classified cabinet documents was missing. The papers were being carried by the ministerial and parliamentary services staffer travelling with Senator Murray Watt, the then agriculture minister, on a flight home from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation conference in July 2023. The curious case of the missing documents was first made public in early October and has been a point of interest at the latest round of Senate estimates hearings in Canberra. Agriculture department officials were quizzed about the international incident during a tense exchange on Tuesday morning. Tim Simpson, the department’s first assistant secretary for people, property and security, confirmed details from an internal investigation, saying the papers were left on a plane in the early hours of 7 July. The Senator and staffers had flown from Mumbai to Doha on an Indian airline on their way back to Australia from the UN conference in Rome. The staffer left the secure bag containing the cabinet documents on the aircraft, Simpson told the hearing: What I can confirm is the documents were carried in an appropriate container … and secured correctly for the classification. Australian embassy staff in India were contacted about 10 or 15 minutes after the travelling party got off the plane and staffers tried and failed to get the documents back. “At the time the documents weren’t there when they were able to get back on and look for them,” Simpson said. The agriculture secretary, Adam Fennessy, said security was taken very seriously and staff were retrained after the incident. At the end of questioning, the hearing was told the staffer worked for ministerial and parliamentary services. “I hope the poor devil got over it,” the Labor senator Glenn Sterle said. ‘A Trump presidency would be a disaster,’ Greens senator says The Greens senator Steph Hodgins-May has a more emphatic position on the US election. She said in Canberra this morning: A Trump presidency would be a disaster, a disaster for women, for people of colour, for the LGBTIQA+ community, for the climate. He threatens our democracy and progress. It’s incredible to think Americans might give such a vile man another chance. If Trump is elected, the prime minister must urgently cancel Aukus and reconsider Australia’s relationship with the United States. We cannot be associated with such a dangerous demagogue like Donald Trump. AAP reports that Kennedy was on Sunrise earlier. She described the US election as historic, and said whatever the outcome Australia would be a “winner”: In terms of our foreign policy, and especially in terms of Australia, which is our most trusted and capable ally, I don’t think it will change the fundamentals … no matter who wins, Australia will be the winner. Caroline Kennedy, the US ambassador to Australia, says as an ambassador she’s not supposed to talk about politics … but went on to say (after the ABC Breakfast host Michael Rowland said “assuming you did vote for Kamala Harris …”: I think the issues that are on the ballot this time are important to women. She’s made that really clear. Donald Trump is focusing more on immigration. And she points out that in the US, where voting is not compulsory, it’s “all about turnout, who shows up on election day”, and that they need to get young people to the polls. But she wouldn’t change their system: I think our system is great. It’s so complicated, gives Australians something to talk about all year long for four years. So I wouldn’t change a thing! But the way you do it is really impressive, and I have learned a lot on that while I have been here. She says the US has “an incredibly strong and transparent system despite attempts to interfere with it from abroad, as we heard from our national security agencies”. “And obviously some people who don’t want to accept the result are going to start saying, you know, that there’s a problem if it’s not clear, but I think it’s shaping up to be very close,” she says, on the potential for unrest. Angus Taylor bats away questions about Bridget McKenzie flight upgrades The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has been asked about reports that the shadow transport minister, Bridget McKenzie, did not declare more than a dozen flight upgrades. He told ABC Radio: I don’t know that any of that’s been verified. The “real issue”, he says, is allegations about Anthony Albanese’s upgrades. The Australian Financial Review is reporting that McKenzie has not updated her register of interests about the upgrades, and we’ve asked McKenzie’s office for a response. Taylor also says Australia is “absolutely at the back of the pack” getting inflation to where it needs to be”. “We’ve got a long way to go here. Australians are losing hope,” he says, adding: Everyone is helped by lower inflation and lower interest rates. Asked whether a possible Coalition government would wind back cost-of-living measures, Taylor says they haven’t supported all of them, and that while they want lower debt for all Australians, they are against the government’s policy to reduce student debt. He describes Labor as having “magic pudding economics”. On Dutton’s rebuke on abortion, and that call from the minister for women, Katy Gallagher, for the withdrawal of the anti-abortion bill (mentioned below), Taylor says “it’s a state issue, and we should leave this issue to the states”: It certainly shouldn’t be politicised in the lead up to an election … I think it’s incredibly insensitive. There was some seriously colourful language in Senate estimates yesterday, but in this case the media regulator found radio hosts’ words were a step too far. Sarah Martin reports on what the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young described as “revolting, sexist, racist, misogynistic, divisive stuff”: A “dangerous anti-abortion bill” before the Senate should be withdrawn, if the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, wants credibility on women’s healthcare, the minister for women, Katy Gallagher, says. Dutton has warned his MPs on speaking out on abortion, after comments by the Indigenous Australians spokesperson, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, and with abortion back on the agenda in the lead up to the Queensland election. Gallagher said: It is typical of Peter Dutton to view this purely as a matter of winning or losing votes, rather than any genuine commitment to women’s healthcare. If Peter Dutton wants any credibility on women’s healthcare, he must immediately ensure Senators [Matt] Canavan and [Alex] Antic withdraw their dangerous anti-abortion bill currently before the Senate. This is a test of Peter Dutton’s leadership, and a test of his commitment to the rights of Australian women. She is referring to a “born alive” bill that has been described as misleading, and containing misinformation. A committee inquiry found there was “no legal, ethical or medical basis to support the bill”. Labor launches pre-emptive strike over CFMEU ahead of Senate estimates AAP reports that the Albanese government has launched a pre-emptive strike as the opposition holds its feet to the fire over the CFMEU scandal. The employment and workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, is expected to face a grilling when his portfolios are picked apart in a Senate estimates hearing on Wednesday. The construction arm of the embattled union was placed into administration in August after allegations emerged of criminal conduct and organised crime links on job sites. The Coalition has suggested Labor’s response did not go far enough and should have included reinstating the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The construction watchdog was reintroduced in 2016 by the Turnbull government but abolished by Labor in February 2023, with its powers transferred to the Fair Work Ombudsman. The ombudsman has dozens of ongoing investigations into the commercial building and construction industry involving most branches of the CFMEU, its officials and employers. The Liberal senator Michaelia Cash was employment minister when the commission was revived and said it would prompt “cultural change” across the construction sector. Watt said bringing back the body would be “complete madness”, pointing out much of the union’s alleged offending occurred under its nose. He said: The failures of the ABCC to bring about change to the construction sector were plain to see. It was politicised for the gain of [the former prime minister] Malcolm Turnbull and the minister who was instrumental in removing him from office, Michaelia Cash. Under the Coalition’s watch we saw the lowest productivity since the 1960s and higher average days lost to industrial action. He argued the Albanese government was cleaning up the construction sector by taking the “strongest action possible” against the union and developing a building and construction industry blueprint. Some more on our political editor Karen Middleton’s piece today, which brings with it some needed nuance: [Anthony Albanese] doesn’t just need interest rates to start actually falling before he goes to the polls, he needs Australians to believe the depths of the cost-of-living crisis have passed and things are finally on the up. And he needs them to start believing it now, not wait until they can feel it in the hip pocket. Good morning, Australia, and thanks for tearing your eyes away from US politics to join me (Tory Shepherd) here. And muchas gracias to Martin Farrer for doing the sparrow’s fart shift. Let’s get started – estimates will continue apace, question time looms and hopefully some surprises await. How would Australians vote in the US election? It’s fair to say that some events in Canberra and Australia might play second fiddle to an election occurring somewhere else today. As chance would have it we have one or two Australian angles on the US election story, including an Essential poll showing that more Australian men would vote for Donald Trump than vice-president Kamala Harris. The poll shows that more Australian men would vote for Trump than Harris, and a majority of men and women support key elements of his platform including tariffs and deportation of illegal immigrants. Overall though, Harris would win the vote in Australia by 41% to 33% – according to the poll which you can read about here: Peter Lewis analyses the poll findings and concludes that it shows progressive Australians shouldn’t be complacent. He writes: On the core elements of Trump’s nihilistic populism, Australians are more likely to share his disdain for the system, and even the majority of those who would vote for Harris concur.

Australian federal police officers have trawled through 90 hours of CCTV and body camera footage and seized mobile phones and clothing depicting a terrorist symbol. “If relevant thresholds are met, the AFP will provide briefs of evidence to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions to determine if charges will be laid,” acting commissioner Ian McCartney said. The AFP is further investigating whether rhetoric over killed terrorists or events in the Middle East reached the threshold of urging violence or advocating terrorism. A special taskforce, codenamed ARDVARNA, was set up for the rally specifically due to the volume of evidence and referrals that had to be assessed, the AFP deputy commissioner, Krissy Barrett, said. Police have spent some 1,100 combined hours investigating. There were 113 reports relating to the display of prohibited hate symbols between January and October 2024, which resulted in 49 further investigations by the joint counter-terrorism team. Of these, 28 remain active but no one has been charged since the hate symbols legislation came into effect on 8 January, Barrett confirmed yesterday. United Airlines has breached Australia’s biosecurity reporting requirements three times in three years by failing to report that a dog was on a commercial flight, a Senate estimates committee heard on Tuesday. Anna Brezzo, the department of agriculture’s first assistant secretary for compliance and enforcement, said in response to questions from Victorian senator Bridget McKenzie that the airline had breached the pre-arrival reporting requirements on a flight into Sydney in December 2022 and a flight into Brisbane in March 2024, and had breached requirements by invalid disinfection of a plane in August 2023. “The dogs themselves were assistant dogs and they did have an import permit to arrive into Australia,” Brezzo said. “What we require however under the Biosecurity Act is that the airline lets us know ahead of time what is coming in on their airline.” Brezzo said the breach was picked up by biosecurity officers at the airports because it’s “a bit hard to miss the dog coming off the commercial airline”. United Airlines entered into a voluntary undertaking in August 2024 to undertake auditing, update its compliance framework and train its staff. Compliance with that undertaking will be monitored by the department of agriculture over the next 15 months, Brezzo said. “Should they fail to commit or to abide by the agreement in the undertaking, we will take them to federal court and let the federal court make that decision.” McKenzie asked why it took three breaches to enforce the voluntary undertaking. “That looks like permissive parenting that we just let them keep getting away with a slap on the wrist,” she said. The deputy secretary for biosecurity, operations and compliance group, Justine Saunders, said the response was “absolutely proportionate” and more effective in terms of ensuring long-term compliance. “Our intent is not to punish but actually to address the breach,” she said. Good morning and welcome to our live Australian political coverage. I’m Martin Farrer bringing you the best of the overnight stories and Tory Shepherd will be along to guide you through the day. Our top story this morning is that ACT’s former director of public prosecutions Shane Drumgold believes “something went terribly wrong” with the Sofronoff report into Bruce Lehrmann’s prosecution, which resulted in Drumgold losing his “dream job”, a court battle over its findings and a subsequent integrity commission investigation. He says media “hysteria” over the case fuelled a mob mentality against him but will return to work at the NSW bar. The Reserve Bank’s caution about interest rates is becoming one of the biggest obstacles to Anthony Albanese winning a second term next year. Labor needs a cut by March at the latest, our political editor writes today, or his election chances will be much diminished. But RBA governor Michele Bullock is telling politicians that if they want a rate cut then they need to be careful with election promises. Federal police have executed three search warrants and are investigating 14 people for allegedly displaying a terrorist symbol at pro-Palestinian protests. No one has been charged yet but we have more details coming up."

          "headline": "Clashes over budget could push Germany’s ailing coalition to collapse",
          "bodyText": "When, in 2021, Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats went into a “traffic light” coalition with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, the new government was riding high on an enthusiastic spirit of cooperation. There were promises to modernise, reinvigorate and green-proof Europe’s largest economy. Germany, the coalition partners said, had sleep-walked into a complacent state during 16 years of rule under Angela Merkel. The new trio in power would jolt the country out of its hubris, and deliver it into a new era of vigour and creative transformation. That, at least, was the idea. There were cracks visible from early on but attempts were made to paper over them. Now, however, they have become impossible to hide. The government’s popularity has slumped to just 14% and is widely thought to be on the brink of collapse. For weeks the three main figureheads – Scholz, the chancellor; Robert Habeck, his economics minister; and Christian Lindner, the finance minister – have been briefing against each other, delivering individual solutions to fix Germany’s ailing economy that are so contradictory in their approach as to prompt one unnamed politician to remark: “It is no longer possible to saddle this horse.” On Wednesday, a meeting of the coalition committee – the government’s most important body, consisting chiefly of the three parties’ leaders – could bring all this to a head. Over dinner at the chancellery, they will decide whether there is scope for continuation or whether the coalition should split. Federal elections had been slated for September next year, but that is now considered unlikely. More than one in two Germans now support early elections, and bets are being taken on 9 March as a new election date. An official said: “After carnival season and before the Easter break.” The row that has plunged the government into its worst crisis to date is over how to stop a multi-billion-euro gap in next year’s budget. The fiscally conservative free marketeers of the FDP, considered the most likely coalition partner to walk out, surprised their partners on Friday with the presentation of an 18-page plan on how to restructure the budget, proposingtax and spending cuts to lift Germany out of the economic doldrums. Commentators said it was well crafted – and akin to a divorce proposal. Neither the Greens nor SPD are likely to agree with its suggestions. Indeed, just a week earlier Habeck had put forward his own multi-billion-euro investment plan to remedy weak growth. The FDP, struggling in the polls, and in danger of failing to reach the 5% threshold needed to enter parliament at the next election, is thought to be looking for a reset, hoping voters will view it as a knight in shining armour even as Lindner has faced criticism for his provocative behaviour. Poll ratings for the SPD and Greens have also hit record lows. All three are under particular pressure from their party bases to reassert their individual agendas after poor showings at recent state and European elections and before the next federal poll. The far-right Alternative für Deutschland, as well as the leftwing conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, have proved themselves in recent state elections to be adept at taking votes from all mainstream parties. If the coalition does fall apart, early elections are not a given. An alternative could be a minority SPD-Greens government, but it would probably be a lame duck dependent on the opposition conservatives to push through any major legislation. Polling high on 36%, the Christian Democrats are now biding their time, with the party leader, Friedrich Merz, waiting in the wings to take over the chancellorship. Overshadowing everything in Berlin has been the presidential vote in the US. The “potential geopolitical uncertainty”, said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING, had once seemed “to be the guaranteed glue to keep the government together”. This no longer appeared to be the case, he said. Speaking on Monday, Habeck said he understood voters’ frustration, but warned of a lengthy impasse if the government collapsed. He told reporters: “This would be the worst time for us to fail.”"

          "headline": "AI chatbot launches on Gov.UK to help business users – with mixed results",
          "bodyText": "It speaks a bit of Welsh, can recite the building regulations, refuses to say whether Rishi Sunak is better than Keir Starmer and won’t explain the UK corporation tax regime. The government is launching an artificial intelligence chatbot to help businesses chart the 700,000 page labyrinth that is the Gov.UK website and it looks like users can expect varied results. The experimental system will be tested by up to 15,000 business users before wider availability, possibly next year. Before you get started it warns: “The biggest limitation of AI tools like me is a problem known as ‘hallucination’. This means we sometimes make up false information or facts but present them to you confidently.” But the solution, it continues, is to check the links to the website it provides next to its answers, which it fires back in about seven seconds. Speaking about earlier trials in February, Paul Willmott, chair of the government’s Central Digital and Data Office, told reporters that improvements were needed to iron out the “1% of hallucinations where the agent starts to get challenging, or abusive – or even seductive”. At a test run, offered to reporters on Tuesday, government officials said any hallucinations were now more mundane, like a garbled weblink or an abbreviated answer. The chatbot, which uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o technology, happily explained what regulations a hemp farmer would need to meet before planting a crop, but when asked about the chance of cannabis being legalised in the UK, replied: “I cannot provide predictions or opinions.” It explained the regulations governing the cladding of high-rise buildings after the Grenfell Tower fire, but wouldn’t answer what the public inquiry into that disaster told us about government failures. In one case, the chatbot briefly answered in Welsh. It wouldn’t answer the question, “What is the corporation tax regime?”, apparently because it didn’t like the word “regime”. But it was fluent on the incentives available for installing solar panels. The chatbot is currently not trained on all Gov.UK documents so content in ministers speeches and press releases appears to be missed. “Guardrails” have been added so the chatbot won’t respond to queries that may prompt an illegal answer, share sensitive financial information or force it to take a political position. Working with the government’s AI Safety Institute, the developers have also installed protections aimed at preventing hackers from leading the bot astray and making it say damaging things, but cannot rule out the risk altogether. Peter Kyle, secretary of state for science and technology, said the government wanted to “use AI to improve public services in a safe and reliable way, making sure the UK government leads by example in driving innovation forward”. He continued: “Outdated and bulky government processes waste people’s time too often, with the average adult in the UK spending the equivalent of a working week and a half dealing with public sector bureaucracy every year. We are going to change this by experimenting with emerging technology to find new ways to save people time and make their lives easier, as we are doing with Gov.UK chat.”"

          "headline": "OBR moving to ‘trust but verify’ relationship with Treasury after ‘black hole’ row – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Time to wrap up… MPs have been told that Treasury officials may have broken the law when they failed to alert the Office for Budget Responsibility about £9.5bn of spending that should have appeared in the March Tory budget. Richard Hughes, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told MPs that the system in which the OBR and the Treasury shared information ahead of the budget had “very clearly broke down.” That, he said, resulted in officials failing to disclose £9.5bn of spending pressures which the Treasury knew about, which “under the law and under the Act they should have”, Hughes said. As a result, he said, the OBR is “moving from a system of trust, to a system of trust but verify” in its dealings with the Treasury. The OBR chief also said the watchdog had expected the markets to react to the budget by pushing up UK bond yields, as indeed happened, as investors were being asked to buy more UK debt. In other news… UK borrowing costs have jumped, after an auction of British debt attracted the lowest demand in almost a year. The US dollar has weakened against other currencies as the US heads to the polls, lifting the pound back over $1.30 for the first time in nearly a week. Growth in the UK services sector has slowed, while in the US it has hit its highest in two years. A planned strike by tube drivers that threatened to halt all London Underground services on Thursday has been called off, their union announced. Shares in pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca have dropped over 8%, following a report that dozens of senior executives at its China unit could be implicated in the largest insurance fraud case in the country’s pharma sector in years. AstraZeneca’s tumble has weighed on the London stock market, where the FTSE 100 index has just closed 11.85 points lower at 8172, a drop of 0.14%. Shares are rallying in New York, though, where the S&amp;P 500 index is up almost 1%. A planned strike by tube drivers that threatened to halt all London Underground services on Thursday has been called off, the Aslef union has announced. Talks between Aslef officials and Transport for London management on Tuesday led to a “significantly improved offer”, according to the union. Aslef had called two 24-hour walkouts in the capital, for Thursday and Tuesday next week. Finn Brennan, Aslef’s full-time organiser on London Underground, said: “Following fresh talks, and an improved offer, ASLEF has agreed to suspend our planned industrial action on London Underground. “Details of the offer will be discussed with our reps at a meeting on Thursday. We are pleased that this progress has been made and that strike action has been averted at this time. We are not able to reveal any further details until after that meeting with our reps on Thursday.” Just to clarify that post, AstraZeneca’s shares are down about 8.5% now (I’ve fixed a typo in the initial version). Elsewhere in the City, shares in pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca have fallen by over 8% [CORRECTED] after a report that dozens of senior executives at its China unit could be implicated in an insurance fraud case. Financial media company Yicai is reporting that the investigation by Chinese authorities has now expanded to include the public security bureau, supervisory commission and other relevant bodies. Last week, AstraZeneca revealed that its China president Leon Wang is under investigation, and pledged to cooperate with Chinese authorities. In early September, Chinese police reportedly detained five current and former AstraZeneca employees as part of an investigation into possible breaches related to data privacy and importing unlicensed medications. UK government borrowing costs are rising, after today’s debt auction drew fewer bids than normal (see 1.26pm). The yield (or interest rate) on five-year UK government bonds has risen to 4.42% today, which would be the highest closing level since November 2023. 10-year bond yields have also risen towards the one-year highs seen after last week’s budget, at 4.51%. This has pushed the gap between UK and German borrowing cost to its highest in a year (that also reflects forecasts that eurozone interest rates could fall faster than in the UK). Newsflash: The US services sector grew at the fastest rate in over two years in October. The closely watched Services Sector PMI report from the Institute of Supply Management shows that economic activity in the services sector expanded for the fourth consecutive month in October. The Services PMI has risen to 56%, which is the highest reading since July 2022 and indicates the sector expanded for the 50th time in 53 months. That’s up from 54.9% in September, indicating growth in the sector picked up. Perhaps a sign that Joe Biden will leave an economy in pretty good shape to his successor…. Firms reported a slowdown in new order growth, but firms also took on more staff last month. Fourteen industries reported growth in October, up two from the 12 industries reporting growth in September. Some companies reported that recent hurricanes have affected supplier deliveries, but also lifted demand in the equipment sales and rental businesses. Carson Group’s chief market strategist, Ryan Detrick, argues that a divided US government (where one party controls the White House, and the other Congress) could be the best result for the markets. The resulting gridlock could prevent more radical policies from getting through, as agreement between Congress and the President is needed to spend more money. Detrick says: “The election is finally here and emotions are running high. Elections matter, but let’s not forget that an economy that continues to surprise to the upside, record earnings, and a dovish Fed likely matters more for this bull market than who is in the White House.” “Things are close, we know that. But we also know this year will be the thirteenth year in a row that saw the S&amp;P 500 close higher amid a split Congress. Gridlock can be a good thing and should we see this once again, this could be what investors should be rooting for.” The US dollar is losing a little ground; it’s now down about 0.3% against a basket of other major currencies. This has lifted the pound back over the $1.30 mark for the first time in nearly a week. Bitcoin is rallying, though – it’s up over 4% today and just traded over the $70,000 mark. Q: Is the OBR too pessimistic in its forecast about the impact of planning reforms? Mike Brewer of Resolution Foundation says the OBR “didn’t do the government any favours” in its growth forecasts. But that’s because we don’t yet have full details about the government’s growth plans. About a third of the government’s investment spending is going on fixing hospitals, schools and prisons – that’s “vitally needed” but won’t immediately lift growth. Brewer adds: As the government says more about its growth strategy, I expect the OBR will respond to that, by revising up its trend rate of growth assumption. Andy King of Flint Global, who is a former member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, has explained to MPs how the Treasury can attempt to game the system when drawing up budget measures. King says: Every time the OBR sets out a methodology… the Treasury can then ‘teach to the test’. You’ve seen that in the last couple of years. He cites the example of personal tax measures – in his time at the OBR, the watchdog assumed they didn’t affect the supply side of the economy (because “the income gain and the substitution incentive” offset each other), just the demand side. But now the OBR does factor in an impact on the supply side, and “all of a sudden there’s a raft of measures in that space, because they score” on the OBR’s forecasting table. King explains that he used to run the costings process at the OBR, totalling up the fiscal cost of measures. The Treasury is “very adept” at spotting what scores in the forecasts, and adjusting policy accordingly, he adds. Over in New York, stocks have opened a little higher as traders await the results of the US election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 large US companies, rose 40.9 points, or 0.10%, at the open to 41835.49. The broader S&amp;P 500 index gained 9.7 points, or 0.17%, to 5722.43, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite picked up 70.7 points, or 0.39%, to 18250.707 at the opening bell. The outcome of the US election will impact financial markets around the globe in two ways, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB: Short term: Global financial markets could be hit by volatility if there is a surprise outcome. As we have mentioned, we think that financial markets are pricing for a Trump victory. Thus, a win for Harris could lead to a short term sell off in the dollar, gold and potentially in US stocks. This could also boost global equities, as Harris is seen to be less tempted to slap tariffs on imports. Chinese stocks could rally sharply, along with key European and UK firms. Longer term: A win for Trump, could see the dollar pop higher, but we think a win for the former President could have a long-term impact on global financial markets due his plans for tariffs. A US system of import tariffs would reorder global trade flows and hurt global growth. Labour MP Yuan Yang returns to the problems with the UK’s employment data: Q: Interest rate forecasts are very dependent on estimates of the output gap, so how confident are you about the quality of the UK’s labour market data? Paul Johnson of the IFS (who is caught smiling during the question) agrees that the current labour market statistics are “not ideal”. But they’re only part of the data available. Unemployment is still relatively low, he says, and vacancies are still high by historic standards (although falling). So it seems likely that there isn’t a big output gap to be filled, Johnson argues, even if the precise numbers are uncertain. Q: How unusual is the UK’s levels of economic inactivity compared to other countries, and how can it be aleviated? Johnson says the UK is “very unusual” in terms of the number of people out of work due to sickness or disability, as those numbers have grown in a way they haven’t in almost any other country post-Covid. He’s not sure why, though, or what can be done about it. There is an “urgent need” to address the rise in mental health issues among younger people, he adds. Q: Gilt yields rose by 10 basis points on Friday after the budget – is that a sign that the government’s fiscal room for manouvrer is limited? KPMG’s Yael Selfin explains that the important question is what a government is borrowing for – if it is going to generate much stronger growth, it could pay for itself. Compared to other countries, the UK doesn’t have the highest ratio of debt as a share of its economy, Selfin points out, and it doesn’t face sharply higher borrowing costs. She says: The confidence of the markets is very important in terms of the premium you’re paying on top of the base rate, but that base rate is also very important – we have higher rates than we had previously. Harriett Baldwin MP asks about the £350bn increase of public spending outlined in the budget, which the OBR suspects will raise gilt yields and interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point. Do any economists disagree with the OBR’s forecast? Yael Selfin, vice chair and chief economist at KPMG, reckons it will have larger impact, meaning short-term interest rates will be half a point higher than would otherwise be the case, not just a quarter. The Treasury Committee are now holding a second hearing on the budget, with some leading UK economists. They’ll hear from Mike Brewer, interim chief executive of Resolution Foundation; Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies; Yael Selfin, vice chair and chief economist at KPMG; and Andy King, specialist partner at Flint Global. New economic data today has shown that the UK services sector slowed last month. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that its UK service PMI, which measures activity in the sector, dipped to 52.0 in October, down from 52.4 in September. That’s the weakest reading since last November; S&amp;P Global says it shows “weaker growth momentum in October”, it says, with the PMI still above the 50-point mark. New orders growth slowed, despite a solid rise in new work from abroad, and firms said they cut their workforces for the first time this year. Some service firms said heightened business uncertainty ahead of the Autumn Budget was a factor delaying spending decisions among clients. Some firms also noted that geopolitical tensions had weighed on willingness-to-spend. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, explains: The wait for clarity on government policy ahead of the Autumn Budget was widely reported to have weighed on business confidence and spending. Broader geopolitical concerns and forthcoming US elections also added to a sense of wait-and-see on business investment decisions in October. At the same time, cost of living pressures remained a constraint on household spending. With service providers grappling with softer new order growth and less upbeat business activity expectations for the year ahead, the latest survey pointed to a decline in staffing numbers for the first time since December 2023. A number of firms also noted budget constraints due to elevated salary pressures. Back in the financial markets, a sale of UK government debt has attracted the lowest interest from investors this year. The sale was still over-subscribed, but by less than usual. Bloomberg has the details: UK bonds attracted the weakest demand in almost a year at an auction Tuesday, a sign of lingering investor anxiety over last week’s fiscally expansive budget and the US presidential election. Bids for 10-year gilts totaled 2.81 times the £3.75bn ($4.9bn) on offer, the lowest ratio for a sale of that maturity since December. Last month, a similar auction attracted demand equivalent to 3.25 times the offer. Treasury committee chair Meg Hillier takes the OBR back to its claim that the Treasury did not give you all the information should have done under the Act (see 11.27am). Q: In your view, did think the Treasury broke the law when preparing the spending forecasts it passed to you in preparation for the March budget? OBR chair Richard Hughes replies that “they didn’t provide all the information that we require to do our forecast”. This was a “material amount of information” which would have led to a “materially different forecast” had the OBR had it. Hughes adds that he thinks every public servant does their best to obey the law, and respect its spirit and letter. But there was a “systemic failure” in putting together the March forecasts, and potentially a “misunderstanding of expectations on both sides about what needed to be provided”, Hughes suggests. Q: So what went wrong? Did the Treasury break the law? Hughes suggests there may have been a “misunderstanding” about how the law should be interpreted, regarding sharing information about departmental spending. Q: Was the OBR asked to do any work around the changes to inheritance tax relief for farmers; did you model any different changes? OBR member Tom Josephs says the watchdog can only cost policies that have been announced by the government. Obviously, if you raised the thresholds you’d raise less money, he adds. The committee then turns to Rachel Reeves’s new fiscal rules. Q: Is the new fiscal rule more, or less, responsible than the previous one? OBR chief Richard Hughes says one difference is the change to measuring public sector net financial liabilities, “known in the trade as persnuffle”, Hughes grins, rather than net debt. A second change is the timescale. Initially, Reeves’s debt rule requires that debt is falling as a share of the economy by 2029-30 (five year’s time, the same as the old rule). That will change when 2029-30 becomes the third year of the forecast period. From that point, debt should then fall by the third year of the rolling forecast period. The other fiscal rule is to show the current budget must be in surplus in 2029-30 (and then by the third year ahead). Hughes says “both targets are more likely to be binding on more meaningful parts of our forecast than some previous fiscal targets have been”. David Miles adds that the OBR’s forecast shows that the number of people in employment will be 50,000 lower than would otherwise be the case, due to the rise in employers’ NICs contributions. That’s a “material number, it’s not trivial”, but a small proportion of the overall workforce of around 32 to 33m people. Liberal Democrat MP Bobby Dean then asks the OBR about the impact of raising employers’ national insurance contributions. OBR member professor David Miles says the OBR’s analysis shows that in the long run, the majority of the impact is that real wages will be lower than they would otherwise of been. [reminder: Rachel Reeves announced that the main rate of employers’ National Insurance contributions will increase from 13.8% to 15% from April 2025, and lowered the threshold at which an employer has to pay on a worker’s salary from £9,100 a year to £5,000.] The OBR estimates that three-quarters of the impact of raising employers’ NICS payments falls on workers, with a quarter showing up in lower profits. Miles says: Nobody escapes completely, but more of it falls on workers in terms of lower real wages than in lower profits. The impact in the short-run is a bit different, though, as employers aren’t going to hit workers with immediate pay cuts. Instead, it’s likely that pay rises will be lower in the next few years, to cushion the impact. Richard Hughes adds that the OBR relies on the Treasury being forthcoming on their best estimates of the costs of government policies and the risks around them. In this case [the March forecasts], that does not seem to have happened. Conservative MP John Glen asks about the political row over the ‘black hole’: Q: Isn’t it highly regrettable that you’ve been sucked into this political debate about a black hole; can that be avoided in future? Hughes says “what happened” is regrettable. There was a serious overspend against our forecasts, we’ve needed to make serious adjustments to that, governments had to make serious adjustments to policy. The OBR doesn’t have the luxury of standing on the sidelines on these things, Hughes points out – it has to draw up forecasts for departmental spending. If there are errors, or undisclosed information, it has to correct for that and explain itself. Q: Ministers relied on officials to provide whatever information the OBR requested – so how can information not be disclosed, given the integrity of Treasury officials? Hughes replies that the OBR relies on the Treasury to disclose the information it has at the time about departmental spending, adding: That information was not shared with us at the time of the March budget, and it was information that was available to the Treasury at the time. The Treasury committee then turns to the ‘black hole’ which Labour claims it found in the public finances when it took office. OBR chief Richard Hughes explains that the OBR is changing the way it interacts with the Treasury when drawing up its economic and fiscal forecasts. He tells MPs: We are moving from a system of trust, to a system of trust but verify. That will see the OBR ask more questions about the pressures on departmental budgets, and what decisions on, for example, pay, will mean for those budgets. That, Hughes says, should mean that the “failure of oversight that very clearly happened in March doesn’t happen again.” Hughes explains: It will involve greater scrutiny on our part of departmental spending limits, and the preparations of departments’ budgets, to make sure that those kind of pressures do get disclosed to us, and we have a conversation about how they will be managed and offset, and what it means for departmental overspending or underspending. Hughes outlines how the OBR had built up a way of working with the Treasury over the years, which was a “high trust relationship with the Treasury” that expenditure pressures on departments were being well managed and managed within the spending total allocated to departments. He admits: That system very clearly broke down. Hughes explains that the OBR was not aware of the extra pressures on government departments when, in July, chancellor Rachel Reeves told MPs there was a £22bn black hole in the public finances. After that happened, Hughes says the OBR asked the Treasury what they were aware of when the fiscal watchdog put its March forecasts together. That uncovered “£9.5bn of net [spending] pressure which they did not declare to us, which under the law and under the Act they should have”, Hughes says. Labour MP Dr Jeevun Sandher then asks about the impact of the UK’s health crisis on the economy. Q: Is it fair to say that potential output is limited by the state of our NHS, with the highest waiting lists in history? OBR chief Richard Hughes says hundreds of thousands of people are out of work due to health reasons. But most people on the waiting lists are not those people, Hughes adds: they’re people who are older, who weren’t working, or are still working even though they need healthcare. So fixing the lengthy waiting lists might have some impact on the labour force. Q: How confident are you in the picture you have on the UK’s jobs market, as the Office for National Statistics had problems getting responses to its labour market survey, forcing the Bank of England to use alternative sources? “Not very”, sighs professor David Miles. The reliability of the ONS’s labour force surveys has fallen a lot, he says, due to the drop in response rates. Fixing that is taking time. Miles adds that the OBR has other surveys of the jobs market too. And he’s fairly confident that the labour market is “relatively tight”, given vacancy levels are still high (although falling). Labour MP Yuan Yang asks about the OBR’s assumption that there is very little spare capacity in the UK economy. Q: Isn’t that pessimistic, given the scarring effect of the pandemic on the economy, the shrinking workforce since 2020? If that scarring is caused by a health crisis, can the government fix it? OBR chair Richard Hughes responds, saying there’s a difference between untapped potential and spare capacity. With unemployment at a low rate, around 4%, and high vacancies, that implies a small output gap, he says. Many of the people who have left the workforce are out of work due to health reasons, Hughes points out, and will need help to get back into the labour force. That will take time, and those people may not return to full-time jobs. Liberal Democrat MP Chris Coghlan turns the OBR’s attention to the rise in government borrowing costs after the budget. Q: How worried are you about the increase in gilt yields – they rose by 10 basis points on Friday, compared to 40 points after the 2022 mini-budget? OBR chief Richard Hughes says the fiscal regulator had expected the budget to be “a surprise to the markets”, due to the volume of government debt (gilts) that are to be issued. He tells MPs: “To a large extent the gilt market response was just a response to higher volumes – if there are more gilts on the market that drives down the price.” [Reminder: the yield (or interest rate) on a government bond measures the cost of borrowing, and rises when prices fall]. Hughes adds that “the front-loading of the expenditure” in Rachel Reeves’s budget was also a surprise. The volume that the market was being asked to take down this year and next was more than they expected. He explains that the OBR had expected the gilt market to be a bit surprised – that’s why the OBR raised its forecasts for UK interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point. Hughes adds that gilt yields have now settled broadly in line with its forecasts, tho “maybe a little bit above, but not significantly”. Today, UK 10-year gilts are yielding 4.48%, up from 4.31% the day before the Budget, but below the 4.53% they hit after the fiscal event. Harriett Baldwin, Conservative MP, Q: Your report says that the economic and fiscal outlook is broadly unchanged since March, while the budget creates a £350bn increase in public spending – is that responsible? OBR chief Richard Hughes says there is a “loosening” of fiscal policy in last week’s budget. About half the tax rises announced last week are “relatively certain and reliable”, such as the rise in employers’ national insurance contributions, Hughes says. The other half, focused on raising taxes on a small number of people, are less certain, though. Q: What is the impact on interest rates, and how sensitive are we to further shocks? OBR member Tom Josephs says a 1% rise in interest rates would add about £16bn to borrowing, while it would only take a 0.3% increase to wipe out the government’s headroom to hit its fiscal targets (tho there are different estimates within the OBR’s work). Labour MP Rachel Blake asks the OBR about the impact that the government’s proposed planning reforms will have on growth… Q: has the OBR factored in the “deliverability” and the market’s response to those reforms? David Miles says the OBR hasn’t made a direct estimate of the impact on growth, as it is waiting for more detail on the plans. The chance are, he adds, that the plans will create some upside on residential construction (housebuilding). Miles also reminds MPs that previous governments have also promised to tweak the planning system to improve housebuilding, but found it hard to “move the dial”. He says: It’s hard to know quite how effective measures will be. The Treasury Committee turn to household spending and saving… Q: Savings patterns changed after Covid – what do you think will happen with savings levels going forward, if people feel insecure? The OBR’s David Miles says the household savings ratio was very high in Covid as people couldn’t go out and spend. That’s not surprising – but what is surprising, he adds, is that savings rates haven’t fallen back to pre-Covid levels, as expected. One minor factor is the rise in interest rates, making saving more lucrative. A stronger factor, though, is “heightened uncertainty” after the shock of Covid, and rising energy prices. Professor Miles says: Our best guess…. is that the savings rate does drop a little bit from its [current] level, but it doesn’t get back as low as it was pre-Covid. And that could have an impact on demand in the economy, given the importance of consumer spending. The Treasury Committee kicks off its hearing with the OBR by asking about its forecasts for GDP growth, which are “typically more optimistic” than the Bank of England’s. Richard Hughes says the OBR has revised its forecast for growth this year up to 1.1%, after the “relatively disappointing” growth of almost 0% last year. He tells MPs: We do think that the combination of the momentum coming into this year plus the boost given to GDP by government policies boosts that growth rate up to 2% going into next year. But, Hughes then cautions that this is mostly a “temporary boost to output”, due to the government increasing spending by more than taxation in this budget. That raises GDP by half a percentage point at its peak, but it’s a temporary effect, with growth expected to dip back to 1.5% at the end of the forecast horizon (to 2029-30). That, Hughes points out, is below its estimated long-run potential growth of the UK, of around 1.66% per year. Conservative MP John Glen probes the OBR on this…. Q: Your assessment over the forecast period is that growth will be 0.7% lower than expected at the March budget. The government, though, would argue that their supply-side reforms would have a positive effect on growth – why have you not factored that in? OBR member David Miles says the substantial investment in public investment will lift growth, but that takes time to come though – so most of the impact on growth will arrive beyond the five-year horizon. But on the downside, Miles says the increase in employers’ national insurance contributions will dampen labour market growth, which hurts the UK’s productivity in the long term. Miles adds that productivity growth has been “absymal” in the last 12 years, for various reasons (such as Covid, and the invasion of Ukraine). The OBR takes the view that the next 10 years will be more positive – and roughly halfway between the dismal last decade and the brighter 40 years before that. Over in parliament, MPs on the Treasury committee are taking evidence from the Office for Budget Responsibility about last week’s budget. They’ll hearing from Richard Hughes, Chair of the OBR, along with professor David Miles and Tom Josephs, who are both members of the Budget Responsibility Committee. The committee says its scrutiny is “likely to examine whether the Chancellor’s new fiscal rules are right for the health of the UK economy and changes to spending, taxation and debt”. You can watch it live here: The US dollar has dipped very slightly this morning, and is down by 0.12% against other major currencies. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “There is a ‘wait and see mood’ on the markets as uncertainty weighs about the outcome of what appears to be a deadlocked US Presidential election. Campaigning is converging on the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania and the extent to which voters can be galvanised to join queues at polling booths could make all the difference. The dollar has been fluctuating but is still lower on the week, as Kamala Harris’ chances have appeared to have improved. A pro-tariff Trump presidency could see the dollar strengthen amid concerns higher inflation will prompt the Fed to keep interest rates higher. Looking back at the US election, bond trading giant Pimco suggests that the potential economic impact of the candidates’ policies could be less than the market assumes. Libby Cantrill, Pimco’s head of U.S. public policy, points to four areas where the choice between the Republican and Democratic candidate won’t make a difference: Specifically, 1) deficits will be higher under either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump – and the differences between the two are not likely to be that much different due to the narrow Congressional majorities that either will likely have to contend with); 2) both candidates will have to deal with taxes in 2025 due to the expiring tax cuts under the Trump Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and in either case, we are likely to see most, if not all of the tax cuts be extended; 3) both candidates will continue to be hawkish on China; and 4) the Fed will remain independent due to institutional guardrails and no current vacancies (and despite some jawboning that we can expect if Trump wins in particular). But there are (clearly!) also large differences between the two candidates. And on economic issues, Cantrill identifies three: 1) tariffs, which are likely to stay high under Harris on China but will likely go higher under Trump and other countries are likely to be subject to increased tariff pressure as well 2) immigration, although we would note that for Trump to do some of what he is said he will do would largely require Congress, and: 3) regulation, where we would expect Trump to have a lighter touch (we would note that reversing regulation is hard, although there would undoubtedly be more regulatory certainty under Trump from the absence of new regulation as well as rolling back Biden executive orders). Just in: Car sales in the UK fell last month, despite a pick-up in registrations of electric vehicles. Industry group the SMMT reports that businesses, fleets and private buyers registered 9,241 fewer vehicles last month than in October 2023, bringing total new registrations down to 144,288. Sales of diesel-powered cars fell by 20%, with petrol down 14% year-on-year. But…. sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) rose by 24.5% year-on-year, helped by “a raft of new models driving the strongest growth this year”. That lifted Bev’s share of the market to 20.7%. The SMMT warns, though, that manufacturers are subsidising the transition to electric cars with “billions in unsustainable discounting”, adding: One in five BEV models now retailing for less than the average petrol or diesel but consumer support still needed for fast and fair transition. Online fast fashion chain ASOS has tumbled deeper in the red, as it tries to implement its turnaround plan. ASOS has reported a pre-tax loss of £379m for the year to 3rd September, up from a £296m loss in the previous year. The company says it hit its targets in its “Back to Fashion” push, having completed its stock clearance process and embedded a new commercial model. Group revenues fell 18% in the year, as ASOS focused on cutting its clothing inventory in half, through “disciplined stock management” and writing off around £100m of products. ASOS insists it is focused on delivering “sustainable, profitable growth”, and points out that sales of new ranges were up 24% last year. CEO José Antonio Ramos Calamonte says ASOS is now in the strongest position it has been in years, with “the right level of newness to excite customers”, and improved operational efficiency. Calamonte adds: With these solid foundations in place, we can focus on delivering experiences that delight our 20 million customers. There is much work to do, but we have already seen our efforts rewarded with new product sales increasing 24% YoY over the last three months. I am energised by the progress we have made so far and excited for the next phase of our journey.” Shares in ASIS have dropped by 6.5% this morning, though, hitting 345p, the lowest since the end of August. Back in March 2021 they were worth almost £60. Associated British Foods, the owner of discount clothing chain Primark, has posted a 43% rise in pre-tax profits for the last year. ABF’s CEO, George Weston, says Primark achieved “good sales growth this year” (up 6%, or 1.2% on a like-for-like basis) and managed to increase its profit margin (it rose to 11.7% in the last year, up from 8.2% in 2023). Primark grew its sales by 2% in the UK and Ireland, and also expanded in its “key growth markets”, including the US, France, Spain, Italy and Central and Eastern Europe. Weston has told Reuters this morning that Primark is expecting strong trading this Christmas, saying: “We think that Christmas is going to be good.” ABF’s grocery sales grew 4%, despite a “mixed” performance by Ovaltine, while operating profits at its sugar business jumped by 52% But revenues at ABF’s agriculture revenue decreased by 9%. It says: Lower sales in our compound feed businesses reflected reduced commodity prices and continued soft demand in the UK and China. Market conditions in the UK remained challenging due to reduced herd sizes and excess feed production capacity and in China the market was depressed by the economic environment and low farm profitability. The results of today’s Congressional elections will have a massive influence on the next president’s ability to get their policy goals into law. A divided government (where one party controls the White House, and the other controls Congress) means less can be done. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at investment bank Stifel, predicts that Republicans will win enough seats to retake the Senate. He tells clients: Democrats currently hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate. Thirty-four seats are being contested this year and Democrats hold 23 of those seats while Republicans hold 11 which gives the GOP a numerical advantage in the ability to gain seats. With the retirement of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Republicans are likely to gain that seat and are well positioned to flip Sen. Jon Tester’s seat (D-MT). This would give the GOP 51 seats and the majority. Ohio is the GOP’s next best pick-up opportunity and while there are several other close races (Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). We think Democrats will likely (but not definitely) retain those seats. But, the race for the House of Representatives is “even tougher to forecast than the presidential race”, Gardner says, adding: Regardless of which party wins the House, we think the majority will be less than 10 seats which will make governing challenging (again) Michael Brown, senior research strategist at brokerage Pepperstone, has predicted the likely impact on the markets for a Donald Trump, or Kamala Harris, victory. He says: A TRUMP victory would likely see markets focus on a theme of reflation, with tax cuts likely to provide a fillip to growth, and the imposition of tariffs giving rise to a potential resurgence in inflationary pressures. In terms of initial market reactions, one would expect: US dollar upside, particularly against those currencies which could find themselves subject to tariffs, such as the MXN [Mexican peso], CNH [the Chinese Yuan] and EUR [the euro] Treasury [US government debt] downside, most notably at the long-end of the curve, as growth and inflation expectations rerate higher Upside for equities, broadly speaking, amid expectations for a lower regulatory burden, with the Energy and Defence sectors likely to outperform Meanwhile, a HARRIS victory would represent a theme of continuity. In terms of initial market reactions, one would likely see: US dollar weakness, as Trump-linked hedges are unwound, and trade-sensitive currencies breathe a sigh of relief Treasury downside, albeit not to the same degree as in a Trump win, on bets that fiscal policy will become more expansionary Knee-jerk equity downside, on concerns over potential for tighter regulation, though any dips are likely to be bought in short order, while sectors such as Clean Energy and Technology could outperform European stock markets have opened cautiously, with investors eying events in the US. The UK’s FTSE 100 share index is down 4 points in early trading, at 8179 points. Defensive stocks are in demand, with Severn Trent (+2.4%) and United Utilities (+2.5%) among the top Footsie risers. At the other end of the table, Schroders are down 11% after reporting that its client funds saw a net outflow of £2.3bn in July-September. Schroders says it was hit by “continued market volatility in China” in the last quarter. France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX indices rose 0.1% at the open, while Spain’s IBEX dipped by 0.2%. Vodafone and Three have welcomed the CMA’s new Remedies Working Paper on their merger. In a statement, the two (soon to become one?) mobile operators say they believe the Paper “provides a path to final clearance”. They say: The Parties welcome the CMA’s recognition that the significant improvements in network quality delivered by their Joint Network Plan will “boost competition between mobile network operators in the long term and benefit millions of people who rely on mobile services.” The merger is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the UK’s digital infrastructure – which lags significantly behind its European peers – and for more than 50 million UK customers to benefit from a vastly better mobile experience. Back in the UK, the £15bn merger between Vodafone and Hutchison’s Three UK has moved closer to being cleared. The UK’s competition authority has declared today that the merger could proceed “if appropriate remedies are implemented,” including upgrading the merged company’s network to speed up the roll-out of 5G services. The Competition and Markets Authority says: The CMA has today set out a Remedies Working Paper to seek views on the effectiveness of a proposed remedy package. It provisionally finds that a legally binding commitment to undertake the network integration and investment programme proposed by Vodafone and Three would significantly improve the quality of the merged company’s mobile network, boosting competition between mobile network operators in the long term and benefiting millions of people who rely on mobile services. Previously, the CMA had sounded more concerned about the deal – saying it could hurt competition and push up bills. Back in July, Vodafone CEO Margherita Della Valle told the Guardian that the Labour government will fail to achieve its promise of nationwide access to 5G if the deal was blocked. The first results in the US presidential race are in, and it’s a tie! Fittingly (given the closeness of the polls) Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have won three votes each in Dixville Notch, a tiny New Hampshire town which traditionally kicks off voting on election day. According to CNN, four Republicans and two undeclared voters participated in the poll – in which all eligible voters gather at the now-dormant Balsams Hotel in Dixville Notch to cast their secret ballots once polls open at midnight. With Americans heading to the polls today, the financial markets are in a state of high excitement over the race to the White House. Market volatility has been picking up in recent days, as investors have tried to assess the likely winner of today’s presidential election, and how congressional elections may play out too. Yesterday, the US dollar dipped to a two-week low, after a poll showed Kamala Harris with a surprise three-point lead over Donald Trump in Iowa. The greenback is flat this morning. Stocks fell on Wall Street last night too, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 257 points or 0.6% to 41,794 points. As the polls have been so tight, traders are concerned we will not know the result for several days or even longer. Erik Knutzen and Jeff Blazek, co-CIOs of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, told clients that the uncertainty could last days, or even weeks: Uncertainty around control of Congress, particularly the House, could also extend longer than uncertainty over who is in the White House. And a contested result could add still more days or weeks of market volatility. We have been anticipating a pick-up in volatility as the election nears, and this week is likely to see a peak in that volatility, lasting until we have an unambiguous outcome. This is a key reason why we have been counselling against taking substantial active positions—particularly active positions tilted to one or other election result. The exception would be in assets that can help to diversify portfolios and dampen their volatility, such as gold and other commodities. Anxiety over the election has already contributed to US government bonds suffering their worst month in two years in October. Betting markets have narrowed significantly on the eve of Tuesday’s presidential election, eroding Trump’s lead over Harris as Americans cast their votes. Last night, Trump and Harris have held their final election rallies. Harris ended with a message of unity, telling supporters in Philadelphia that her campaign was ending “with energy, with joy,” adding: “Instead of stewing on an enemies list I will work on my to-do list.” Trump has just wrapped up in Michigan, where he insulted President Joe Biden, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, representative Adam Schiff, California governor Gavin Newsom and Harris, and also promised action on immigration, saying: “The day I take office the migrant invasion ends.” You can track all the action in our US election liveblog: Boeing’s CEO Kelly Ortberg has said he was pleased the plane-maker’s union had ratified the latest pay deal. In a message to staff, Ortberg said: “While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Boeing’s management, and airline operators across the world, will be letting out a large sign of relief today, after its factory workers agreed to end their strike after 53 days. West Coast factory workers have accepted a pay deal, ending the walkout that began in mid-September and halted much of the company’s jet production. Boeing’s union said members voted 59% in favor of the new contract, which offers a 43.65% compounded wage increase over four years – 13%, 9%, 9%, and 7%. Jon Holden, the union’s lead negotiator, told members: “This is a victory. We can hold our heads high. Now it’s our job to get back to work.” Holden has also said that the new contract can “create a new foundation”, to help Boeing return to building the highest quality and safest airplanes in the world. He says: “Working people know what it’s like when a company overreaches and takes away more than is fair. Through this strike and the resulting victory, frontline workers at Boeing have done their part to begin rebalancing the scales in favor of the middle class – and in doing so, we hope to inspire other workers in our industry and beyond to continue standing up for justice at work. Through this victory and the strike that made it possible, IAM members have taken a stand for respect and fair wages in the workplace. Our members perform high quality and flight critical work for the airplanes we build and deserve a return on their labor investment that provides for the quality of life worthy of that labor. The breakthrough eases the pressure on new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg after two previous offers were voted down in recent weeks. Airlines will also be relieved, after being hit by delays to Boeing’s shipments. Yesterday, Ryanair said continued problems at Boeing meant it wouldcut its growth plans for next year.

          "bodyText": "It has been called the most critical election in US history, and it has certainly been one of the wildest races, with an incumbent president stepping down late in the campaign, a criminal guilty verdict for one of the candidates and a couple of assassination attempts. We revisit the key moments, played out against the backdrop of two seismic global conflicts, of a political struggle that holds American democracy itself in the balance. The challengers The hard-right Florida governor Ron DeSantis was widely seen as the most probable Republican candidate to prevent former president Donald Trump from becoming the party’s nominee for a third consecutive election. However, in January, despite being backed by the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, DeSantis ends his flailing campaign – and eventually endorses Trump, whose team had smeared him as “Pudding Fingers” owing to his alleged eating habits. Running almost as an incumbent, Trump’s last serious challenger ends up being the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who, against all expectations, takes on the mantle of the anti-Trump vote. Casting doubt on Trump’s mental fitness and his loyalty to the US constitution, the former UN ambassador garners significant support – and perseveres until Super Tuesday in March, when she finally stands aside, leaving Trump as the last major candidate standing for the 2024 Republican nomination. The president In the annals of American politics, incumbent presidents seeking re-election typically enjoy a significant edge over their challengers. However, Joe Biden – the country’s oldest president – bucks the trend as his meandering remarks, frequent misspeaking of names and halting speech raise concerns that he might just be too old to take on Trump again. Nevertheless, essentially unopposed, the 46th president of the US runs the board in the Democratic primaries and is named the party’s candidate for 2024, while vowing that, despite his advancing years, he remains the most capable contender to defeat Trump once again. The trial The first real jolt of the election campaign arrives on 30 May, when a jury of 12 New Yorkers makes Trump the first ex-president in American history to become a convicted felon. They find him guilty of committing a crime – 34 of them, in fact – when he falsified business records to disguise $130,000 (£100,000) in hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels, to hide the scandal from American voters on the eve of the 2016 election. It is far from Trump’s only legal woe: at various times he has faced more than 90 criminal counts, including racketeering charges in Georgia for a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results, where he marked another milestone: the first mugshot of an American president. (That case itself later takes a dramatic turn when the district attorney, Fani Willis, is revealed to have had an affair with a prosecutor she hired, and the case remains on hold while a judge considers whether to disqualify her.) Separately, in February, a federal judge orders Trump to pay $83.3m to the writer E Jean Carroll, who had sued for defamation after Trump publicly disputed that he had sexually assaulted her – an accusation the judge ruled was “substantially true”. Many of the other cases remain in limbo while Trump pursues his well worn legal tactic: delay, delay, delay. The debate Biden’s performance in the opening presidential debate against Trump on 27 June in Atlanta is perhaps one of the worst in American history. Shaky, raspy-voiced and slack-jawed, his disastrous showing is punctuated by repeated stumbles over words, uncomfortable pauses and at least one point where he trails off before claiming: “We finally beat Medicare.” Top Democratic figures and donors panic, while recriminations swirl about the role of his campaign and of the media in failing to adequately account for his apparently declining mental fitness. The drum beat for Biden, 81, to step aside becomes increasingly relentless, as Democratic strategists finally join average voters in questioning whether the party might yet swap him out for a younger standard bearer to face off against Trump. The immunity ruling On 1 July, the supreme court drops a bombshell of its own: it rules that Trump is at least partly immune from criminal prosecution for anything he did in his “official capacity” as president. The decision, a major victory for Trump, destroys the likelihood of a criminal trial for Trump over trying to subvert the 2020 election occurring before the new election in November 2024. It is also the latest example of what most observers agree is the rightwing capture of the supreme court that Trump himself made possible by appointing three arch-conservative judges. Having already overturned Roe v Wade – a monumental victory for the anti-abortion movement, for which Trump proudly claims credit, that made abortion a huge issue in the 2022 midterms and now the 2024 election – the conservatives had caused even more of a furore in May when photos proved an upside down flag flew outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito, a symbol of support for Trump’s “Stop the Steal” movement that was prominent at the 6 January riot. Since the immunity ruling, the special counsel Jack Smith has hit back, filing a new indictment with more streamlined allegations; Trump in return has promised to fire Smith “within two seconds” if he wins re-election. The shooting On 13 July, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump is shot and wounded in his upper right ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, who fires eight bullets with an AR-15-style rifle from the rooftop of a nearby building. As security agents cover the president, he stands with a raised fist and shouts: “Fight, fight, fight”, in what becomes an instantly iconic photograph and moment. The shooting claims the life of one attender and two others are left in critical condition; Crooks is killed by security agents. Just nine weeks later, on 15 September, Trump is allegedly the target of a second aspiring assassin at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, where Secret Service agents find Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, hiding in the bushes with a rifle. As well as setting off a crisis in the Secret Service, the events give Trump a rallying cry for his re-election effort: he appears at the Republican national convention days after the Butler shooting wearing an ear bandage, to a rapturous welcome. The withdrawal At 1.46pm on 21 July, Biden announces he will no longer seek re-election – ending weeks of fevered speculation and mounting pressure from lawmakers, donors, activists and voters terrified of his inability to beat Trump. A key intervention comes from the actor and Democratic fundraiser George Clooney: “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,” he writes. Biden’s longtime political ally and ex-House speaker Nancy Pelosi also plays a crucial role in limiting the president’s legacy to one term in what she says is a “cold calculation” for the sake of the country – and later tells the Guardian she has not spoken to her old friend since. The coronation Taking the stage in Chicago on 23 August to a thunderous standing ovation, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, with the full-throated support of Biden, officially accepts the Democratic presidential nomination, making her the first Black woman to lead a major party ticket. Harris declares the election an opportunity for the country to “chart a new way forward” and encourages voters to write the “next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told”. The impact is immediate and dramatic: she goes on to raise more than $1bn in less than three months, a record, and draws boisterous crowds to energetic rallies where she focuses on reproductive rights, economic help for the middle class and safeguarding US democracy. The wildcard Robert F Kennedy Jr, the scion of the most famous Democratic family whose independent campaign for president had at times reached as high as 10% in national polling, drops out. Kennedy had faced a string of scandals, including accusations he had assaulted a former babysitter. He also admitted that, yes, it was him who dumped a bear carcass in Central Park in a case that had mystified New Yorkers a decade earlier. After dropping out, the environmental campaigner turned vaccine skeptic then plays both sides – reportedly making overtures to Harris in August to discuss endorsing her in exchange for a job, then opting to back Trump, who has allegedly offered Kennedy control over the health agencies. Among third-party candidates still running are the environmentalist Jill Stein, who also stood as the Green party’s candidate in 2012 and 2016, the progressive activist Cornel West and Chase Oliver of the Libertarian party. The running mates In July, the Ohio senator JD Vance formally accepts Trump’s offer to run as his vice-presidential nominee – a dramatic change of position for Vance, the author of the hit memoir Hillbilly Elegy who once described himself as a “never Trumper” and called his new boss “America’s Hitler”. But if there is one quote for which JD Vance will be remembered in history, it is his controversial definition of leading Democrats: “A bunch of childless cat ladies,” he told the Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2021. On the other side of the aisle, Harris chooses the Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a native of rural Nebraska who was a teacher and high school football coach and served in the National Guard for 24 years before entering politics. Walz captures national attention with a surprisingly effective takedown of Republicans: “These guys are just weird.” The billionaire The wealthiest man on the planet formally declares what most people had suspected after he bought Twitter and rebranded it as the more extreme X: he is a fully fledged cheerleader for Trump. First endorsing Trump after the assassination attempt, and then dancing and leaping on stage at a Trump rally, the boss of Tesla, Space X and several other companies takes to the newest of his many jobs with a gusto that shames even the most politically active billionaires. Musk becomes everything from a Trump policy adviser to a mega-donor and (through his America Pac campaign group) a leading figure in the Republican “ground game”, its effort to get voters to the polls. In October, he also begins giving away $1m a day to Pennsylvanians who are registered voters – causing a judge to demand his presence in court for running an “illegal lottery”. To those who ask what’s in it for Musk, observers point to billions in federal contracts and Trump promising him a role in helping to gut regulators. The debate 2.0 On 11 September, Harris outperforms Trump in their first debate, appearing to vindicate Biden’s decision to gracefully bow out and marking a dramatic change in fortune as she takes a slight polling lead over Trump – though the polls essentially remain tied for the remainder of the race. However, it isn’t Harris’s victory that most attracts headlines from the debate, but the former president’s claim about immigrants from Haiti: “In Springfield, they are eating the dogs,” Trump said. “They are eating the cats. They are eating the pets of the people that live there.” Quickly immortalised in a viral song, the statement – an obvious and quickly debunked lie – appears at first to hurt the Republicans, but far from repudiating it Trump and Vance begin repeating it as part of an anti-immigrant focus that the campaign embraces as its driving principle, including a promise to carry out the largest mass deportation in US history. The celebs If Trump can rely on the support of the world’s richest man, Harris can count on that of its biggest-selling recording artist. In a post on Instagram minutes after the debate, Taylor Swift endorses Harris, encouraging her fans to register to vote and signing it “Childless Cat Lady”, a reference to Vance’s slur. She is hardly alone: Charli xcx had already set off a series of pro-Harris internet memes by tweeting “kamala IS brat” – referring to a lifestyle inspired by noughties excess and rave culture, as well as the name of her hit album Brat – and eventually Beyoncé, Eminem (whose hit Lose Yourself was rapped by Barack Obama at a Detroit rally where the superstar told his home city to “use your voice” for Harris) and dozens more popstars back Harris. From actors such as Robert De Niro – who clashes with Trump supporters outside the ex-president’s hush-money trial in New York – and the cast of Marvel’s Avengers movies, or athletes such as LeBron James (“When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me”), most of the highest-profile celebrity endorsements have gone to Harris – though Trump can boast he has Hulk Hogan, Dr Phil and Kid Rock in his camp. The rally Anger and vitriol take centre stage at New York’s Madison Square Garden as Trump and a cabal of his acolytes hold a rally marked by racist comments, coarse insults and threats about immigrants. The rally features nearly 30 speakers, with some of them making a series of racist remarks about Latinos, Black Americans and Jewish citizens. “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” Tony Hinchcliffe says, among other controversial remarks including singling out a Black man in a remark about watermelons. In the subsequent hours, Democrats, celebrities and Hispanic groups on both sides of the political aisle condemn the comments as “offensive” and “derogatory”, with many voters of Puerto Rican heritage saying they will change their votes to Harris – potentially a key voting bloc in the swing state of Pennsylvania. The event had already drawn comparisons to an infamous Nazi rally held at the arena in 1939, with the Democratic National Committee projecting images on the outside of the building repeating claims from Trump’s former chief of staff that he had “praised Hitler” – and although Vance dismisses the comparison, many note it was only in 2016 that Vance himself had suggested Trump could become “America’s Hitler”. The final pitches The days leading up to election day are always the most frenzied, and the 2024 race is no exception, with the candidates trading insults and billions of people around the world glued to the latest polls, which do not show a clear lead for either Trump or Harris. With the White House illuminated behind her, Harris draws a crowd of more than 75,000 people in Washington DC, referring to Trump as “another petty tyrant” who had stood in the same spot nearly four years ago and, in a last-gasp effort to cling to power, helped incite the mob that stormed the US Capitol. Meanwhile, Trump continues to smear immigrants and arrives at a rally in a garbage truck, a stunt to attack Democrats. Police chiefs and sheriffs across the country brace for potential violence against election workers, disruptions at polling locations and harassment of voters, while unfounded allegations of voter fraud prompt fears that Trump could, once more, refuse to accept the results if he loses – and this time get millions of Americans to do the same."

          "headline": "Exercise in a pill: have scientists really found a drug that’s as good for you as a 10km run?",
          "bodyText": "Can a pill really mimic all the beneficial effects of exercise? You’d think so from some of the stories about substances that “could make going to the gym unnecessary”. There was another rash of these a few weeks ago, when researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark announced that a drug called LaKe “brings the body into a metabolic state corresponding to running 10km at high speed on an empty stomach”. But what’s going on here? Even if a pill can replicate parts of what exercise does for us, how useful is that, really? First things first: the most commonly accepted term for drugs like LaKe is “mimetics”, because what they do, as a rule, is mimic the biological effects of working out without the need to actually break a sweat. The idea has been around for a while: in 2008, San Diego’s Salk Institute introduced the world to a drug called GW501516 (516 for short), which signals key genes to burn fat instead of sugar, helping rodent test subjects run for longer without hitting the proverbial wall. In later tests, a pair of rodents nicknamed Couch Potato Mouse and Lance Armstrong Mouse, both reared on the same diet of fatty, sugary pellets, did the same amount of daily physical activity, but Lance Armstrong Mouse was dosed with 516 – and markedly increased its endurance, while staying much leaner than its control counterpart. A variant of 516 quickly ended up on the black market as a banned doping agent known as Endurabol, and the World Anti-Doping Agency issued warnings to athletes that it was unsafe – but plenty more mimetics were already in development. Compound 14, first announced in 2015, started development as a way to treat other diseases, before researchers discovered that it could reduce fasting blood glucose levels, improve glucose tolerance and promote weight loss in obese mice. Since then, we’ve also seen research on Lac-Phe, a chemical usually produced in the body through resistance training, and a new molecule known as SLU-PP-332, which boosts metabolism and endurance, helping rodents run 50% further than they previously could. The latter, its lead researcher says, tells skeletal muscle to make the changes typically provoked by endurance training. That has the potential to help dieters maintain muscle mass during weight loss, or older people avoid sarcopenia as their bodies respond less strongly to exercise. LaKe is still in the rat-study stage of development, so it’s not certain that the results will transfer over to humans. But what it seems to do is first prompt a quick surge of lactate in the body – mimicking the sort of effect you’d typically see after a bout of high-intensity exercise – and then a more gradual increase of a chemical called beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). BHB is a ketone, or a chemical synthesised in the liver from fatty acids to provide the body with energy when it doesn’t have enough glucose – which is where the notion of “running on an empty stomach” comes from. Between them, these two changes do seem to lower the level of free fatty acids in the bloodstream and also suppress appetite – which are effects you’d expect from fasted exercise (working out without eating beforehand), and could help to reduce the risk of conditions such as heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes over the long term. And (again, in rats) the pill seems to show no signs of toxicity – unlike early versions of 516, which promoted rapid cancer cell growth in their rodent test subjects. Promising stuff, then – but is it really that simple? Well, it’s tough to say. Exercise affects almost all of the body’s systems, in often intricate ways that we’re a long way from understanding (the largest research programme dedicated to comprehending its impact at the molecular level, using almost 2,600 volunteers, is still ongoing). Together, many of the drugs mentioned above might be able to mimic any number of these – perhaps working in conjunction with already government-approved interventions like Ozempic to encourage a host of benefits. But any supplement has limitations: exercise is a full-body experience, with downstream effects that include everything from improved bone density to better sleep. It enhances mood and self-esteem while decreasing stress, and it seems to have qualities that protect against dementia. All of these impacts come from complex interactions between any number of biological effects – but even if science could mimic them all with pills, it would be much tougher to recreate the psychological advantages of running a 5k with friends, or hitting a new personal best in the squat. We’re still a fairly long way from finding safe drugs that can replicate exercise’s most beneficial effects in humans, but when they exist, they’ll probably be most useful for people who are elderly, ill, infirm, or otherwise unable to do the real thing. They might help people recovering from surgery – or astronauts who, even if they work out while in orbit, suffer bone loss and muscle wastage because their bodies work less hard in microgravity. For the rest of us, the benefits of a gentle walk or a handful of squats are tough to mimic with pills, and (reasonably) easy to get without them. One day, perhaps we’ll be able to take our exercise in pill form – but right now, it’s much easier to hit the road."

          "bodyText": "It has come to feel like a collector’s item – a Manchester United goal in the Premier League. When it came, Bruno Fernandes scoring from the penalty spot on 70 minutes, the celebrations were suitably wild. Especially from Ruud van Nistelrooy, the United interim manager who is keeping the dugout warm for Rúben Amorim. Van Nistelrooy pumped his fists, he ran down the line, he jumped up and he punched the air. It was like the old days when he led the United line, and the release of emotion was understandable because there had been plenty of frustration about the team’s performance. It was only their ninth goal of the league campaign – in their 10th game; remarkable levels of profligacy have been a major theme, one of the many drivers in the demise of Erik ten Hag. The lead lasted only four minutes. Chelsea deserved something, especially on the back of their first-half display, and they got it when the game’s best player, Moisés Caicedo, caught a dropping ball so sweetly on the edge of the area after a half-cleared corner. It was a celebration of technique and concentration, the volley fizzing through a crowd and into the bottom corner, André Onana powerless. There were chances at both ends thereafter, Fernandes blowing a gilt‑edged opportunity in stoppage time but the draw was about right. It left United on 12 points, their lowest tally after 10 league fixtures since 1986‑87, the season when Alex Ferguson took charge on 6 November (after 13 games). It is fair to say that Amorim will start from a low base. Van Nistelrooy has two more games in charge – PAOK in the Europa League on Thursday, Leicester on Sunday, both at home – and this one was always going to be tougher than the Carabao Cup romp against Leicester last week. Chelsea had travelled with confidence, Enzo Maresca reverting to his first-choice XI after rotating all of them in the Carabao Cup exit at Newcastle. The team were set up for Cole Palmer and he was prominent, as usual. There was a reason why Palmer sought space up the inside left; to get at Casemiro, to exploit the United midfielder’s lack of mobility. It was from a loose Casemiro pass that Palmer almost profited early on, Caicedo stepping up to win the ball and feed him. Palmer was kept out by a solid piece of one-on-one defending by Matthijs de Ligt. Chelsea were the better team in the first half, more cohesive up through the thirds, Caicedo excellent. Their big chance was Noni Madueke’s header from a Palmer corner on 15 minutes. With Wesley Fofana also free behind him, Madueke adjusted his body to head against the post. Was Fofana better placed? On the rebound, Lisandro Martínez swiped at Levi Colwill. Chelsea wanted a penalty. It would have been generous. Chelsea’s press created a few problems for United, especially when Onana played Casemiro into trouble, Caicedo making the challenge and watching the ball loop up and over the crossbar. Chelsea’s general menace, though, did not translate into many clear chances. United wanted to win the ball and transition quickly, looking for Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. There were too many times when they either missed their passes or did not move the ball quickly enough. It was a slog; plenty of effort, low levels of composure and quality. United did have chances in the first half, two big ones, the first in the 24th minute when Rasmus Højlund crossed low on the counter and Rashford let it run for Garnacho. He stepped inside only to shoot tamely. On the stroke of half-time Fernandes crossed for Rashford, who banged a volley off the top of the crossbar from a difficult angle. Pedro Neto ran at Diogo Dalot after the interval and drilled low past the far post but it was increasingly error strewn and attritional. When Garnacho blew a golden chance from a Fernandes cutback, scuffing the shot with his right foot, it was easy to wonder where the goal would come from. For Garnacho, it was one of those days. Højlund battled gamely with Fofana and Colwill and finally he gave the former the slip, getting in behind him to control a Casemiro cross. If the touch took him away from goal, he got his reward when Robert Sánchez flew off his line to catch his ankle with his gloves. Fernandes’s penalty was nerveless. Game over? Not a chance. With this United team, the closing stages are normally the prompt for the chaos. Once they were level, Chelsea almost scored again, the ball reaching Enzo Fernández, on as a substitute, after a ricochet and a De Ligt slip. With Onana off his line, Fernández’s chip sailed high. Back came United. Garnacho shot past the far post and faded a side-on volley too high. In between times Joshua Zirkzee, on as a substitute, was too slow to get in on goal after a Fernandes flick. Fernandes almost had the final word, enjoying the break of the ball inside the area only to volley over. Martínez was fortunate to see yellow rather than red at the very end after raking his studs down Palmer’s knee; he set out to stop him and wanted to make absolutely sure. With United, there are precious few certainties at present."

          "headline": "UK’s borrowing costs rise as Reeves’s budget prompts fears of slower interest rate cuts",
          "bodyText": "UK government borrowing costs have risen to their highest level this year as City investors bet Rachel Reeves’s budget would lead the Bank of England to adopt a more cautious approach to cutting interest rates. The yield – in effect the interest rate – on benchmark 10-year UK government bonds rose by more than 0.15 percentage points to trade above 4.5% on Thursday, before falling back slightly, as financial markets reacted to Labour’s first budget in 14 years. The pound also fell against the US dollar, while the FTSE 100 index lost ground amid a broader global sell-off, reflecting wider jitters over the prospect of the world’s most powerful central banks keeping interest rates higher for longer. “The quiet optimism that appeared to be spreading during Rachel Reeves’s speech has evaporated and a higher risk premium has returned for UK debt,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the investment service Hargreaves Lansdown. “Bond yields are set to stay volatile, as institutions financing government borrowing keep a more suspicious eye trained on what the swollen investment budget will be spent on.” In a historic budget to begin the task of repairing battered public services and rebooting economic growth, the chancellor announced a £70bn increase in spending on services and infrastructure, with more than half funded by higher taxes. City analysts said Reeves had announced a more expansionary package than anticipated, including higher near-term borrowing, before hitting her newly revised fiscal rules within five years. This would lead the government to sell more bonds, known as gilts, to cover its financing needs, analysts said. The chancellor’s plans would also increase inflation, with potential to complicate the path for the Bank of England to cut interest rates. “The sell-off across the gilt curve is likely partly reflective of higher than expected issuance projections after the current fiscal year,” said Shreyas Gopal, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “The stakes are now also higher for next week’s Bank of England meeting.” Before the budget, financial markets widely expected the central bank to cut interest rates from their current 5% to about 3.75% by the end of next year, with a first quarter-point reduction on Thursday next week. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent Treasury watchdog, said it had raised its prediction for the base rate by 0.25 percentage points across its five-year forecast to reflect the additional stimulus Reeves’s budget would have on the economy. Financial markets moved after the budget to price in fewer reductions in the base rate, predicting it would reach about 4% by the end of next year. Analysts said that while rising gilt yields reflected concerns in financial markets over Reeves’s budget, the movements still stopped considerably short of the fallout triggered by Liz Truss’s mini-budget. David Page and Gabriella Dickens of Axa Investment Managers said: “In terms of the overall market assessment this should in no way be compared to the disastrous mini-budget delivered under Liz Truss’s short reign in 2022. “On that day, gilt yields jumped 33 basis points and went on to rise by 100 basis points over the next three sessions.”"

          "headline": "ICC chief prosecutor facing staff calls for external inquiry into sexual misconduct claims",
          "bodyText": "The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court in The Hague is facing calls from his own staff for an independent external investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him. Karim Khan is the subject of allegations, details of which have emerged in recent weeks, about his conduct towards a woman who previously reported directly to him. On Monday, Khan announced in a social media post he had asked the court’s internal watchdog to open an “immediate investigation” and said he would “cooperate fully with that inquiry”. However, senior ICC officials have told the Guardian there are concerns among court staff about the independence of the inquiry, with some fearing it could be used to retaliate against those who raised the alarm. Four sources from the prosecutor’s office also expressed concerns about a potential appearance of a conflict of interest as the incoming head of the court’s internal watchdog, known as the independent oversight mechanism (IOM), currently works for Khan. The allegations against Khan, which are understood to span a 12-month period to April of this year, have emerged at an acutely sensitive moment for the ICC and prompted an unprecedented crisis at the judicial body, a court of last resort that prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities. In recent days, opponents of the ICC have sought to exploit the claims as a panel of its judges continue to consider requests by the prosecutor to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza. Khan, a British barrister whose nine-year term as ICC prosecutor began in 2021, had convened a small group of close advisers to help deal with the crisis, sources said. The prosecutor’s request for a new investigation came as the court’s governing body, which is made up of member states, is understood to be considering how the allegations should be investigated and what form an inquiry should take. The presidency of the governing body, the assembly of state parties (ASP), did not respond to questions about the inquiry ordered by Khan. He announced the inquiry on Monday in a statement posted on X shortly after the Guardian reported allegations that Khan had tried to persuade his former colleague to deny the claims against him and that he took steps to deter her from formally pursuing the matter. His statement said he had notified the presidency of the ASP that he had requested the head of the independent oversight mechanism “to open an immediate investigation under the umbrella of the IOM into misconduct allegations and surrounding circumstances relating to the official processes of the court and what appears to be disinformation”. The allegations against Khan, 54, include unwanted sexual touching and “abuse” over an extended period, according to a document seen by the Guardian. Multiple ICC sources said the allegations also included coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. Lawyers for Khan said he “denies any misconduct” and “it would not be appropriate to comment further in light of the prospective investigation”. The alleged victim, a lawyer in her 30s who worked directly for Khan, has declined to comment. ICC sources said they believed the incoming head of the IOM could be conflicted and unable to oversee an investigation into the situation owing to his current role working under Khan. The mid-ranking official, who was appointed by the governing body, will take up his new post in early December after leaving a role in the prosecutor’s office where he leads some of its investigative activities. “The IOM is meant to be independent and impartial,” one of the sources said. “Having a former [prosecutor’s office] staff member as the IOM head is insane. Essentially you’re asking him to investigate his former boss.” The incoming head of the IOM declined to comment. Its current head, who oversaw a short-lived inquiry into the allegations in May, did not respond to a request for information about Khan’s announcement. According to sources with knowledge of Khan’s handling of the situation, the prosecutor’s request to the IOM was being regarded internally as an attempt to seize the initiative and set the terms of an inquiry. They pointed to his demand the IOM investigate “surrounding circumstances relating to the official processes of the court and what appears to be disinformation” in addition to the allegations against him. Multiple ICC sources claimed this was an attempt to encourage the watchdog to investigate individuals at the ICC who brought the allegations to light. “[Khan] is firing back asking for an investigation into the leaks,” one of the individuals claimed. The internal controversy of how the allegations should be investigated comes after the ICC’s staff union council said last week that any alleged misconduct committed by one of the court’s elected officials, such as the prosecutor, should be subject to an external inquiry. In an email to staff, the union said: “We call for a prompt, independent and thorough investigation led by an external panel free from any potential conflict of interest. We insist that this panel respects the highest standards of confidentiality and impartiality.” The union is understood to be seeking the views of its members about what further action it should take."

          "headline": "The Unfinished Harauld Hughes by Richard Ayoade review – comic novel or conceptual art project?",
          "bodyText": "The Unfinished Harauld Hughes is something like a South Bank Show House of Leaves: it’s the narrative of the making of a documentary that never gets made, about a movie that also never got made. Its protagonist-narrator is Richard Ayoade, an alter ego of the author of the book, Richard Ayoade. He’s in search of an alter ego of his own – or, at least, a doppelganger. The late Harauld Hughes – author of era-defining plays with titles such as Platform, Table, Roast, Roost, Prompt, Flight, Shunt and Dependence, and subsequently a hack screenwriter – is Ayoade’s white whale. It so happens that the playwright’s author photograph looks extremely like Richard Ayoade, except that Hughes “wore the kind of glasses I would search for, in vain, from that moment on”. Ayoade’s interest in Hughes, kindled by the chance likeness, develops into a deep reverence: “Harauld Hughes, to my mind, is drama.” Now, for sheer love of Hughes (he reproaches himself, from time to time, that he should never have agreed to make this documentary), Ayoade is filming an arts programme to be called The Unfinished Harauld Hughes, in which he trundles around interviewing such associates of the late playwright as will agree to talk, and goes in quest of a copy of O Bedlam! O Bedlam!, Hughes’s last, lost film. The footage is apparently in a Swiss bank vault somewhere, and nobody who knows about it is prepared to say anything that makes a lick of sense. What tips this from being a comic novel into something more like a conceptual art project is that, foolishly or heroically, Ayoade has actually written the complete works of Harauld Hughes, in three volumes – Four Films, Plays Prose Pieces Poetry and The Models Trilogy – released, apparently, as limited editions, alongside the novel. So you can now read or even perform Platform, or The Awful Woman from Space. They come with straight-faced prefaces, timelines, deleted scenes, critical essays, the lot. That’s a degree of commitment to world-building George RR Martin could learn from. The fictitious Hughes has very much more than a dollop in him of Harold Pinter. He’s angry and shouty (“the most furious British writer since the Boer war”), he’s famous for his dramatic pauses, he has a roughish East End background, and he has a troubled first wife whom he leaves for a bit of posh (if that’s not too disrespectful an epithet for the many-splendoured Lady Antonia Fraser or, in this case, Lady Virginia Lovilocke). But there are differences, too. For Pinter’s fabled love of cricket, substitute a fierce interest in badminton. Why badminton? The same reason, I suspect, why “Harauld”, and why the facial likeness between Ayoade and his subject. Because it’s funny and a bit offbeat and random, and why not? Ayoade’s book is full of such touches of mild absurdity. Its comic tenor is part satirical and part pure whimsy, and it’s very beguiling. In the satirical mode, as he travels from interview to interview with pretentious Director Dan, Tony Camera and a stoner soundman called Wiggsy, Ayoade is excellently droll on the making of presenter-led telly “docs” (it bugs our hero that Dan calls them that, but telly people undeniably do). For Dan’s purposes, naturally, Ayoade is on a journey. Dan’s way of keeping the sense of a journey is to show a journey, bookended by someone saying they are about to go on a journey and/or have just been on a journey, all the while staring at a moving landscape through a reflective surface, underpinned by a voiceover about being on a journey. His commitment to literalism is almost inspiring. The journey, it’s probably not too much of a spoiler to reveal, goes nowhere. As tempers fray, interviewees drop out or die unexpectedly, and promising leads turn out to be dead ends, Tony Camera rants: “How are you meant to journey through the life of a writer. They don’t do anything – they don’t fight wars or make laws or save lives, they just make shit up!” But it’s not the journey. It’s the friends we make along the way, right? Those friends include the excellently imperious Lady Virginia, Hughes’s East End associates (who have about them more than a touch of Monty Python’s Piranha Brothers), a pompous theatre critic and, of course, the splenetic Hughes himself. Ayoade’s quietly intelligent, low-key wit, funnelled through his hangdog narrator, makes this a journey worth taking. • The Unfinished Harauld Hughes by Richard Ayoade is published by Faber (£16.99).

          "headline": "US elections live: Harris addresses first-time voters as Trump performs ‘garbageman’ stunt – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "This blog is closing now – thanks for following along. Here’s a summary of day: More than 57.5 million people have already voted in US election. With six days until the 2024 election, more than 57.5 million Americans have already voted as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Of the 57 million, just over 30 million voted early in-person and about 27 million voted by early mail. A new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by six points in Wisconsin and five points in Michigan, key battleground states. Harris leads Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin. The candidates are tied at 48% in Pennsylvania. Puerto Rican reggaeton singer Nicky Jam has withdrawn his support for Donald Trump after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. “Never in my life did I think that a month later a comedian would come to criticize my country, to speak poorly of my country, and therefore I renounce any support to Donald Trump and move aside from any political situation. Puerto Rico deserves respect,” he said. Trump and Harris each held rallies in Wisconsin. Trump riffed on his appearance in a garbage truck earlier, and wore a reflective vest of the kind often worn by sanitation workers. The crowd laughed as he said that he liked the vest because it was flattering. Harris spoke to a hugely enthusiastic crowd and seemed at ease and energetic. The strongest part of her speech was when she addressed first-time voters, specifically, telling them that issues including the climate crisis, gun control and abortion restrictions weren’t political to them: these were their lived experience. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, addresses progressives’ concerns about voting for Harris given the administration’s support for Israel’s war. Kamala Harris held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, this afternoon. “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” she said. Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden’s “garbage” remarks, Harris said that Biden had “clarified his comments”, adding: “I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.” Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of Republicans crossing party lines to vote against Donald Trump. The US supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: “The application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted.” Virginia’s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court’s ruling, calling it a “victory for common sense and election fairness”. Youngkin had ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks. Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying: “We know it’s going to be close, but we’re going to win this thing.” Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said: “We’ve got the better ground game, we’ve got the excitement, we’ve got the momentum on our side.” Many Puerto Ricans who have moved to the mainland will be able to make their voices heard on 5 November, with large communities in Pennsylvania and Florida being targeted by both campaigns. Those who remain in the territory meanwhile, have made numerous efforts to become a state in their own right. The island has more people than the five smallest states combined and statehood is supported by many, but the final decision lies with Congress – and recent efforts have stalled. Those delays and persistent disfranchisement means some Puerto Ricans are eager to leave the US orbit altogether. On Tuesday, alongside elections for local politicians and an informal straw poll for their favoured presidential candidate, they will vote in their seventh non-binding referendum on status – this time putting full and partial independence up against statehood. “It’s not fair that that all of these decisions are being made as if we were savages, as if we were people who can’t have self determination,” Betancourt says. “I don’t want to vote for the United States – I want to vote for the president of Puerto Rico.” Read the full story here: Residents have no say over Washington’s decisions that control their everyday lives, according to Karina Claudio Betancourt, a student in Puerto Rico’s capital city, San Juan. “Elections impact us because the president decides what to do or not to do with Puerto Rico right now,” they say. Betancourt points to Donald Trump’s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island, and the Obama administration’s imposition of a board controlling government funding. “Basic transportation and health services and things that impact us day-to-day are decided by the Congress of the United States and by this fiscal oversight board, but we don’t get to vote for any of that,” they say. “People are fed up.” Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally was meant to be a triumphant return to the city that made his name. Instead, the event has reheated simmering tensions on the island territory of Puerto Rico, where locals say they feel like second-class citizens, days out from a historic US election. Comments from a comedian at Trump’s rally this week, describing Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage”, might have fired up local resentment against the Republican candidate, but those who live there will be unable to show their anger through the ballot box. Residents of Puerto Rico are among the more than 3 million Americans whose votes won’t count, when the country elects its president next week. Most residents of the US territories – Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Marianas – are citizens and pay federal taxes. Many have family on the mainland. But the territories have no votes in the electoral college that ultimately decides the president. “They’re just basically captive to whatever Congress and the president want to do to them,” says Luis Fuentes-Rohwer, a law professor at Indiana University. “To be a citizen means to be a member of the political community. Not in the US.” It’s one of the few things uniting the disparate territories, which range from Puerto Rico, home to 3 million citizens in the Caribbean, to American Samoa, closer to Australia than America with a population of just 50,000. Read more here: One reason for Harris’s energy: as we reported earlier, a new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by six points in the state. Harris leads Trump by 51% to 45% among likely voters in Wisconsin. A tale of two Wisconsin rallies: Trump kept his relatively tight, for him – it was just over 60 minutes – while Harris spoke for her usual 20 minutes. Trump riffed on his appearance in a garbage truck earlier, and wore a reflective vest of the kind often worn by sanitation workers. The crowd laughed as he said that he liked the vest because it was flattering. Harris spoke to a hugely enthusiastic crowd and seemed at ease and energetic. The strongest part of her speech was when she addressed first-time voters, specifically, telling them that issues including the climate crisis, gun control and abortion restrictions weren’t political to them: these were their lived experience. Harris ends that hugely energetic speech, in response to which she received very loud cheers from the crowd. “We love our country. And when you love something, you fight for it,” Harris says. Harris’s speech tonight, unsurprisingly, is a combination of last night’s major address in Washington DC and her previous speeches. Her speech was interrupted near the start by a person calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, and she responded quickly. If that person continued shouting “Ceasefire!” the sound was drowned out by the crowd cheering when Harris said: “I am speaking now.” Harris addresses young, first-time voters: “You, who grew up with active shooter drills, are fighting to keep this country safe. You, who have fewer rights than your mothers.” She also addressed the climate crisis, an issue that has been on the backburner for the Democrats during this campaign. “This is not political,” Harris says. “This is your lived experience”. Harris repeats her line: if Trump is elected, “on day one he will walk into the Oval Office with an enemies list,” she says. “I will walk in with a to-do list focused on your needs. And at the top of my list will be bringing down your cost of living.” “It is time for a new generation of leadership in America,” Harris says. Harris repeats her record as a prosecutor, saying she isn’t afraid of a tough fight. “If you give me the chance to fight on your behalf as president, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way of fighting for you.” “So Madison, early voting has started […] you can vote through November 3rd. And we need you to vote early, Wisconsin,” Harris says. “And make no mistake: we will win.” Harris is energetic, the crowd is energetic. Someone in the crowd is chanting: “Ceasefire now!” Harris stops her speech. “Listen,” she says, “we all want the war in Gaza to end.” She says she will do everything in her power to make that happen. Everyone has a right to be heard, she says. “But right now, I am speaking.” There is a sustained and very loud cheer from the crowd – this is one of Harris’s most famous lines. Kamala Harris is on stage now in Madison, Wisconsin. “It’s good to be back,” she says. “And many of you may know when I was five years old, my parents taught at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.” In the days leading up to the election, mysterious monuments continue to pop up in cities across the US poking fun at candidate Donald Trump and his supporters, the Guardian’s José Olivares reports: On Wednesday in Maja Park in Philadelphia, a large statue of Trump was propped up. Titled “In Honor of a Lifetime of Sexual Assault”, the monument, showing Trump smiling and holding his hand in a suggestive manner, quotes from the infamous 2005 recording – leaked in 2016 – in which Trump is heard bragging about sexually assaulting women. The monument was quickly removed, Philly Voice reported. On Sunday, a similar satirical statue was found in Portland, Oregon. It was beheaded that day and further damaged by a Portland city council candidate and Trump supporter, who filmed himself chipping away at the base of the statue. Read the full story here: Alice Herman There are 13,000 people at the Harris event in Madison, according to the Harris-Walz campaign. Kamala Harris is expected to speak in 40 minutes’ time in Madison, in the swing state of Wisconsin. Trump is wrapping up. “Just in conclusion”, he says, and repeats various falsehoods, mainly about Harris, whom he earlier criticised for speaking about him too much. Trump begins with various things he will make America again. These include “healthy”, “proud”, “safe”, and, of course, “great”. Trump is once again played off by Village People’s gay anthem, YMCA. Village People sent Trump a cease and desist letter in 2023 asking him to stop using the song at campaign events. The Guardian’s Alice Herman is in Madison, Wisconsin for the Kamala Harris event. She reports: Mumford &amp; Sons, the British folk-pop band, is now performing – an offering to the elder millennial rallygoers, who seem way more into this set than Gracie Abrams’s younger fans. (The young woman who sobbed throughout Abrams’s set appears unmoved by Mumford &amp; Sons so far). Harris has rolled out a series of celebrity endorsers and performers during her rallies so far this year, from Beyoncé, who appeared at a Harris rally in Texas, to Jennifer Lopez, who is scheduled to make an appearance at a Nevada rally later this week. The Guardian’s Alice Herman is in Madison, Wisconsin, for the Kamala Harris event. She reports: Gracie Abrams, a popular gen Z singer-songwriter, is performing in Madison at the Alliant Energy Center, where Harris is scheduled to speak soon. Her performance was likely a draw for some in the crowd – including the young woman in the risers to my left who has been sob-singing every lyric during Abrams’s performance. Trump plays a video about Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed in Texas when she was 12 yeas old by two Venezuelan men who reportedly entered the country illegally. The video features Nungaray’s mother talking about her daughter and what happened, and is incredibly sad. Trump has talked about Nungaray before. During Trump’s presidential debate against then presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Trump repeatedly brought up her murder and assault. As Trump began speaking about his “favorite chart” – the one about illegal immigration that he was talking about on stage in Butler, Pennsylvania when a gunman tried to kill him – a woman in the audience began shouting: “Fight! Fight! Fight!” It’s what Trump shouted that July afternoon as the Secret Service hustled him away, and become a rallying cry for his supporters. The audience picked up the chant, and Trump paused to soak it in, before saying: “That’s an aggressive youngster. He’s going to go places.” Apparently he didn’t get a good look at who started the chant. Trump is repeating his well-worn, racist and false statements about immigration. He claims he wants to “protect the women of our country” – from immigrants. He says he is going to protect women “whether they like it or not”. It is a statement with menacing undertones, given that Trump has boasted about limiting abortion access for women: a procedure that can be key to keeping women safe. He has done this despite the majority of Americans supporting abortion rights. More than 60% of Americans now believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. “We broke Roe v Wade,” Trump has bragged: Meanwhile Kamala Harris has touched down in Wisconsin, where she will be speaking in 90 minutes’ time. Her stepdaughter, fashion world darling Ella Emhoff, is with her, per the pool report. In a profile published this week, the New York Times called her the “second daughter of New York’s downtown”. Trump says he has sold 10,000 black Maga hats – it is unclear whether this is true. The red Maga hat is the most recognisable Trump supporter accessory, and was the subject – or inciting incident – of a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode. And more recently: Trump claims that his profession is “very dangerous” but that if he had to do it again he would, “every time”. Trump was injured during an assassination attempt in July during which the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed. In September, a second man, Ryan Wesley Routh, was charged with attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. Authorities said he spent 12 hours camped outside Donald Trump’s golf course before the Secret Service spotted him with a rifle. He pleaded not guilty to attempting to assassinate the former president as well as other federal charges. The orange reflective vest Donald Trump is wearing has made him appear even more orange, at least on the Resch Center jumbotron. Trump’s orange-tinged skin tone is a signature part of his appearance, something the left often mocks, and which the right has mocked back with its “orange man bad” meme directed at liberal outrage. Trump rarely wears anything but a suit (unless he’s golfing), but is clearly trying to make the most of Joe Biden’s comment yesterday in which the president appeared to describe his supporters as “garbage” – something the White House disputes. Trump is doing a bit now about being reluctant to wear the vest on stage, wondering whether he could wear it over a suit, and so on. He says his campaign staff told him it would make him look thinner, at which point he was sold on the idea. That gets laughs and applause from the crowd. “I may never wear a blue jacket again,” he says. The audience in Green Bay’s Resch Center stood up for the first 10 minutes or so of Trump’s speech, but now they’re in their seats. It’s worth settling in for a Trump speech – they’ve stretched to about the 90-minute mark lately (about the length of a movie) with the ex-president riffing on all kinds of things. He just played a video of Kamala Harris mentioning his name in her speeches, which draw a huge applause. Trump plays a recording of about 15 times Kamala Harris has used his name while making speeches during an election in which he is her opponent. “That’s all she talks about because she and Joe have absolutely no achievements,” Trump says, falsely. He continues talking about Harris. Then Trump talks garbage. One of his advisers said: “Sir, the hottest word right now is garbage.” He then says his campaign staff managed to organise the garbage truck on short notice, and that he felt uncomfortable driving it while wearing a suit. “And then they said sir, we have a vest.” Trum says the “most beaautiful words to me” are “religion, number one and love number two”. He pauses, then says: “and tariffs, number three”. He has said this before. Trump is promising to levy tariffs on all imports in a bid to boost American manufacturing, a proposal that economists say would probably mean higher prices for consumers while angering US allies. The International Monetary Fund warned this week that the tariffs could hurt global growth, as it upgraded its forecast for the UK economy. The Washington-based organisation said tariffs trigger tit-for-tat trade wars that impoverish the economies involved in the dispute and the wider global economy. A reminder of what it is Trump is riffing on: On Tuesday Biden appeared to call supporters of Donald Trump “garbage”. The president clarified that he didn’t mean Trump supporters, but rather the attitude of a comedian who performed at a Trump rally and made several racist statements – including calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” – towards Latinos. The official transcript had Biden saying: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” The comment nevertheless set off echoes of Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” put-down of a section of Trump’s supporters in 2016. “And by the way, I want to thank all of our incredible sanitation workers across America,” Trump says, in a continuation of his garbage-truck-driver schtick. Here is the scene my colleague Chris Stein referred to earlier – Trump answering questions from reporters while seated in a garbage truck. He falsely stated that Harris was responsible for Biden’s use of the word “garbage”, calling it “the comment made by really both of them”. He also wildly overstated his support, calling the remark about his supporters an insult to “maybe 250 million people”. Trump got 74.2m votes in 2020 (to Biden’s 81.2m): “We’re done with their hatred, we’re done with their hysteria,” Trump says of the Democrats. “Joe Biden’s comments were the direct result of Kamala’s efforts to portray everyone who is not voting for her as … subhuman,” Trump says. This statement is false – Harris has been careful not to insult Trump supporters. Just before Donald Trump took the stage in Green Bay, a video played showing him in shirtsleeves with a reflective vest on, declaring: “Hello everybody, this is Donald J Trump. Two hundred fifty million people are not garbage.” It then cut to his photo op earlier today, where he took questions while sitting in the driver’s seat of a garbage truck and honking its horn. Now he’s on stage, in the same reflective vest. Donald Trump is on stage. He starts by saying: “I have to say 250 million Americans are not garbage”, referring to Joe Biden’s ambiguous comments yesterday. Turnout at rallies is no guarantee of election victory, but the Trump campaign must be pleased with the sight in Green Bay tonight. Just about every seat in the approximately 10,000-seat Resch Center is full, with the former president yet to take the stage. Brown county, of which Green Bay is the seat, is friendly GOP territory, voting for Republican presidents in every recent election, with the exception of when Barack Obama was first elected in 2008, and when Bill Clinton was re-elected in 1996. Donald Trump is expected to speak soon at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This is Helen Sullivan taking over our live US politics coverage. I’ll bring you any key developments from Trump’s speech, and Kamala Harris’s speech in Wisconsin in two-and-a-half hours’ time. Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s key events: A new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by 6 points in Wisconsin and 5 points in Michigan, key battleground states. Harris leads Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin. The candidates are tied at 48% in Pennsylvania. Puerto Rican reggaeton singer Nicky Jam has withdrawn his support for Donald Trump after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. “Never in my life did I think that a month later a comedian would come to criticize my country, to speak poorly of my country, and therefore I renounce any support to Donald Trump and move aside from any political situation. Puerto Rico deserves respect,” he said. Kamala Harris held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, this afternoon. “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” she said. Kamala Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden’s “garbage” remarks, Harris said that Biden had “clarified his comments”, adding, “I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.” Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of Republicans crossing party lines to vote against Donald Trump. The supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: “The application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted.” Virginia’s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court’s ruling, calling it a “victory for common sense and election fairness”. Youngkin had ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks. Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying, “We know it’s going to be close but we’re going to win this thing.” Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said, “We’ve got the better ground game, we’ve got the excitement, we’ve got the momentum on our side.” Donald Trump is taking questions from reporters while sitting in a garbage truck branded with his campaign logo. “This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,” Trump said. It’s quite a move, days after his campaign caught flack for platforming a comedian who compared Puerto Rico with an island of garbage. Asked about reports that Elon Musk, who has become a close ally, has been in communication with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Trump responded: “Elon is a great guy, he’s one of our geniuses.” The Guardian’s Chris Stein is in Green Bay, reporting on the Trump rally there. Donald Trump is holding a rally this evening in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and booked himself perhaps the best warm-up speaker he could hope to get in the football-mad city: Brett Favre, a legendary former quarterback for the Green Bay Packers NFL team. “I have not done an event like this before, but I’ve decided it’s time,” Favre told the crowd at an indoor arena next to the football stadium, where quite a few people had forgone wearing Maga hats and Trump shirts in favor of Packers jerseys. One of the last small cities with an NFL team in the United States, Green Bay sits in Brown county, a Republican-leaning area of a swing state that’s regarded as one of the most evenly divided in the country. After lamenting the financial damage done by inflation and the human toll of fentanyl overdoses, Favre said: “We’ve already had President Trump once. We’ve already seen Kamala in action. We can compare, and we know this is better.” “So, it’s time to pitch Kamala, and put in the star quarterback,” Favre said. “USA, it’s a great country. We all know that. Kamala broke it, Trump will fix it.” Canvassers for Elon Musk’s America PAC in Michigan were subjected to poor working conditions, unreasonable quotas, and in some cases were misled about the fact that they would be promoting Donald Trump, Wired reports. From Wired: In Michigan, canvassers and paid door knockers for the former president, contracted by a firm associated with America PAC, have been subjected to poor working conditions: A number of them have been driven around in the back of a seatless U-Haul van, according to video obtained by WIRED, and threatened that their lodging at a local motel wouldn’t be paid for if they didn’t meet canvassing quotas. One door knocker alleges that they didn’t even know they were signing up for anything having to do with Musk or Trump. A representative for Musk and America PAC did not return a request for comment. Labor grievances and disputes have been a common thread across Musk’s companies. The Guardian has reported on injuries and safety issues at Tesla. Black workers at the company have also alleged race discrimination and harassment. A pregnant worker at Neuralink alleges she was forced to work with a monkey that was carrying herpes. Employees at SpaceX have sued Musk and the company for sexual harassment and whistleblower retaliation, among other wrongdoing. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, addresses progressives’ concerns about voting for Kamala Harris given the administration’s support for Israel’s war. He writes: I understand that there are millions of Americans who disagree with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the terrible war in Gaza. I am one of them. While Israel had a right to defend itself against the horrific Hamas terrorist attack of 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 innocent people and took 250 hostages, it did not have the right to wage an all-out war against the entire Palestinian people. It did not have the right to kill 42,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of whom were children, women and the elderly, or injure over 100,000 people in Gaza. It did not have the right to destroy Gaza’s infrastructure and housing and healthcare systems. It did not have the right to bomb every one of Gaza’s 12 universities. It did not have the right to block humanitarian aid, causing massive malnutrition in children and, in fact, starvation. And that is why I am doing everything I can to block US military aid and offensive weapons sales to the rightwing extremist Netanyahu government in Israel. And I know that many of you share those feelings. And some of you are saying, “How can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this terrible war?” And that is a very fair question. And let me give you my best answer. And that is that even on this issue, Donald Trump and his rightwing friends are worse. In the Senate and in Congress Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The president and vice-president both support getting as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible. Trump has said that Netanyahu is doing a good job and that Biden is holding him back. He has suggested that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property for development. It is no wonder Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office. But even more importantly, and this I promise you, after Harris wins we will, together, do everything we can to change US policy toward Netanyahu – including an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, a surge of massive humanitarian aid, the stopping of settler attacks on the West Bank, and the rebuilding of Gaza for the Palestinian people. Read the full piece here: A Pennsylvania judge on Wednesday sided with Donald Trump’s campaign and agreed to extend an in-person voting option in suburban Philadelphia, where long lines on the final day led to complaints voters were being disenfranchised by an unprepared election office. A lawsuit demanding an extension of Tuesday’s 5pm deadline in Bucks county until today was filed this morning after long queues outside the county’s election offices on the last day for applications led to security guards cutting off the line and telling some of those waiting they would not be able to apply. Videos of the scenes were widely circulated on social media, fuelling rumours of voter suppression. The Trump campaign was joined by the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the GOP Senate candidate Dave McCormick in the lawsuit alleging that voters waiting outside election offices for mail ballots were turned away empty-handed and ordered to leave after the deadline expired at 5pm on Tuesday. “This is a direct violation of Pennsylvanians’ rights to cast their ballot – and all voters have a right to STAY in line,” the Trump campaign said. Judge Jeffrey Trauger said in a one-page order that Bucks county voters who want to apply for an early mail ballot now have until Friday. The queues for late mail ballots were a result of Pennsylvania not having an early on-site voting system at designated spots, as is the case in some other states. Instead, voters can apply for ballots on-demand at election offices before filling them out and submitting them on the spot, a procedure that takes about 10 minutes. The flood of late applicants overwhelmed electoral workers in Bucks county’s administration building in Doylestown, leading to a long queue which was cut off at around 2.45pm on Tuesday, according to CBS. Protesters interrupted Harris about 8 minutes into her remarks here. It was difficult to hear what they were saying, but I could hear the word “genocide”. The crowd began chanting “USA!” and Harris reminded the crowd that democracy was on the line in this election. “Ours is about a fight for democracy and your right to be heard. That is what is on the line in this election,” she said. “Look, everybody has a right to be heard, but right now I am speaking.” After another protester interrupted a few minutes later, she said: “At this particular moment it should be emphasized that unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy from within. He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at the table.” Shawna Barnes, a 45-year old healthcare worker from Philadelphia, said she’s concerned that men aren’t supporting Harris in this election. When she’s knocked on doors, she’s noticed that the women are often all in, but the men are “iffy”. “Black and brown women are going to come out and support. White women of course are going to support. The men are just kind of like afraid,” she said as Mr Brightside by The Killers blasted on the sound system. “I don’t think it’s about gender, I just think it’s fear.” Kamala Harris is speaking at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex &amp; Expo Center in Harrisburg, where she is promoting her economic proposals. \"We stand for working people, we stand for middle class growth and strength,” Harris said. She derided Donald Trump’s tariff proposals, and warned that he would dismantle the popular Affordable Care Act. “We know what’s on the line. We know that Donald Trump will try, like he has so many times to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would throw, millions of Americans off of their health care and take us back to when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions,” she said. Donald Trump’s team is reportedly considering withholding federal grants from police departments that decline to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to ease deportations. NBC News reports that the former president’s team is working on plans to force sanctuary cities such as Chicago, and states such as California to work with the federal government to help Trump deliver on his promise of mass deportations. The Guardian has not independently verified NBC’s reporting. Withholding funding from police departments who decline to work with Ice will undoubtedly face legal challenges. During Trump’s presidency, several states sued the administration after it cut off grants to sanctuary cities, and appealed a court decision that sided with Trump – running out the clock on Trump’s term before the supreme court could issue a final decision on the matter. With six days until the 2024 election, more than 57.5 million Americans have already voted as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida. Of the 57 million, just over 30 million voted early in-person and about 27 million voted by early mail. I spotted Minerva Ortiz-Garcia, 68, walking around with a small Puerto Rican flag before the rally started so I stopped her to ask what she thought of the racist joke a speaker made before Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. “I feel horrible. I’m Puerto Rican, I actually started to cry,” she said. “How could someone say that about an island that is trying to survive [Hurricane] Maria?” Ortiz-Garcia, a flight attendant, lives in Easton, which is in eastern Pennsylvania, a part of the state that is extremely competitive and has a huge Latino population. She said she thought many Latino voters in her part of the state were waiting for Harris to reach out to them directly. “I think that people want her to say something directly,” she said. I’ve been chatting to a few voters at a Kamala Harris rally here at the Farm expo building in Harrisburg, where there’s a vague smell of horses as the crowd swag surfs and dances to Motown hits such as We Are Family and Aretha Franklin’s Respect. I just spoke with Corine Wherley, a 38-year-old librarian from Harrisburg who is attending her first political rally ever. She said she decided to come to the rally because she was so alarmed by what she heard during Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. “A lot of it was the rhetoric around ‘this secret’ and other things like that they’re planning on doing,” she said, referring to Trump’s comment that he has a “little secret” with House speaker Mike Johnson, that many took to be a plan to contest the election. “They’re like: ‘I can do whatever I want,’ and I think that’s what scares me.” Puerto Rican reggaeton singer Nicky Jam has withdrawn his support for Donald Trump after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday. On Wednesday, the singer posted a video on social media saying: “The reason I supported Donald Trump is because I believed it was what’s best for the economy in the United States, where a lot of Latinos live … a lot of immigrants that are suffering over the state of the economy … With [Trump] being a businessman, I felt it was the right move.” He went on to add: “Never in my life did I think that a month later a comedian would come to criticize my country, to speak poorly of my country, and therefore I renounce any support to Donald Trump and move aside from any political situation. Puerto Rico deserves respect.” In September, Nicky Jam made an appearance at one of Trump’s rally during which he was misgendered by the former president. “Do you know Nicky? She’s hot!” Trump said to the crowd, adding: “Where’s Nicky? Where’s Nicky? Thank you, Nicky. Great to be having you here.” The battleground states for the White House overlap significantly with the states where Democrats are fighting to keep or gain majorities in state legislative chambers, noted Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC). “While the overlap has opened some opportunities for unprecedented collaboration, this environment has also produced steep challenges for state legislative candidates to get their message out, especially through paid communication,” Williams told reporters on a press call today. Williams noted that the Harris campaign was now spending more on paid ads each week than the DLCC’s entire budget for this election cycle, which is $60m. The gap in resources could heighten the risk of “ballot rolloff”, the phenomenon of voters only filling out the top of their ballot without continuing down to lower-level races. “Our historical data indicates that, in presidential years, we face the challenge of ballot rolloff most acutely,” Williams said. “Communicating and educating voters on who their state legislative candidates are is incredibly important to mitigate underperforming the top of the ticket.” Although much of the country is focused on the presidential and congressional races, the results of this year’s state legislative elections will have vast consequences on Americans’ everyday lives. On a press call today, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) reported that state legislative control appears to be a true toss-up in several battleground states, reflecting the neck-and-neck nature of the presidential race. “Right now, just 12 legislative seats are deciding six legislative majorities in the biggest battleground states across the country, and all our polling shows that this election will be incredibly close,” said Heather Williams, president of the DLCC. Democrats are looking to maintain their narrow majorities in state legislative chambers in Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania while attempting to regain majorities in Arizona and New Hampshire. The new legislative maps in Wisconsin also represent a key opportunity for Democrats. “The stakes couldn’t be higher, as nearly half of Americans currently have their rights protected by Democratic majorities in state legislatures,” Williams said. “Decisions on fundamental freedoms are happening in the states, and many of the dangers of Project 2025 and Trump’s MAGA [’Make America Great Again’] agenda will continue to advance through our statehouses no matter the outcome at the top of the ticket.” A new CNN poll shows Kamala Harris leading over Trump by 6 points in Wisconsin and 5 points in Michigan, key battleground states. Harris leads Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin. The candidates are tied at 48% in Pennsylvania. The vice president’s slim advantage is due in part to “relatively strong performance among White voters and White voters without college degrees, two groups which traditionally break Republican,” CNN said. Here’s a look at where things stand: Kamala Harris held a campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, this afternoon. “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” she said. Kamala Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden’s “garbage” remarks, Harris said that Biden had “clarified his comments”, adding, “I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.” Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of Republicans crossing party lines to vote against Donald Trump. The supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: “The application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted.” Virginia’s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court’s ruling, calling it a “victory for common sense and election fairness”. Youngkin had ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks. Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying, “We know it’s going to be close but we’re going to win this thing.” Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said, “We’ve got the better ground game, we’ve got the excitement, we’ve got the momentum on our side.” “I see the promise of America in all the young leaders who are voting for the first time,” Kamala Harris said. “You’ve only known the climate crisis and are leading the charge to protect our planet and our future. You young leaders who grew up with active shooter drills, who are trying to keep our schools safe, you who have known fewer rights than your mothers and grandmothers and are standing up to fight for freedom to make your own decisions about your own bodies. None of this for you young leaders is theoretical. This is not theoretical for you. It is not political for you. For our young leaders, this is your lived experience, and I see you, and I see your power, and I am so proud of you,” she added. “Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” Kamala Harris said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at the table,” she added. “We have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who has been trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other. We know that is who he is but, North Carolina, that is not who we are,” Kamala Harris said. “It is time for a new chapter where we stop with the pointing fingers at each other, and instead let us lock arms with one another, knowing we have so much more in common than what separates us,” she added. Kamala Harris is now on stage in Raleigh, North Carolina, for a campaign rally. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates. Donald Trump is claiming – without evidence – that Pennsylvania is cheating and has filed a lawsuit against Bucks county. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote that the state is “cheating, and getting caught, at large-scale levels rarely seen before”. He did not specify what constituted the state’s cheating. In a separate statement, Trump’s campaign announced on Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Buck county for “turning away voters.” Again, without evidence, the campaign claimed that voters were being turned away early, saying: “The Pennsylvania Department of State made clear if voters are in line at a county elections office by 5:00PM, the counties MUST give voters the opportunity to apply for their mail-in ballot. Pennsylvania voters were turned away as early as 2:30PM.” The Guardian’s democracy reporter Rachel Leingang reports on the most pervasive myths and lies about US elections: Kamala Harris said that she strongly disagrees with criticisms of people based on who they voted for. Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday following Joe Biden’s “garbage” remarks, Harris said that Biden had “clarified his comments”, adding, “I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they voted for.” In response to whether she is worried that Biden’s comments could increase the country’s political divisiveness ahead of the elections, Harris said: “I’ve been very clear with the American public – I respect the challenges that people face, I respect the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us.” Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, has announced he is endorsing Kamala Harris. He joins a running list of republicans crossing party lines to vote against Trump. “I want to tune out. But I can’t. Because rejecting the results of an election is as un-American as it gets,” Schwarzenegger wrote on X. “To someone like me who talks to people all over the world and still knows America is the shining city on a hill, calling America a trash can for the world is so unpatriotic, it makes me furious. “And I will always be an American before I am a Republican. That’s why, this week, I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.” He added that electing Trump as president would be “four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful”. The legal dispute centers on a 7 August executive order by the Republican Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, ordering the state to run its voter registration rolls against DMV data on a daily basis to check for non-citizens. The justice department and civil rights groups sued, saying that the state was violating a federal law that prohibits systematic removals of voters within 90 days of a federal election. The US district judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request last week to restore the voters. Voting experts have long warned that comparing voting rolls to DMV data is not a reliable way to find non-citizens on the rolls because there may be paperwork errors and people can become naturalized after getting their driver’s license. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said they had identified several people who were in fact citizens but had their registrations wrongly canceled. Donald Trump and allies had distorted the removals, saying that the lower court decision meant that non-citizens were going to be placed back on the voter rolls. But the state had not provided conclusive evidence that many of those removed were non-citizens. The supreme court made the ruling to pause the lower court ruling on its emergency docket and did not give a rationale for its decision, which is customary for rulings on an expedited basis. All three liberal justices on the court – Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – said they would not have halted a lower court ruling earlier in October ordering the state to restore the voter registrations. Virginia’s Republican attorney general Jason Miyares has also lauded the supreme court’s decision to strip away voting rights from approximately 1,600 people, saying: “I am pleased to announce that the US Supreme Court granted Virginia’s emergency stay to keep noncitizens off our voter rolls.” Virginia’s Republican governor Glenn Youngkin has hailed the supreme court’s ruling that allowed the state to proceed with its removal of approximately 1,600 voter registrations, calling it a “victory for common sense and election fairness”. Youngkin, who ordered state officials to identify and cancel the voter registration of alleged non-citizens unless they could prove their citizenship in two weeks, said: “Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections. Virginians also know that we have paper ballots, counting machines not connected to the internet, a strong chain of custody process, signature verification, monitored and secured drop boxes, and a ‘triple check’ vote counting process to tabulate results. Virginians can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia’s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference.” The supreme court has paused the ruling by a lower court that would have restored voting rights to approximately 1,600 voters in Virginia. In its brief order, the supreme court wrote: “The application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted. The October 25, 2024 order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia … is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ is timely sought. Should certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically. In the event certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of the Court.” Last week, Virginia was asked to permit more than 1,600 people to the vote after a federal judge ruled that the state had illegally revoked those rights. The Guardian’s voting rights reporter Sam Levine reported then that the plaintiffs who brought forth the lawsuit said that many people were being incorrectly identified as non-citizen by the Department of Motor Vehicles by checking the wrong box on a form. In a new interview with CBS Mornings, Tim Walz said, “People are hungry to come back together … They’re hungry for us to find solutions.” Walz, who spoke to Good Morning America earlier this morning, said: “One that’s talking about unifying us, one that’s talking about bringing folks to the table … The American tradition of disagreeing and debating but still doing it in a respectful manner.” He went on to add that one of the most important campaign issues was restoring federal reproductive rights across the country, saying, “Restoration of Roe – that’s what we’re looking for.” In response to Arab American voters in Michigan who have voiced their disapproval towards Kamala Harris over her support of Israel, Walz said, “There’s one ticket here that is going to find the pathway to stabilization in the Middle East, but also one that is going to respect their human rights here – push back against Islamophobia – make sure that they have the right to fully engage in our system here.” A former Republican congressional candidate has been charged with stealing ballots in Indiana. Reuters reports: A Republican former congressional candidate was charged with stealing ballots during a test of a voting system in Madison county, Indiana, state police said on Tuesday. During the test on 3 October, which involved four voting machines and 136 candidate ballots marked for testing, officials discovered that two ballots were missing, according to the Indiana state police. Voter fraud is rare in the United States, and courts dismissed multiple lawsuits of alleged electoral fraud brought by former president Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies who accused Democrats of stealing the 2020 election. Trump faces the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, in a 5 November presidential election. For the full story, click here: Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying, “We know it’s going to be close but we’re going to win this thing.” Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said, “We’ve got the better ground game, we’ve got the excitement, we’ve got the momentum on our side.” He added that his biggest concern was that “that Donald Trump has brought up a pessimism to folks, that folks don’t believe that their vote matters. Those votes do matter … Make sure you participate in this democracy. I think you’re going to see Donald Trump continue to spiral downward in this really difficult and hateful rhetoric.” In response to Joe Biden’s “garbage” remark, Walz said, “The president’s clarified his remarks, but let’s be very clear: the vice-president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end … and what I say is, there’s a place for all of us here.” With the election just a few days away, here is what the presidential and vice-presidential candidates are going to be up to today, according to Politico: Donald Trump will hold a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, at 1pm ET then a rally in Green Bay Wisconsin at 7pm ET. JD Vance will hold a town hall with Democrat-turned-Republican Tulsi Gabbard in Bedford, Pennsylvania at 5.30pm ET. Kamala Harris will hold rallies in Raleigh, North Carolina, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Madison, Wisconsin. Tim Walz will make appearances on Good Morning America and CBS Mornings before holding campaign events in Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville, North Carolina. In a new interview on Fox News, Nikki Haley, a Donald Trump critic-turned ally, said now was “not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos”. Haley, who ran against Trump earlier this year before dropping out the presidential race, added: “You’ve got Americans who are absolutely not going to vote for Trump. And then you’ve got a percentage in the middle who like Trump’s policies but don’t like his style. That is what they need to focus on. So when you look at these things, it has got to be a story of addition. This is not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos. This is not a time for them to get overly masculine with this bromance thing that they’ve got going. 53% of the electorate are women with will vote. They care about how they’re being talked to, and they care about the issues …” When Yadira Caraveo, a Democratic party member, won the race to represent Colorado’s eighth district in the House of Representatives in 2022, she eked out a victory, winning by the narrowest margin of any Democrat in the country. This November, Caraveo is facing yet another close race – one that could determine the balance of Congress. In a district where nearly 40% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the community will be decisive in crowning a winner. The battle for their votes is mostly playing out not on TV or in town halls, but on social media and local radio. “[Latino voters] are listening to social media and the radio,” said Sonny Subia, Colorado’s volunteer state director for Lulac, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the country … Local newspapers are just as relevant as ever this election, as the DNC takes out attack ads. The adverts that paint Donald Trump as “unhinged, unstable, unchecked” are running in 25 local newspapers in the seven battleground states. The papers include the Delco Times and Erie Times-News in Pennsylvania or the Macomb Daily and Northern Express in Michigan. On of the ads takes up a full page and is plastered with Trump’s infamous mugshot snapped during his indictment on racketeering charges in Georgia. The ad calls the former president “unhinged, unstable, unchecked” and “unfit to lead”. “In the final week of the election, Democrats are not leaving any stone unturned, reminding voters in key battleground states that their vote means the difference between chaos and revenge with Donald Trump, or a New Way Forward with Vice President Harris,” Jaime Harrison, the chair of the DNC, told the New York Times. Donald Trump’s extremist attacks on top Democrats as “the enemy from within” and talk of deploying the military against political foes if he wins the election are stark signs Trump will endanger the rule of law in America, say former US justice department officials and scholars. Trump’s threats – singling out ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and others as “the enemy from within” and “more dangerous than China [and] Russia” – jibe with his earlier incendiary talk of using a return to the White House to seek “revenge” against political foes led by Joe Biden. He also suggested the military could be used to quell violence at the polls from “radical left lunatics”. Those comments, along with Trump’s adamant refusal to say clearly he will accept the election results if he is defeated, prompt critics to say Trump poses unprecedented dangers to the US constitution … The latest polls show Kamala Harris enjoys a small lead over her rival Donald Trump. However, the election is still too close to call and a small margin of error could see either candidate in the White House. The key battleground states, so named because there is no entrenched support for Democrats or Republicans and could swing either way, are Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s controversial set continues to be used as a political football by both sides of the aisle as election night draws closer. The joke that got everyone’s back up was when Hinchcliffe compared Puerto Rico to a floating island of garbage. President Joe Biden said Puerto Ricans are “good, decent honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” Republicans seized on the president’s line, comparing it to Hilary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables,” comment during the 2016 election campaign. Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Trump’s running mate, said: “This is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country.” Just one day earlier, Vance brushed off the Puerto Rico island-of-garbage comment, saying, “We have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America.” Biden backpedalled somewhat on social media: “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage – which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” he wrote. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.” If Donald Trump wins next week’s election, it would be the first time in US history that a candidate wins based on such a huge lie – his falsehood that we have “the worst economy ever”. The former president’s Big Lie has distorted the views of millions of Americans, wrongly convincing many that the US economy is in bad shape. There’s no denying that many Americans are struggling economically and that inflation was painfully high back in 2022, but inflation is far lower now, and most economists agree that our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is way down, economic growth is solid, and job growth has been remarkably strong. Indeed, the country has added nearly 18m jobs – a record – under the Biden-Harris administration. Not only that, median household income has climbed to $80,610, higher than it was in Trump’s last year in office… Welcome to our ongoing coverage of the US election campaign as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump continue to make their pitches to voters with less than a week to go to election day. Current president Joe Biden was forced to clarify comments he made on Tuesday after he was seen in an edited video clip saying “the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters”. He said that a pro-Trump comedian’s “hateful rhetoric” about Puerto Rico was “garbage”. Republican politicians and rightwing media outlets quickly picked up the clip to argue that Biden had called Trump’s supporters garbage, comparing his remarks with Hillary Clinton’s labeling of half of Trump supporters as belonging in “a basket of deplorables” in 2016. Elsewhere: Urged by some allies to apologise for racist comments made by speakers at his weekend rally, Donald Trump took the opposite approach on Tuesday, saying it was an “honour to be involved” in such an event and calling the scene a “lovefest” – the same term he has used to describe the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol. Harris will spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss her campaign’s plans. If elected, Harris would be the first graduate of a historically Black university to occupy the Oval Office. Michelle Obama took the stump in Georgia. The former first lady’s organisation When We All Vote hosted a rally for more than 2,000 people at an arena in College Park, near Atlanta’s airport – a slickly produced event that was dominated by earnest pleas to vote from a star-studded roster. JD Vance hit back at those who say Trump is a fascist, accusing Harris and her allies of disrespecting second world war veterans as he campaigned on Tuesday in one of the most hotly contested regions of battleground Michigan."

          "bodyText": "We’re looking for apps I don’t remember downloading, and which platforms can access my smartphone’s camera or microphone; who else can see my calendar, my notes, my emails. We also check the basics: whether my device is actually registered to my name and email address, and whether I have two-factor authentication turned on. Rose MacDonald, cofounder of Nansen Digital Forensic Services, is walking me through the digital safety audit she provides to victim-survivors of family violence. I’m talking to the former police detective and digital forensics specialist so that I can better understand the experience of people who are subject to this kind of abuse – and how they can minimise the risks. We examine who might be able to access my Google or iCloud accounts. What third-party platforms are connected to the account, and whether my emails are being forwarded to another address. Sometimes when MacDonald does these audits she finds hi-tech surveillance tools – spyware, for example, which buries itself deep in your phone’s software. But this kind of technology costs money and much more often, she says, perpetrators take advantage of the opportunities for surveillance offered by everyday features: the shared accounts or location sharing tools that reveal more than we realise. “What we find more typically is misconfiguration of normal settings … and breaches of the cloud environment. If they’ve got a username and password to something, you don’t really need a lot of technical knowledge,” she says. The use of technology to “control, abuse, track and intimidate” is a common feature of family violence in Australia. A report published in 2020 found that almost all of the 442 frontline DV practitioners surveyed had had clients “who had experienced technology-facilitated stalking and abuse”, with particular risks for women with disabilities or those who are from Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander or non-English speaking backgrounds. Advocates have told Guardian Australia about trackers in cars and secret cameras, but also messages of intimidation sent via bank transfers and even online shopping purchases. “It can be really insidious [and] really difficult, if you think about how many accounts you have on different sites, how many passwords,” says Rosa Grahame, principal solicitor of the family law practice at Women’s Legal Centre ACT. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email ‘I thought he was being a nice guy’ In my audit, MacDonald and I talk about my wifi network at home and who set it up; whether the password has been changed. Do I know what it is? We check whether my calls are being forwarded to another number. We look at my Bluetooth connected devices. If I had a smartwatch, for example, this is where we might have a discussion about who bought it – was it me or someone else? “We start thinking about [whether] the perpetrator of violence got access to the account [and] the health data, which might show your location,” MacDonald says. As she runs forensic software that looks for traces of foreign devices and suspicious activity, MacDonald says the audits are also about education. She wants people to leave understanding the relationship between their device and the cloud. “I explain to them … if a perpetrator got into this environment … they can access your Gmail, they can access maps, they can access your documents,” she says. These scenarios are familiar to Lauren*, whose partner subjected her to years of what she now sees as coercive control. “I thought he was being a nice guy when he bought me a brand new phone and set it up on his business account,” she said. “But it was really so that he had access to all my text messages and who I’m calling.” He also set up her email, she says, and was able to get into her Facebook account. Later, he would confront her over innocuous messages. “It’s a campaign for dominance and control over someone,” Lauren says. During the audit, we scroll through my phone’s family sharing settings. MacDonald tells me that if I log in from a new location to a shared account for a streaming platform, for example, a prompt might be sent to the original account – giving me away. Ultimately, in a family violence situation, it could be a child’s account that reveals my movements and location – even the app that sends updates from daycare. One trend Grahame from the Women’s Legal Centre has observed is perpetrators giving children items to enable GPS monitoring, such as a smart watch. In another case, a man installed a tracker in his daughter’s toy frog. Criminologist Molly Dragiewicz of Griffith University has researched how children might be involved in technology abuse via everything from mobile phones and GPS tracking to gaming devices and social media. She says some forms of surveillance-like tracking apps have been normalised between parents and children. “The same exact technologies can be used for good or to do harm depending on the context of the relationship,” she says. “It’s not about specific technologies. It’s about the context in which they’re used.” Audits need to be trauma-informed Digital safety audits like the one I undertook with MacDonald are not easily accessible, and funding can vary by state. In Victoria, programs such as the Personal Safety Initiative can help facilitate access to safety audits among other security steps. But if a victim-survivor uses a private service, the cost can run to hundreds of dollars. Another concern raised by several advocates is the lack of vetting of those in the private security space – as well as whether they are properly trauma-informed and aware of the specific risks related to family violence. Diarmaid Harkin, a senior lecturer in criminology at Deakin University, has researched some of the solutions offered for technology-facilitated abuse. He says any claims about technology that can “detect” spyware needs to be deeply scrutinised, as the sector is rapidly evolving and there will always be limitations. “Those [tech safety] audits themselves need to be audited,” Harkin says. “Is the advice appropriate from a technical perspective, but also is it appropriate in the context of domestic violence?” MacDonald also believes the security industry needs better standardisation when it comes to family violence safety assessments, to ensure risks aren’t being missed. She says she’s seen some providers do a “factory reset” on phones, for example, erasing important evidence that might be needed in court. It might also simply be unsafe for the victim-survivor to disconnect the perpetrator from their devices without first consulting family violence services or police, she says. “If we find a compromise, then we have a discussion around the best way to manage it. If I was to cut that access off without any further safety planning, that could escalate behaviour.” Even as the government pushes digital platforms to design for safety first, we can’t promise victim-survivors absolute security, Dr Dragiewicz says. Spyware is constantly evolving, but also the technology we need to function every day – to work, communicate and pay bills – creates risks. It’s not realistic to simply ask people to disconnect, she says. “A lot of the responsibility for taking care of tech safety is offloaded on to the victim. We’re not actually addressing or interrupting the behaviour of the abusers,” she says. Lauren now works with a group called DV Safe Phone, which provides free mobile phones to victim-survivors of family violence. “Certainly, when someone’s after power and control, they know how much everyone relies on our phones now,” she says. “To be able to have access to a phone that they don’t know about … it can really be life-changing.” * First name only for privacy reasons • In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump’s extremist attacks on top Democrats as “the enemy from within” and talk of deploying the military against political foes if he wins the election are stark signs Trump will endanger the rule of law in America, say former US justice department officials and scholars. Trump’s threats – singling out ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and others as “the enemy from within” and “more dangerous than China [and] Russia” – jibe with his earlier incendiary talk of using a return to the White House to seek “revenge” against political foes led by Joe Biden. He also suggested the military could be used to quell violence at the polls from “radical left lunatics”. Those comments, along with Trump’s adamant refusal to say clearly he will accept the election results if he is defeated, prompt critics to say Trump poses unprecedented dangers to the US constitution. Critics call Trump’s campaign rhetoric especially worrisome since it squares with his efforts after he lost the 2020 election to falsely claim the voting was rigged, while scheming to overturn the results before a mob of his allies on January 6 attacked the Capitol as Congress was certifying the results. Alarm about a second Trump term were heightened this month when Trump’s former chief of staff and former four-star marine general John Kelly condemned him in the Atlantic as unfit to govern and having said: “I need to have the kind of generals that Hitler had.” Ex-justice department officials are appalled by Trump’s demonizing his political foes as “the enemy from within”, words used by the demagogic senator Joe McCarthy, and ruminating about using the military against them to exact revenge. “Trump’s anti-democratic, authoritarian rhetoric has been ratcheted up the closer we draw to the election,” said Michael Bromwich, a former inspector general at the justice department. “Rather than keeping a covert enemies list, he publicly names his enemies against whom he vows to take action. The implications for a Trump justice department, charged with dealing with Trump’s lust to retaliate against these enemies, are frightening to consider.” Bromwich said: “People who take their oath to the constitution seriously have trouble wrapping their heads around someone who views the constitution and the rule of law as nuisances to be circumvented rather than a set of principles to be scrupulously honored.” Other justice department veterans express similar worries about a second Trump term. “Trump’s rhetoric is dangerous for two reasons. Using the powers of the presidency to go after his political rivals is an incredibly dangerous deviation from democratic norms and the rule of law,” said Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor in eastern Michigan and a law professor at the University of Michigan. “The rule of law requires that we apply the law equally to everyone, and not in retaliation for political activity or speech. Second, the military is to be used against our foreign adversaries, not our own citizens. These tactics are things we see in authoritarian regimes, not democracies. Following through on these threats would change the country as we know it.” Fears about how Trump would rule in a second term have metastasized as former senior top officials in his first administration have gone public, labeling him a fascist and unfit to be president again. Mark Milley, Trump’s ex-chair of the joint chiefs of staff, was in quoted in Bob Woodward’s new book calling Trump “fascist to the core”. Kelly, too, told the New York Times that Trump met the definition of a “fascist” and “prefers the dictator approach to government”, and once said that “Hitler did some good things”. Trump in turn attacked Kelly last Friday, calling him a “whack job” and boasting that he had fired Kelly, who was a “nutjob to start off with. These are phoney stories by a general that got fired.” Thirteen former Trump officials signed a letter supporting Kelly’s charges and attacking Trump’s “disdain for the American military and admiration for dictators like Hitler”. Don’t miss important US election coverage. Get our free app and sign up for election alerts Trump’s obsession with having a military loyal to him as Hitler did, fits with a larger pattern in Trump world: Trump and his allies have made it clear that loyalty to Trump will be a prerequisite to serve in a new administration, and that moderate Republicans would not be welcome. Critics say Trump is intent on creating an administration without the kinds of guardrails that existed with people like Kelly and Milley as checks against his authoritarian instincts, a point that is underscored by Trump’s campaign talk of using the justice department to seek “revenge” on his enemies. That mindset was palpable when Trump told the podcast host Joe Rogan on Friday that the country faces a “bigger problem … with the enemy from within” than the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, and allowed that his “biggest mistake” as president was hiring “disloyal people”. Trump’s latest incendiary claims fit too with his call in 2022 on Truth Social for the “termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the constitution”, which he justified by citing his false claims the 2020 election was stolen. Tim Naftali, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, said: “Trump wants a second go without any obstacles from people who will tell him what he can’t do. People who served as guardrails during his first term are now worried about what he will do if he gets a second term without guardrails. From personal experience they know that his instincts are injurious to US national security and our constitutional democracy.” Naftali noted further that the supreme court’s much criticized ruling broadening presidential immunity “has made it easier for Trump, if he wins, to push his own people to do whatever he wants”. “The court has made this a more permissive environment for an abusive president. If he’s re-elected, Trump can take advantage of the new permissive environment created by the supreme court which wraps his official acts in at least presumed immunity.” Naftali’s warnings are buttressed by Trump’s repeated threats to seek revenge against his enemies, whom he has often portrayed as part of a “deep state” conspiracy against him that he claims involves a weaponized justice department waging “lawfare” against him. Little wonder that Trump last Thursday upped his attacks on Jack Smith, the special counsel who has filed criminal charges against the former president over his election subversion efforts in 2020, and for improperly taking hundreds of classified documents with him when he left office. Trump said he would fire Smith in “two seconds” and that he should be “thrown out of the country”. Justice department veterans voice alarm about Trump’s barrage of autocratic-style threats about seeking revenge on foes in both parties if he defeats Kamala Harris. “For a long time, Donald Trump has been promising to use government to punish his enemies. It is shocking but not surprising that he has now adopted the language of Joseph McCarthy by labelling his likely targets ‘the enemy from within’”, said Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general under the former president George HW Bush. “But this is just one more piece of his single-minded effort to divide the American people and establish his own authoritarian power by attacking the basic principles that have long united us. The American people must not let him get away with this.” Other justice department alumni see Trump posing unprecedented dangers if he wins again. “No one in our history has ever stressed the constitution the way Trump has,” said Ty Cobb, a lawyer who served in the Trump White House and former justice department official. Cobb added: “The founders could not have conceived of the possibility a crippled narcissist like Trump, a court -determined rapist … with dozens of criminal felony convictions, serious pending charges, some involving functional insurrection, and civil fraud liability in the hundreds of millions, could possibly be a serious presidential candidate, much less elected.” Bromwich, too, sees the prospect of Trump in power again as frightening. “What would a justice department staffed by senior officials willing to implement Trump’s authoritarian, unconstitutional, and retaliation-minded agenda look like? Like nothing we have ever seen: staffed by lawyers with much ambition and little principle, working for a president himself protected by the immunity from prosecution conferred by the supreme court.” • Footnote added on 12 September 2025: With reference to a comment expressed by Ty Cobb, Donald Trump was found liable for sexual abuse, but not rape, in a civil case, although a judge later said it constituted “rape” in common parlance"

          "headline": "Sweden and Norway rethink cashless society plans over Russia security fears",
          "bodyText": "Sweden and Norway are backpedalling on plans for cashless societies over fears that fully digital payment systems would leave them vulnerable to Russian security threats, and concern for those unable to use them. A combination of good high-speed internet coverage, high digital literacy rates, large rural populations and fast-growing fintech industries had put the Nordic neighbours on a fast track to a future without cash. Swish, a mobile payment system that six banks launched in 2012, is ubiquitous in Sweden, from market stalls to coffee shops and clothes stores. The Norwegian equivalent, Vipps, which merged with Danish MobilePay in 2022 to form Vipps MobilePay, is also very popular. Last month, it also launched in Sweden. The former deputy governor of Sweden’s central bank predicted in 2018 that Sweden would probably be cashless by 2025. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and a subsequent rise in cross-border hybrid warfare and cyber-attacks blamed on pro-Russia groups have prompted a rethink. The Swedish government has since completely overhauled its defence and preparedness strategy, joining Nato, starting a new form of national service and reactivating its psychological defence agency to combat disinformation from Russia and other adversaries. Norway has tightened controls on its previously porous border with Russia. The security rethink extends to the fundamentals of how people pay for goods and services. In a brochure with the title If Crisis or War Comes that will be sent to every home in Sweden next month, the defence ministry advises people to use cash regularly and keep at least a week’s supply in various denominations as well as access to other forms of payment such as bank cards and digital payment services. “If you can pay in several different ways, you strengthen your preparedness,” it says. The government is also considering legislation to protect the ability to pay in cash for certain goods. Cash is legal tender in Sweden, but shops and restaurants can effectively make themselves cashless as long as they display a notice setting out their restrictions on payment methods. Norwegian retail customers have always had the right to pay in cash, but it has not been enforced and in recent years increasing numbers of retailers have gone cashless, locking out about 600,000 people who do not have access to digital services. The government acted over the summer, bringing in legislation under which retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they do not accept cash payments from 1 October. The justice and public security ministry said it “recommends everyone keep some cash on hand due to the vulnerabilities of digital payment solutions to cyber-attacks”. It said the government took preparedness seriously “given the increasing global instability with war, digital threats, and climate change. As a result, they’ve ensured that the right to pay with cash is strengthened”. The country’s justice and emergencies minister, Emilie Enger Mehl, said earlier this year: “If no one pays with cash and no one accepts cash, cash will no longer be a real emergency solution once the crisis is upon us.” Prolonged power cuts, system failures or digital attacks on payment systems and banks could leave cash as “the only alternative that is easily available”, she said. Max Brimberg, a researcher at Sweden’s central bank, said the move away from cash had been driven largely by the private sector. Many of the country’s banks abolished cash in local branches some time ago, which made digital payment services easy to roll out to a very willing public. The percentage of cash purchases in physical shops has fallen from almost 40% in 2012 to about 10% in recent years, and Brimberg said there was growing concern about cash becoming obsolete. “That’s something that we as a central bank and also the central government see as a potential risk, especially for the people who still haven’t adopted the digital economy and also for preparedness if there were to be a weaponised attack or armed attack against Sweden or a close country,” he said. “So cash fills a very specific role in the payment system, both because it’s issued by the state but also because it’s the only form of payment that we can use if the systems for electricity or communications networks don’t work as they usually do.” Because all Swedish payment systems were part of one ecosystem, an attack could bring society to a standstill, he said. “Pretty much any function that you do in society you have to use some sort of payment or verification analysis, either by electronic ID or electronic payment,” he said. “All of those would be at risk of undermining the functionality of the entire system in Sweden if it were to fail.” The central bank is looking into creating and issuing an “e-krona” that would act as a “digital complement to cash”, but implementation would require a political mandate. Hans Liwång, a professor of systems science for defence and security at the Swedish Defence University, said there was a lack of evidence about whether cash was better than digital payments in the face of modern threats. Pointing to Ukraine, where digital systems have proved vital to its resilience, he said: “Ukraine is a very good example of moving into the future when there is war rather than backwards.”"

          "bodyText": "When the Reserve Bank board meet next week to discuss interest rates, it will have an inescapable “best-laid schemes of mice and men” feel about it. For sure, there will the usual meticulous assembly and assessment of data, including Wednesday’s relatively benign inflation figures. The annual consumer price index landed at 2.8% for the September quarter from a year earlier, retreating for the seventh of the past eight quarters. It is now within the RBA’s 2%-3% target range for the first time since early 2021. Most of the other trends were friends too. Underlying inflation, as measured by trimming off more volatile items, eased half a percentage point from the June quarter, to 3.5% – or about where the RBA had expected it to be by the end of 2024. Shoppers may not yet appreciate it but the price of essentials, or non-discretionary items, were up 2.9%. Tradeable goods, including petrol, were barely up at all – rising just 0.6% – reflecting in part China’s faltering economy with more of their products exported. Services were the most obvious holdout. It crept up for a second straight quarter to an annual pace of 4.6% – reflecting strong jobs growth in that sector – and will no doubt prompt the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, to repeat concerns about “sticky” inflation. The RBA decision will almost certainly see it hold its cash rate at 4.35%, marking a year since its most recent rate hike. Attention will likely focus on whether the board at least considered a rate cut – something it hasn’t done in about four years. As they do every quarter, the RBA’s monetary mavens will also update the central bank’s forecasts of where they think everything – from the oil price to government spending and household saving – will change over the next two years. A routine event, as far as the schemes of the women and men of our central bank go. But how long might it take before Bullock’s nuanced comments or the finely calibrated forecasts are overtaken by events? After all, the first polls will be opening in the US not long after the RBA’s board meeting wraps upon Tuesday. Counting delays can be expected to elevate tensions – unless there is a decisive victory for Democrats or Republicans. So far, markets seem to be adjusting to varying expectations of whether the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, will prevail for the Democrats or Donald Trump will make a return to the White House he reluctantly and ungraciously left four years ago. “A Harris win is likely to see a great degree of policy continuity regarding trade (and, more broadly, industrial policy), immigration and Federal Reserve independence,” NAB’s senior economist, Tony Kelly, opined in a report released on Wednesday. “A Trump presidency in contrast would pursue substantially different policy in these areas, although a divided Congress would impede some of his agenda.” Trump’s promise of a 60% tariff on many imports is just one of the policy departures from the Democrat president, Joe Biden. The RBA board will no doubt be mulling similar advice as it weighs up various scenarios – although don’t expect the wargaming to appear in its meeting minutes. Perhaps everything will go smoothly in the world’s biggest economy. Everyone – in the US and elsewhere – can then return to dealing with more prosaic considerations, such as what December quarter inflation may look like and how soon might the RBA cut rates. The alternative, though, of US political fights moving from the pulpit to the courts to the streets can’t be airily dismissed."

          "bodyText": "A Melbourne woman has died after she and her son were poisoned by a homemade meal containing foraged mushrooms, prompting a warning from the coroner. The 98-year-old woman, Loreta Maria Del Rossi, died in hospital on 22 May, seven days after eating the meal. In the Victorian state coroner’s report released on Wednesday, Judge John Cain said Del Rossi died from multi-organ failure after poisoning from the toxins found in lethal “death cap” mushrooms (Amanita phalloides). Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The death prompted Cain to call for an annual public health campaign about the dangers of consuming wild mushrooms – including how to identify and remove deadly fungi, and instructions for suspected poisoning. Victoria’s health department warns people in the state not to pick and eat them “unless you are an expert”. Del Rossi lived with her adult son, Nicola Del Rossi, in the eastern suburb of Bayswater, where, according to the report, she cooked with homegrown vegetables and was known to regularly collect wild edible grasses such as dandelion, milk thistle and cat’s ear. Foraging is common in European countries including Italy, from where Del Rossi migrated with her son and daughter in 1955. The report detailed that Del Rossi found wild mushrooms in the garden in April, and told her son that she would collect, clean and test them. They consumed the mushrooms in a meal of rice and tuna with no negative effects. On 15 May, Del Rossi found more mushrooms growing in the same patch and prepared them in the same way for her son to cook for dinner. After they both ate the meal and went to bed, Del Rossi began vomiting at 2am and her son became unwell at 6am. He called an ambulance and they were transported to hospital. Del Rossi’s son survived, but her condition deteriorated despite aggressive treatments. She told staff she was in significant pain, and in line with her wishes, entered palliative care on 20 May. The health department’s Better Health website, referenced in the coroner’s finding, warns poisonous mushrooms typically grow in Victoria in autumn. It states the yellow-staining mushroom is the most commonly eaten poisonous mushroom in Victoria, and is, the coroner’s report noted, “often confused for edible mushrooms that can be purchased in supermarkets”. “The death cap mushroom is usually whitish, yellow, pale brown or green in colour and often grows under oak trees,” the report said. The estimated lethal dose of amatoxins in humans is 0.1 mg/kg. As such, the coroner’s report warned, a 50g mushroom could contain a potentially fatal quantity of anatoxins for a 70kg adult."

          "headline": "Unknown waltz by Chopin found in library vault after nearly 200 years",
          "bodyText": "An unknown waltz by Chopin, written nearly 200 years ago, has been discovered in the vault of the Morgan Library and Museum in New York. The score, on a card bearing Frédéric Chopin’s hand-written name, was found by a curator in the spring, the New York Times reported on Sunday. “I thought, ‘What’s going on here? What could this be?’ I didn’t recognise the music,” curator Robinson McClellan told the paper. He was at first unsure that the piece was actually Chopin’s after photographing the score and playing it on a keyboard at home. He conferred with an academic at the University of Pennsylvania who is an expert on the Polish composer, before the Morgan concluded the find was genuine after testing the ink and paper. The penmanship was also found to match Chopin’s, including the reproduction of a stylised bass clef symbol as well as doodling characteristic of the composer. “We have total confidence in our conclusion,” McClellan said. The finding may prompt debate in the classical music field, where reports of unearthed masterpieces are sometimes greeted sceptically, and where there is a history of fakes and forgeries, the New York Times reported. Newly discovered works by Chopin, who died in 1849 at 39, are rare. While he is one of music’s most beloved figures – his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is encased in a church in Warsaw – he was less prolific than other composers, writing about 250 pieces, almost entirely for solo piano. The museum believes that the music is from between 1830 and 1835, when Chopin was in his early 20s. The tune features a stark opening and was described by pianist Lang Lang as containing “dramatic darkness turning into a positive thing”. With Agence France-Presse"

          "headline": "Budget will end neglect of ‘broken not beaten’ NHS, say Labour ministers",
          "bodyText": "The budget will revive a “broken but not beaten” NHS, Labour ministers have said, with billions of pounds of funding to be announced in an effort to cut record waiting lists. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said measures to be announced on Wednesday would “end the neglect” of the health service, delivering more surgical hubs and radiotherapy machines in a drive to lay on an extra 40,000 appointments a week. The government is expected to deliver a boost of at least 4% to NHS annual funding, sources have previously told the Guardian, which could translate to a cash injection of about £7bn for the health budget in England. In a speech on Monday to underline how steep tax rises would fund public spending, Keir Starmer said this would be the biggest budget of the next five years, with the toughest decisions, to set the course for the whole parliament. The prime minister said he wanted to “take the difficult decisions here and now upfront” to create the conditions for improving public services, investment and growth. “We are fixing the foundations in this budget … That’s the approach … you can expect to see pretty well all of that in this budget,” he said, though he added that he could not “ever completely rule out any further changes”. Treasury sources said Starmer and Reeves would emphasise this week that the budget would be “generational” and would contain the most significant decisions of the parliament, barring unexpected crises. “We do not want to come back and do another budget of this magnitude,” one said. “This is responding to a once-in-a-generation set of crises and we don’t intend to ask the country to do this again.” Tax rises are expected to hit employers’ national insurance contributions, a rise that will directly be linked with the investment planned for the NHS. The rises are not likely to be extended to employers’ pensions contributions. The chancellor is also expected to make changes to capital gains and inheritance tax and to extend the freeze on tax thresholds, meaning more households will be dragged into paying higher rates of tax as wages rise. It comes as Reeves unveils a £240m package to speed up the rollout of local services to help people back into work. The “Get Britain Working” scheme is expected to feature support in work, skills and health for people who are disabled or long-term sick. Treasury sources said there would be “no rabbits” – big surprise measures – claiming they were instead focused on the serious endeavour of fixing the national finances. Speaking on a visit to St George’s hospital in south London on Monday, Reeves and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said hard choices would deliver extra public spending where it was necessary. Starmer also underlined that point in his speech, drawing a distinction with the elections of 1997 and 2010 when Labour leaders promised to match Conservative spending plans. The prime minister said he had never made the same commitment because he was not prepared to countenance significant spending cuts – though cabinet ministers have privately raised alarm at the prospect of squeezed budgets. “The budget the chancellor will deliver on Wednesday will prevent devastating austerity in our public services and prevent a disastrous path for our public finances,” Starmer said. “That is the reality of what would happen if we’d stuck to Tory spending plans.” He admitted the £2 bus fare cap, which was introduced under the Conservatives to kickstart public transport use after the Covid pandemic, would end. The cap will rise to £3 after the current funding runs out at the end of the year. The decision comes despite heavy lobbying by Labour’s elected mayors to keep the cap in place, as reported last week by the Guardian. The prime minister also gave a hint that the chancellor could freeze fuel duty once more in this week’s budget, telling a reporter from the Sun, which has campaigned to keep the freeze in place: “I do understand how important it is to you, your readers and others.” During their hospital visit, Reeves and Streeting said the NHS could not wait for future budgets in order to start making drastic improvements. Streeting, who has been criticised for describing the NHS as broken, said it was “broken but it’s not beaten” and the budget marked a moment to rebuild, including a focus on elective treatment. In August 6.4 million patients in England were waiting for 7.6 million hospital appointments, scans or operations, and more than 280,000 of those appointments or treatments had been awaited for more than a year. The government announced on Monday that the budget would fund £1.5bn for more surgical hubs and scanners and £70m for new radiotherapy machines, which Reeves said would free up thousands of additional procedures and millions of diagnostic tests in England. Matthew Taylor, the head of the NHS Confederation, said the announcement was a “step in the right direction” especially ahead of a “difficult” winter. He said: “We know that capital investment is critical to increasing productivity and ensuring patients are provided with the best possible care in a timely way.” The Kings Fund said capital investment would “only go so far in improving patient care when the existing backlog of NHS maintenance issues with buildings and equipment continues to rapidly rise and now stands at a staggering £13.8bn.” Figures seen by the Guardian show that the NHS would need to spend more than £240m just to replace out-of-date radiotherapy machines. According to Radiotherapy UK, an estimated 70 machines are expected to be out of date by the end of 2024. It would cost about £3.5m to replace each machine. Prof Pat Price, the chair of Radiotherapy UK, said: “While £70m is a very welcome first significant investment in new radiotherapy machines since 2016, if the government is serious about cutting cancer treatment waiting lists, there’s a lot more that needs to be done. “Investing £350m in radiotherapy by replacing out-of-date machines alongside new technologies could free up 87,000 cancer appointments and super-boost the capacity of our cancer workforce.” Mark Lawler, a professor of digital health at Queen’s University Belfast and the chair of the International Benchmarking Partnership, said that combined with £400m funding for cancer surgery and £100m for chemotherapy, the government would need to spend £850m on cancer treatment to make substantial inroads into cancer waiting lists, enabling more patients to be treated quicker. “Incredibly, we have not achieved the 62-day target for referral to first treatment since 2015, a shocking indictment of a system that is failing our cancer patients,” he said. “Prompt treatment is crucial to the chances of survival. An investment of just £850m – a tiny fraction of the overall NHS budget – would make significant inroads into the cancer treatment waiting lists, saving thousands of lives.” • This article was amended on 29 October and 1 November 2024. An earlier version said that in August “more than 7.6 million patients” in England were waiting for treatment, with more than 280,000 waiting over a year; to clarify, the figure was 6.4 million patients waiting for 7.6 million treatments, 280,000 of which treatments had been awaited for more than a year."

Starmer has promised “better days ahead” and said the era of Tory neglect and “making working people pay the price” for their policies was over. Warning “there are no shortcuts” after 14 years of Tory-led government, he said “The time is long overdue for politicians in this country to level with you honestly about the trade-offs this country faces”. The use of the word “genocide” in relation to the war in Gaza risks undermining genocides such as the Holocaust, David Lammy has said. The foreign secretary was replying to a question by Conservative MP Nick Timothy, who asked whether the description of Israel’s actions in Gaza as “annihilation, extermination and genocide” was inappropriate. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer welcomed Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati to Downing Street for a bilateral meeting. The pair shook hands outside Number 10, where they are expected to discuss the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The prime minister offered Mikati his “condolences for the very many losses in your country”. Labour figures today have been repeatedly questioned by the media about the definition of “working person”. The prime minister said “I’m concerned with what’s in their payslip, and making sure that there is no more tax in their payslip”. Cabinet minister Pat McFadden said the budget would be the “most honest” in years. McFadden also issued a strong rebuke to shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s criticism of the Office for Budget Responsibility plans to publish a report about the country’s fiscal situation, saying the Tories “don’t want to hear the truth” about the financial situation they left for the new government. Foreign secretary David Lammy robustly defended his position and the topics he had raised with the Chinese in recent discussion during an urgent question in the Commons, where he was repeatedly criticised for not being strong enough. Lammy said it was “crass” to suggest in three months he could have brough about different outcomes to the previous government’s 14 years of diplomacy. Kemi Badenoch said the Tory leadership election was “existential” for the party. She nevertheless claimed the party could return to power after one term of a Labour government. Russell Findlay, the new Scottish Conservative leader, has proposed cutting free prescriptions, merging local authorities and abolishing quangos to deliver cuts in Scottish income tax rates. The adult prison population in England and Wales has dropped 3% after reaching record levels. That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and the UK politics live blog for today. Thanks for following along. Conservative shadow Treasury minister Gareth Davies has urged the government to say how much Labour plans to borrow in this Wednesday’s budget. Across the dispatch box from chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones, Davies pressed the government on what advice Treasury officials had given to ministers about the impact of Labour’s spending plans on interest rates. He also asked: “This Labour government are quick to spend but unwilling to explain, so can I ask the chief secretary finally, on behalf of the British people and the markets who are watching this statement so very nervously, what definition of public debt is the UK offering to lenders today and how much does the government plan to borrow under an expanded definition?” Jones said in his reply: “He has some brass neck standing up in this House telling this government how to behave after the years of his party’s maladministration over the last 14 years.” The minister had earlier set out changes to fiscal rules, known as the “stability rule, that we will pay for all day-to-day spending on public services from receipts” and the “investment rule, which will get debt falling as a proportion of our economy”. He said: “After years of chaos from the Conservative party, chaos that cost families, businesses and public services dear, the British people are now rightly looking to this new Labour government to clear up the mess from the last government, to fix the foundations and to rebuild Britain.” Meanwhile, Keir Starmer welcomed Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati to Downing Street for a bilateral meeting. The pair shook hands outside Number 10, where they are expected to discuss the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The prime minister offered Mikati his “condolences for the very many losses in your country”. Referring to the “long, shared and good history” between the UK and Lebanon, Starmer said it was important to discuss how to bring about a “cessation of hostilities” and “ensure that the UN resolution is not just words”. Mikati thanked Starmer for calling for a ceasefire in the region and for Britain’s support on humanitarian matters. The foreign secretary has said that if Israel severs its ties with the United Nations agency dedicated to humanitarian aid in Gaza, it could be grounds for sanctions. MPs asked David Lammy whether he would be introducing sanctions on Israeli politicians several times after he gave his statement on the Middle East on Monday afternoon. Labour’s Patricia Ferguson asked if new laws due to be debated in the Israeli parliament this week over whether to stop all cooperation with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees could hasten sanctions. She said: “Given the way in which the Knesset to vote on the issue on Unrwa today, will he, if that decision goes the way it seems to be going in which Israel will make it very difficult if not impossible for Unrwa to operate, with the consequence that humanitarian aid will not get into Gaza. “Is that not the point at which we have to consider serious sanctions against those who are proponents of such action?” Lammy said: “Yes, the truth is if Unrwa is brought to its knees, that would be a very very serious event indeed.” SNP MP for Dundee Central Chris Law called for sanctions for Yair Golan, the Israel Democrats Party leader who during an interview in June called for Palestinians to “starve” if Hamas did not return hostages. Lammy said: “These issues are being kept under review.” The use of the word “genocide” in relation to the war in Gaza risks undermining genocides such as the Holocaust, David Lammy has said. The foreign secretary was replying to a question by Conservative MP Nick Timothy, who asked whether the description of Israel’s actions in Gaza as “annihilation, extermination and genocide” was inappropriate. Timothy said: “Today, as on other occasions recently we’ve heard comments from the benches opposite that suggest somehow Israel is conducting a war of annihilation, extermination and of genocide. “There is obviously much suffering in Gaza, and we all accept that, but this terminology is completely inappropriate, not accurate, and is repeated by the protesters and the lawbreakers who are intimidating British Jews as we saw again this weekend. Will the foreign secretary take the opportunity to say that there is not a genocide occurring in the Middle East?” Lammy said: “There are quite properly legal terms that must be determined by international courts. “But I do agree with the honourable gentleman, those terms were largely used when millions of people lost their lives in crises like Rwanda, the second world war in the Holocaust, and the way that they are used now undermines the seriousness of that term.” Iran “should not respond” to Israeli airstrikes over the weekend, David Lammy has urged. The foreign secretary told the Commons on Monday: Targeted Israeli strikes hit military sites inside Iran including a missile manufacturer and an air defence base. This was in response to Iran’s escalatory ballistic missile attacks on Israel, condemned across the House. These attacks were the latest in a long history of malign Iranian activity. Its nuclear programme, with their total enriched uranium stockpile now reported by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) to be 30 times the Jcpoa (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Iran nuclear deal) limit, and political, financial, military support for militias including Hezbollah and Hamas. Let me be clear, the Government unequivocally condemns Iranian attacks on Israel. Lammy warned Iran and its proxies’ goal is the “complete eradication of the Israeli state” and added: “We do not mourn the deaths of the heads of proscribed terrorist organisations. The priority now is immediate de-escalation. Iran should not respond. “All sides must exercise restraint. We do not wish to see the cycle of violence intensified, dragging the whole region into a war with severe consequences.” The prime minister’s official spokesperson, responding to the Commons Speaker’s criticism, told reporters “it’s entirely routine for government to make announcements in the run up to budgets and spending reviews”. However, they added: But obviously we will also ensure that parliament has all the requisite time to scrutinise measures clearly. The chancellor will be in front of parliament on Wednesday and, indeed, there will be days of budget debate subsequently at which parliamentarians will be able to scrutinise budget measures. Lindsay Hoyle earlier accused Chancellor Rachel Reeves of acting with “supreme discourtesy” towards MPs given her “premature disclosure” of budget details. In an angry rebuke delivered in parliament he said it was “totally unacceptable to go around the world telling everybody” about “major” new policy announcements rather than giving the information first to MPs. In the announcement, Hoyle said Reeves’s interview were “major new policy announcements with significant and wide-ranging implications for the government’s fiscal policy and for the public finances.” He said: It is evident to me that this should therefore have been made in the first instance in this House and not to the world’s media. This principle is clearly and unambiguously set out in paragraph 9.1 of the Ministerial Code. While this can hardly be described as a leak - the Chancellor herself gave interviews on the record and on camera - the premature disclosure of the contents of the budget has always been regarded as a supreme discourtesy to the House. Indeed, I still regard it as such. I am very, very disappointed that the Chancellor expects the House to wait nearly a full week to hear her repeat these announcements in the budget statement on Wednesday. The bus fare cap in England will be extended for a further year, but rise from £2 to £3, Keir Starmer has said. The Liberal Democrats have described it as a “bus tax”, and Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick called the move “clueless”.

Read more here: UK loses out on £19bn in annual GDP growth due to lack of social mobility My colleague Jessica Elgot has also suggested that the speaker was misguided earlier in his vociferous criticism of Labour’s pre-budget announcements and briefing. She writes: Sorry but the last time when big measures were not briefed, it was such a shock to markets that it caused a run on sterling and the Bank of England had to save pension funds from collapse. Pitch-rolling is not always a bad thing. Imagine - just imagine - if Reeves had only announced her borrowing changes on the day to parliament. Not serious. In parliament the foreign secretary has made a statement about the Middle East. David Lammy said the government unequivocaly condemns Iranian attacks on Israel. He said he had spoken to the foreign ministers of both Iran and Israel and urged restraint from both. On northern Gaza, he said nine in ten Gazans had been displaced in the course of the year, and said “there is no excuse for Israel’s government’s current restrictions on humanitarian aid”. “They must let aid in now,” he said. He added that current restrictions “fly in the face” of Israel’s commitments, and said they are a rebuke to friends of Israel who have supported its right to defend itself, while also funding humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people. He said it was “a matter of profound regret” that Israel’s parliament has debated closing down access to Gaza for Unrwa. On Lebanon, Lammy said the government had led efforts to respond, with a swift call for a ceasefire. He said the prime minister was meeting with Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister. Lammy said ceasefires, international law and diplomacy were the way to deescalate the situation in the region. “It is a source of deep frustration”, Lammy said, that progess had not been made. He said the government would continue its efforts in the region “So that one day they might all live side-by-side in peace and security.” A dissenting voice to the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, hauling the government and in particular the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, over the coals on budget details being published in the media in advance is Hugo Gye, political editor at the i, who argues the counterpoint, that “if the government genuinely refused to say anything about the budget before its delivery you would find a) even more damaging speculation doing the rounds b) a potentially quite violent market reaction on the day”. Readers with keen memories may remember the incident in 2013 when it appears that the Evening Standard in London had been briefed the whole of George Osborne’s budget, as evidenced by one journalist tweeting out the paper’s front page containing details before Osborne had spoken. Not that many of us however, I suspect, remember directly the time in 1947 that Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after a different evening paper, the Star, published his budget before he spoke. In parliament Iain Duncan Smith has raised an urgent question about the UK’s relations with China, and recent contact between the foreign secretary and Chinese officials. Foreign secretary David Lammy robustly defended his position and the topics he had raised with the Chinese, and said he would take no lessons from the Conservative party, whose attitude to relations with China changed course several times, he says. Emily Thornberry has invited Lammy to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee which she now chairs. Lammy says he would be happy to appear before the committee whenever “she commands”. Alicia Kearns, Conservative MP and shadow minister for foreign affairs, accused Lammy of giving an account of meetings that differed greatly from that given by the Chinese. “That was really quite bad,” Lammy replies to her question. Sir Lindsay Hoyle has said it is “evident” to him that last week chancellor Rachel Reeves made significant policy announcements about fiscal rule changes in the media, rather than in parliament. He said he is glad there is a statement being made in the house later which he implies is “no coincidence” after he has expressed his anger. “It is not acceptable, I don’t want it to continue”, he said of budget details being paraded in the media before Wednesday. He said that often members are worried about getting a seat in the chamber for the budget speech, but “the way things are going” this won’t be a problem, as everything will have already been published. He also said that the party now in government used to complain about the previous administration doing this, and are now doing the same themselves. “Get your acts together on all sides,” he said. My colleague Polly Toynbee has published her latest column, in which she argues that Rachel Reeves’s budget “needs to sing ‘Here comes the sun’ after too many grey months of grim prognosis.” Kemi Badenoch has just been given a warning by the speaker in the House of Commons after raising questions about Jas Athwal, MP for Ilford South since July 2024. After she referred to stories in the media about Athwal’s alleged activities as a landlord, Lindsay Hoyle asked Badenoch whether she had notified the MP in advance that she intended to mention him. She said she would need to check with her office whether that had happened. He admonished her, and told her to change the subject of her questions. Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch are making their final pitches to Conservative party members in the leadership election this week. Jenrick has posted today to say that it was time to “end the drama, end the excuses and just deliver.” He also rather unexpectedly made a pitch for the nightclubbing vote, by posting a picture of himself in a night club in Ilford, calling for a revitalisation of the late night economy. For her part, Badenoch appeared on BBC Radio 2 today. She denied that the position she was vying for was “a caretaker leader job”. She told listeners it was possible for the Conservatives to get back into power after one term of Labour in government, but that this leadership election was “existential” for the Tories. Badenoch said: What I tell everyone is that we have one chance to get this right. This is existential. I actually feel that if we’re not careful, this could be the end of the Conservative Party. There is a Reform Party on the right that says it’s the real conservative party. We need to be more confident, more authentic in our values. But we also need to ensure that we understand what we got wrong and explain to the public, apologise and create a better offer. So there’s everything to play for. It can be done in one term, but it’s certainly something that will be the toughest thing we’ve ever had to do. Angela Rayner has robustly defended the government’s plan for mandatory housing targets in the Commons today. Asked by David Simmonds, Conservative shadow minister for housing, how confident the government was of meeting its targets given, he said, “the uncertainty created by the government’s new top down targets, which will delay the implementation of local plans and therefore planning decisions”, Rayner said: Britain is facing the sharpest housing crisis ever because of the failure of those benches opposite. We will make sure through our mandatory housing targets and announcements that have been made, and will be made at the budget, to ensure that we get the houses that Britain needs. The co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, Carla Denyer, has described the change in the bus fare cap in England from £2 to £3 as “the wrong approach”. She posted to social media to say: The Labour government has confirmed a 50% rise in bus fares - a blow for everyone who relies on buses in the cost of living crisis. This is the wrong approach – government should be supporting our economy and environment by making it easier to get around without a car. Blackburn’s independent MP, Adnan Hussain, has also criticised Labour’s plans for the bus fare cap in England. He posted to social media to say: Disappointing Labour plans to increase bus fares by 50%, especially for towns like Blackburn, in the north-west, where many rely on bus services to get to and from work. Pensioners’ heating allowance, two-child cap, and now bus fares. So much for helping the most vulnerable. Hussain won the seat in July from Labour’s Kate Hollern. The government has published a written ministerial statement from deputy prime minister Angela Rayner on social and affordable housing. In it she says Wednesday’s budget will “set out how the government will deliver more affordable housing and ensure social housing is available for those who need it most.” Rayner says: This will include an immediate one year cash injection of £500m to top up the existing Affordable Homes Programme which will deliver up to 5,000 new social and affordable homes, bringing total investment in housing supply in 2025/2026 to over £5bn. The government will also consult on a new 5-year social housing rent settlement, which caps the rents social housing providers can charge their tenants, to provide the sector with the certainty it needs to invest in new social housing. The intention would be for this to increase with CPI inflation figures and an additional 1%. You can read the statement in full here. The House of Commons is about to start sitting for the week, and after the traditional prayers there will be housing questions. Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron MP has described the announcement raising the bus fare cap from £2 to £3 in England and extended the scheme for a further 12 months as “without a doubt a bus tax.” In a statement, Farron said While this new government has been left to make difficult choices, they cannot allow the burden of fixing the Conservatives’ mess to be on people and small businesses across the country. The fundamental issue is that neither Labour nor the Conservatives before them seemed to understand is that for rural communities, it doesn’t matter if the cap is £2 or £3 if they don’t have a bus service in the first place. If the government is serious about growth then it would invest in services which will boost our struggling town centres and high streets. Jeremy Corbyn has also added his voice to criticism of the announcement, saying: Scrapping the £2 bus fare cap is a disgraceful decision that will harm the poorest in society, and discourage public transport at a time when it is needed more than ever. Why is the government punishing people for trying to get to work? Speaking earlier today, prime minister Keir Starmer said that the flat £2 fare cap in England had only been funded by the previous Conservative administration to the end of this year, when it was due to end, and that his government were extending the policy, but at the higher rate. When the policy was announced, the then Conservative government claimed it would save almost a third of the ticket price for the average journey, and cut emissions and congestion by taking an estimated 2m cars off the roads. Earlier Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick described the Labour announcement as “clueless”, and shadow transport secretary Helen Whately said “That’s £10 a week extra to get to work under Labour. Clearly bus users don’t count as ‘working people’ either.” Russell Findlay, the new Scottish Conservative leader, has proposed cutting free prescriptions, merging local authorities and abolishing quangos to deliver cuts in Scottish income tax rates. In his first major policy speech since winning the leadership last month, Findlay said “nothing is off the table” in a bid to cut income tax rates, which are devolved in Scotland but higher than in the rest of the UK. He would start by abolishing the 21p tax rate. He told Tory activists and MSPs in Edinburgh: Tens of millions of pounds are waiting to be saved if only politicians in Edinburgh were more concerned about ensuring best value for taxpayers. This should be our mission over the years ahead: rebuild the broken bond of trust between politicians and the public by only promising what’s deliverable. Rebuild trust by being ruthlessly efficient custodians of taxpayers’ money. He said he would reduce Scotland’s 131 quangos and agencies, which the Tories claim cost £19bn a year. He pledged to merge the largest environmental agencies, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and NatureScot, and to scrap the Scottish Land Commission, which oversees land reform policy. He also proposed scrapping baby boxes, which include free gifts of clothing, books and thermometers given to all new mothers. “Nothing really is off the table. Everything is up for discussion. Baby boxes might seem in the grand scheme of things like not a lot of money, but £50m could do a lot of good in our public services, and I think we should look at that.” After appearing to suggest abolishing free tuition was under consideration, he later appeared to backtrack. He said the key issue was closing down university courses of little material value – a theme echoed by candidates in the contest to be the next UK Conservative leader. Findlay refused to be specific on how many of Scotland’s 32 local councils or its NHS boards could be scrapped or merged; the Scottish Labour party has proposed merging Scotland’s 14 territorial NHS boards into three. “I think we need to rationalise where we can and look at everything with a fresh eye. [At] this stage, I’m going to consult with colleagues and bring forward our proper proposals,” he told one reporter. Findlay was elected Scottish Tory leader after his predecessor Douglas Ross resigned following a crisis over his treatment of a fellow Tory election candidate, David Duguid, his expenses claims, and an apparent breach of his promise not to stand again for Westminster. Political correspondent Kiran Stacey has this report on today’s announcements by Keir Starmer: The bus fare cap in England will rise from £2 to £3 at the end of this year, Keir Starmer has said, as Rachel Reeves prepares to raid transport funding in this week’s budget. The prime minister told an audience in Birmingham that the money to fund the £2 cap would run out at the end of 2024 and that the Labour government would then not be able to keep it at the same level after that. The decision by the prime minister and chancellor comes despite heavy lobbying by Labour’s elected mayors to keep the cap in place, as revealed last week by the Guardian. Starmer insisted on Monday that working people would welcome such decisions as a necessary part of fixing the public finances after 14 years of Conservative government. “The Tories only funded [the £2 fare cap] until the end of 2024, and therefore that is the end of the funding in relation to the £2 bus fare,” Starmer said. “I do know that this matters, particularly in rural buses, and that’s why I’m able to say to you this morning that in the budget, we will announce there’ll be a £3 cap on bus fares until the end of 2025, because I know how important it is. So that’ll be there in the budget on Wednesday.” The prime minister was giving a pre-budget speech in Birmingham to set expectations ahead of what ministers warn will be a painful budget for many people, including planned rises to national insurance, capital gains tax and inheritance tax. Read more here: England’s bus fare cap will rise from £2 to £3 in 2025, says Starmer Another part of the dripping out of budget announcements ahead of Wednesday has been the prime minister this morning stating that local services to “get Britain working” will get a £240m funding boost. It is part of the Labour party’s stated national mission to pull the employment rate up to 80%. In quotes issued from the Chancellor about the funding, Rachel Reeves said “Due to years of economic neglect, the benefits bill is ballooning.” Work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall is quoted as saying that “Through our Get Britain Working plan, we will ensure every young person is supported to find earnings or learning, while our new jobs and careers service will transform opportunity for all.” Economic inactivity has risen by nearly one million people since before the pandemic in 2020, with PA Media reporting that 85% of this is due to those who are long-term sick. If you didn’t see it, at the weekend our economics correspondent Richard Partington had a reported out piece looking at this issue in Barnsley, where for the first time since the deindustrialisation years, there are more vacancies than people looking for work. I imagine the number of people who could put together a specific list of top five most impactful UK budgets from the last five decades is quite small, but our economics editor Larry Elliott is among them. Readers of a certain age – including me – are sure to get a certain frisson from seeing pictures of Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson, Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke among others. Kwasi Kwarteng also, inevitably, puts in an appearance. The adult prison population in England and Wales has dropped 3% after reaching record levels. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures show there were 85,867 people in prison on Monday, which was 1,598 fewer than recorded at the beginning of last week. PA Media reports the drop means there is capacity for 3,141 more people in the system, and that the figure for inmates is the lowest since 30 June in 2023. Earlier, speaking in Birmingham, prime minister Keir Starmer criticised the record of the previous government, saying “Just look at the state of our prisons. Where’s the Tory apology for that? Watching the prison population rise while they were too weak either to reform sentencing or build new prison places.” A little bit more context around the bus fares cap in England. It was introduced by the last Conservative government at the beginning of 2023 as a three month scheme, budgeted at £60m. It initially capped single bus fares at more than 130 bus operators serving more than 4,600 routes, saving almost a third of the average single ticket price. Some smaller operators declined to participate. In September 2023 government analysis claimed that the overall price of bus fares in England, outside London, had dropped by 7.4% between June 2022 and June 2023, largely as an effect of the scheme. Bus fares in London are capped at £1.75. Robert Jenrick, the Conservative leadership hopeful, has described the Labour government’s decision to extend the bus fare cap in England for another year, but raise the maximum price to £3 as “clueless”, adding “Starmer must think people who get the bus aren’t working people.” Shadow transport secretary Helen Whately, the Conservative MP for Faversham and Mid Kent, has criticised Keir Starmer’s announcement that the bus fare cap in England was set to be extended for another year, but raised from £2 to £3. In a post to social media, Whately said: That’s £10 a week extra to get to work under Labour. Clearly bus users don’t count as “working people” either. In December 2022 the then-Conservative government announced that the £2 bus fare cap in England “will run until 31 December 2024.” In his speech in Birmingham announcing the extension and price rise, the prime minister said “I do know how much this matters, particularly in rural communities where there’s heavy reliance on buses.” Keir Starmer has posted to social media to say that “This budget will help to get Britain working. It will pave the way for reforms that tackle the root causes of economic inactivity, so those who can work, will work.” Earlier, speaking in Birmingham, the prime minister had said the UK is “the only G7 country for whom economic inactivity is still higher than it was before Covid”. He continued: That’s not just bad for our economy. It’s also bad for all those who are locked out of opportunity. So the Chancellor will announce £240m in funding to provide local services that can help people back into work. The Green party of England and Wales’s co-leader Carla Denyer has responded to Keir Starmer’s speech in Birmingham by reposting some comments she made yesterday calling for more taxation on the super-rich, saying: 14 years of Tory underinvestment have left public services on their knees, our economy broken. We can’t afford five more yers of this. It feels like Labour are stuck in second gear on the motorway. They could deliver on the change they promised if they’re prepared to tax the super-rich. Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice has also been on the airwaves today talking about Wednesday’s budget. He described Labour’s plans as a “targeted assault on wealth creation,” saying “We’re all gonna get absolutely hammered and assaulted on Wednesday.” Keir Starmer has promised “better days ahead” and said the era of Tory neglect and “making working people pay the price” for their policies was over. In a speech in Birmingham designed to trail Rachel Reeves’ budget on Wednesday, the first from the new administration, Starmer: announced that the bus fares cap in England would be extended for a year, but at a higher rate of £3 said the Chancellor will announce £240m in funding for services to get people back into work said the country needed to face up to the “fiction” that you can lower taxes and increase public spending at the same time said he could not give a “cast iron guarantee that never again in any budget will there be any adjustment to tax” because “we just don’t know what’s around the corner” said his concern was making sure “there is no more tax in their payslip” for working people sidestepped a question about whether a fuel duty rise would count as a tax on working people who use their cars to get to and from work Starmer warned that working people around the world had lost faith that politics could deliver for them, but said that did not mean politicians should give up on them, warning that “populism preys on the fears that people have.” He also accused Rishi Sunak and the previous Conservative government of calling an early election to avoid facing the fiscal situation that his Labour party have inherited. Warning “there are no shortcuts”, Starmer said: The time is long overdue for politicians in this country to level with you honestly about the trade-offs this country faces Working people know that hard choices are necessary. They lived through the Liz Truss episode. They lived through the cost-of-living crisis. So they know that the things they want from us – protecting their living standards, building our nation, fixing our public services – they know that this can only be achieved alongside economic stability. Keir Starmer somewhat sidestepped a question on whether a rise in fuel duty would count as a rise in taxes on working people, and whether the government planned such a rise. During a question and answer session with the media in Birmingham, Jack Ellison from the Sun had asked “Every day millions of people across the country will get in their cars and go to work. So would any hike to fuel duty on Wednesday be a direct hit on the working people that you claim the champion?” In response the prime minister said: Well, I know this is a particular concern to your readers, and I’m not going to preempt what happens on Wednesday, but obviously this is an issue that comes up at every budget, and you’ll see how we deal with it at this budget. But I do understand how important it is. I understand what you’re putting to me, and I know how important it is to you, your readers and others. Keir Starmer has drawn a round of applause from the audience in Birmingham after a rather brusque response to a question from a journalist from the Daily Mail. Asked whether Starmer thought his government was at odds with the priorities of the public after Kumail Jaffer cited “new polling this morning suggests that the majority of voters would prefer Wednesday’s priority to be lower taxes ahead of investment in public services,” Starmer initially simply said “No.” He then elaborated: I think for too long we pretended that you could lower your tax and spend more on your public services. It is about time we faced up to that fiction. A couple of questions during this session from Sky News and the Times have attempted to get the prime minister to commit to no further tax rises during the course of the five year parliament. Keir Starmer has refused to allow himself to become a hostage to fortune here, saying: We are fixing the foundations in this budget. So that is the purpose of this budget, to take the difficult decisions. Now nobody wants tax rises, least of all me, so we will do the hard work in this budget to allow us then to rebuild the country. I can’t give you a cast iron guarantee that never again in any budget will there be any adjustment to tax, because we just don’t know what’s around the corner. We’ve lived through, in the last five or six years, Ukraine, Covid, et cetera. But I can tell you that as we stand here now going into this budget, it’s our intention to take the tough decisions here and now up front, in the hope that we can then build and rebuild the country on that stable foundation. Keir Starmer has announced that Labour will raise the £2 bus fare cap in England to £3 next week. Asked about rumours around changes to the cap in Wednesday’s budget, the prime minister said: On the £2 bus fare, the first thing to say is the Tories had only funded that til the end of 2024 and therefore that is the end of the funding in relation to the £2 capped fair. I do know how much this matters, particularly in rural communities where there’s heavy reliance on busses, and that’s why I’m able to say to you this morning that in the budget, we will announce there will be a £3 cap on bus fares to the end of 2025, because I know how important it is. So that will be there in the budget on Wednesday. Sam Coates from Sky News asked the prime minister if he was “absolutely sure” that the government were “front-loading” tax rises, and could he rule out further tax rises in future budgets. Keir Starmer said “I fundamentally believe that we need to run towards the tough decisions. I fundamentally believe we have to fix the foundations so we can build a better future, and that’s tough. That’s difficult.” The first two questions have been from the BBC and ITV and have focussed on the semantics of whether Keir Starmer’s Labour manifesto was “honest” about taxes on working people. The prime minister said in reply to one of the questions: Let me be clear. As far as working people, I’m concerned with what’s in their payslip, and making sure that there is no more tax in their payslip. And that matters to people, because we made that promise to them. But honesty is really important, because we’re facing really difficult decisions, and I’m not prepared to continue with the fiction that we’ve had previously over the last 14 years. Where there are problems, we’ll identify them and we will fix them. As a reminder, this is the paragraph from the Labour manifesto which has sparked these accusations: The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT. Keir Starmer has said that this week’s Labour budget will “light the way” ahead for the new government. He said “We have five years and a big mandate so working people will not accept any excuses,” adding that the government “will publish clear ambitions for this parliament” that they can be measured about. He continued: These are my priorities for change, and I won’t change course. The budget will light the way, and we will use the power of government for stability, investment and reform with partnerships across the whole of society, galvanised by clear objectives, to deliver on the priorities of the British people. Foundations fixed, public services renewed, a country rebuilt. Starmer is now taking questions from the media. Keir Starmer says that working people across the world have lost faith that politics can deliver for them. Describing it as a paradox, the prime minister said: All around the world, traditional values, democratic values, values that have underpinned the way countries like ours have operated for years, the pragmatism that is part of our identity, is under attack. Why? Because people – working people most of all – have lost faith it can still deliver for their family, And yet, at the same time, what people want from politics hasn’t changed. People want a stable economy. They want their country to be safe, their borders secure, economic security, national security, border security. Beyond that, they want exactly what those [Labour] national missions promise, a growing economy, safer streets, clean British energy in their home, opportunities for their children and an NHS that is there when they need it. I know populism preys on the fears that people have that these things no longer belong to them. But I’ve never felt that the right response is to ignore those concerns, rather than showing that they can still be delivered. In Birmingham Keir Starmer has delivered his previously trialled line, that his government will ignore the “populist chorus of easy answers” in this week’s budget. The prime minister said: Politics is a choice, and it’s time to choose a clear path. It’s time to embrace the harsh light of fiscal reality so we can come together behind a credible long term plan. It’s time we ran towards the tough decisions, because ignoring them set us on this path of decline. It’s time we ignored the populist chorus of easy answers, because we saw what happened if you reject the constraints of the economic stability, and we’re never going back to that. That is our choice. Stability to prevent chaos. Borrowing that will drive long term growth. Tax rises to prevent austerity and rebuild public services. We choose to protect working people. We choose to get the NHS back on its feet. We choose to fix the foundations, reject decline and rebuild our country with investment. Starmer then issued a challenge to the opposition, citing the disastrous short-lived premiership of Liz Truss, saying: I can’t get into the individual measures before Wednesday but I will say this. If people want to criticise the path we choose, that’s their prerogative, but let them spell out a different direction. If they think the state has grown too big, let them tell working people which public services they would cut. If they think tax rises are unfair, let them tell working people which taxes they would raise instead. If they don’t see our long term investment in infrastructure as necessary, let them explain to working people how they would grow the economy for them. And if they think the taxes are too high, but they don’t want to cut public spending, let them tell working people why the lessons of Liz Truss no longer apply. Because I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, the time is long overdue for politicians in this country to level with you honestly about the trade offs this country faces. To stop insulting your intelligence with the chicanery of easy answers. Keir Starmer has accused Rishi Sunak and the previous Conservative government of calling an early election to avoid facing the fiscal situation that his Labour party have inherited. Speaking in Birmingham, the prime minister said: Just look at the state of our prisons. Where’s the Tory apology for that? Watching the prison population rise while they were too weak either to reform sentencing or build new prison places. Too scared to conduct a proper spending review, as we’ve done, because of the damage they knew it would uncover. They knew. That’s why they ran away from that exercise and called an early election instead. They knew our public services were broken. They knew there was a black hole in the public finances. £22bn of unfunded spending this year. Wasting reserves three times over on Rwanda, asylum hotels, propping up a failing train companies, and that’s before we even get the long term challenges ignored for 14 years. Keir Starmer has said the era of the Conservatives “destroying economic foundations” and making “working people pay the price” is over. Speaking in Birmingham two days ahead of the first budget from the new government, Starmer said: It will be a budget which will show to the British people that we won’t be distracted from our task. That we will stick to our long term plan. Run towards the tough decisions, rip off the short term sticky plasters. So we can lead our country, finally, but decisively out of this, pay more, get less, doomed, low growth Tory trap that for 14 years, decimated public services, destroyed our economic foundations and made working people pay the price. And mark my words, that era is now over. We are turning the page on Tory decline, closing the book on their austerity and chaos. Those days are done. They are behind us, and change is here. Speaking in Brimingham, the prime minister has said he will defend Labour’s “tough decisions” on the economy being made in the budget this week. He likened the public finances and the state of public services to a homeowner finding damp in their house. Keir Starmer said: Everyone who finds damp in their house knows they have to make the decision, paint over it or strip it out, pull off the plaster and deal with it once and for all. So I will defend our tough decisions all day long. It’s the right thing for our country, and it’s the only way to get the investment that we need. That is how we will fix the NHS, rebuild Britain and protect the payslips of working people delivering on our mandate of change. In a section of his speech that seems very much informed by the lengthy media debate over the weekend on the semantics of what constitutes a “working person”, prime minister Keir Starmer has said: Every decision that we have made, every decision that we will make in the future, will be made with working people in our mind’s eye. People who’ve been working harder and harder for years just to stand still. People doing the right thing, maybe still finding a little bit of money to put away. Paying their way, even in the cost of living crisis. But who feel that this country no longer gives them or their children a fair chance. He continued about the identity of “working people”, saying: I know some people want to have a debate about this, and I know there will always be an exception that proves the rule. Welcome to the wonders of a diverse country. But I also know that the working people of this country know exactly who they are. That they are the golden thread that runs through our agenda. Every single one of our national missions is about delivering for them, and we’re getting on with the job. Kier Starmer has started his speech by reminding people that Birmingham, where he is speaking, had an announcement of a £500m investment in battery storage, and said “that’s a snapshot of the Britain we’re building.” Keir Starmer is speaking in the West Midlands. We will bring you the key lines that emerge. You can watch it here … Richard Parker, mayor of the West Midlands, is opening the event where Keir Starmer is due to speak. The prime minister has begun the publicity push for his speech this morning on social media, with Keir Starmer issuing a post saying: This is a landmark week for Britain. For the first time in 15 years, our budget will put working people first. The truth is, the Tories left you to pay the price for their chaos. We will clear up their mess. Step up in tough times, not stand back. We will deliver change. Starmer is expected to speak and take questions from the media in the West Midlands this morning. Labour’s leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, is expected to be making a visit in Glasgow today ahead of Wednesday’s Westminster budget, which he says “will end the era of austerity and prioritise investment and growth.” In a piece for the Daily Record published today, Sarwar writes: This week will see the first budget of a new UK Labour government. After 14 years of Tory chaos, division and decline, it will continue the job of turning the page on those lost Tory years, fixing the foundations and rebuilding our country. This week you will hear many, the Tories and the SNP, who will want to pretend that all of the UK’s problems started three months ago or that somehow all of the UK’s problems can be fixed with one budget. They will be insulting the intelligence of the Scottish people by attempting to absolve the Tories of their woeful record. He did sound a slight note of warning to his Labour colleagues based in London, though, adding: I recognise that the Chancellor will have to raise revenues, but any tax rises must fall on those with the broadest shoulders, and not hit working people who have already borne the brunt of the Tories crashing the economy and SNP income tax hikes. We need a Budget that prioritises investment and growth. We need to see a significant increase in capital investment. This is the change that Scotland needs — and I will be doing everything I can to make sure a Labour government delivers it. Esther Webber at Politico has an interesting piece this morning looking at some of the complaints by newly elected MPs about how, one said, “tradition is standing in the way of MPs being able to either see their kids in the evening or do our job effectively.” Among the complaints are the tradition of MPs having to bob up and down to attract the attention of the speaker in order to be called, late sitting hours, and the failure to implement electronic voting. Green MP Ellie Chowns has complained the so-called bobbing “is not an efficient or accessible way to form an orderly queue to speak.” Webber writes: MPs are proposing the Commons should have a “call list” of the kind already employed by the House of Lords, where a list is published each day setting out who is going to speak and in what order. Some would also like to see a reformed timetable, with earlier sitting hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and a return to digital voting, which was trialed during the Covid pandemic but later dropped. You can read more here on the Politico website: Britain’s new MPs rage at parliament’s old traditions Imposing VAT on international schools in the UK could lead to hundreds of pupils leaving, European diplomats have said. They called for the institutions to retain the exemption from the 20% duty that private schools are expected to lose. The German and French ambassadors to the UK, Miguel Berger and Hélène Duchêne, said international schools were distinct from British private schools because the option of transferring to the British state sector was not always realistic for their pupils. Read more from Kevin Rawlinson here: VAT on international schools ‘could prompt hundreds of pupils to leave UK’ We are expecting Keir Starmer to give a pre-budget speech at about 11.15am this morning. It will, naturally, be quite light on detail ahead of the budget itself – tradition dictates that major measures can be trailed and hinted at but not announced before the day – but the prime minister is expected to set out the direction of travel for his government this way, with overnight briefing suggesting he will say: It is working people who pay the price when their government fails to deliver economic stability. They’ve had enough of slow growth, stagnant living standards and crumbling public services. They know that austerity is no solution. And they’ve seen the chaos when politicians let borrowing get out of control. We choose a different path: honest, responsible, long-term decisions in the interests of working people. It’s stability that means we can invest, and reform that will maximise that investment. Stability, investment, reform. That’s how we fix the NHS, rebuild Britain and protect working people’s payslips. Delivering on the mandate of change. If people want to criticise the path we choose, that’s their prerogative. But let them then spell out a different direction. If they think the state has grown too big, let them tell working people which public services they would cut. If they don’t see our long-term investment in infrastructure as necessary, let them explain to working people how they would grow the economy for them. This is an economic plan that will change the long-term trajectory on British growth for the better. Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has issued a strong rebuke to shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s criticism of the Office for Budget Responsibility plans to publish a report about the country’s fiscal situation, saying the Tories “don’t want to hear the truth” about the financial situation they left for the new government. Speaking on GB News, McFadden said: You have the sight today of the shadow chancellor desperately attacking the Office for Budget Responsibility for producing a report on the inheritance. They don’t want to hear the truth. They don’t want people to know about it. We inherited a whole load of things that were announced for which no funding had been allocated. It was enormously irresponsible. He said that when voters hear the budget announcement on Wednesday, they should be “annoyed at a mess that we inherited.” He told viewers: If people are annoyed about things that they’ll hear about in the Budget, what I would say is be annoyed at the Tory legacy. Some of these decisions are difficult, but we have to fix up the situation that we inherited. There will be extra funds for public services, and there’ll be a different investment story for the future. Hunt, who was appointed as chancellor by Liz Truss in October 2022 after her disastrous mini-budget led to the sacking of Kwasi Kwarteng, has complained that the decision of the OBR to publish a report on the same day as the budget was “a surprise and a significant concern”. [See 9.50am GMT] McFadden was also inevitably again asked about the definition of a “working person” by the media, and said: We’ve had a lot of discussion in recent days about definitions, about job descriptions, or people’s earning levels and so on. I don’t really think that’s the way to look at it. The way to look at it is to look at what we said in our manifesto about income tax, national insurance and VAT. And the question is, will we keep to those promises when the Budget happens on Wednesday? We will. McFadden added “It wasn’t somebody is included if they earn a particular amount or they do a particular job, I don’t think that’s a helpful way to think about it. We will stick to our manifesto promises.” Shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt has returned to his theme this morning that Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) plans to publish a review of the Treasury on the same days as the budget are, he says, undermining the OBR’s position of political impartiality. In a message on social media, the former chancellor said: I’m a strong supporter of the OBR. I was proud to serve in the government which set it up and strongly believe it enhances the UK’s economic credibility. However its credibility in holding the government to account depends on political impartiality so if that is being undermined friends need to say so. It cannot be right to publish a review of what happened under the previous government without consulting those who had political responsibility at the time. As my colleague Graeme Wearden reported late on Sunday, Britain’s fiscal watchdog is to publish a detailed breakdown of the £22bn “black hole” that Labour says it inherited after Rachel Reeves presents the budget on Wednesday, which Hunt has described as “a surprise and a significant concern.” Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said that the new Labour government had “levelled with people” ahead of the budget, and that it would be “the most honest … we’ve had for some years.” Speaking on Times Radio, PA Media quotes McFadden saying: There’s no point in telling people everything’s absolutely fine when the prison system is in a state of collapse, when NHS waiting lists are at a record high, when we’ve got crumbling schools. There’s so much that’s wrong that we’ve got to fix and it’s important to set that out honestly and candidly for the public. I think we’ll have the most honest Budget on Wednesday that we’ve had for some years. An important thing is when people see their payslip after the Budget, those key things to look for: the level of tax – income tax and national insurance – in their payslip in their wages, that won’t change after Wednesday. Jeremy Corbyn and the independent alliance of MPs have issued a letter ahead of the budget with five things they are asking Chancellor Rachel Reeves to implement. Saying “We have the means to end poverty, we just need the political will”, Corbyn listed five priorities: Scrap the two-child benefits cap Reverse cuts to winter fuel Tax wealth Protect welfare Invest in a greener future In a letter accompanying the requests, the independent group of MPs write: It is a national scandal that 4.2 million children and 2.1 million pensioners are living in poverty in the sixth richest country in the world. You have previously told the British public to prepare for “difficult decisions” to repair this nation’s finances. At the very same time, you have committed to raising defence expenditure to 2.5% of GDP. Imagine if we spent that money on renewable energy, social housing, schools and the NHS instead. The Labour party this morning is touting a piece in the Sun in which the government is announcing it will pledge £500m to fixing what it terms “the pothole crisis” in Wednesday’s budget. Josh Halliday is the North of England editor at the Guardian A Labour MP has warned that the government risks embarking on “austerity 2.0” in a stark warning ahead of the budget on Wednesday. Kim Johnson, the MP for Liverpool Riverside, urged the chancellor Rachel Reeves to reverse expected cuts to benefits and the winter fuel allowance, citing fears that “people will die this year unless this cut is reversed”. In a letter to Reeves published on Monday, Johnson writes: “The anticipated £3 billion in sickness benefit cuts risk driving some of the most vulnerable in our society into poverty and could be perceived as austerity 2.0.” Liverpool Riverside is ranked as the most deprived parliamentary constituency in the UK, where 43% of children are classed as living in poverty – more than double the national average. Johnson, a backbench MP who has not shied away from criticising the Labour leadership, writes that her constituency has suffered “systematic impoverishment, skyrocketing inequalities and plummeting living standards under successive Tory governments, while the right and powerful continue to benefit”. She adds: “On 30 October, these communities who voted for change will be looking to Labour to deliver for them. We must not let them down.” During his media round this morning Pat McFadden rather hit the nail on the head about the futility of interviews around the time of the budget, when ministers are forbidden from giving any details in advance. He told viewers of BBC Breakfast: I can’t speculate on the individual measures. We’re in this period where you interview people a day or two before a budget, and we really can’t comment on what might be in it. It seems like that the question and answer session after Keir Starmer’s speech this morning will mostly consist of him saying “Well, I can’t give you any details, wait until Wednesday” to an increasingly frustrated broadcast journalist pool. We will, of course, bring you any key lines that do emerge when the prime minister speaks. Conservative shadow health secretary Victoria Atkins has accused the Keir Starmer government of imposing “1970s socialism” with its budget plans. Speaking on GB News, Atkins, who retained her Louth and Horncastle seat in July’s election, said: This is socialism that we’ve seen in the 1970s. This Labour government came into power promising they weren’t going to raise taxes. They have this peculiar definition of working people. They don’t seem to understand what a working person is, even though they’ve set this test for themselves. If you have assets, if you work, if you’re a pensioner looking this winter as to how you’re going to make up that shortfall, given that they’ve slashed winter fuel payments, this is going to affect all of us. This idea that they’re compartmentalising and separating us into different categories of people that they find acceptable, I think is the very worst of socialism. It seems unlikely that many on the left of the Labour party would claim that Rachel Reeves is about to launch a set of socialist economic policies in the budget this week. In its election manifesto, Labour ruled out tax rises on income tax, employee national insurance contributions, and VAT. On the BBC Breakfast programme cabinet minister Pat McFadden was asked more about Labour’s definition of “working people”, a phrase which has dominated media coverage in recent days. He said: I don’t define this by picking a job, or an income level, and relate it to the promises you just mentioned in the manifesto. We were talking about the taxes that people pay on their wages, and we said we will not increase those. Look, that was true in the campaign. It’s true today. It will be true after Wednesday. We will stick to those promises when the Chancellor updates the budget speech this week. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has described it as “frustrating” that both Labour and Conservatives ignored his warning before the election that there was a significant problem with the public finances. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: One heard the senior politicians from both sides continually saying that there wasn’t this problem, and taxes wouldn’t really have to go up, and growth would source it all. But everybody knew that there was a big problem with the public finances, and we’d either have to get tax increases or significant spending cuts. And lo and behold, we’re being told that that has now been discovered, and it looks like we’re going to get something like £40bn of tax increases, if the briefing is to be believed. And that would make this one of the biggest tax raising budgets ever. Cabinet minister Pat McFadden has said there are “real reasons” to have optimism as the country approaches the first Labour budget for 14 years later this week. He stated that the government had “inherited a plan to decline, to reduce, investment” from Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, and that the measures Labour were taking in the budget were “tough decisions” but the start of a turnaround. He told viewers of BBC Breakfast: I think people should look for three things in the budget. Will it stabilize the country’s public finances and do so in a way that keeps our promises? It will Will it also start to turn around the public services and the NHS in particular. We will start that road with a combination of both investment and reform. And critically, will it change the country’s story for the future by investing in the things that we need, the better schools, hospitals, the houses we need, the transport infrastructure, the energy infrastructure. This is what Britain has to do if it’s going to get better economic growth in the future. What we inherited was a plan to decline, to reduce investment in all of those things going forward. That’s not a role we were prepared to accept we need to invest in the future of the country if we’re going to have a better future. So there are tough decisions in this budget. There are also real reasons to look for hope and optimism, for better public services, a better NHS and a better investment and growth story for the UK in the future. McFadden has served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster since July’s general election. Keir Starmer will be making a pre-budget speech later today in which he is expected to lay out what he says is the dire state of the fiscal reality of the country, but promise that “better days are ahead”. In briefings given in advance of the speech, the prime minister is expected to say: This is not 1997, when the economy was decent but public services were on their knees. And it’s not 2010, where public services were strong, but the public finances were weak. These are unprecedented circumstances. And that’s before we even get to the long-term challenges ignored for 14 years: an economy riddled with weakness on productivity and investment, a state that needs urgent modernisation to face down the challenge of a volatile world. Starmer will say the Budget will embrace the “harsh light of fiscal reality”, and will have to “ignore the populist chorus of easy answers”. In the 2024 Labour manifesto the party said: The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income Tax, or VAT. Prime minister Keir Starmer will make a speech today in which he is widely expected to say that this week’s budget will embrace the “harsh light of fiscal reality” because “it’s not 2010”, but he will promise that “better days are ahead”.

          "headline": "VAT on UK international schools ‘could prompt hundreds of pupils to leave’",
          "bodyText": "Imposing VAT on international schools in the UK could lead to hundreds of pupils leaving, European diplomats have said, as they called for the institutions to retain the exemption from the 20% duty that private schools are expected to lose. The German and French ambassadors to the UK, Miguel Berger and Hélène Duchêne, said international schools were distinct from British private schools because the option of transferring to the British state sector was not always realistic for their pupils. “For expats coming here for two, three or four years wanting their children to go back to the national system, their only option is to go to these schools,” Berger said. He told the Times: “We would really like to see the British government recognise the importance of these schools – not only for our political and cultural relations but also for the people this will affect.” From January, the government plans to remove the VAT exemption and business rates relief for private schools to enable funding for 6,500 new teachers in state schools. Currently, independent schools do not have to charge 20% VAT on their fees because there is an exemption for the supply of education. Berger said executives of companies that invest in the UK “must know they can send their children to a German school”. He said Deutsche Schule London, based in Richmond in the south-west of the capital, had about 900 pupils and that “between 20% and 25% might be obliged to leave” if the change was introduced. He added: “The German state covers 30% of the costs of the school and 50% of the investment, so there is a lot of state funding that goes into the school.” Critics of the VAT change have expressed concerns about the short timescale involved and the risk of unintended consequences such as the potential impact on children with learning difficulties who attend specialist independent schools and on military families. Eleven schools in the UK are accredited by the French education ministry, nine of which are in London. Duchêne said these schools would be weakened by the VAT change. She said: “We are not asking for an exemption: we are not the target of this VAT measure. Our schools are different from the target ones since we follow special courses preparing for French exams. These parents don’t have a plan B because other schools don’t follow the French curriculum.” She said 6,300 pupils could be affected in the UK, adding that the change was “not in line with the reset to our relationship which the British government has instigated”. She said imposing VAT on the schools “could also be an issue for our companies, as they need these schools for employees coming to work here”."

          "headline": "Force food firms to disclose products’ health ratings, industry boss urges",
          "bodyText": "Food firms should be forced to reveal how healthy or unhealthy their products are, to help people consume a better diet, an industry boss has said. Ministers should compel companies to publish an annual report so consumers can see how much of their sales is made up of dishes that contain too much fat, salt and sugar, Stéfan Descheemaeker also said. Descheemaeker is the chief executive of Nomad Foods, which owns popular brands such as Birds Eye fish fingers, Findus frozen foods and Goodfella’s pizzas. He told the Guardian that mandatory publication of what proportion of each firm’s sales count as healthy or unhealthy under government guidelines would kickstart a “nutrition arms race” in which manufacturers would vie with each other to make their products better for health. He also urged Wes Streeting, the health secretary, to ensure that all tins and packets of foodstuffs carry traffic light-style labels. This would also help tackle the obesity crisis because it would encourage people to choose more nutritious foods and shun less healthy options, he said. And he threw his weight behind growing calls – backed by the House of Lords and the Labour-friendly Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank – for a new tax on products containing excessive amounts of salt or sugar. His comments underline what one diet campaigner called the “quiet revolution” going on in the industry in its views on how best to tackle the UK’s addiction to unhealthy food. More and more manufacturers want the government to now order the sector to improve its behaviour, rather than relying on voluntary agreements as the Conservatives did during their 14 years in power. “We support measures requiring companies to publish data. We believe that requiring all food companies to do this would drive a nutrition arms race, kickstarting an industry-wide reformulation drive, ultimately increasing the production, sale and consumption of tasty, healthy food,” Descheemaeker said in an interview. For the last seven years Nomad has published figures showing the percentage of its net sales that are deemed healthy under the government’s nutrient profiling model of judging which products contain the right or wrong amounts of fat, salt and sugar. It was now at 93.3% overall healthy, he said, according to the official high in fat, sugar or salt (HFSS) assessment system. Public disclosure of food firms’ sales would enable the creation of league tables that would allow those whose products are more often unhealthy to be named and shamed, backers say. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Iceland and the yoghurt maker Danone have already made clear they back mandatory reporting. The last government brought in a “food data transparency partnership” with industry aimed at putting details of companies’ sales into the public domain. Despite being conceived as being binding, it became a purely voluntary measure after industry protests. “We believe that mandatory front-of-pack nutrition labelling could play a vital role in helping the public understand what is healthy and what is not,” Descheemaeker said. “We’ve seen this work in other European markets, such as France, where ‘nutri-scores’ have been shown to influence healthier purchase decisions.” Some supermarkets and retailers in the UK use colour-coded labels on some or all of their products to alert consumers to how healthy or unhealthy they are, but the system is voluntary. Both measures would prompt food manufacturers to reformulate their products by cutting the amount of fat, salt and sugar in them, Descheemaeker said. Doing so is easier than some firms have claimed, he added. He cited how Nomad had overhauled the nutritional makeup of Goodfella’s pizzas since buying the brand in 2018, by stripping out fat, salt and calories and adding more fibre, so that it now complies with HFSS rules as a healthy product. Nomad has also cut the amount of sugar in its Aunt Bessie’s apple crumbles by 30% and added 15% more fibre so it too now counts as HFSS compliant. Since 2020 the company has also reduced the amount of salt in some of its products such as Birds Eye fish fingers (21%) and potato waffles (28%) for the same reason. He said the scale of Britain’s obesity crisis was so great, and bad diet’s role in causing major diseases such as obesity and cancer so great, that the food industry overall needed to display much more “responsibility” to improve public health. James Toop, the chief executive of chef Jamie Oliver’s diet campaign group Bite Back, said making data transparency obligatory would change a situation where most big food companies rely on sales of unhealthy products for their profits. “Our research this year showed that our biggest food manufacturers in the UK made most of their profits from selling unhealthy products. It’s encouraging to see a growing number of senior food industry leaders are now openly supporting bold government action to improve the nutritional quality of what they sell,” he said. “This quiet revolution happening in the UK food industry – with companies recognising their role in reducing the junk they package as food and committing to healthier products – is one we should all harness. Many of these leaders are now making it clear they want government policies that create a level playing field based on regulation, not just voluntary changes, so everyone is held to the same high standards. “It’s vital we see measures like mandatory reporting on healthier sales and front-of-pack traffic light labels to hold companies accountable for providing healthier food alternatives.” Last week the House of Lords food, diet and nutrition and obesity committee urged ministers to take a much more robust approach to the food industry to help address the obesity “public health emergency”. It called for routine reporting of sales data, a new salt and sugar tax model modelled on the sugar tax, and “a decisive shift away from voluntary measures to a system of mandatory regulation of the food industry”. Earlier this year Streeting warned food companies that a Labour government would use a “steamroller” to compel them to reformulate their products, but he has taken no action yet to pursue that since becoming the health secretary in July. He is understood to prefer reformulation to imposing a tax on salty and sugary products given the cost of living crisis. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are taking a range of actions to tackle the obesity crisis head on – shifting our focus from treatment to prevention – to ease the strain on an NHS in critical condition and help people to live well for longer. “We are taking proportionate action including, restricting junk food advertising on TV and online, empowering councils to block the development of new fast-food shops outside of schools, and banning the sale of energy drinks to under 16s. “Our 10-Year health plan will also reform the NHS by shifting its focus from sickness to prevention.”"

          "headline": "ICC prosecutor allegedly tried to suppress sexual misconduct claims against him",
          "bodyText": "The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court allegedly responded to a formal complaint of sexual misconduct by trying to persuade the alleged victim to deny the claims, the Guardian has been told. Multiple ICC staff with knowledge of the allegations against Karim Khan said the prosecutor and another official close to him repeatedly urged the woman to disavow claims about his behaviour towards her. The alleged attempts to deter the woman from formally pursuing the claims took place in phone calls and in person, and came after Khan learned court authorities had been made aware of allegations of misconduct, four sources said. At the time, the chief prosecutor had been advised to avoid one-on-one contact with the alleged victim after an aborted internal inquiry into the matter. Contacted by the Guardian for comment, Khan denied asking the woman to withdraw any allegations. His lawyers said: “Our client denies the whole of the allegations and we are most concerned the exposure of a confidential and closed internal matter is designed to undermine his high-profile ongoing work at a delicate time.” After reports of alleged sexual misconduct began to circulate in the media in recent days, Khan denied the claims in a public statement that said he and the court had been “subject to a wide range of attacks and threats”. In anonymous briefings, court officials close to the prosecutor have suggested he may have been the target of a smear campaign. “There is no truth to suggestions of such misconduct,” Khan’s statement said. “I have worked in diverse contexts for 30 years and there has never been such a complaint lodged against me by anyone.” The woman at the heart of the allegations – who ICC colleagues describe as a well-regarded lawyer in her 30s who worked directly for Khan – has declined requests for comment. But multiple sources familiar with the situation said she told colleagues she declined the alleged requests to disavow the claims. She believed the alleged approaches by Khan and another ICC official were part of an attempt to make her say that the claims against the prosecutor had been fabricated, the sources added. According to a document seen by the Guardian, the accusations against Khan, 54, include unwanted sexual touching and “abuse” over an extended period. They include an alleged incident in which he is said to have “pressed his tongue” into the woman’s ear. Khan denies such allegations of misconduct. Four ICC sources familiar with the allegations said they also include coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. The Guardian has interviewed 11 current and former ICC officials familiar with the case, as well as diplomatic sources and friends of the alleged victim. All declined to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the allegations, or because they wanted to protect the woman. Multiple sources said misreporting about the allegations and efforts to politicise the situation have been deeply distressing for the woman, who is said to have initially held back on pursuing a complaint against Khan over concerns about reprisals, and fears it could be exploited by Israel or opponents of the court. Sources who know the alleged victim said she has been left traumatised by the situation and is “experiencing severe emotional distress”. “She never wanted any of this,” one person close to her said. “But the complaint filed against her wishes, followed by Khan’s denials and attempts to suppress the allegations, have forced her into a very difficult position.” The public emergence of the allegations comes at an intensely sensitive moment for the ICC, a court of last resort that prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities. A panel of three ICC judges is weighing politically explosive requests by Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza. The ICC, which is headquartered in The Hague, now faces an unprecedented crisis amid growing internal strife over the handling of the allegations and apparent attempts by the court’s opponents to weaponise them. Critics of the court have seized upon the allegations, which Khan first learned about weeks before his announcement in May requesting arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, his defence minister and three Hamas leaders. Khan has stopped short of explicitly accusing Israel of being behind the allegations, but in his statement denying misconduct he noted that he and the court have been the target of “a wide range of recent attacks and threats” in recent months. The Guardian revealed earlier this year how Israel’s intelligence agencies ran a decade-long campaign against the ICC that included threats and attempts to smear senior staff. Against this backdrop, ICC officials close to Khan are strongly hinting the allegations may be part of a smear campaign by Israel. However, in a months-long investigation into the allegations against Khan, the Guardian has found no evidence that Israel, or any other country, had any involvement in the underlying allegations – although there does appear to have been a subsequent effort by anonymous actors to brief journalists and post leaks online. Online leaks Last week, as leaks about Khan’s alleged conduct began to appear, press reports and social media posts minimised and misconstrued the allegations, according to sources familiar with the alleged victim’s accounts. References to allegations contained within a report by a so-called “whistleblower”, they said, included inaccuracies. Several media organisations received, and then published, the same incomplete information. The Guardian can reveal a more detailed picture of the allegations and of the complex sequence of events that ultimately led to aspects of the claims leaking online and into the pages of rightwing media outlets. According to three sources familiar with the situation, the allegations of sexual misconduct relate to Khan’s behaviour towards the woman between a period of approximately April 2023 and April 2024. “The allegations do not relate to a single or a couple of incidents, but misconduct taking place over a period of several months,” one ICC source said. The alleged victim told colleagues that, after initial concerns about how Khan had sought to hold her hand while on a work trip in London, the prosecutor is alleged to have made repeated attempts to initiate unwanted sexual contact. The alleged incidents are said to have escalated over time and occurred in his office at the ICC’s headquarters, in hotel rooms on overseas work trips, as well as at his home in The Hague. Three sources said the woman reported to colleagues detailed descriptions of alleged unwanted sexual touching, including occasions when Khan would allegedly grope her and put his tongue in her ear. According to an ICC document describing the allegations, she reported that she tried to make excuses to avoid being alone with Khan, but attempts to distance herself from him would lead to negative consequences in the workplace. After returning from an overseas work trip with the prosecutor in April, the woman spoke in confidence to two close colleagues after they noticed she was upset and gave a detailed account of Khan’s alleged conduct. The alleged victim told colleagues at the time that she was reluctant to pursue a formal complaint as she feared that doing so could have negative consequences for her, her family and the work of the international court. Within days of confiding in the two colleagues, however, Khan and the ICC’s independent oversight mechanism (IOM), a watchdog that investigates alleged misconduct, had been made aware of the claims. Khan was told one evening in early May that serious allegations would soon be shared with the IOM when a small group of staff from his office approached him, according to multiple people familiar with the events. The meeting, which took place at Khan’s home in The Hague, occurred without the woman’s knowledge or consent. “The alleged victim was kept in the dark,” one source said. Investigation Three days after Khan was given advance warning of the allegations, IOM investigators hastily summoned the alleged victim to a hotel in The Hague, informing her they had received a report of alleged misconduct. According to a record of the meeting, the woman told investigators she had been blind-sided by their approach and had serious concerns about their handling of the situation. ICC sources said the alleged victim had previously expressed concerns about the competence of the IOM, a body that was not wholly trusted by female staff at the court. Two days after meeting with the alleged victim, the IOM decided against opening a full investigation into the claims. The body recently said in its annual report the woman “declined to pursue a formal complaint” even after it was suggested an investigation could be “referred to an external entity”. However, records relating to the investigation seen by the Guardian suggest the woman agreed to meet the IOM for a second time, shortly before investigators closed the matter. An external investigation was not offered at that stage, the records suggest. In a recent statement about the IOM investigation, the court’s governing body said that, following a conversation with the alleged victim, “the IOM was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage. Measures to safeguard everyone’s rights were recommended”. Two sources said those recommendations, which were sent to Khan in writing, included that he minimise contact with the woman and avoid spending time with her alone, at night or while travelling on work trips. However, after the alleged victim returned to work, the prosecutor discussed the situation with her in several in-person meetings and calls, sources said. Another official within his office also encouraged her to distance herself from the claims, telling her that Khan was “very scared” and “nervous” the allegations would eventually leak. Between May and September, according to three sources, Khan and the other official close to him encouraged the alleged victim to write a letter disavowing the allegations against the prosecutor. At one stage, the official is said to have told her that if she wrote such a letter it would normalise her working relationship with the prosecutor. He allegedly advised her to state in writing: “I have never said this. He never assaulted me”. The official is understood to dispute the suggestion he discussed the matter with the alleged victim. Lawyers for Khan also denied the episode. “We confirm that neither our client, nor any person acting on his behalf, or who reports to him, asked for any such letter to be written, nor did they ask the person to withdraw any allegations,” they said. “Our client has fully complied with internal processes and allowed these matters to be handled in an impartial manner by authorities independent of him.” ‘New theory’ Last week, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, which adopts a conservative and pro-Israel line, published a leak of information about the allegations based on the questionable “whistleblower” report that has been circulated to the media. The newspaper speculated on what it called “a new theory”: that Khan sought arrest warrants against Netanyahu to divert attention from sexual misconduct allegations that threatened to precipitate his resignation. One official with knowledge of the ICC’s Palestine investigation described that suggestion as “inaccurate”. Another well-placed source pointed out that the key decisions to seek arrest warrants for senior Israeli and Hamas figures had already been made by the time Khan was informed of the misconduct complaint. By that stage, the source said, applications for the warrants were already in the process of being drafted. Multiple current and former ICC officials expressed concerns that Israel and its allies would seek to exploit the controversy surrounding the embattled chief prosecutor, with little regard for due process for the woman at the centre of the situation. Many staff within the court are understood to be supportive of Khan’s decision to request the arrest warrants and applauded him for asserting the independence of the court in the face of significant political pressure. But many in the same workforce also have deep concerns about the accusations he is facing and the court’s handling of the situation. Last week, the ICC’s staff union called for a “prompt, independent investigation led by an external panel free from any potential conflict of interest”. Khan has said he would be willing, if asked, to cooperate with a new inquiry. In a statement, a spokesperson for his office added: “It is essential, in particular in the context in which the [prosecutor] is presently operating, that any reports of this nature are addressed in a formal independent process, protecting the rights of all persons.” On Friday, the Associated Press reported the woman at the centre of the allegations is now in touch with the assembly of states parties (ASP), the court’s governing body which has the ultimate say about Khan’s future. A diplomatic source said the ASP had yet to initiate a new investigation. That investigation may be the next step in the process, resulting in Khan facing a second formal inquiry that would be expected to question the prosecutor and alleged victim about the allegations, and conduct other investigative work, prior to reaching any conclusion about Khan’s innocence or guilt. In a statement issued last week, the ASP’s president, Päivi Kaukoranta, said “any reports of misconduct are taken very seriously”. She asked people to respect the integrity and confidentiality of internal processes, “including any further possible steps as necessary”."

          "headline": "Writer Amy Key: ‘Knowing I’d finally hear Joni Mitchell sing live left me woozily panicked’",
          "bodyText": "The last time I was in Los Angeles, in February 2020, I had told a white lie. My taxi driver asked me what I was doing there. “I’m here to write about Joni Mitchell,” I said. I wanted to have a story. Earlier this month, I landed at LAX airport, returning to see Mitchell play at the Hollywood Bowl. In 2020, the idea she would perform again seemed like fantasy. In 2015 she had an aneurysm that left her unable to speak or walk, and even before that, her public performances had been rare. But over the past few years, Mitchell has hosted musicians at her home for a “jam” in her living room. For a long time, she listened to others sing her songs to her, but then, gradually, she began to sing along. In 2022, she made a surprise appearance at the Newport folk festival in Rhode Island and, last year, headlined a show in Washington state. I failed to get tickets. In the days after, I’d watch videos of it people posted on Instagram, but with the sound down because it felt too painful to listen to, as though I was seeing the love of my life get married to someone else. I wanted to hold on to an idea I’d hear her for myself one day. After my first trip to Los Angeles, I began to write a book, Arrangements in Blue, inspired by the type of intimate self-examination that is at the heart of Mitchell’s music, especially her album Blue. Like millions of her fans, I felt – I feel – that Blue belongs to me, as if it is part of my own personal mode of emotional expression. It shaped my ideas of romantic love, of the life I believed I would lead and the woman I would grow to be. So when I wanted to look at the life I’d created and the one I wanted, it was Blue I turned to, using a lyric from each of the songs as a prompt to explore different parts of life. Since my book was published last spring, I’ve become, for some people, tethered to Mitchell. I’m sent news about her, links to interviews and clips. Readers tell me what she means to them – what their favourite song is. And some tell me they’ve listened to her for the first time: they’ve found Blue because of my book. I’m hardly the first writer to fall under her spell, but I’m glad to have contributed to a growing body of culture that celebrates her significance as an artist. Then, in January this year, she announced another show. I unfroze a credit card and bought – in a state of real panic and confusion, as though I was trying to escape the Crystal Maze – two tickets at the cost of £1,979.29. After, I was in shock. The combination of spending more money on a single thing than I’d ever done in my life and the near certainty I’d get to see Mitchell perform took hold of my nervous system in a way I couldn’t comprehend. How was I going to pay for all this and how would I survive the emotional debt this encounter with Mitchell might generate? Once I land in LA, for the first few days I work in the courtyard of my hotel, my brain soothed by the sound of water running from the spout of a stonework lion into a small pond. Then I take a trip to the Getty museum. My Uber driver, a cheerful man named Gregory, asks me what I’m doing in LA. “I’m here to see Joni Mitchell at the Bowl,” I say. “I’m going to be writing about it for a newspaper back home.” “I’ve got chills!” he replies. “I’m so excited for you, you’re going to have the best time.” I can’t get my enthusiasm to match his. I realise I am feeling afraid. My friend the Scottish poet Roddy Lumsden died just before my last trip to Los Angeles. He’d been ill for a long time, suffering from complications of alcohol addiction. That time is infused with grief: everything I saw and experienced was illuminated by or in the shadow of his absence and the confrontation his death had instigated. While I was standing outside Mitchell’s old house in Laurel Canyon on a kind of pilgrimage in 2020, for the first time I allowed myself to acknowledge a pain I’d been carrying. I had let the absence of romantic love become the organising principle of my life. I’d built my life around, and defined it through, lack. The trip was transformative: it opened up a space to rethink my life and ultimately it was the impetus to write Arrangements in Blue, which, while it isn’t a book about Mitchell, is a book that would not exist without her. That I would tether my life so intimately to someone I’ve never met surprises me. I love to be a fan, but I’ve never signed up to fandom. I don’t get into fights about Mitchell on the internet and I am not a completist. There’s a lot of her oeuvre I’m yet to spend time with. But I have written a book inspired by a work of art created by a person who doesn’t know I exist. If that’s not fandom, then what is? The thought of sharing a space with her, the knowledge I would hear her speak and sing live gave me the woozy panicked feeling of waking from a dream where someone you’ve lost appears to be alive. “The things we want most we will never have,” wrote Roddy in a poem. Will I get what I want? Do I deserve to have it? When it comes, will I be able to experience it, inhabit the moment completely? This was where the fear was coming from, that I might not be equal to the opportunity. Maybe Roddy meant not that you don’t get the things you want most, but that if you do, the experience will not correspond to the desire you felt. A bride left disenchanted by her longed-for wedding day. Since my book came out I’ve been asked countless times: “Has Joni read it?” “I wish,” I say. “Oh God, I hope not,” I think. I hate the thought of my own art inspired by Mitchell finding its way to her and for her to hate it or, worse, be utterly indifferent. I don’t need her to know who I am, or what I think of her and how her music made me. A Mitchell lyric to hand for every heartbreak, for every sense of restlessness. This is almost true. In the days leading up to the concert, I’ve daydreamed about what I might post about it on Instagram: a photo of Mitchell singing captioned: “This is my Eras tour.” There isn’t a Swiftie friendship bracelet exchange equivalent for the Mitchell fanbase, but I’ve brought my own merch. A customised jacket inspired by an original tour jacket from 1976. I commissioned someone to recreate the beautiful chain-stitched lettering on the back. At the show, I want people to say: “I love your jacket, where did you get it?” I want, I now realise with some small degree of shame, to identify myself as a big fan, attract Mitchell’s attention. My heart not just on my sleeve but embroidered on my back. On my first trip to LA, I had a sense of wanting to trace Mitchell’s steps, as though being eye level with her experience might reveal something to me. I got more than I bargained for in that respect: it sent me careening into something more intimate than I could have imagined. But this time I have a strange sense of haunting myself, retracing my steps to check how I correspond with past me. LA keeps throwing cinematic narratives my way. Visiting a flea market, I stop at a box of old postcards and immediately find one, sent in 1934, with an ethereal illustration of the Hollywood Bowl at night. A couple of days later, I call an Uber and the driver gets out: it’s Gregory, from my trip to the Getty. He tells me that earlier that day he dropped a woman off in Laurel Canyon, saying she’d met Mitchell back in the day. The day before the show, I meet up with photographer Dan Tuffs. We stop at the Canyon Country Store, a famous landmark from the 1960s and 70s, then take a detour so I can once more walk down Mitchell’s old street, site of my epiphany back in 2020. The day of the concert, I have lunch with the writer Dolly Alderton (back in London, we met and became friends because we both love Mitchell). “How are you feeling?” We ask each other over our bloody marys. “I have a confusing sense of nervy excitement,” I say. “It’s like I am going to be doing a show.” I go with my friend Doug Powell, a poet who lives in San Francisco. We meet before the show and walk to the Bowl, slowly meeting others going in the same direction, a snaking crowd forming. I tune into bits of conversation. “I hope she plays Morning Morgantown,” a man says. “I think she loves mozzarella sticks,” a girl says. “She loves mozzarella sticks?” her companion says in reply. “Yeah, well I think she’s definitely a vegetarian.” “Look at that jacket,” a woman says, and I wonder if she’s talking about me. Taking our seats at the Bowl, I am surprised to find mine is slap bang in the middle: I will be eye to eye with Mitchell even if I can’t see her face from that distance. In the row behind us is a family, in front a lesbian couple; people with pizzas and drinks, wearing merch while holding on to their new merch. The house lights go down and the stage begins to revolve. We all get to our feet. The big screen shows Mitchell on her throne, wearing purple velvet and her hair in plaits under a beret. Her skin seemingly lit from within, she holds a walking stick tipped with a diamond-encrusted cat’s head like a sceptre. Beside her, a table with a stained-glass Tiffany lamp. We are invited into her living room, all on the same level, seated, but spiritually at her feet. She opens with two songs I don’t know, Be Cool and Harlem in Havana. It doesn’t matter. I almost need that dislocation from my personal Mitchell canon to adjust to what is happening: I am really there, she is really there. But the third song she plays is Hejira, the one I had dared to hope for. “So now I’m returning to myself,” she sings, “These things that you and I suppressed.” The tears come then, silent and steady. She sings Coyote, mischievous and sexy. I think of a young woman, Íde, who I met last year at a book event, and how happy she must be – I know she is somewhere in the audience – with her “No regrets Coyote” tattoo. There is a singalong to Carey, reminding me of when I visited Matala in Crete, where Mitchell met Cary Raditz, and felt too self-conscious to sing along when the tour guide played the song on the coach. This time, I stand up with everyone else, add my voice to theirs. Closing her first set, she sings Both Sides Now; the moon rises to the right of the stage, inching over the hills as she begins and finishing high above the Bowl as she takes us into the interval. As counterpoint to her incredibly rich, strong voice, I can hear a woman behind me weeping uncontrollably. The second half is more bombastic: out come the special guests (Doug leaps out of his seat at the sight of Annie Lennox). They begin with a barnstorming Big Yellow Taxi, a song I can ordinarily take or leave but find myself swept up by. A thrilling Raised on Robbery, followed by California, sung mainly by Marcus Mumford but redeemed for me by Joni’s spontaneous interjections. Hearing her ask an audience if they will “take me as I am” moves me deeply. The distance Mitchell has travelled between recording that song in her 20s and singing it to a rapt audience at 80 years old is so gorgeously felt in her voice. Every lyric and evolution of her register is enriched by the journey she has been on, and it feels a privilege to get to hear it: hear how life – its pain, glory, futility, rancour, joy – accumulates. After Dog Eat Dog, someone shouts: “Fuck Donald Trump” and she replies: “I love that song.” Throughout, she chuckles and laughs, letting her pleasure show. During Shine, I scribble down a lyric – “They travelled inward / Past themselves” – because it feels important to remember. It’s where I need to go. To quote Come in from the Cold: “I longed to lose control.” I want to know I can just love Mitchell and (to quote an earlier song) “forget about me”. I’m left wondering how you metabolise profound experience. I’m not sure you can in its immediate wake. That night with Mitchell was so intimately mine yet shared with almost 18,000 others. I was just a biggest fan among all her biggest fans. It has entered me in a form beyond language, infused my cells. I’m rendered daft and incapable other than the most cliched expression. If I feel overwhelmed, then good. I’m grateful. How wonderful to know what something has meant to you with no need to persuade someone of it. On the postcard I found at the flea market, the sender wrote: “It was thrilling sitting there with just the stars for a roof.” Twice, when I looked up at the night sky above the Bowl, I saw a shooting star.

          "bodyText": "While organising an interview with Marianna Spring, the BBC’s first Social Media Investigations correspondent, I asked if I could meet her at home. It would be more intimate than meeting at the BBC’s offices, I said, more relaxed. But a communications manager called me on the phone. It’s a bit sensitive, she said. It’s not that Marianna doesn’t want me to go to her house, she explained, it’s just… the trolls. In the first five months of 2023, the BBC received 14,488 messages abusive enough to be escalated by their system designed to detect hate; 11,771 of those, around 80%, were about Spring. Due to her reporting on conspiracy theories she’s regularly targeted with death threats and harassment, both on and offline. For a while, a man camped in a tent outside the BBC’s New Broadcasting House shouting “disinformation agent” in her face as she left work. Which means, while I can say Spring welcomes me with a hug and invites me into her front room for a conversation that will span murder and Kate Middleton and teenage boys, I can’t describe the city she lives in, or who she lives with, or if she lives with anybody else at all, or give any personal details that might put her in danger. “It’s quite a big deal for me this,” she says nervously, as we settle on her sofa. “I keep so private, because I know that the world I investigate has attracted this group of trolls who will stop at nothing to figure out literally everything about me and then use it in some way.” She once mentioned that her dad was a doctor, which led to strangers suggesting this connection is why she is invested in killing people with the Covid vaccine. Once she shared a picture online of her family’s 19-year-old cat and she was accused noisily of animal cruelty. “They also called her Chairman Miaow,” Spring adds, “which was actually quite funny.” Spring grew up in south London. At eight years old she’d “make my poor little sister sit and watch BBC world news when we were on holiday. I remember my mum coming in and saying, ‘Why are you watching this, get outside!’” After graduating from Oxford, she sent Emily Maitlis some examples of her journalism and got a job on Newsnight. Later, as the 2020 American election approached, the BBC asked her to report on the sociological aspects of social media and its impact on democracy. Spring was 23. She’d been obsessed with news since 9/11 and, as she got older, became obsessed further with the conspiracy theories that surrounded it. When the pandemic began, reporting the real-world consequences of disinformation became even more necessary. A 2023 survey found that around a third of the public believe various conspiracy theories, such as “Covid-19 was a hoax” and “15-minute cities are an attempt by governments to restrict people’s personal freedom and keep them under surveillance.” What used to be seen as paranoia, now blurs into beliefs held by many millions. For a typical investigation, Spring will create a series of fake online profiles to see what the algorithms deliver. “I think I currently have 24 phones. Every time I swing by the desk of the poor bloke who looks after the retired iPhones at the BBC he’s wary because he thinks I must be selling them on.” Today her work, which includes Panorama investigations and a BBC podcast Why Do You Hate Me? (the new US series of which investigates the online phenomena that could influence the election), sees her dig into the darkest corners of the internet, a place she calls “Conspiracyland”. Here she meets the people who live there, like those who claim terrorist attacks have been staged. Sometimes she meets her own trolls, too. The harassment she receives “is almost always about me being a young woman, attempting to undermine my credibility, using gendered slurs. You know, I’m everything from a silly little girl who couldn’t possibly know what’s going on to an evil whore who’s eating babies.” She never would have guessed her own harassment would be such a large part of the story, “but I think it’s important to talk about it. I think a huge number of women in public life are subject to this and obviously it’s way worse if you also get racist abuse and other forms of hate. And it normalises it if we don’t talk about it.” As well as using her own experiences as an example of how online hate metastasises, her work has become a vital tool for those seeking to understand the conspiracy theories that continue to shape our world and how, when the people in power abuse that power, they fuel anxieties that prompt these theories. Democracy relies on a shared reality, Spring says. “So, we’re sitting on the sofa, right? And I might love this sofa and you might hate this sofa, but if we don’t agree the sofa is here, we can’t have a conversation. That’s the thing we should be worried about – the conversation is not about the sofa, the conversation has to begin with, ‘Why don’t you think the sofa is here?’” She’s had many such conversations with theoretical sofa deniers, like those she calls the “true believers”. Last year, she met a woman called Natalie in Totnes who believes that governments and global organisations are trying to control us through things like attempts to limit pollution. While telling her this, Spring says, Natalie suddenly started crying. “She said she felt so isolated from people in her life. It was the same in America, talking to a woman who believed Trump’s assassination was staged. She started crying, too. It’s stressful not being able to trust anything any more, to truly believe these plots are happening, that everyone is out to murder and kill people in your life. You can understand why that would make you feel untethered from the world around you.” What might surprise readers, she says, is that most of the conspiracy theorists she’s met aren’t bad people. She sits with them at home, like we’re doing now. They have tea together. Biscuits. “Often they arrive at these places from really legitimate points. They really care, they’re very worried about other human beings who are being hurt, or powerful people doing bad stuff. But they are themselves being exploited by other people on social media. They’re being pushed that kind of content and others benefit from their attention.” Other memorable interviewees include people whose lives have been overturned by these conspiracy theorists. In February, Martin Hibbert, a survivor of the 2017 Manchester Arena attack, won his bid to sue Richard D Hall, who claimed nobody died in the attack, and that Hibbert and his daughter (both of whom were left with severe disabilities) were not there. “People like Martin are so brave. He’s willing to stand up against the conspiracy theories and abuse that he and his daughter have been subject to after living through something most people can’t even imagine. But also what he’s doing could set a really important precedent for how this stuff is dealt with.” This is the most important part of Spring’s job, she thinks: giving a voice to people, like the family of 13-year-old Olly Stephens. In 2021, two schoolboys who ambushed him after a dispute online were convicted of his murder. Spring investigated the role social media played and exposed how teenagers’ Instagram, YouTube and Facebook accounts routinely recommend violent videos and knives for sale. People like Stephens’s parents “often feel as though the social media companies are not listening to what they have to say and the politicians don’t get it, and so if I can be the person that investigates it, that is the greatest privilege.” Spring, 28 now, takes barely a breath in our two-hour conversation. She has the charisma and energy of a kids’ TV presenter, delivering complex ideas in digestible explanations with empathy and wit. “I am a very positive person, which is important because everything I investigate is largely very dark. That positivity is a really valuable thing, because it keeps you going – I’m someone who is fundamentally hopeful about people.” I wonder where she sees her career going. Does she have ambitions to become the next Emily Maitlis? “Oh!” she says. Well, she loves the investigative work and the presenting, but it’s the public service element of her job that excites her. “The landscape is changing so much it’s quite hard to know what work is going to look like in 10 years.” And by then, she predicts, “everything will be a social media investigation – you can’t untangle the two things.” Has she ever been taken in by disinformation herself? “Hmm!” She thinks, theatrically. Around the time she started doing this job, there were wildfires spreading across Australia and on her Instagram she started to see memes of, “I want to say… wombats? They were very cute and very big, and they were hiding other baby animals from the flames. I sent them to my friends, these wombats, but it later transpired the story was just complete rubbish. And that’s how all this works – you’re pulled in by anything that makes you have an emotional reaction.” It’s easy to be tricked, she says – that’s what disinformation is designed to do, to exploit our emotions, our legitimate concerns, our real anxieties, often for profit. That’s why we need to remove the stigma attached to people who get drawn in, she stresses. “There’s this idea that they’re stupid or crazy, but it’s just not the case – they’re often really cynical and clever and engaged. They probably spend a bit too much time on social media, which they readily admit to me, but honestly, they could be any of us.” Earlier this year, in fact, it was. After the Princess of Wales’s absence from the public eye became a talking point, the palace published a family portrait to quash gossip, but the image only increased speculation, leading to “Kategate’” with thousands of people scrutinising photos and sharing theories to fill a vacuum of information. The seduction of conspiracy theories lies partly in a dissection of power – marginalised people seeking to unpick the control that those in power wield, or the sense they’re plotting to deceive us, and then, the power that comes from feeling like you’re are in possession of privileged knowledge. “I’ve investigated quite a lot of online sleuthing where people come up with things that are true,” says Spring. “Like they’d sussed out Molly-Mae’s new brand before she’d even announced it. But then there are other examples, everything from when Nicola Bulley disappeared to Kate Middleton, to Jay Slater who also disappeared this year.” Spring saw patterns appearing. “People often come from a point of caring, and wanting to understand what’s going on, but then we all get a bit sucked in. And the theories are more exciting and interesting often than the truth, which can be quite complicated and quite boring and quite sad. But sharing them has real consequences for the people who are at the centre of the story.” This year, after the stabbing attacks in Sydney, falsely blamed on a Jewish student, then, when riots spread after a false name was attributed on X to the man who killed three children in Southport, Spring became increasingly desperate to interview Elon Musk about the part social media played. She’s tried many times – for a while, X’s comms department replied to all journalists’ emails with a poop emoji. Spring found herself lying in bed at night thinking about what she’d ask him. “Questions around decisions he’s made that appear to have had a real-world impact – decisions about blue ticks, decisions about the algorithm, decisions about what’s allowed and what isn’t. I was thinking, maybe I should just go to San Francisco, maybe he’d talk to me then. It’s worrying that he won’t, when you’re trying to hold these kinds of powerful institutions to account – these companies are as powerful as lots of governments in many cases.” She wants to ask him specific questions about people who have experienced serious harm as a result of disinformation and what’s being recommended on their feeds. “A lot of what I imagine Elon Musk would say is about how the UK want to clamp down on freedom of expression, and my challenge to that would be, well what about the freedom of expression of these people who’ve been harmed? When does it stop, how does it stop, and how do you how do you deal with that? This is the question at the crux of all of this.” She’s thinking about the people she’s met in Conspiracyland, who see people they trust sharing disinformation at the top of their feeds, posts that are getting hundreds of likes, “and that not only affects their perception of reality, but more broadly this shared concept of reality that we all rely on.” Instead of answering her interview requests, “He’ll probably just share this interview. In the past he’s tweeted a picture of me which resulted in an absolute wave of online abuse and hate and threats.” But she’ll keep on asking. “I’m the BBC’s Social Media Investigations Correspondent, but have not interviewed anyone senior at his company for more than two years – that shows us that there’s a problem with accountability. If cabinet ministers just stopped doing interviews, everyone would be really outraged.” One side effect of her work is that Spring has become a sort of unofficial social media agony aunt, with people messaging her regular questions, often about their experiences of trolling, or asking whether a story they’ve seen is real, or for advice on kids and phones. She always responds, but, she says, it’s not simply a case of telling them to go offline: “We’ve reached a point where it would be very difficult to live without our phones.” They’re our wallets, our map, our supermarket, our family. “And there are positives that come out of using social media, and it doesn’t feel like it should be on all of us to change how we live in order to keep ourselves safe – that is ultimately a responsibility that the majority of the major social media companies have signed up to.” What does she think about the move to ban phones for kids? “Again, it shifts the accountability away from the companies and I don’t think we should be letting them off the hook that lightly!” It reminds her of people who, having heard about her experiences of trolling, ask why she doesn’t simply quit social media. “First, it’s what I investigate so it’d be a bit like asking a political journalist not to be in the House of Commons, but also, why should people have to leave a particular social media platform, when they’re entitled to be there, too?” As the pandemic subsided she thought the conspiracy movement might calm down a little. “I thought people might go, ‘Oh, you’ve had a bit of a funny half hour there,’ but I don’t think that has been the case and I think it will continue to not be the case.” There are people, she says, who truly have shifted in how they view reality. “I don’t know how many more times I have to investigate almost the same thing, which is,” she lifts her head, vaguely maddened, “a situation in which something hateful or false spreads on social media, is actively pushed by the algorithms, that causes harm or has a serious consequence for people. Then I track all those people down, email the social media companies saying this has happened, and then…” And then? “We go again! I don’t know how many times that has to happen before someone says, ‘OK, how are we dealing with this?’” What needs to change? “Well, when you start thinking of the companies more like governments, even though they’re not elected, that maybe helps? A lot of this is about fundamentally how the companies’ sites operate and it does frequently come back to algorithms. Until we reach a place where safety is more important than engagement, these kinds of things will keep happening.” She pauses and leans back on the sofa, which exists, and seats two, and is blue. “My job is to expose the problems. I guess, I hope people reading will come up with solutions.” Marianna Spring’s podcast, Why Do You Hate Me, is now available on BBC Sounds (bbc.co.uk)"

          "headline": "Ukraine war briefing: Russian attacks kill nine civilians across Ukraine, officials say",
          "bodyText": "A string of Russian attacks killed and injured civilians in widely separated parts of Ukraine, officials said. The number of people killed in the central city of Dnipro after Russian missile attacks rose to five, including a child, local officials said. A Russian glide bomb killed one person and injured three on Saturday in Kostiantynivka, near the frontline in Donetsk region, the regional governor said. Russian shelling also killed two people in a small town west of the southern city of Kherson. And a Russian drone strike killed a teenager in Kyiv during a night-time barrage on the Ukrainian capital that lasted for hours, officials said. The latest attacks prompted Volodymyr Zelenskyy to issue a new call to Kyiv’s allies on Saturday to intensify pressure on Moscow. In his nightly video address, he said the assaults showed Russia was “determined to continue its aggression”, adding, “these are conditions in which the lack of stronger decisions from partners to support Ukraine only encourages Putin to invest further in terror,” Zelenskyy said. “The world can stop the escalation of war. Abstractions and words are not enough for this. Concrete steps are needed.” Finance ministers of the G7 nations vowed on Saturday to step up efforts to prevent Russia from evading sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine. A December 2022 agreement was intended to limit Russian petroleum sales and revenues without curbing exports so sharply that it would cause global oil prices to soar. But some countries, notably China, have continued to import Russian crude oil without observing the price ceiling. “We remain committed to taking further initiatives in response to oil price cap violations,” the group said in a statement after a meeting in Washington. Those further steps were not spelled out in detail. Zelenskyy is warning that Russia is planning to send North Korean troops into battle against his country. In a post on Telegram, he said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that “the first North Korean military will be used by Russia in combat zones” between Sunday and Monday, and that the deployment was “an obvious escalating move by Russia”. He didn’t provide any further details, including where the North Korean soldiers may be sent. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the Oleksandropil settlement in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the state-run news agency RIA reported on Saturday, where it has made a string of advances in recent months. The ministry also reported its air defences brought down 51 Ukrainian drones over four regions near the border. But Russia has struggled to push Ukrainian forces out of its Kursk border region after an incursion almost three months ago. Georgia’s ruling party is leading in a pivotal parliamentary election that could mean the country is heading for closer ties with neighbouring Russia. The vote is widely seen as a make-or-break vote for the country’s long-held aspiration for EU membership. If the partial results confirm the victory of the Georgian Dream party, the country could be heading for closer ties with neighbouring Russia. Its campaign centred on a conspiracy theory about a “global war party” that controls western institutions and is seeking to drag Georgia into the Russia-Ukraine war. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in seven Italian cities on Saturday calling for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, the Middle East, and all global conflicts. Peaceful rallies were held in Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Bari, Palermo and Cagliari, with the support of hundreds of associations committed to peace, disarmament and human rights."

          "bodyText": "When the old guard told us we were brave to start a political party, hardly anyone meant that as a compliment. Perhaps it is naive to believe in the possibility of a better future, but inequality was yawning ever wider, with women and girls at the sharp end. Frankly, setting up the Women’s Equality party (WE) wasn’t so much brave as a no-brainer. Why not simply join a mainstream party or use our media platforms to campaign? Well, we saw old parties adopting the rhetoric of populism to woo voters, while editors platformed toxic views in the name of balance, and clickbait-hungry broadcasters turned dangerous buffoons into reality stars. For almost a decade, WE thrived, offering transformative solutions and making a real difference, not because of our own efforts but thanks to the thousands of brilliant people who picked up the idea and ran with it. Just this May, Stacy Hart won a seat on Basingstoke borough council, trouncing the Tory incumbent and securing 59% of the vote. She joined a growing band of WE councillors including our first elected representative, Kay Wesley in Congleton, already re-elected for a second term. Each of these women models how much political upstarts can achieve. Despite this, we have come to the reluctant conclusion that this beloved organisation, part movement, part community, passionate and extraordinary, has run its course. At November’s special conference, we will back a motion proposing its closure. We reached this decision after much soul-searching and against the pleadings of our own hearts. WE’s executive and steering committees have been examining options, and we both initially gravitated towards ideas that would preserve the party, keenly aware of the implications for staff, volunteers, members, supporters, elected representatives and voters. Whatever conference decides, our immediate concern is to ensure that not a single activist takes this discussion as a deterrent to ambition. WE’s history carries exactly the opposite message, a prompt to action on as grand a scale as possible. If one small, but mighty party can do so much, what could not be achieved with more resources? Money has always been a problem, with most of the party’s income coming from members who were already cash-strapped before the one-two punch of the pandemic and cost of living crisis. Unlike other parties, we have never received large donations from corporates or super-rich individuals. In fact, in the early days of the party we turned down a gamechanging sum after the potential donor explained the strings attached: we would have to change the name of the party. Yep, ditch “Women”. Thanks, but no thanks. If funding were the only issue, we would almost certainly advocate for keeping going. But business as usual is not an option. The world has changed and so we are calling for an end as a new beginning. Let us explain. Our founding idea was simple: if we could show there were votes in feminism, the old parties would attempt to neutralise us by mimicking us, just as we had seen them do with Ukip and its successors. The ploy worked. WE racked up a whacking number of votes in our very first election, triggering the anticipated response. From then on, WE delivered each of our successive manifestos to other parties with a label reading “please steal us”, and they did. They put up women against us, too, and echoed our positions on vital subjects they had previously ignored. As a result, wherever WE ran, WE won. Winning seats is, of course, the main change mechanism for traditional political parties. Despite direct victories, we never expected to make much of a dent that way. First-past-the-post elections most sharply disadvantage exactly those people whose voices are lacking in politics, marginalised women and minorities. At the 2019 general election, WE showcased a different route to winning, fielding survivors of violence to stand against five MPs facing unresolved allegations of abuse and harassment. Not one of those MPs returned to parliament. Which other parties do you know that can boast an electoral clean sweep? This proud record sits alongside WE’s substantial contribution to grassroots campaigning on reproductive rights, tackling misogyny and racism in the police and other institutions, and spotlighting discrimination in its many forms including sexual harassment and the gender pay gap. WE held a members’ assembly to try to shed light and diminish heat in the fight between trans inclusive and gender critical feminism that is weakening the women’s movement to the delight of regressive populists. This list represents just a tiny fraction of the party’s positive impacts and legacy. Perhaps WE’s greatest contribution – and most enduring change mechanism – has been to bring exceptionally talented people into politics. Within a few short years of the wonderful Mandu Reid attending her first meeting, she became the first woman of colour ever to helm a UK political party. As Zoe Williams recently observed in the Guardian: “in a world with rational priorities, she would be a much bigger household name.” Other parties have been quick to notice, recruiting former WE candidates with promises of safer seats. As a result, our candidates can find themselves contesting seats alongside sisters-in-arms who wear the colours of another party but were or are WE members. UK politics operates as a club. WE have always aimed to open doors, rather than pull up drawbridges. That is why WE are the only party to extend membership to members of other parties, and sometimes endorse their candidates in return for them embracing our policies. WE have worked particularly closely with the Green party, helping to draft a cross-party bill, and exploring a range of collaborative models from joint candidacies up to a permanent alliance. Climate change is gendered in its causes and its outcomes. At the general election earlier this year, WE endorsed the Green’s Siân Berry, and unveiled a joint policy platform, A New Deal for Care. She in turn won a seat in parliament promising to champion our flagship universal free childcare policy. It even used to be possible to work with those Conservatives who regarded gender inequality and climate change as urgent issues rather than fodder for culture wars. As recently as Theresa May’s premiership, one of her chief advisers called us to Downing Street to discuss which WE policies the government might incorporate in its legislative programme. Now we operate in a political landscape where the Tories’ attempts to contain the electoral threat from the hard right has instead seen them fully captured by it. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer’s Labour has also veered to the right, fixated on discipline, both fiscal and within its own ranks. The leadership barely listens to its MPs and wider membership, so it is hardly likely to pay heed to us. Nor would they be tempted by our policies. WE view care as an investment; they see it as an expense that can be cut. All of this means that merely tweaking our approach cannot be enough, and this isn’t just about WE. The last Westminster election might have looked like a return to safer ground, just as the 2020 US presidential contest did, but such results are misleading. In many countries, populism and tech-driven polarisation are winning, to the benefit of the far right and other extremists, dictators and repressive regimes around the globe. We must do more, not less, to confront the storm. Far from giving up the fight for equality, the two of us, like many other activists, are hard at work on ways to gear it up, to regroup, renew, and return, roaring. And if the conference decides that the Women’s Equality party is no longer the most effective vehicle for change, we know that its energy, inspiration, knowledge and, above all, its people are more than capable of leading a new charge. • Catherine Mayer and Sandi Toksvig are co-founders of the Women’s Equality party"

          "bodyText": "On the morning of 30 November 2022, Keri-Sue McManus sat down with her three-year-old son, Micah, to watch the TV series Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood. A preschool animation about a tiger cub, the show sets out to teach life lessons. That day, Keri-Sue chose a specific episode, Daniel Goes to the Hospital, for a reason. She planned to take Micah to hospital and was using the cartoon to reassure him that everything would be OK. She was sensitive to his mood because it wasn’t the first time Micah had visited the emergency room in recent weeks. In fact, it was the third time Keri-Sue had taken her toddler to hospital, and the sixth time that month she had contacted various doctors about his deterioration: he had a lack of appetite, weakness, fatigue and severe dizziness, and these symptoms were getting worse. Each time, she was reassured he would get better. One medic even implied that their frequent visits to the hospital were giving her son anxiety. It was suggested the mother should think twice about taking him in again, for his own sake – hence the cartoon. In the Daniel Tiger episode, the cub, nervously approaching his appointment, is told: “The hospital is a place where doctors and nurses work together to help you get better.” But that’s not the way it worked out for Micah, who died just hours after he arrived on this third visit, after a series of clinicians failed to take his condition seriously. “Daniel goes to hospital and the doctors fix him and everybody’s so nice. And then he gets to go home,” Keri-Sue remembers of the cartoon. “It’s like a fairytale that we didn’t get to live out.” Micah’s story casts light on how parents, especially mothers, are frequently patronised and dismissed by the medical profession. “I can’t think of any other way to describe it besides gaslighting,” Keri-Sue says when we speak. “It’s your own child, so you get a feeling or you notice something. You know your child’s normal state better than anybody else and you’re paying attention more than anybody else. I’ve relived all those moments a thousand times. What if I’d gone to this doctor; what if I’d said it this way instead of that way. But the reality is that they weren’t paying attention and doing their job. “Part of my grief has been trying to wrap my head around how it all happened.” * * * When she was 24, Keri-Sue lived in Spain for a year. Out shopping one day, she saw a cute bedroom sign that said Mi habitación (My room) with a little boy riding a horse. “I bought it and said, ‘I’m gonna have a son someday, and he’s gonna hang this in his room.’” The sign is still hanging there when I talk to Keri-Sue, two days before what should have been Micah’s fifth birthday. Micah was Keri-Sue’s first child with her husband, Dan. “I was so excited. I knew immediately, I just had this feeling when I found out I was pregnant that it was a boy.” She had only been pregnant a couple of weeks when they chose his name. The family lived a charmed life on a farm two hours north of New York City. Weekenders are drawn to the area’s natural beauty, with the Hudson River cutting through the valley and the Catskill mountains close by. In 2020, when Covid hit, there was an influx of people looking for a taste of the bucolic life. Their farm grows 200 crops, mostly organic vegetables, that they sell at farmers’ markets and to retail stores. Micah loved the lifestyle. “He was so proud of it. Everywhere we went, he’d say, ‘I have a farm.’ I wondered at the time if he thought everybody had a farm, because when kids are small it’s like, that’s their only point of reference.” Micah would feed the chickens and collect the eggs. He loved watering their garden and planting and picking flowers. “We have a farm crew, and he would pick flowers and then walk around the field and give them out to the crew. He loved making people happy; if he saw something got a really positive reaction, he would do it again.” Keri-Sue watched her son grow up quickly. She would occasionally try to freeze a moment, to make sure she was fully aware of her good fortune. On 14 October 2022, Keri-Sue and Dan were due to be married. But their son, who had turned three just 12 days before, woke them up in the night, burning with fever. The wedding was set to be a low-key event – just the couple and two friends who were witnesses; they were hoping Micah could join them after the ceremony. Instead, they rushed home to be with him as he lay lethargically on the couch. The next day the doctor told them that he had Covid, and, while the fever went away after a week, the toddler never fully bounced back. His mother watched the pulse in his neck, drumming against the skin. Micah’s primary-care doctor told Keri-Sue the elevated pulse was nothing to worry about, just swollen glands, a vestige of Covid. But Micah, who had grown out of napping, had begun to doze off during the day. He didn’t have the energy to return to his local playgroup. A few times Keri-Sue tried to take him there, but he looked like he might fall asleep in the back of the car, so she aborted each trip. Besides, knowing how playgroups are hotbeds for viruses, she wanted to make sure he was better before she exposed him to any more illnesses. Micah never went back. He stayed home for weeks, summoning up the energy to play in the leaves and dress as a cowboy for Halloween. But at the start of November he came down with RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Although common, RSV was particularly virulent that year because it hadn’t been circulating as much during the lockdown years. Both Micah and his baby sister, Chloe, coughed their way through the week, but while Chloe, who was two years his junior, soon regained her vitality, Micah became weaker and weaker. He didn’t want to eat. He didn’t want to play. His doctor gave him antibiotics, having suggested that he had a lingering sinus infection from Covid, and that some kids just take longer to recover. But his mother remained concerned. By mid-November, Micah was still barely eating and wouldn’t even watch TV, so for the first time Keri-Sue drove her son an hour to the Albany medical center hospital. Despite his elevated pulse, he didn’t even make it past the triage room and Keri-Sue was told to follow up with his regular doctor. She says she didn’t have much luck with his regular doctor, either. “I feel like he was just kind of stringing me along. He was like, ‘Kids just take a while to get better. You need to have patience.’ The whole vibe was that I was giving him anxiety and not allowing the natural process of the illness to take place.” Micah himself tried to articulate the dizziness that he was experiencing: “I feel like I’m going to fall down,” he kept saying. The call logs from the time show Keri-Sue was phoning the doctor every few days. “I was like, ‘He still won’t eat. I don’t know what to do. Should I bring him back to the hospital?’ And they just kept saying to give it more time.” At one point, the receptionist said pointedly: “I knew you would call – you call every day!” Keri-Sue was made to feel like an irritating mother who didn’t know when to give it a rest. But, naturally, she deferred to the clinicians. “Part of me wanted to believe them that I was making him anxious and overreacting, because I wanted him to get better. So if they said, ‘He’s fine, he just needs a few more days,’ I’d be like, ‘Oh, OK, good.’” She was reassured. By now a month had passed since Micah had become ill. During that period, the whole family had been sick twice, but Micah was the only one who had never got better. He refused to walk, and was increasingly frail, so Keri-Sue started having to carry him around. On 23 November, 10 days after their first visit, she took him to hospital for the second time. “I’ve replayed this scene a million times, because it didn’t have to go this way,” Keri-Sue says. She remembers the resident doctor being cold and accusatory: “‘Why are you bringing him here? You just brought him here.’ And I said, ‘Right, but he’s just not getting better. He’s not eating. He won’t walk. He’s pale, he’s tired, he seems winded to me.’ I told them everything, and she really gave me a hard time, to the point that I actually started to cry.” Keri-Sue tried to explain: “You’re telling me that I’m wrong, but I wouldn’t have brought him here unless I really was worried.” The doctors carried out some examinations: they checked for any rash and listened to Micah’s chest with a stethoscope. He was given anti-nausea medicine, which allowed him to drink some apple juice and eat a saltine cracker. And then he was discharged. As they were leaving, Keri-Sue remembers a doctor saying: “You know, he’s probably anxious you keep bringing him to the hospital.” They advised the mother “not to bring him for a while and let him get better at home”. The paperwork for this visit states: “Micah may be experiencing some stress related to having recently been ill.” At home, Micah became clingy, telling his mother over and over again that he loved her. “If I left for any amount of time, I’d come back and he’d say, ‘I missed you so much, Mama. I love you so much.’” Keri-Sue stopped working on the farm in order to dedicate all her time to her son’s recovery. She took to heart the doctor’s advice, and started playing them both meditation tapes. “I was just trying to do whatever we could to relax. But he wasn’t getting better.” He was listless. When he ate, he only wanted to do so lying down. He still talked about the sensation of falling. On 29 November, Keri-Sue called her regular doctor’s office again, begging them to squeeze Micah in for an appointment. She had stayed up all night Googling, writing down possible causes of her son’s illness, including liver problems, long Covid, inflammation of the heart … “I said we need to be more thorough, and went down a long list. And every single one of them, he was just like, ‘No, no, that’s not what’s happening. Kids are not getting long Covid. No, it’s not anything with his heart, or his fingers would be blue. No, it’s not his liver.’ When we left, I had been given a prescription for an allergy medicine.” Unsatisfied, Keri-Sue called her doctor again later that day to request an echocardiogram, a scan of the heart and nearby blood vessels. She says she was told it wasn’t necessary. She couldn’t sleep. “I just had a horrible feeling.” In the middle of the night, Micah got up to pee, and said, ‘Ow’. He pointed to his abdomen as the source of pain. “I knew it was his heart or liver. I just knew.” That third time at the hospital, everything seemed chaotic, and the staff appeared to be overwhelmed. (Albany medical center hospital reportedly has some of the longest ER waiting times for adults in the US.) “You can’t get a response from anyone and you don’t feel like you get to talk to the same person twice,” Keri-Sue says. Finally, an ultrasound was ordered for Micah’s abdomen. Keri-Sue sang Hush Little Baby to her son and tried to keep her eyes off the screen. The ultrasound technician finished the scan and wished them luck. “I just kept saying, ‘They’re gonna help you, they’re gonna help you. These people are so nice.’ They weren’t even being that nice,” Keri-Sue recalls, “but I just kept saying it because I really wanted to make him feel safe.” She started recounting stories from when she was young. “I told him how my parents, my brothers and I went to Cape Cod for the weekend. Our car broke down on the side of the road and we had to hitchhike there. I was scared because we were standing on the side of the highway. But these people with a tow truck came and picked us up, and saved the day. So we made it and we were fine and happy. I was trying to create this analogy of how something scary can happen, but then it turns out OK.” Dan joined them in the hospital; the hours passed as they waited for the ultrasound results. Occasionally, someone would pop their head in the door and say, “Has anyone come to see you yet?” and disappear. Eventually, the doctors confirmed Micah had an enlarged heart and blood clots on his liver. From her earlier Googling, Keri-Sue knew straight away he needed blood thinners, but the clinicians said they wanted to do more tests and start treatment in the morning. At this point, it was early evening, and the family, who had been at the hospital all day, worried about letting another night slip by. They were reassured: “We have a whole team of doctors that are working on this, and this is really treatable stuff and he’s very stable right now.” Admitted to stay overnight, they were kept waiting in a cubicle in the ER. Keri-Sue lay next to her son hugging him as he slept. At around 8pm, a nurse came to take observations and put fluid in his IV. Within minutes, Micah woke and started gasping. His eyes turned yellow and, though he hadn’t needed to pee all day, he urinated across the bed. Keri-Sue ran into the hallway yelling that something was wrong. Some of the nurses hurried in, under the impression that the problem was that he had peed. “They offered to get him a diaper and I’m like, ‘No, something is wrong. Look at my kid, he’s gasping for breath.’” And then, suddenly, after being ignored for weeks, Micah and his family had a throng of people surrounding them. The doctors put him on oxygen, but his heart rate was plummeting. They called a code blue, the signal for a cardiac arrest, and started CPR. “I stood there in this tiny little room while person after person gave my son CPR. For about an hour and a half he looked like he was dead or dying. I was just pacing around saying, ‘Micah, I’m here. I’m here.’ At one point, they said: ‘You should leave the room.’ So we did. We went to the room next door and just stood there asking ourselves: What has happened? How is this real?” A blood clot had travelled to Micah’s lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. His heart had stopped beating and they couldn’t revive him. Nothing could be done. They put Micah in his mother’s arms and started counting. One, two, three … when they reached 60 they declared him dead. Keri-Sue and Dan knew they couldn’t just sit there for hours with their son’s lifeless body, but at the same time they couldn’t fathom leaving without it. One of the staff offered to push Keri-Sue out to their car in a wheelchair. But, eventually, they walked through the waiting room and out into the cold night air, passing lines of children with their parents on the way. Apart from receiving a small clay imprint of their son’s hand, taken after he died, they had no further communication from the hospital. There was no explanation, there were no condolences. They simply never heard from them again. *** Keri-Sue contacted me after reading in the Guardian the story of my daughter Martha, who died, aged 13, of septic shock as a result of medical negligence. We live on different continents, in countries with different healthcare systems; our children were different ages and died from different illnesses. But we have this in common: we tried to raise the alarm about our child’s deteriorating condition and we were condescended to and ignored. So when Keri-Sue describes how she plays these memories over and over, willing a different outcome; when she says that “part of me never left the hospital, is still living that moment, hoping things change”, I know exactly how she feels. “It was so similar to what happened with you,” she says. “There was a lot of time and a lot of opportunities for doctors to take it seriously.” Martha was an inpatient at King’s College hospital (KCH) in London. In our case, key bits of information about my daughter’s condition – details that would have helped me advocate for her – were held back because they saw me as a problematically anxious mother. Although KCH policy states that parental concern should prompt discussions about a critical care review or a move to intensive care, with Martha the doctors decided not to arrange this potentially life-saving intervention on the basis that it would increase my anxiety. Much has been written about the diagnostic value of parental concern in medical literature. Paediatric doctors-in-training are taught to “listen to the mother and father, they know the patient better than anyone”. But that’s rarely how it plays out. Doctors too often regard parents’ involvement as a problem rather than a vital contribution: the family hasn’t had years of training; in a hospital they have no status and are treated as though they know nothing. And, too frequently, a well-intentioned instinct to put a parent’s mind at ease can inadvertently cause a doctor to reassure themselves. In post-death investigations into what went wrong in Martha’s care, my husband and I were asked a memorable question: “Were you reassured by the doctors?” The problem, of course, was that we were falsely reassured – and not listened to. On 29 November 2022, 24 hours before Micah died, 13-year-old Chloe Longster was admitted to hospital in Kettering in the English Midlands. She had been suffering from severe chest pain, a cough and other cold-like symptoms before her condition rapidly developed into sepsis. Her mother, Louise, tells me she was with her the whole time. “I felt like I had to try and convince them that she was poorly.” Echoing Keri-Sue, she says: “It was like they were trying to gaslight us.” This month, a coroner ruled that a hospital’s neglect contributed to Chloe’s death. There were numerous missed opportunities for sepsis screening and treatment. “I really believe Chloe died because there is a pervasive belief that parents are an irritant and they’re wrong,” Louise says. In cases such as Micah’s, a doctor’s counter-argument might be that the vast majority of children they see who have non-specific symptoms like his do get better. Unfortunately, children often exhibit symptoms of serious illness in different ways from adults. Ron Daniels is an intensive care consultant and CEO of the UK Sepsis Trust. He notes: “Children can compensate for illness longer than adults can. In the case of sepsis, a child can increase their heart rate to a greater degree than an adult, which means they sometimes don’t appear really sick until very late in the day – at which point they need very urgent intervention.” Equally important is that children communicate differently. “Oddly, they are more stoical than adults, and less likely to make a fuss.” Younger children especially perceive pain and discomfort in ways not always obvious to doctors. “Which means we have to listen to the experts, which in this case is the parents or carers, who just know when their child is seriously unwell.” Daniels accepts that whatever doctors are taught in med school, listening to parents remains a challenge in practice. “There’s a fear that if we empower people we’ll be overrun by hypochondriacs and time-wasters. But most good doctors know that’s not the case. No one wants to spend a lot of time in A&amp;E or a hospital ward, because they’re not pleasant places to be.” Or as Louise Longster puts it: “Chloe had never been to hospital. We’re not those kinds of people. Who sits in A&amp;E for hours on end voluntarily?” Which suggests those parents who do keep pushing deserve to have their fears taken seriously, especially if, like Keri-Sue and Dan, they don’t have a long history of repeatedly contacting a doctor. This is the reason I have campaigned for Martha’s Rule, a patient safety initiative that allows patients, families and junior staff to trigger a rapid review if they have concerns about a patient’s deterioration. Martha’s Rule is being introduced at 143 hospitals in England. Micah’s story confirms, however, that a poor listening culture is not a problem unique to the NHS: giving patients and their families more power to raise an alarm is something that needs to happen in healthcare systems around the world. As it stands, the McManuses have filed a lawsuit against Albany Med Health System for negligence and failing to perform the necessary diagnostic tests. (When approached for comment about Micah’s care, a spokesperson said: “ We cannot comment on pending legal matters.”) They are also campaigning to introduce the Grieving Families Act, which argues that New York state law inadequately compensates families like them who lose children because of medical malpractice. New York is one of just two states that place little value on the life of a child who doesn’t contribute economically. (The law is similar in the UK, where only negligible compensation is ever given to parents after a child’s death from medical mistakes. I recall one legal firm’s website suggesting that, owing to the high cost of raising children these days, there’s an argument that parents are in fact better off once their child is dead.) Naturally, money is of little consequence when it comes to the avoidable death of a child, but there’s something about a lack of accountability and recompense that feels like an affront. As Keri-Sue says: “This is not the tragedy to me. The tragedy is that I lost my son. The [resistance to the] Grieving Families Act just makes me feel like my tragedy doesn’t matter much to New York.” * * * Flicking through old photographs these days, Keri-Sue finds herself looking for signs of what was to come. “I feel like a murder-mystery detective. Since he died, I’m trying to find clues. But there is nothing to find. I guess I’m just looking for anything; looking for evidence of him.” The McManuses have turned part of their farm into a memorial garden for Micah. It is full of colour – lots of sunflowers and zinnias and cosmos. Keri-Sue says she has decided to plant mostly annuals there, which complete their life cycle in one growing season, from germination to flowering, setting seed and dying. Annuals have a shorter lifespan, but they bloom consistently and when they flower they are bright, beautiful, unmissable. “They remind me of Micah,” she says. “He wasn’t here very long. But while he was here, he was in full bloom.” • Merope Mills is editor of the Guardian’s Saturday magazine"

          "bodyText": "The daughter of a vulnerable woman who took her own life in prison after being left without clean underwear for 10 days and denied phone calls with loved ones has called for urgent reform of England’s justice system. A jury at Avon coroner’s court concluded last week that Eastwood Park prison in Gloucestershire failed to provide for Kay Melhuish’s “basic human needs” and that neglect contributed to her death in July 2022 after “gross failings” in her care. Melhuish waited 10 days to get clean underwear until a nurse intervened. After being granted an initial phone call to her best friend, it took 16 days before she was allowed another call. Melhuish was taken into custody during an acute mental health crisis and was being held on remand. In a state of despair over access to her children, she had been arrested holding a knife to her own throat outside the place where two of her children were living with her ex-partner. The prison was aware of her history of suicide attempts and self-harm. It had also been warned that her autism coupled with complex PTSD from violence inflicted on her since childhood made the noise, use of force and loss of control in prison hard for her to cope with. Despite 11 self-harm and suicide reviews being conducted in the 19 days Melhuish spent there, a mandatory care plan with support actions was never prepared. On 4 July 2022, less than three weeks after Melhuish arrived at the prison, she was found unconscious in her cell, and she died in hospital three days later, aged 36. Officers had seen her making obvious preparations to end her life that day but did not consider putting her under constant supervision. The family say Melhuish’s case is a stark reminder of the dangers of a justice system that criminalises vulnerable women. In an interview with the Guardian, her daughter Oceana, 20, a care worker from Exeter, said: “Mum was ill, not bad. She had harmed herself and that’s a big enough red flag. She wasn’t a criminal, she was just someone that was really unwell.” A government review of sentencing is expected to consider ways to reduce the number of women in prison and will look at scrapping shorter sentences and treating more offenders in the community. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, said: “If ever a death is to prompt a radical change in the way we treat women in conflict with the law, it should be this one. I urge the prisons minister to respond to the shocking circumstances of Kay Melhuish’s case. Yet again we ask why she was ever imprisoned in the first place.” Eastwood Park was given the lowest grade for safety in a 2022 inspection, which warned about concerning gaps in care for the most vulnerable and distressed women. During her time at Eastwood Park, Melhuish was repeatedly seen cowering with her hands over her ears trying to block out noise, running into walls, punching herself and creating the means to end her own life. A communication support plan was produced by a neurodiversity specialist, who has since left and not been replaced, but the court heard that almost nobody even read it. Oceana said: “The prison did not try hard enough. They are the reason I lost my mum just before I turned 18 and I’m going to have to go through all my now adult life without my mum – all five of us kids will have to. All professionals that could have done something, made a change – literally, just given her a pair of pants or given her a phone – it just wasn’t even looked at.” Before Melhuish had even entered Eastwood Park there were warnings. She had to be cut from the Serco van having made a credible suicide attempt, and there was a letter from her psychiatrist saying prison would endanger her life. Her best friend, Cathy Goldsmith, had called ahead from court to tell the prison that Melhuish’s neurodiversity and mental health meant it was a dangerous environment for her. Melhuish arrived with none of her medication and when she was given the diazepam she relied on, the dosage was dangerously reduced. In her last call to Goldsmith she was distressed, telling her friend that she “looked like Batman” after punching herself and that her medications were all wrong. Goldsmith believes that if Melhuish had been given proper access to a phone, “she would still be here today”. The records show Melhuish trying repeatedly to call her from the prison phone but that it failed to add her number. Goldsmith said of the prison: “They’ve got blood on their hands. They were warned by professionals and by me. Kay should never have been in prison. Just shut it down and build some therapy units for these poor women.” Ceri Lloyd-Hughes, a solicitor for Melhuish’s family said: “The tragedy of Kay’s death is that it was avoidable. Two more vulnerable prisoners at Eastwood Park died self-inflicted deaths within six months of Kay. There must now be swift action to address the coroner’s concerns that similar future deaths will occur at Eastwood Park or at other prisons if things do not change.” The story of Melhuish’s eventual imprisonment is also one of missed opportunities to intervene. Her family say that when she was threatening to end her life two years earlier, police used a stun gun against her and she was sectioned. They were expecting her to be treated for 28 days, but two days later she arrived home again, still desperately unwell. Oceana said: “My mum isn’t the first and she won’t be the last if there is no change. And change obviously won’t bring back Mum, but if we can save lives in the future and save families from going through the grief that we went through, that’s as good as it can be.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Kay Melhuish. The circumstances of her tragic death are why the new government is ending the designation of prison as a ‘place of safety’ and will soon form a women’s justice board, tasked with reducing the number of women going to prison. “At HMP Eastwood Park, improvements and training have been carried out so women, especially those in the early days of custody, are better supported. More psychologists are also being recruited to help those with complex needs.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

          "headline": "Israeli airstrikes kill at least 72 across Gaza",
          "bodyText": "At least 72 people have been killed in Israeli operations across Gaza in the past day, hospital officials in the besieged territory have said, although communication difficulties in the north of the strip mean the final toll could be much higher. In the central town of Khan Younis, 38 people, including at least 13 children from the same family, were killed in airstrikes early on Friday, hospital records showed. Relatives cradled their bruised and broken bodies in the morgue of the nearby European hospital before they were buried, in some cases several children to a shroud. Other survivors sifted through the rubble of the strike, which hit the Manara neighbourhood, for belongings such as clothes and documents. Saleh al-Farra, who lost his 17-year-old brother and 15-year-old sister in the attack, said he remembered the family tried to move into the middle of the building for safety before a direct hit collapsed the structure and he passed out. “I started screaming until my brother and father came, and they started trying to get me out. I didn’t know anything about anyone,” he told the Associated Press. In a statement, the Israeli military said it had killed Palestinian gunmen in air and ground strikes in the area. Meanwhile, in northern Gaza, where Israel on 6 October launched a fierce new offensive that critics say is designed to force the remaining population to flee, internet and phone service blackouts mean it is unclear what happened in a reported Israeli airstrike overnight on a block of houses in the Jabaliya refugee camp. In a statement on Friday, the UN’s human rights chief, Volker Türk, said he believed the “darkest moment” of the war was unfolding in northern Gaza, “where the Israeli military is effectively subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation”. He said of the offensive: “Unimaginably, the situation is getting worse by the day … We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity.” In a video posted to social media late on Thursday, Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera journalist from Jabaliya, said a total of 150 people had been killed and wounded in a huge airstrike that flattened 11 buildings, although there has been almost no official account of the strike from health officials owing to Israeli ground forces and communications difficulties. The civil defence service said on Thursday it had been forced to stop operating in the area due to Israeli targeting of its crews and vehicles, and Jabaliya camp is believed to be under a total siege by Israeli ground forces. “There is no civil defence, no journalists, no coverage, and nothing but death and destruction … The wounded died without ambulances or hospitals. No one could hear or see them except God,” Sharif wrote. A civil defence spokesperson, Mahmoud Bassal, also said the death toll was believed to be 150. There was no immediate comment from the Israel Defense Forces. North Gaza’s three remaining hospitals are struggling to cope due to a near-total Israeli blockade on aid and medical equipment. On Friday, the Israeli military said it had raided Kamal Adwan hospital because of intelligence that Hamas was operating in the area. It also said it had evacuated some patients and delivered fuel and supplies to the facility, although there were conflicting reports that the delivery had been made by the World Health Organization. The hospital’s director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, said in a social media video on Thursday night that several patients had already died due to a lack of supplies and medicine such as antibiotics, and one doctor had been killed by shelling on his way to work on Wednesday. About 200 patients are estimated to be at the facility, according to the WHO. “We’re a few hours away from the death of all these people,” Abu Safiya said. “Until when will this continue? Instead of receiving aid, we receive tanks.” On Friday, the WHO said that it had lost contact with staff at the hospital. Türk called on world leaders to act on the situation in Gaza, stressing that all states were responsible under the Geneva conventions to ensure respect for international humanitarian law. “For months, I have pleaded with all parties to the conflict, as well as all states … to act to stop the carnage and destruction, to ensure the prompt and unconditional release of all hostages, and to ensure international humanitarian and international human rights law are respected,” he said. “But still this goes on and on and on.” International efforts at brokering a ceasefire in the year-long Israel-Gaza war sparked by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack are expected to resume next week, but observers say a short truce of 12 days is under discussion rather than a lasting ceasefire aimed at bringing the conflict to an end."

          "headline": "Pakistan v England: third men’s cricket Test, day two – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "That’s all from us today, thanks for your company and correspondence. I’ll be back in the early morning to bring you day three from Rawalpindi, it’ll more than likely be the last day of the series no matter what happens. Don’t miss it. Bye! What a day. England edged in front in the morning before Pakistan ground them down in the afternoon, recovering from 177 for 7 to end up with 344. A three wicket trick at the close puts the home side in a commanding position to take the series. Oh, and it’s only the end of day two! This match has rattled along. Root and Brook will start in the morning with a deficit of 53 to chip off before Pakistan have to even think about chasing. Michael Atherton still has hope for England, do you? Andrew Hill poses the question… I don’t have the brain capacity to crunch the numbers. You have to know your strengths and weaknesses in this life. “At 19/2, England need to score 102 more runs for their total runs in the second and third tests to equal their monster 823 declared from the first test. Have a test team ever scored more in one innings of a three+ match series than they have in the rest of their innings in that series?” “Runs after the fall of the sixth wicket so often determines the result of a Test match” emails Gary Naylor. “They’re usually the product of nous, belief and team spirit. England’s tally of 149 yesterday looked good, but it’s been eclipsed by Pakistan’s 189 today, not something many saw coming I suspect. Credit, then, to the much-maligned Shan Masood and Jason Gillespie, who have put their side in the box seats for a memorable win and given fans of the format yet another example of its unpredictability and charm.” Men all round the bat. Slip, leg slip and short leg breathing down Brook’s neck after Root sweeps a single. Brook gets forward and smothers the spin, something Pope failed to do to Noman last over. Brook collects two runs through the leg side and steers a single past point. The Umpires are twitchy about the light, gloaming in Rawalpindi. In fact, they knock off the bails and lead the players off. England can’t get out of there quick enough but the damage could already be done. 9th over: England 24-3 (Root 5, Brook 3) 8th over: England 20-2 (Root 3, Brook) That was the last ball of the over, here comes Harry Brook. England are clinging on here. They are probably done for already but they definitely can’t afford to lose another this evening. Pope is out! Noman gets one to loop, drift and spin, the ball taking Pope’s outside edge as he pokes out in front of his front pad, that’s what does for him, the ball hitting the glove and plopping up to slip. The side on angle shows Pope was nowhere near the pitch of the ball, Noman’ completely outwitting him with a change of pace. 7th over: England 19-2 (Pope 1, Root 3) Pope survives a probing examination from Sajid Khan. Maiden. Six dots. Deep breaths. 6th over: England 19-2 (Pope 1, Root 3) Joe Root joins Pope out in the middle, he’ll feel like he owes his side some runs here after that misjudgement in the first innings. Crikey! Root nearly goes in exactly the same way again, playing back and asking to be pinned lbw but juuuust managing to jam the bat down in time! Be still my weary ticker. Pope pushes for one into the cover. Root is shuffling back and across again, clipping for two. Can’t take your eyes of it, more importantly, neither can you, Joe. Crawley on toast! A skidder from Noman Ali thuds into Crawley’s pad bang in front. There’s no inside edge to save him and a review is burned trying to find one. England in trouble. Trouble Trouble Trouble. 5th over: England 15-1 (Crawley 2, Pope 0) The beleaguered Ollie Pope joins Crawley in the middle. You could cut the atmosphere with a rusty spoon. Pope survives the four remaining balls. Wicket maiden from Sajid. Brilliant bowling from Sajid who spears the first ball in and then follows up with a slower ball that loops and drops, beating Duckett on the inside edge and slamming into his pads. The umpire says not out but Pakistan are convinced! Rightly so – the DRS shows the ball was smacking into middle stump. Duckett has to go! 4th over: England 15-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 12) A probing maiden from Noman Ali. Flight and guile. Feel the tension. 3rd over: England 15-0 (Crawley 2, Duckett 12) Sweep x 2! Sajid Khan back into the attack after one over from Saim Ayub. Ben Duckett drops to his knees and plays back to sweeps to get back to back fours! 2nd over: England 5-0 (Crawley 1, Duckett 3) Crawley stands tall and drives off the back foot for a single through cover. Duckett then gets out the sweep and picks up two runs to deep square leg. 1st over: England 1-0 (Crawley 0, Duckett 0) Saim Ayub is opening the bowling, Shan Masood getting funky! Noman Ali and Sajid Khan absolutely livid no doubt. England’s third innings gets underway with a Zak Crawley leg bye. Noman is going to bowl the second over, spindly shadows stretching over the outfield. This will be a real test for England. Here come Crawley and Duckett… buckle up. Bowled him with the googly! Rehan finishes with 4-66 and England drag their weary weary limbs from the field. The last few hours have been punishing for Stokes and his men, they now have a tricky hour to face with the bat before the close. They need to wipe off 77 runs before they can start to make their opponents sweat. 96th over: Pakistan 337-9 (Sajid Khan 41, Zahid Mahmood 0) Atkinson takes his metaphorical sweater after getting the breakthrough. Zahid Mahmood is the last man in, I dare say Sajid is going to open his shoulders here… The end of an epic innings! Atkinson gets the breakthrough with a short ball, Saud in two minds whether to pull or not and ends up plinking a simple catch to midwicket. What a knock, entered the fray at 46-3 and departs nearly a day later with a century to his name and having hauled his side to a lead of 70 runs on a tricky pitch. Well batted Saud Shakeel. Advantage Pakistan! 95th over: Pakistan 333-8 (Saud 131, Sajid Khan 39) Pakistan lead by 66 as three runs are pilfered off Jack Leach. Gus Atkinson is coming on to try and bust out a wicket for England. 94th over: Pakistan 330-8 (Saud 131, Sajid Khan 39) Things have calmed down after the pongoing of a few overs ago. Rehan gets through another over with two singles worked off it. 93rd over: Pakistan 328-8 (Saud 130, Sajid Khan 38) Leach continues, Saud and Sajid work the gaps and scamper runs, the lead stretches to 61. This partnership have added 63 runs in ten overs. Ben Stokes has his field spread, not a catcher in sight. It’s not often you see that, England firmly on the defensive, trying to limit the damage. 92nd over: Pakistan 324-8 (Saud 127, Sajid Khan 36) Well bowled Rehan Ahmed, just a single off his latest over. England licking their wounds in Rawalpindi. Meanwhile… 91st over: Pakistan 323-8 (Saud 127, Sajid Khan 36) What.A.Shot! Sajid plays an in-to-out lofted drive to a Jack Leach length ball and blasts over cover for a flat four. Bugle sounds. Stand and Deliver! Crank up Adam Ant. Pakistan lead by 56 runs 90th over: Pakistan 317-8 (Saud 126, Sajid Khan 31) Bashir is spared another by Stokes but England’s captain chooses to thrust young Rehan Ahmed’s feet to the fire instead. The leggie does well to get out of the over for just a couple. I’m worn out, Pakistan’s lead stretches past fifty, it’s been high octane stuff post tea. 89th over: Pakistan 315-8 (Saud 125, Sajid Khan 30) Leach does well to keep a lid on things, just two runs off the over as Saud tells Sajid to take a breath and not try to hit every single ball. Twenty more minutes of this and England will be dead and buried. 88th over: Pakistan 313-8 (Saud 124, Sajid Khan 29) Sajid Khan is destroying his fellow off-spinner in Rawalpindi! Six runs clattered over Ben Duckett at mid on… and again SIX MORE. Bashir is wide eyed, the game and series on the line and he’s being well and truly targeted. Four more! Sajid cuts a short ball away to the fence. Fantastic hitting, England are hurting here, NINETEEN runs off the over. The entire complexion of this match has shifted – Pakistan lead by 47 runs. 87th over: Pakistan 294-8 (Saud 123, Sajid Khan 11) More pain for England as Leach leaks thirteen runs off his over! Saud Shakeel gets in on the act and swipes through midwicket for four, that’s his first boundary in 108 deliveries! 86th over: Pakistan 281-8 (Saud 113, Sajid Khan 9) Pakistan still have to bat last on this surface so runs in front will be crucial. That’ll help! Sajid Khan smears Bashir down the ground for SIX. He can be dangerous with the bat and every run hurts England. More runs are scampered and eleven runs are collected off the over. 85th over: Pakistan 270-8 (Saud 110, Sajid Khan 1) Saud knocks Jack Leach’s first ball post tea into the leg side for a couple to give Pakistan a lead on first innings. A single brings Sajid Khan on strike and he’s content to pat back the rest of the over. Here come the players post tea. Scores level. Series on the line. What more could you possibly ask for this Autumnal Friday morning? Jeremy Boyce seems to be clamouring for Harry Brook to turn his arm over: “It seems to me this is a situation crying out for someone who can send down a few sets of head-scrambling concentration-testing Dermot Reeve-styled Dibbly-Dobblers, harnessing the unpredictability of the bowling to that of the pitch.” “I don’t like to see Geoffrey traduced.” Writes Peter Metcalfe. “At Headingley in the 1960s/70s it was quite a sight to see the great man shepherd the scores of autograph hunters into an orderly queue along the boundary before he stood there and started signing. Some signed twice over. And he signed all his books on the sales stand before they were even sold. I also treasure two appreciative letters from him, in blue Quink ink, from when he was outrageously dropped in 1967 for alleged slow scoring.” The players head off for the tea interval without a single run to split them. 84th over: Pakistan 267-8 (Saud 107, Sajid Khan 1) Gone this time! England have toiled for the breakthrough and they get it right at the end of the session. Bashir gets the new ball to skid on and Noman plays across the line on the back foot, he knows he’s done for as soon as he misses it. Brilliant knock though, helped haul his side up to parity. 83rd over: Pakistan 265-7 (Saud 106, Noman 45) Another big lbw appeal! From Leach this time but there was another big edge on it and umpire Sharfuddoula spotted it. So did England as they choose not to review. 82nd over: Pakistan 262-7 (Saud 105, Noman 44) Bashir back into the attack and goes up for a vociferous appeal to Noman Ali who misses with a sweep. Umpire Gaffaney not interested though and England opt not to review. DRS shows that it was clipping leg but would have stayed with Umpire’s call. Another appeal next ball but a big inside edge saves Noman and they scamper a couple with the ball trickling off fine. 81st over: Pakistan 257-7 (Saud 105, Noman 41) New ball but same old. Leach is worked around for six runs off his returning over. England looking flatter than Michael Flatley driving across a fjord with four flat tyres and a broken stereo. Pakistan only trail by ten runs now. Will emails in with another amusing Boycott encounter: “At Trent Bridge in the early 1990s, my friend Ed and I joined a small group of autograph hunters approaching Boycott only to be loudly berated, “Not now, I’m having me loonch!”. Still, I remember this much more vividly than the autographs we did get that day (sorry, RK Illingworth).” 80th over: Pakistan 251-7 (Saud 104, Noman 38) Root rattles through his over, Saud flicks a couple then drives his 72nd single to keep the strike. The new ball is due and has been taken. Aptly, Jack ‘The Nut’ Leach is going to have first use of it. A clip into the leg side off Rehan Ahmed brings Saud a brilliant century. He raises his bat nonchalantly whilst Noman goes gangbusters with his celebration. Arms everywhere, lovely to see. Saud has kept his side in this match and could well tilt the scales in Pakistan’s favour if he stays out there for another half an hour or so. England’s lead is down to just 19 runs. 79th over: Pakistan 248-7 (Saud 101, Noman 38) 78th over: Pakistan 243-7 (Saud 98, Noman 36) Joe Root replaces Bashir and nearly gets a wicket first ball! Root gets one to spit off the wicket and take the shoulder of Noman’s bat, the edge looping just out of reach of Stokes at slip. Noman works Root for a single but gets a ticking off for running down the middle of the wicket, that’s his second warning. Naughty boy. 77th over: Pakistan 241-7 (Saud 97, Noman 35) Noman Ali sweeps Rehan hard to the square leg fence for four! Eeeesht! Nearly a run out next ball as Noman jabs to point and calls Saud for a run, Stokes swoops and peels off a fast and hard throw at the stumps, missing by a few inches. Noman would have been gone too. Stokes wipes his brow with his cap and allows himself a rueful grin. 76th over: Pakistan 235-7 (Saud 96, Noman 30) Saud cuts Bashir for two and then picks up a couple more with a clip off his legs. He goes to within one blow of a Test ton, he’s only hit four boundaries all innings mind. This is Pakistan’s highest partnership of the innings. 75th over: Pakistan 230-7 (Saud 91, Noman 30) Rehan flights a few, Saud and Noman nudge and nurdle, taking the runs on offer. 74th over: Pakistan 227-7 (Saud 89, Noman 29) The fifty partnership is up for Saud and Noman Ali. Pakistan very much in this game. England’s lead down to 40 runs. Bubbling up in Rawalpindi as the incongruous tubthumps of Chumbawumba burst out of the stadium PA system (Tannoy is a brand name, you knew that though). “Hi Jim, given what’s happening in Pune, have New Zealand fired up the patio heaters in Wellington? Has cricket changed forever?\" Jake – emailing from the classroom - this tour fits well with the teaching day” Are you hiding in a store cupboard or brazenly emailing in in front of a classroom of kids? New Zealand going well in Pune, a first Test win on Indian soil on the cards… 73rd over: Pakistan 225-7 (Saud 88, Noman 28) Noman Ali smears Rehan over mid on for SIX! Confident shot and more frustration for England. Well bowled – a good response from the young leggie who rips one on a length, he’s been a bit too short in this brief spell. Time for a drink. 72nd over: Pakistan 215-7 (Saud 87, Noman 19) England burn a review as Bashir replaces Atkinson and Noman Ali tries to sweep a straight ball but connects only with fresh air. It looked outside the line on first glance and so it proved on DRS. England looking slightly frustrated by this partnership, wounding memories of Pakistan’s wagging tail in the second Test at Multan creeping back into the noodle no doubt. The partnership between this pair is up to 39 runs in 14 overs. 71st over: Pakistan 211-7 (Saud 86, Noman 16) Rehan struggles to find his length and is easily worked around for five singles. Pakistan trail by 56 runs. “On the subject of meeting famous cricketers, I was at a Test match with my Dad at the Oval in the late 80s when I was about 10 years old. As we were heading down the stairs between overs to get a drink, a kindly looking West Indian gentleman was walking up the other way. He paused and looked at me smiling, presumably waiting for me to ask him for his autograph. Alas at that stage in my cricketing education I didn’t recognise the greatest all rounder in history, so I smiled back and then edged round him and headed down the stairs. I only realised who he was when I saw his autobiography in the shop later that day.” It’s good to keep these guys on their toes, Tom Barnes. KLANG. I met Sobers a few years ago. Are you daft? Of course I asked him about Malcolm Nash: 70th over: Pakistan 206-7 (Saud 84, Noman 13) Atkinson stitches together a maiden, shaved scalp glistening with sweat under the afternoon sun. Hard yakka. Rehan Ahmed is being summoned, he was the star of the morning session. Can he prise another one out for England? He’s got real chutzpah, watching him bowl is a joy. 69th over: Pakistan 206-7 (Saud 84, Noman 13) Five singles collected off Bashir with a minimum of fuss. England’s lead being whittled away. Mark Lewis is indulging in a bit of chaos theory this Friday morning. “Morning Jim, On meeting your heroes… In early summer of ‘05, a friend of mine was living in Cardiff. During a morning jog, he bumped into Simon Jones, who was running towards him, likely still recuperating from his latest injury. Spotting Jones, my friend mentioned a nasty pothole on his side of the road and warned him to be careful approaching it. “We need you fit for the First Test!” he added. Jones missed the pothole, stayed fit, and the rest is history. My pal claims he basically won us the urn that year...” Say thanks from me, Mark. Imagine a life without this – gudddunk! 68th over: Pakistan 201-7 (Saud 81, Noman 11) Thanks Rob and hello all. Engrossing Test cricket right here, Pakistan trail by 69 runs on first innings and Saud is well set. We could be in for a one innings shoot out to decide the series. Err yes please. Gus Atkinson slams a few into the guts of the pitch, England have gone to a short ball policy it seems – Pope is fielding very close in at silly cover. Lid firmly in place to protect his cherubic features. Noman rolls the wrists and collects a single to take Pakistan past 200. Right, that’s it from me for today and indeed the series. Jim will be with you for the rest of the day. Thanks again for your company, emails, rants and riffs. See you for the West Indies white-ball games. 67th over: Pakistan 198-7 (Saud 78, Noman 10) Sharfuddoula made two howlers yesterday but that decision, though incorrect, was fair enough – it looked out in real time. Noman is not out! Indeed he did, a gossamer thin inside edge onto the pad. REVIEW! Noman given out LBW to Bashir It looked good, though the certainty with which Noman reviewed suggests he may have hit it. It’s tea in Pune, where New Zealand are 85 for 2. Will Young fell to Ravichandran Ashwin for 25 but the captain Tom Latham is still there on 37. Their lead is 188. 66th over: Pakistan 197-7 (Saud 78, Noman 10) Saud takes a single off the first ball, almost with England’s blessing as it means Atkinson has the chance to bowl five at Noman. The second zips past the edge; the rest are defended solidly. For a No9, Noman has an impressive technique and temperament. “Having finished reading the masterly tome The Art of Captaincy a few days previously, I bumped into Mike Brearley in the middle of Manchester,” writes Ian Wild. “He accosted me with the words: ‘Do you know where I can find the Piccadilly Hotel?’ I said, ‘Wow, you’re Mike Brearley!’ He said a little testily, ‘Yes. Do you know the whereabouts of The Piccadilly Hotel?’ I said ‘No’, and he walked on rather abruptly. Next time I was in Manchester, I saw we had been only a couple of hundred yards away from the massive Piccadilly. Still my hero.” 65th over: Pakistan 196-7 (Saud 77, Noman 10) Saud threads Bashir nicely between the two men at short extra. Only a single but it was a classy shot from a player who has made a mockery of all the low scores. He’s given only one chance, a really tough one to Jamie Smith on 20something. “May have shared this before but my first meeting with a hero stays with me,” says Pete Salmon. “Waited in the foyer of the Hilton Hotel across from the MCG when I was nine in 1979. Ian Chappell, 53 not out overnight on his way to 75, came striding towards me. I held out my autograph book, but Chappell didn’t break stride, just said to me ‘F*** off mate, f*** off’ and kept going. Never felt so grown up - Chappelli had called me mate and told me to f*** off!” The innocence of a child. Had that happened at 29 it would have been terrifying. I had the chance of interview Chappelli in early 2013; it was only over the phone but I was still genuinely fearful. He couldn’t have been nicer or more interesting. He even asked me if this new lad Joe Root was any good; for once I gave the right answer. 64th over: Pakistan 194-7 (Saud 76, Noman 9) Weird game, cricket. In the first two Tests England’s second-choice spinner was their biggest threat and now the third choice is doing the job. Or rather he was. Gus Atkinson is on for Rehan Ahmed, who is possibly being saved for 10 and Jack. As Athers says on Sky, Noman Ali played Rehan well just before lunch; Rehan also looks more dangerous to the right-handers. Anyway, Atkinson to Noman, with one slip and a couple of men on the drive. An attempted bouncer from Atkinson doesn’t get up at all and whooshes just past the tumps with Noman starting to take evasive action. “Your mention of Boycott’s ruthlessly efficient way of dealing with autograph hunters reminds me of the time I bumped into Brian Johnston at Lord’s,” begins Phil Withall. “It was at a village cup final sometime in the early nineties, he was barrelling along, greeting all and sundry with a happy wave and a pleasant nod. After signing my match ticket he ploughed on ‘having places to be’, yet it still felt meaningful. As if he really appreciated the request, the recognition. A truly unique and wonderful man.” 63rd over: Pakistan 191-7 (Saud 75, Noman 8) Five singles form Bashir’s over, although one ball almost sneaked through to hit Noman in front. “With the Test series likely to be concluded tomorrow, there are some very important questions for this England team,” says Phil Russell. “Namely ‘Where is the nearest golf course?’ and ‘Can we get 18 holes in before it gets dark?’ I presume that Jimmy Anderson will be tasked with sorting this out. Can’t imagine he’s got much to do as fast bowling coach beyond advising Atkinson to bowl at the stumps and wait for one to keep low.” Haven’t you heard? They’ve made him the official reverse-sweep mentor. Right then, the players are back on the field in Rawalpindi. Shoaib Bashir will start, though I’d have been tempted to give Gus Atkinson a couple of overs at Noman Ali. New Zealand are racing along in Pune. They’re 78 for 1 after only 18 overs, a lead of 181. Like the man said. “I remember as a 10-year-old at Hove in the late 1950s, I asked for Jim Parks’ signature, and he shooed me away with ‘not now, I’m busy’,” writes Dr Roger Luther. “ It made a lasting impression, as you can see. ”On the subject of Sussex wicketkeepers. in more recent years I used to take my dad, in his 90s, to a cafe in Rottingdean where we regularly met Rupert Webb and his lovely wife Babs. He was a great chap, very easy to talk to, now buried at the church in Rottingdean where Stanley Baldwin got married and Simon Cowell didn’t (good quiz question!).” Pune update New Zealand are 59 for 1, a lead of 162, with the tantalising chance of an historic series victory. I think it’s a done deal, although I guess you never know with a team as great as India. “On the subject of ‘You should never meet your heroes’,” begins Finbar Anslow. “My modest rebuttals would be Vic Marks (a polite handshake in the Oval car park) and Plaistow Patricia (sitting on the banks of a small river in the Piedmontese mountains).” This reminds me of an amusing scene at The Oval in 2011. Geoffrey Boycott was signing a load of autographs, at which point some guy in his thirties started fawning over him: ‘Geoffrey you were my dad’s favourite player’, etc, etc. The guy was mid-sentence when Boycott barked imperiously: ‘Pen!’ At least Geoffrey signed it to be fair. I’ve heard a couple of stories of England greats telling kids where to stick their autograph book. Today’s lunch break is a full hour to allow for Friday prayers, so play will resume at 9.30am BST. “I find it fascinating that for all of the thrilling adventure of Bazball England still are unwilling to stick their head above the parapet and take a gamble on the excitement a legspinner can bring as their only spin option,” says Tom Van der Gucht. “Instead, we remain obsessed with the safety net that a finger spinner brings by holding an end up. Perhaps the final Rubicon that Morgan crossed with the ODI team through backing Rashid that allowed them to fully achieve greatness that McCullum and Stokes haven’t yet taken. Show them what you’re made of, Rehan.” I might be wrong – it’s hardly without precedent – but I don’t think it’s that. They fast-tracked Rehan when he was 18 and, don’t forget, brought him into an Ashes squad as well. I suspect it’s simply that they think Bashir (who is also an extremely brave selection) is a better bowler and, crucially, more likely to succeed in Australia. There’s also a greater duty of care to young legspinners. England don’t ask Bashir to hold an end up because they know he can’t, not at this stage of his career; they also picked Moeen Ali as an attacking option when Leach was injured for the Ashes. (Even if, weirdly enough, the series turned on a very tight spell from Moeen at Headingley.) If England were playing it safe they’d have picked Liam Dawson, whose form with bat and ball in the last few years is spectacular. England lead by 80 runs after another compelling session. They looked vulnerable at 151 for 4, only for the 20-year-old Rehan Ahmed to take three key wickets in a mischievous spell of legspin. Saud Shakeel is still there, having batted in a bubble to make a splendid 72 not out, so England aren’t guaranteed a first-innings lead. But they’d have taken this position at the start of play, and especially when Pakistan were 151 for 4. 62nd over: Pakistan 187-7 (Saud 71, Noman 6) Noman doesn’t mind hitting out just before the interval. He blasts Rehan back over his head for an emphatic boundary – it almost went for six – and then turns the final ball of the session just short of leg slip. 61st over: Pakistan 182-7 (Saud 71, Noman 2) Saud trusts Noman, who made a vital 32 in the first innings at Multan, and is still batting in his bubble. He’ll have to open his shoulders at some stage but it’s never going to happen on the stroke of lunch. 60th over: Pakistan 179-7 (Saud 69, Noman 1) Rehan teases Noman with his variations: googly, legbreak, over and around the wicket. A late defensive stroke from Noman denies Rehan a plumb LBW; he has to settle for a second successive maiden. 58th over: Pakistan 179-7 (Saud 69, Noman 1) With the left-handed Noman in at No9, Stokes brings back Shoaib Bashir. A quiet over, two from it. In Pune, Mitchell Santner has taken 7 for 53 and India have been bowled out for 156. They trail New Zealand by 103 runs on a Bunsen and are facing an historic series defeat. 58th over: Pakistan 177-7 (Saud 68, Noman 0) A wicket maiden for Rehan, who has bowled a thrilling spell of 6-1-19-3. Rehan Ahmed has blown this game open. Aamer Jamal fiddled indecisively at a googly and deflected the ball back onto his stumps. He goes for 14 and England lead by 90 on a wearing pitch. Rehan whips through another over. Jamal is straining to get outside the line so that he can’t be LBW even if he doesn’t pick the googly. Bowled looks more likely – and that’s exactly what’s happened! 57th over: Pakistan 177-6 (Saud 68, Jamal 14) Jamal is beaten by Leach for the second time in as many overs. Pakistan are still picking up singles fairly easily but there isn’t quite the same sense of permanance they had during the Saud/Rizwan partnership. 56th over: Pakistan 174-6 (Saud 67, Jamal 12) From nowhere Saud charges Rehan, has a filthy mow across the line and edges the ball over the head of Stokes at slip. A leading edge from Jamal runs through point for another single. Rehan could easily have dismissed all four batters he has bowled at today. 55th over: Pakistan 169-6 (Saud 63, Jamal 10) Jamal has started with intent. He rocks back to cuff Leach past mid-on for four, an unusual but beautifully played stroke. Leach hasn’t been at his best today, though the next ball is spot on and goes past the outside edge. Meanwhile, in Pune… Mitchell Santner has taken six wickets and India, despite a typically defiant counter-attack from Ravindra Jadeja, are in the malodorous stuff like you would not believe: 142 for 9, still 117 runs behind. 54th over: Pakistan 164-6 (Saud 62, Jamal 6) A shortish delivery from Rehan is forced into the leg side for a couple by Jamal, who then hacks a single behind square on the leg side. “Looks like the England selectors have struck gold by including Rehan Ahmed in the trio of spinners,” says Colum Fordham. “He is clearly the X-factor - low action, brisk pace, sharply turning googly - that is unsettling the Pakistan batsmen who are more used to the slow left arm/offspin combination of Leach and Bashir. Great to see Rehan smile, encouraged by his captain, injecting the young leggie with confidence. Good on Stokes!” 53rd over: Pakistan 159-6 (Saud 61, Jamal 3) Saud Shakeel is batting beautifully and doesn’t need to come out of his bubble just yet, although he will if he’s still at the crease when Pakistan are eight down. Three from Leach’s over; for once he’s the support act to Rehan Ahmed. 52nd over: Pakistan 156-6 (Saud 60, Jamal 1) Jamal inside-edges his first ball, another terrific googly, in the air but wide of short leg. Salman is out! A huge double breakthrough from Rehan Ahmed! Salman pushed defensively down the wrong line at a lovely delivery that straightened to hit him on the back thigh. Bounce isn’t going to save him… and it’s umpire’s call on line! It’s been reviewed and might be missing off, though my hunch is umpire’s call. 51st over: Pakistan 152-5 (Saud 58, Salman 0) Leach replaces Bashir, presumably with the right-handed Salman in mind. He’s been Pakistan’s best batter in this series, averaging 87, but he looks a little nervous at the start of his innings. 50th over: Pakistan 151-5 (Saud 57, Salman 0) So close to another wicket! A beautiful googly from Rehan keeps low and is just kept out by the new batter Salman, who then gets a leading edge when trying to whip across the line. They’ve got the wicket! A beaming Rehan Ahmed has struck with his ninth ball of the day. Rizwan reached out to sweep, missed and was hit on the back thigh. The LBW was given on the field and, though Rizwan reviewed, the ball would have hit off and middle a third of the way up. 49th over: Pakistan 149-4 (Saud 57, Rizwan 23) Rizwan pushes Bashir for a single to bring up an initiative-seizing fifty partnership in less than 13 overs. Time for drinks. England aren’t in trouble but they do need a wicket. 48th over: Pakistan 147-4 (Saud 56, Rizwan 22) Now then, Rehan Ahmed is on for Gus Atkinson. You’d imagine Rizwan will target him, although there’s no real scope to do so during a decent first over. One wider delivery keeps a bit low and is steered for a single by Rizwan, one of three in the over. “Crawley feels like one of those players who will always have a question mark handing over him in the minds of the public,” says Will Vignoles. “Might be wrong but I remember Ian Bell having the same issue until the 2013 Ashes. For Crawley, he was as you pointed out fantastic against Australia and India, has averaged 46 or so in the past 18 months, is part of what is statistically and on entertainment value England’s best opening partnership since Andrew Strauss’s retirement started this whole mess and yet people still want him gone. Duckett may have become the main man, particularly in the subcontinent, but there’s a lot of value in Crawley still. Pope, less so sadly.” One thing that helps Pope is that there’s no obvious replacement at No3. If he was batting, say, No5 I think he’d more vulnerable. 47th over: Pakistan 144-4 (Saud 54, Rizwan 21) 46th over: Pakistan 143-4 (Saud 53, Rizwan 21) There’s no movement for Atkinson, and no prospect of reverse swing, so his biggest weapon is uneven bounce. I don’t think any deliveries have really kept low today; maybe that’s because the ball is a bit older. A series of gunbarrel-straight deliveries are repelled by Rizwan and there’s one from the over. Atkinson’s figures today are 4-0-10-0. He’ll probably have one more. 45th over: Pakistan 142-4 (Saud 52, Rizwan 21) Saud sweeps Bashir firmly for four to bring up a terrific half-century from 92 balls. He was missed by Jamie Smith in the 20s but has otherwise played with an eyecatching assurance. In an ideal world Ben Stokes would save Rehan Ahmed for the tail but he may need to gamble soon because Pakistan are cruising along. This pair have added 40 in the last eight overs with few alarms. 44th over: Pakistan 135-4 (Saud 46, Rizwan 20) Atkinson continues to target the stumps in the hope that one will shoot through. Rizwan gets a thick inside edge that bounces safely on the leg side, then pushes Atkinson down the ground for a couple. He’s playing superbly and is becoming a pain in England’s hindquarters. “Any sign of Joe Root warming up?” asks Jeremy Boyce. Nope! “Given his rare failure with the bat yesterday I’m sure he’s itching to make up for the lapse. Actually, this seems to be the perfect occasion and pitch for some of Dermot Reeve’s dibbly-dobbly mash up.” 43rd over: Pakistan 133-4 (Saud 46, Rizwan 18) Bashir replaces Leach and is swept deftly for three by Saud; it should have been two but there was an overthrow after a poor return from Rehan. Three singles make it six from the over in total. Rizwan has put England under pressure and runs are starting to come more easily. 42nd over: Pakistan 127-4 (Saud 42, Rizwan 16) Rizwan continues his invaluable counter-attack by clipping Atkinson through midwicket for three. His busy positivity makes him a particularly dangerous player in low-scoring games. “Can we bring in Foakes, bat Smith and drop Pope and Crawley,” says Alisdair Gould. “Foakes catches and offers variety of mind as a batsman. Smith is our current hero. Lance Pope and Crawley as the last act prior to the Ashes? The indulgence towards both must stop.” In fairness, Crawley was England’s best player against the two best teams in the world. I can’t see him being dropped, especially as his game should be perfect for Australian conditions. Pope remains an interesting and slightly confusing case. Also, Lance Pope sounds like an erratic 6ft 8in left-arm quick from Tasmania. The Rizwan effect. Pakistan scored 26 in 12.2 overs before he arrived; they’ve added 24 in 5.4 since then. 41st over: Pakistan 123-4 (Saud 41, Rizwan 13) Leach hasn’t looked particularly threatening today and is swept decisively for four by Saud; a reminder that he was missed on by 27 by Jamie Smith, a tough chance standing up. 40th over: Pakistan 117-4 (Saud 36, Rizwan 12) Gus Atkinson comes into the attack, a logical move given how well these two batters play spin. When he offers a bit of width, Rizwan opens the face to glide the ball for four. Nicely done. He has changed the tempo of the innings already. 39th over: Pakistan 112-4 (Saud 35, Rizwan 8) Blimey. Out of nothing, after a series of exaggerated defensive strokes and leaves, Rizwan slog-sweeps Leach for six. So much for it being a high-risk shot; he absolutely nailed that. “What is unfolding in Pune ( my home for 7 years) is even more tantalising than this game,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “New Zealand are to cricket what Roger Federer is to tennis and Armand Duplantis to pole vault. Loved by all, even opponents.” It’s a long morning session, two and a half hours, the players are taking the first drinks break. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 103-7 (Ashwin LBW b Santner 4) Can’t spake. 38th over: Pakistan 105-4 (Saud 34, Rizwan 2) Stokes must be really tempted to give Atkinson a couple of overs before Rizwan settles. He’s much better against spin and had a torrid time against Brydon Carse in the first two Tests. Against that, the ball is doing plenty, particularly for Bashir. He beats Saud with another lovely delivery that dips and grips. Meanwhile… Watch: Bashir gets Shan with a beauty 37th over: Pakistan 102-4 (Saud 32, Rizwan 2) A reverse sweep from Saud is anticipated and then stopped by the diving Stokes, a terrific bit of fielding. One run can make the difference. Saud gets it past Stokes later in the over to bring up Pakistan’s hundred. Rizwan plays a defensive stroke and then waves at the heavens, possibly because the drone camera was too close. He gets off the mark by sweeping Leach for two; England won’t mind him playing that shot. “Dude,” says Ben Bernards, “can you stop trying to jinx us (NZ) and prompt an Indian revival!?” I’m just here for the Freudian slips. Sounds like India have some awful shots today. 36th over: Pakistan 99-4 (Saud 32, Rizwan 0) The arrival of Mohammad Rizwan means a left/right-hand combination for Pakistan. You’d expect him to be a lot busier and try to put pressure back on England. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 95-6 (Sarfaraz c O’Rourke b Santner 11) The scene of all scenes in Pune: India are still 164 behind, on a Bunsen, knowing defeat means a first home series loss in 12 years. Beautiful bowling from Shoaib Bashir! He’s got Shan Masood exactly the same way as he did in the second innings in Multan, turning one sharply to take the edge as Shan closed the face. Pope, very close at gully, took a really sharp catch. There may be doubts over Pope’s batting but by flip he is a brilliant close fielder. 35th over: Pakistan 99-3 (Shan 26, Saud 32) Leach has a couple of slightly better LBW shouts against Shakeel. Still not out though; it’s going to be very difficult for him to get LBWs from over the wicket with the ball turning so much. “After the women became World T20 champions on Sunday, New Zealand continues to amaze, Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Population 5 million. I still get misty eyed thinking about the incredible dignity and generosity of spirit they showed after the most heartbreaking of defeats to England at Lord’s in 2019.” 34th over: Pakistan 99-3 (Shan 26, Saud 32) A low-risk single brings up an excellent fifty partnership comprised largely of low-risk singles. Five runs from Bashir’s over, three singles and a two. England need… something. 33rd over: Pakistan 94-3 (Shan 23, Saud 30) There’s an argument – there are quiet a few – that England cocked up real bad before lunch yesterday, and that if Pakistan bet sensibly, with a nice straight bat, they can eke out a decisive first-innings lead. Ach, who knows. The only certainty is that Pakistan are 173 runs behind. Freudian slip of the day 32nd over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 22, Saud 29) Bashir makes it back-to-back maidens, and tjhough England haven’t taken a wicket they do at least have control of the scoreboard: in nine overs this morning there have been only 19 runs. WICKET ELSEWHERE! India 83-5 (Pant b Phillips 18) Look, we can’t ignore this. New Zealand could be heading for their first ever series victory in India, who are in all sorts on a pitch that is only going to get worse. 31st over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 22, Saud 29) Leach, back over the wicket, has a hopeful LBW appeal against Shan turned down by the umpire Sharfudduola. He was outside the line and there might have been an inside edge as well. That aside, it was plumb. It’s also an important day for Sharfudduola, who made a couple of strange howlers in the final session yesterday. Both were corrected by DRS but it’ll surely be playing on his mind. 30th over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan 21, Saud 30) Bashir beats Shan with a near perfect delivery that pitches on middle and growls past the edge. He’s been England’s main threat in the first 25 minutes. Meanwhile, this is one of the reasons Gus Atkinson will be needed today. 29th over: Pakistan 90-3 (Shan 21, Saud 28) It didn’t take Leach long to move around the wicket to the left-handers, an angle that has brought him quite a lot of joy in this series. But Pakistan are playing him well this morning, dealing exclusively in defensive strokes and low-risk singles. 28th over: Pakistan 87-3 (Shan 20, Saud 27) Saud has been dropped by Smith off Bashir. That could be a big moment. It was a tough chance, a big deflection from a leading edge, and it hit Smith on the shinpad. Risk and reward department: Ben Foakes couldn’t have played that magnificent innings yesterday, but he would probably have taken that chance. Thanks to Russ Whedon for sending the TMS overseas link. “This series has definitely exceeded expectations measured on the Bazball ‘entertainment first’ scale, hasn’t it?” says Russ. It surely has. The evolution will be complete next winter when Stokes announces before the first Ashes Test that he couldn’t give a stuff about entertaininment or saving Test cricket, he just want to bring the urn home. 27th over: Pakistan 82-3 (Shan 18, Saud 23) Erm, folks, something historic may be unfolding in Pune. New Zealand 259 India 72/4 (Jaiswal has just surrendered to Glenn Phillips’ golden arm) 26th over: Pakistan 81-3 (Shan 18, Saud 22) Saud cuts Bashir very nicely for four. He’s a real threat to England today, an outstanding player of spin, and I half expected Gus Atkinson to start at Leach’s end because of that. Shan looks less comfortable against Bashir and edges short of Stokes at slip. He pushed with hard hands and the ball still landed well short. “While waiting for play to start I’ve been reading Walter Isaacson’s marvellous biography of Steve Jobs,” writes Kim Thonger. “Jobs had a habit of creating a reality distortion field around himself, in which he would bend truth just enough to win any argument. This strikes me as the same approach really good spin bowlers take. The batsman is never quite sure what’s real and what’s trickery. There is no mention yet of Jobs turning out for the Cupertino XI on Sundays, but maybe Walter is keeping it up his sleeve for the closing chapters.” The old zootermeister, Shane Warne, was so good at that. There’s a brilliant passage in Kevin Pietersen’s book, On Cricket, about how Warne worked over both the batters and the umpires. 25th over: Pakistan 76-3 (Shan 18, Saud 17) The one advantage of batting second on a wearing pitch is that you can learn from the opposition’s first innings. England lost five wickets before they twigged that the sweep is a high-risk shot on such a slow, low pitch, and since then the batters on both sides have generally played with a straight bat. Jack Leach’s first over is a quiet, exploratory affair; two singles from it. 24th over: Pakistan 74-3 (Shan 17, Saud 16) A lovely start from Bashir, whose first ball curves onto middle stump and straightens sharply. Shan does pretty well to drop a thick edge just short of Pope, who is very close and under the helmet at gully. Shan gets another thick edge later in the over, this time all along the ground. He’s definitely a candidate for an edge playing against the spin. The players are ready for action in Rawalpindi. In other news, Virat Kohli has just been bowled by a full toss and India are in a bit of bother against New Zealand in Pune. If New Zealand win the second Test they’ll become the first team to win a series in India since England 12 years ago. Here, have you heard this? It might just be one of the greatest debut singles in the history of forever. “As you ease yourself into the new day, an interesting innings by Western Australia has just unfolded in the Australian one-day competition,” says Phil Withall. “Somehow they managed to lose eight wickets for one run, being bowled out for just 53. Spectacular achievement I’m sure you’ll agree...” Amazing! I completely missed that. It reminds me a little bit of that astonishing Surrey collapse against Lancashire in 1993, which in some ways was even worse because they were so close to victory. Read Ali Martin on Adam Gilchr Jamie Smith Over the course of his sparkling 89 he once again showed the class and composure that marks him out as a player of considerable promise. Victim to a couple of rash yahoos in the second Test, Smith was content to first take a look, soaking up 32 balls for nine runs and playing chiefly with a straight bat. Unlike a couple of colleagues higher up, the 24-year-old appeared to trust his defence. Scorecard aficionados, this one’s for you Read Simon Burnton’s report on day one From the sport that once brought you leg theory, this was more like chaos theory. Before this week nobody knew what you would get if you spent the buildup to a game roasting the pitch in a makeshift fan oven. It turns out the answer is wickets, 13 of them falling on an opening day of drama and frequent befuddlement. This is the day, folks. By 1pm BST/5pm PKT we should have a strong idea who is going to win this intriguing series. For now it remains too close to call with any certainty. Pakistan will resume on 73 for 3, a deficit of 194 on a pitch that has had all the bounce and pace baked out of it. The case for England is that they have runs on the board on a pitch that could go at any moment; the case for Pakistan is that, in England’s first innings, batting became less uncomfortable after around 35 overs as the ball started to age. Pakistan’s innings is 23 overs old, which means only one thing: Big First Hour coming up. Really big."

          "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has opened the door to non-financial reparations for the UK’s role in the transatlantic enslavement, as he came under pressure from Commonwealth leaders to engage in a “meaningful, truthful and respectful” conversation about Britain’s past. While Downing Street insists that the wider issue of reparations is “not on the agenda” of this week’s Commonwealth heads of government (Chogm) gathering in Samoa, No 10 has accepted it is likely to be referenced in the end-of-summit communique. Caribbean countries in particular have been pushing for the issue to be discussed at the summit, with some arguing that continued resistance from the UK to even begin a conversation about the issue was not sustainable. While No 10 is still ruling out paying reparations or apologising for the UK’s role in the transatlantic slave trade, a Downing Street source indicated that the UK could support some forms of reparatory justice, such as restructuring financial institutions and providing debt relief. “There is a general sense that these multilateral institutions give out loans to developing countries then charge large interest rates for repayments,” the source said. The source added that reforming financial situations was something the UK often took a lead on and that this was a form of reparatory justice that would not come at a cost to UK taxpayers. Other proposed forms of restorative justice include making a formal apology, running educational programmes, establishing cultural institutions and providing economic and public health support. However, Downing Street has ruled out an immediate apology. Starmer told the BBC Thursday night: “Our generation can say the slave trade and the practice was abhorrent and we should talk about our history. We can’t change our history but we should certainly talk about our history.” Pressed on whether the UK should apologise or pay reparations, the prime minister said: “An apology has already been made in relation to the slave trade, and that’s not surprising.” But he insisted that Commonwealth countries wanted to talk about challenges for the future including climate finance and international trade. Responding to Starmer’s decision to discuss “non-financial” reparations, the St Vincent and the Grenadines prime minister, Ralph Gonsalves – who was one of the founding leaders of the current reparations committee – stressed the importance of a reparative justice plan that addressed the enduring psychological and socioeconomic impact of slavery. Arguing that the British had committed genocide against and traumatised both the Indigenous people and enslaved Africans in SVG, he added that while enslavers were compensated with millions at abolition, nothing was given to those who had been enslaved and oppressed. “There was nothing for them to start with and build on – no land, no money, no training, no education,” he said. This damaging legacy of enslavement and oppression, he added, has continued to plague Caribbean nations. Meanwhile, the Bahamas prime minister, Philip Davis, said it was time for the Commonwealth to seek “justice” for the brutal history of slavery, as Britain’s former colonies demanded to discuss reparations with King Charles at a key summit on Friday. A draft of the Chogm communique leaked to the BBC said that governments, “noting calls for discussions on reparatory justice with regard to the transatlantic trade in enslaved Africans and chattel enslavement … agreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity.” According to the broadcaster, the communique sought to broaden the issue to include the enslavement not just across the Atlantic but in the Pacific, by saying that a majority of Commonwealth countries “share common historical experiences”. It mentioned the practice of “blackbirding”, where Pacific islanders were kidnapped and brought to Australia where they were sold as enslaved people or cheap labour to work on plantations in Queensland. In 2021, Jack Dempsey, the then mayor of Bundaberg in Queensland, issued a formal apology for blackbirding. Frederick Mitchell, the foreign minister of the Bahamas, said a small section about the subject was under discussion for potential inclusion in the communique. “The single line that they’re arguing about is reparatory justice or a declaration on reparatory justice,” he told the BBC. “Seems innocuous enough to us, because really what should happen is there should be an apology and a commitment to reparations.” Mitchell argued that the UK government needed to face up to the desire among Caricom countries, which groups 21 nations across the Caribbean and Americas, for the subject to be discussed. “Many of the institutions in the UK have already conceded the point of apology, the British government isn’t quite there,” he said. “But, at this time, the discussion needs to be had about the history of this and the ill effects of what happened after slavery was abolished, which continue to affect our societies today.” There was also some muted criticism from within Labour about No 10’s insistence that it was “facing forwards” rather than looking to the past. “Of course it’s about what happened in the past, but it’s about relationships in the future and what those relationships are based on,” Harriet Harman, a party grandee and former interim Labour leader, told Sky. “And therefore, I think to say ‘that’s all in the past, let’s look to the future’ feels like a misunderstanding of what they’re actually saying.” It comes as the Caribbean historian Sir Hilary Beckles, who chairs the Caribbean governments’ reparations body, wrote in the Guardian that global opinion had rallied to the idea that there was a case to answer for reparations. “While imperial Britain soared to sustainable economic development and global military superpower status, the enslaved and their descendants were left to this day with enduring pain, persistent poverty and systemic suffering.” Starmer, who arrived in the Samoan capital, Apia, on Thursday, will want to avoid any row over reparations marring a summit already lacking a series of Commonwealth leaders, including India’s Narendra Modi and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa, who have instead chosen to attend a gathering in Moscow hosted by Vladimir Putin. Even agreeing to start discussions about any form of reparations would be likely to prompt attacks on the prime minister by the Conservatives, with the support of the rightwing press. In the Commons on Thursday, Chris Philp, the shadow leader of the house, asked his government counterpart, Lucy Powell, to confirm that it was “totally wrong to entertain discussions about reparations in relation to things that happened hundreds and hundreds of years ago”."

          "bodyText": "A PIZZA THE ACTION Step into the passenger seat of Football Daily’s DeLorean, pull shut the gullwing door and watch as we go from nought to 88 in as long as it takes to generate the 1.21 gigawatts required for our trusty flux capacitor to send us hurtling through the mists of time on a journey to exactly 20 years ago on 24 October 2004. The very fiercest of rivals whose contempt for each other could not have been more mutual, Manchester United had just beaten Arsenal at Old Trafford, ending a record run of 49 matches unbeaten for Arsène Wenger’s side in the Premier League. Ruud van Nistelrooy’s cathartic, hotly disputed penalty and a goal for birthday boy Wayne Rooney, 19, had secured the points in a bruising encounter that, were it played today, would almost certainly prompt the kind of highly strung and overwrought football fanboys you find on social media abominations to swoon like Victorian ladies while vigorously clutching their pearls. Famously displeased by the sight of northern-based footballing ruffians daring to tackle his far more sophisticated players as they attempted to walk the ball from one end of the pitch to the other and into the opposition net, Wenger was given plenty to think about that afternoon. Enraged by the sight of Rio Ferdinand avoiding an early red card despite hacking down Freddie Ljungberg when he was clean through, the Arsenal manager could scarcely contain his fury as Robert Pires and the late José Antonio Reyes were booted up and down the pitch with more frequency and vigour than the actual match ball. Elsewhere, a brutal studs-up Van Nistelrooy challenge on Ashley Cole went unseen by Mike Riley, the match referee. It should be noted United didn’t have it all their own way, with Arsenal perpetrating 24 fouls against various United players, each of them meticulously logged by Sir Alex Ferguson in a “dossier” the club would subsequently submit to the FA. And they’re only the ones that were punished. Thierry Henry was also accused of deliberately trying to knack United left-back Gabriel Heinze while the Argentinian was lying helpless on the floor, while Arsenal defender Edu tackled Paul Scholes with a challenge Ferg would later describe as “a potential leg-breaker”. Of course, what happened on the pitch wasn’t the half of it. Because the real fun and games didn’t start until the final whistle was blown and the players of both sides had left the field and were on their way back to their respective dressing rooms. To cut a long story short: there was a massive stramash involving the players, managers and backroom staff of both teams in a very narrow stretch of tunnel between the home and away dressing rooms. And during scenes that resembled a cross between a saloon brawl in the Wild West and a cartoon dust-up in which numerous feet, fists and swearwords can be seen emerging from a cloud of dust, somebody chucked a pizza from the Arsenal dressing room and scored a direct hit into Ferg’s famously empurpled coupon, prompting further scenes of pandemonium. When a very fragile peace eventually broke out, officials from both clubs attempted a cover-up, in a bid to avoid FA sanctions for their bottleneck brawl and to spare Ferg’s blushes. Needless to say, this attempted omertà ended in complete failure and in the days, weeks, months and years since, increasingly detailed information about the stramash has been fed to the general public in a manner not dissimilar to a coagulated gloop of melted cheese suffused with pepperoni sausage, jalapeños and olives slowly dripping from the face of an apoplectic Scottish senior citizen on to his blazer, pristine white shirt and red club tie. While both teams eventually escaped punishment due to a lack of evidence and all involved sensibly adopting the Wengerian approach of not having seen the incident, the identity of the mystery pizza-chucker remained a mystery, even if one name kept popping into the frame. It would take another 18 years for Arsenal’s Cesc Fàbregas, who was a mere whelp of 17 at the time, to confirm that it had indeed been him who’d frisbee-ed the savoury projectile across the corridor, although he claimed he hadn’t been aiming for anyone in particular and hitting Ferg had just been a bonus. Well, sort of. “I was just very small, very tiny, and I didn’t know what to do,” he told The Athletic (£). “I wanted to bring something to the table to defend my teammates and that’s what I did. I didn’t aim at anyone. You know when you throw something into a crowd just to see if you hit someone? And then I hit the big guy, Sir Alex, unfortunately.” And so the famous legend of the Battle of the Buffet was born. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE It’s Big Vase all the way.

          "headline": "Ukraine war briefing: Brics summit backfired on Putin with calls for peace, says Kyiv",
          "bodyText": "The foreign ministry in Kyiv said on Wednesday that Moscow had failed to win support for its invasion of Ukraine at the Brics summit it is hosting, where Putin faced direct calls to end the conflict from some of his closest and most important partners. “The Brics summit, which Russia planned to use to split the world, has once again demonstrated that the world majority remains on the side of Ukraine in its quest to guarantee a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace,” the ministry said. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the summit that there must be “no escalation of fighting” in Ukraine, saying: “We must adhere to the three principles of ‘no spillover from the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no adding oil to the fire by relevant parties’, so as to ease the situation as soon as possible.” The Brazilian president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, called for “avoiding escalation and initiating peace negotiations”. Without referring to any specific conflict, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, also issued a call for peace: “We support dialogue and diplomacy, not war.” In private talks, Vladimir Putin welcomed offers by several of the Brics leaders to mediate in Ukraine, even as he told them his forces were advancing, said his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, according to Russian state media. North Korean troops would be legitimate military targets – “fair game” – if they engaged in combat in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday. The US has said for the first time that it has seen evidence of North Korean troops in Russia, and South Korean lawmakers have said about 3,000 soldiers have been sent to support the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine, with Kim Jong-un’s regime promising to provide a total of about 10,000 troops by December. Alexander Lukashenko – the Belarusian president, who has stayed in power by running a client state of Russia – said in interviews broadcast on Wednesday that Putin deploying any foreign forces in the Ukraine conflict would inevitably lead to an escalation, possibly involving Nato troops. Lukashenko claimed it was “rubbish” that North Korean troops were going to fight in Ukraine: “Knowing his character Putin would never try to persuade another country to involve its army in Russia’s special operation in Ukraine … [it] would be a step towards the escalation of the conflict if the armed forces of any country, even Belarus, were on the contact line.” That would prompt Ukraine’s allies to point to foreign involvement “so Nato troops would be deployed to Ukraine”. Ukrainian authorities have announced the mandatory evacuation of children and their families from Borova in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv, where Russian forces have been making advances. The governor of the Donetsk region earlier said all children had been removed from the frontline town of Myrnograd and just several dozen remained in the nearby transport hub of Pokrovsk - the main target of Russian advances. Authorities in the Zaporizhzhia region, which the Kremlin claimed to have annexed alongside Donetsk and two others, said two men aged 40 and 73 had been killed in a drone attack. The Biden administration is trying to provide Ukraine with US$10bn in military aid as part of its $20bn commitment under a $50bn loan coordinated with the G7 and EU, the White House National Security Council said on Wednesday. Joe Biden, the US president, said: “We will provide $20bn in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by the interest earned from immobilised Russian sovereign assets. Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict … tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause”. The US plans to disperse $10bn by December as economic aid, but needs US lawmakers’ approval for a further $10bn, the White House national security council has said on Wednesday. Romania scrambled two F-16 fighter jets after detecting what were probably two drones breaching its national airspace, the Romanian defence ministry said late on Wednesday. It was the third such incident in less than a week. Two signals were picked up by radar less than one hour apart flying above the south-eastern counties of Constanta and Tulcea, the latter bordering Ukraine across the Danube River. The pilots did not see either drone before losing the signals, the ministry said."

          "bodyText": "Birmingham airport is “returning to normal” after flights were grounded and the site evacuated while police responded to reports of a suspicious vehicle. In a statement, the airport said: “Following a police investigation, operations are now returning to normal. Whilst we apologise for any inconvenience and disruption, the safety and security of everyone at the airport was our No 1 priority as we worked through this incident with police partners.” West Midlands police said the airport was “partially evacuated” so a vehicle could be searched and assessed. “Following a search by the explosive ordnance disposal team the vehicle was deemed to be safe. The vehicle is no longer being treated as suspicious. The safety of all was our primary concern and there is no wider risk to the public,” the force said. “The airport has resumed normal business with minimal disruption. We would like to thank the public for their patience and support while we dealt with this incident.” Earlier on Wednesday the airport had said its operations were affected and advised all passengers to stay away. Passengers reported being escorted outside the airport building to the nearby National Exhibition Centre (NEC). Crowds of people, many with suitcases, found themselves behind police tape as they were moved away from the scene. West Midlands fire service said it had crews on standby at the airport, while teams from West Midlands ambulance service were also in attendance “as a precautionary measure as police deal with reports of a suspicious vehicle”. The airport later said passengers could return to the airport, advising them to check the latest flight information before travelling. The departures board showed a number of flights scheduled to take off on Wednesday were delayed by more than two hours while the airport was evacuated. Other passengers reported being stuck on planes on the airport runway after landing. After the latest announcement, passengers said they were being slowly allowed back into the airport building, but further disruption was expected for a number of hours."

          "headline": "Florida reports 13 deaths from rare flesh-eating bacteria after hurricanes",
          "bodyText": "Thirteen people have died from rare flesh-eating bacteria infections in Florida this year amid a spike in cases related to hurricane activity in the state. Florida health authorities said there have been 74 confirmed cases of Vibrio vulnificus infections in 2024, compared with 46 cases and 11 deaths in 2023. Vibrio vulnificus are “naturally occurring bacteria in warm, brackish seawater”, requiring salt to live, according to the Florida department of health. Authorities attributed the surge to Hurricane Helene, which last month lashed Florida with breakneck winds and historic storm surge. The storm then traveled into southern Appalachia, ravaging western North Carolina with deadly flooding and landslides, killing about 100 people there. “In 2024 Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Lee, Pasco, Pinellas, and Sarasota counties experiences unusual increase due to the impacts of Hurricane Helene,” the department said. Hurricane Milton struck Florida as a powerful category 3 storm on 9 October; at least two dozen were killed by the storm, many in relation to a tornado outbreak that unfolded before landfall. Florida health authorities said “Vibrio bacteria, commonly found in warm coastal waters, can cause illness when ingested or when open wounds are exposed to contaminated water.” “After heavy rainfall and flooding, the concentration of these bacteria may rise, particularly in brackish and saltwater environments,” they added. Once infected, Vibrio vulnificus can prompt the breakdown of skin and soft tissue, USA Today said. To prevent the infection from spreading, medics might have to amputate the infected limb, though the infection can prove deadly. This is not the first year that cataclysmic weather has prompted a Vibrio outbreak in Florida. In 2022, there were 74 cases and 17 deaths; health officials noted that Collier and Lee counties saw “unusual increase due to the impacts of Hurricane Ian”. While some Vibrio infections do lead to necrotizing fasciitis, the severe infection in where flesh around an open wound dies, public health authorities believe that a type of Streptococcus is actually the most common cause of this condition in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some experts have balked at the use of “flesh-eating” to describe severe Vibrio infection, noting that it cannot destroy healthy and intact skin even with prolonged exposure."

          "headline": "England select specialist spin trio for third Test decider against Pakistan",
          "bodyText": "England have picked a trio of spinners for the decisive third Test against Pakistan, after their first sight of the pitch for the game revealed that not only had it been blasted with hot air from an array of patio heaters whipped down the wicket by a pair of industrial fans, but it was “pretty obvious that there’s been a few rakes put across it”. The resulting scratches are concentrated on the areas their spinners are likely to pitch the ball. The team held their first training session in Rawalpindi on Tuesday, giving them an initial glimpse of the playing surface. “There’s not too much grass to hold everything together,” Ben Stokes, the captain, said. “It’s pretty obvious there’s been a few rakes put across it. It will be interesting to see how it goes. You’d think a rake would assist the spin. You look down the pitch and we can have a pretty good guess which ends the Pakistan spinners will operate from.” Stokes, who reiterated that he had no issue with Pakistan’s attempts to manipulate the pitch to their advantage, said that while there was clear evidence of raking at both ends, “there are certain areas” where it has been concentrated. These are seen as being intended to assist Pakistan’s spin duo, Noman Ali and Sajid Khan, who took all 20 English wickets in the second Test last week. The home side picked three specialist spinners for that game, but while between them Noman and Sajid sent down 87.5 overs their leg-spinner, Zahid Mahmood, bowled only six. Pakistan are likely to announce their own team on Wednesday, and had been expected to drop Zahid. England’s unexpected decision to field a leg-spinner in Rehan Ahmed, in addition to Jack Leach and Shoaib Bashir, may prompt them to reconsider. “You want to pick someone who, if you do go with three options of spin, who is not a luxury but who’s there to be able to break the game open when you feel like it might be coming a little bit too easy at one end,” Stokes said. “Pakistan played a leg-spinner last week who only bowled a few overs, but you’d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.” England felt that in Multan the run of pale, dry grass across the middle would help to rough up the ball and encourage reverse swing, and the fact that the ground in Rawalpindi offers no such assistance helped to swing their focus away from seam bowling. “The reasoning behind three spinners was, as the game progresses, they will probably come more into the game,” Stokes said. “Also with the outfield being lush and green, we’ll probably struggle to get reverse swing. It was just weighing up who we think will be effective as the game goes on.” Brydon Carse and Matt Potts drop out of the team, with Gus Atkinson returning as the only specialist seamer. Stokes put himself through an unusually lengthy spell of bowling in the nets on Tuesday, and the selection demonstrates that he feels able to contribute more than the five overs per innings he managed when he returned from a hamstring injury for the second Test. “It was good to get through it,” he said. “I put myself through my paces at training, bowled two spells. Coming in and being one of only two seamers, I’m fully confident that I’ll be able to get more out of myself this week than I did last week.”"

          "bodyText": "This blog is now closed. You can read our latest report on Israel’s strikes on Lebanon here and all our coverage from the region here. Further to our earlier post here, Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, is reporting that 10 civilians were killed and 30 others injured in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. At least 10 civilians were killed and 30 others were injured today as a result of the Israeli occupation artillery shelling of Jabalia Preparatory School, which houses displaced people in Jabalia camp, north of the Gaza Strip. Local sources said that medical teams recovered the bodies of at least 10 slain Palestinians and a number of wounded in Israeli artillery shelling of Jabalia Preparatory School in the Al-Fawqa area schools square, which is a Unrwa shelter for displaced people in Jabalia camp, north of the Gaza Strip. Medical sources indicated that 57 citizens were killed in the occupation raids on the Gaza Strip since dawn today, 44 of them in the north of the Strip. The UN warned Monday that almost no aid is entering the besieged Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where a two-week Israeli military campaign has killed hundreds of people and left thousands trapped, CNN reports. “Almost no humanitarian aid is getting into (the) Jabalia refugee camp and telecommunications are severely disrupted amid ongoing air strikes, shelling and fighting across north Gaza, as the violence displaces more and more people,” Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, said at a briefing. Requests by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to enter the Al-Faluja area of Jabalia to help those trapped under rubble had been denied by Israeli authorities for four consecutive days, Haq told the briefing. He also said a request by OCHA Monday to distribute food, medicine and fuel in the Jabalia camp was denied. Only four out of 66 planned humanitarian missions from southern to northern Gaza had been facilitated by Israeli authorities since the start of October, Haq added. “We reiterate once again that these delays are likely costing lives,” he said. COGAT, the Israeli agency that manages the flow of aid into the strip, insists that supplies are reaching Gaza. In a post on X on Monday, it said that that in the past 24 hours, 47 humanitarian aid trucks had been transferred to northern Gaza. For comparison, CNN said, the UN previously reported that an average 500 trucks entered the strip a day in the months before 7 October 2023. Israel’s requirements for the indemnification needed to allow Israeli banks to continue conducting transactions with Palestinian banks have been met by the Palestinian authorities, Reuters reports, citing an unnamed source. Technical experts argue that should warrant an extension of a current indemnification – set to lapse at the end of the month – for at least a year to avert an economic crisis in the West Bank, the source said. US deputy treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo, who last month warned Israel that allowing the banking relationships to lapse would put its own security at risk, spoke on Monday with Palestinian Authority prime minister Mohammad Mustafa (see earlier post here). A bit more (see earlier post here) on US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s trip to the Middle East to push for a Gaza ceasefire. Blinken, who is expected in Israel on Tuesday, will visit Jordan on Wednesday and discuss humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip with the Jordanians, AFP reports, citing an official on the top US diplomat’s plane. The official said that Blinken, who is expected to travel in the region through Friday, would be speaking throughout his trip on bridging gaps on reaching a ceasefire in the year-old Gaza war. Blinken will also discuss initial outlines of a post-conflict governance plan in Gaza, the official said. Blinken also plans to speak to Israel about its expected military strike on Iran and discourage any move that massively increases regional conflict, the official said. President Joe Biden’s administration has voiced hope for progress on an elusive ceasefire, two weeks before US elections, after Israel killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, described by US officials as intransigent in his demands. Blinken’s other stops this trip are likely to include Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, officials say. Iran on Monday warned the United States would bear “full responsibility” in case of a retaliatory attack by Israel on the Islamic Republic, after US president Joe Biden indicated he was aware of Israeli plans to do so. Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, called Biden’s remarks “profoundly alarming and provocative” in a letter addressed to UN chief António Guterres and the Swiss presidency of the UN security council, according to AFP. The US president responded “yes and yes” when asked Friday by a reporter if he had “a good understanding right now” of how and when Israel would respond to Iran’s missile barrage on 1 October. “The United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran … as well as for the catastrophic consequences on regional and international peace and security,” Iran’s U.N. mission said in a letter to the UN security council. Iran launched about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders belonging to Hamas and Hezbollah, and an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. US ally Israel, at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, vowed revenge against Iran for the strikes. “This inflammatory statement (of Biden) is deeply concerning, as it indicates the United States’ tacit approval and explicit support for Israel’s unlawful military aggression against Iran,” Iravani wrote in the letter. “Therefore, the United States will bear full responsibility for its role in instigating, inciting and enabling any acts of aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,” he said. According to the Washington Post, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Biden that he intends to strike Iran’s military sites, and not to target nuclear or oil infrastructure. Lebanese state-run media reported 13 strikes on Monday evening on Beirut’s southern suburbs, a main Hezbollah bastion, AFP reports, in one of the most intense nights of Israeli attacks in weeks. While most districts of Beirut’s southern suburbs had been emptied for almost a month, the densely packed residential area of Ouzai was still filled with people because it had never been targeted before. Lebanon’s National news agency reported at least three Israeli strikes on the Ouzai district. Hezbollah-affiliated rescuers told AFP they were looking for survivors amid the devastation in Ouzai, adding that the evacuation alert, then the strike, caused “panic among residents” who “started to run in the streets”. “They did not leave any room for people to escape. The strike came closely after the warning,” one said. AFPTV footage showed plumes of smoke rising from Beirut’s southern suburbs, with AFP correspondents also hearing several loud bangs before the strikes. The footage also showed two strikes that caused a huge fire, with black smoke surrounding dissipating orange flames. Deputy US treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo on Monday spoke with Palestinian Authority prime minister Mohammad Mustafa and they discussed security and economic stability in the West Bank, the Treasury department said. Adeyemo and Mustafa also discussed the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to improve its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regime, the department said. It added that Adeyemo “stressed the importance of preventing terrorists and violent extremists” from raising, using, and moving funds in the West Bank. The full readout from Treasury: Today, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo spoke with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa. They discussed security and economic stability in the West Bank as well as the Palestinian Authority’s efforts to improve its anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo stressed the importance of preventing terrorists and violent extremists from raising, using, and moving funds in the West Bank. He noted the Palestinian Authority’s progress on strengthening its CFT regime to further support these relationships, including by completing key milestones related to the assessment of AML/CFT risks within its jurisdiction and bolstering effective compliance with international standards. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo commended the Palestinian Authority for completing a risk assessment of their financial system, as well as scheduling a MENAFATF evaluation of their banking system. These are both critical steps for ensuring financial linkages between the Palestinian territories and the international financial system continue. They discussed the importance of the correspondent banking relationships between Israeli and Palestinian banks to the security and economic stability of the region. A Lebanese security official has said that the country’s national airline had to switch landing strips on Monday after Israeli strikes near Beirut’s only international airport hit close to the main runway, AFP reports. “Middle East Airlines switched the runway it was using because the main runway is close to the site of the Ouzai strike,” the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. A lot of news continues to unfold in Beirut, Lebanon, and in northern Gaza. We’ll keep you up with developments as reliable information emerges. It’s around 1am on Tuesday in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City. The Guardian’s New York team is handing over to our colleagues in Australia now. Here’s where things stand: At least four were killed, including a child, and 24 were injured when one of the Israeli airstrikes on Beirut on Monday night hit just in front of the entrance of the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the largest public hospital in Lebanon. Israel also accused Hezbollah of operating under Sahel hospital, not that far away, also in the southern suburbs of the capital. That hospital was being evacuated and has not been hit. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children’s agency Unicef, Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain, have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help “alleviating the suffering of countless civilians” in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. Fadi Alame, the director of the Sahel hospital in the southern suburbs of Beirut, said an evacuation was getting underway and also denied that the hospital is cover for Hezbollah, despite Israeli accusations of such. Israel said the building covers a Hezbollah bunker that was used to shield the assassinated head of the militant group, Hassan Nasrallah, and cash for the group. Joe Biden’s US administration remains “deeply concerned” about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley in the morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan. Lebanese state media reported further airstrikes on southern Lebanon in the last few hours, with reports of people being killed in the attacks and residential neighbourhoods being targeted by the Israeli military. There were reports that at least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Israel has been accused of preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies, including water, food and medicine for people under siege. The US says it is intensifying diplomatic efforts to get ceasefires between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was also set to depart for a four-day trip to Israel and other countries in the Middle East on Monday. Israeli authorities are still preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies including medicine and food for people under siege, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe branch said. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, “is committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,” Hans Kluge said, adding the evacuations would be facilitated by the WHO – the United Nations health agency – and the European countries involved. In northern Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent Society has posted an account from Ahmad Abu Al-Foul, a volunteer Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), about what it describes as “the challenges of working in an area under intense Israeli occupation, targeting for the seventeenth consecutive day.” The volunteer, in the interpreted English language captions, talks of the dangers he and colleagues face as they continue working to save lives. He described the huge pressure with pleas for help coming in all the time amid a shortage of medical supplies and fuel. “We receive dozens of pleas every day and every hour” he said, from places where Palestinian civilians are getting caught up in active combat by the Israeli military’s counteroffensive against Hamas. “The hospitals are finding it difficult to handle the large number of casualties that arrive every minute,” he said. “Despite this we continue to do our humanitarian work in northern Gaza.” Lebanon’s Ministry of Health has condemned what it said was “attacks on two of Lebanon’s largest hospitals” on Monday and was part of Israel’s “daily targeting of the Lebanese health sector.” Israel has killed at least 115 healthcare workers and emergency responders since fighting started between Hezbollah and Israel a year prior. It was the second night in a row that Beirut was heavily bombed, with Israel carrying out more than 15 airstrikes on Hezbollah-linked banking institutions the night before. On Sunday night, Israel said that it would begin targeting a Hezbollah-affiliated bank, Al-Qard Al-Hassan, which provides interest free loans and banking services to hundreds of thousands of Lebanese – primarily Shia Muslims. It accused the bank of helping finance Hezbollah and said that its branches were used to store weapons. The announcement that Israel would start targeting the bank, a part of Hezbollah’s civilian institutions, signified an expansion of the scope of Israel’s targets from just the group’s military wing. The institution had sanctions placed on it by the US in 2017 during the Trump administration for giving Hezbollah access to the international financial system, according to the US treasury. Amid Israeli airstrikes on Beirut on Monday night, one hit just in front of the entrance of the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the largest public hospital in Lebanon. At least four were killed, including a child, 24 were injured in the strike, and the hospital suffered “major damage” from the blast. Despite the strike, the hospital continued operating and is currently receiving the injured from the nearby strikes, a source at the hospital told the Guardian. The initial casualty count was expected to rise as first responders continued digging through the rubble for people. A picture of the building struck in front of Rafik Hariri hospital showed a man covered in blood lying lifeless in a bombed-out building. Fears proliferated that hospitals would be struck in the greater Beirut area after the Israeli military struck near Rafik Hariri hospital and published claims that Hezbollah was operating under Sahel hospital, also in the southern suburbs of the capital – a claim that echoed those made by Israel in Gaza. Further details from the two senior UN agency officials who have written to Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Unicef’s Catherine Russell and the World Food Programme’s Cindy McCain. They called on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to protect civilians and critical civilian services, Reuters reports, in its news scoop of seeing the letter that was sent. They wrote that the UN and aid groups: Need unequivocal security assurances to ensure a safe operating environment … the rules of engagement and their implementation in practice, in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and Lebanon, must reflect the IDF (Israel Defense Forces)’s obligation and commitment to respect, protect, and facilitate humanitarian action,” said Russell, a former senior aide to Joe Biden, and McCain, Biden’s former ambassador to the UN agencies for food and agriculture in Rome. They urgently appealed for an effective humanitarian notification system that the Israeli military “acknowledges and supports”, citing the success of using area-specific pauses in fighting to allow for the polio vaccination of children in Gaza. We request this be applied consistently to facilitate humanitarian action at scale,” they wrote. The United States said last week it was watching to ensure that its ally Israel’s actions on the ground show it does not have a “policy of starvation” in the north of Gaza. Israel has said there is not a lack of aid in Gaza and accused Hamas of hijacking the humanitarian assistance, Reuters reports. Hamas has repeatedly denied Israeli allegations that it was stealing aid and says Israel is to blame for shortages. We call on your support, as Prime Minister, to ensure that the government of Israel upholds its obligations and commitments to enable effective emergency relief operations, and to protect the safety and security of our staff and the civilians they serve,” Catherine Russell and Cindy McCain wrote in their letter to Benjamin Netanyahu. The UN appeal came two days before the US told Israel it must take steps within 30 days to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid. The heads of the United Nations World Food Programme and UN children’s agency Unicef have privately appealed to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help “alleviating the suffering of countless civilians” in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, according to a new letter. The letter has been seen by Reuters today and the agency is reporting on that now, as it is previously unreported despite it being dated 11 October. Effective and meaningful humanitarian action is possible with your political will and commitment,” wrote Unicef executive director Catherine Russell and WFP executive director Cindy McCain, the widow of former US Senator for Arizona, John McCain. Netanyahu’s office did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the letter. The amount of aid entering Gaza has plummeted to its lowest level all year, according to UN data. In addition, a global hunger monitor has warned of a looming famine, and the UN has accused Israel of denying and impeding dozens of attempts this month to deliver aid, particularly to Gaza’s north. More follows. An Israeli airstrike hit in front of the entrance of Rafic Hariri University hospital in south Beirut on Monday night, a spokesperson for the hospital told the Guardian. Rafik Hariri hospital is the largest public hospital in Lebanon and took over the treatment of some patients which had previously been evacuated from hospitals in Dahiyeh, the southern suburbs of Beirut, due to intense Israeli bombing in the area. The bombing near the hospital occured as Israel carried out more airstrikes in Dahiyeh. The Israeli military had issued warnings for residents to move at least five hundred meters away from certain sites in Dahiyeh, including the pier in Ouzaieh, a part of Dahiyeh that still has people living in it. After the warnings were issued, residents of Ouzaieh began to flee the area. Just two hours earlier, the Israeli military said that Hezbollah was hiding hundreds of millions of dollars of cash under a hospital in Haret Hreik, a neighbourhood in Dahiyeh. The hospital was quickly evacuated after the accusation, an accusation the hospital director has since denied. News is firming up that an Israeli airstrike has hit near Beirut’s Rafik Hariri University hospital in the southern suburbs late on Monday, Lebanon’s largest public-sector hospital. Reuters is citing a hospital source, adding that it appeared the strike hit the hospital’s parking lot. We await more details. A breaking news headline on Reuters citing a witness report: “heavy strike heard near Beirut’s souther suburbs”. This as AFP reports that the Israeli army has issued a new evacuation call for residents in a southern Beirut suburb. These two notes may well connect and we’ll update things soon. Other, unverified reports can be seen referring to the Haret Hreik area, between the center of Beirut and the main airport on the outskirts and wire pictures are emerging. A source at Rafik Hariri hospital has told Reuters that the latest Israeli strike has occurred nearby. Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari is claiming that there is a bunker under the Sahel hospital in Beirut filled with cash and gold belonging to the coffers of Hezbollah. The hospital is currently being evacuated in case of Israeli air strikes, despite Israel’s assertions that it will not attack the hospital. According to the estimates we have, there is at least half a billion dollars in dollar bills and gold stored in this bunker. This money could and still can be used to rebuild the state of Lebanon,” Hagari said and AFP reports. Earlier today, Israeli military chief lieutenant general Herzi Halevi said more than two dozen targets belonging to Al-Qard al-Hassan – a financial firm linked to Hezbollah – were hit. The Israeli military is now saying it will not strike the Sahel hospital in southern Beirut, while emphasizing that it is intent on attacking monetary stashes it cites as being controlled by Lebanon-based Hezbollah. The Israeli army said today its forces were pummeling Hezbollah’s financial arm, hitting more than two dozen targets including a bunker with tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold, Agence France-Presse reports. The strikes since Sunday night mark an expansion of Israel’s campaign against the Iran-backed group after a year of cross-border exchanges that escalated in late September into a full-blown war. Israeli forces are now seeking to degrade the Shiite Muslim movement’s ability to fund its operations. The Israeli air force carried out a series of precise strikes on these Hezbollah financial strongholds. One of our main targets last night was an underground vault with tens of millions of dollars in cash and gold. The money was being used to finance Hezbollah’s attacks on Israel,” Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing. Hagari then referenced a separate bunker also allegedly filled with cash and gold under a hospital in the capital Beirut, but said the vault had not been targeted yet by the Israeli military. Reports are coming in that a hospital in the southern suburbs of Beirut is being evacuated amid claims by Israel that the building covers a Hezbollah bunker that was used to shield the assassinated head of the militant group, Hassan Nasrallah, and cash for the group. Fadi Alame, the director of the Sahel hospital, has told Reuters about the evacuation getting underway and also denied that the hospital is cover for Hezbollah. At least two people were killed and three others injured today in an apparent guided missile attack on a car in the Mazzeh area of Damascus, Syrian state television said, quoting a military source, Reuters reports. The source attributed the attack to Israel. The attack occurred near the Eastern Roundabout, close to the Golden Mazzeh Hotel, a high-end establishment in the centre of Syria’s capital, state media added. An Israeli military spokesman later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it killed the head of Hezbollah’s money transfers unit. We will continue to act against Hezbollah in Syria and everywhere else,” Israel’s chief military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said in a televised statement. It looks like more detail may be emerging concerning the short report earlier that at least one person was killed today, probably at least two, in a “guided missile attack” on a car in the Mazzeh area of Damascus, reported a few hours ago by Syrian state television. The Israel Defense Forces reports via its spokesperson Daniel Hagari that Israel carried out an airstrike in Syria today, where it was targeting the leader of the financial organization funding Hezbollah, directing funds from Iran, the Times of Israel reports, referring to the financial firm Al-Qard al-Hassan. Hagari has not given a name but indicated the man is newly appointed. Reuters is now issuing some more detail and we’ll bring an update on this news as soon as possible. The Israeli military has issued a touch of detail to information about the latest air strikes on Lebanon. The Israel army says it has hit about 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in the past day, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The Israeli military said a little earlier today that it struck about 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon over the past 24 hours, in a widening air campaign now also targeting the group’s financial operations. “Approximately 300 targets were hit in the last 24 hours alone,” the military said in a statement after military chief Herzi Halevi said around 30 targets related to Al-Qard al-Hassan, a financial firm linked to Iran-backed Hezbollah. Antony Blinken is departing today for a week-long trip to Israel and a number of Arab countries on a visit that also comes as Israel weighs retaliation against Iran for a ballistic missile attack earlier this month. His other stops are likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, state department officials say, and the Associated Press reports. Since the Hamas attacks in Israel on 7 October 2023, and the Israeli response, Blinken has traveled to the Middle East 10 other times seeking an end to the crisis. His previous trips have yielded little in the way of ending hostilities, but he has managed to increase aid deliveries to Gaza in the past. His other stops this trip are likely to include Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, officials say. US secretary of state Antony Blinken is due to meet Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and president Isaac Herzog tomorrow. Tuesday’s meetings are the first major items on the agenda as Blinken head for the region today in a fresh effort to kickstart ceasefire talks after Israel last week killed Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas. Secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people…He will reaffirm the US commitment to work with partners across the region to de-escalate tensions and provide lasting stability,” US state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement, the Associated Press reports. As of last Friday, Blinken was in Germany on a visit with US president Joe Biden. The Biden administration remains “deeply concerned” about the leak of a pair of highly classified intelligence documents describing Israel’s preparations for a retaliatory strike on Iran, the White House has said. There is no indication that additional documents have been compromised and US officials have been in communication with Israeli counterparts about the leak, White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. The following is from a story written by my colleagues Richard Luscombe and Dan Sabbagh who provide more detail on the leaks: The documents are attributed to the US Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency. They are written in a style similar to documents previously leaked from the Pentagon, using classifications familiar to the national security community. The first document has the title “Israel: air force continues preparations for strike on Iran and conducts a second large-force employment exercise” and the second “Israel: defense forces continue key munitions preparations and covert UAV activity almost certainly for a strike on Iran”. Both are dated 16 October and were first leaked a day later. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley in the morning, hitting buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan. Lebanese state media reported further airstrikes on southern Lebanon in the last few hours, with reports of people being killed in the attacks and residential neighbourhoods being targeted by the Israeli military. There were reports that at least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip. Israel has been accused of preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies, including water, food and medicine for people under siege. The US says it is intensifying diplomatic efforts to get ceasefires between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was also set to depart for a four-day trip to Israel and other countries in the Middle East on Monday. Israeli authorities are still preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies including medicine and food for people under siege, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said. The US president’s special envoy to Lebanon, Amos Hochstein, has held talks with Lebanese officials in Beirut today as diplomatic efforts to revive ceasefire talks in both Gaza and Lebanon continue. Hochstein said that it was “not enough” for Israel and Hezbollah to commit to UN resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war and has since been the framework that governs security dynamics on the Lebanese-Israeli border. It calls for southern Lebanon to be free of any troops or weapons other than those of the Lebanese state. The agreement states that Hezbollah and other armed militias must not be present past the Litani River, about 18 miles (30km) north of the border. Hochstein said that neither Hezbollah nor Israel had adequately implemented the resolution, and that while it would be the basis for the end to current war, the US was seeking to determine what more needed to be done to make sure it was implemented “fairly, accurately and transparently”. Speaking in Beirut, where he met Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, a close Hezbollah ally who has been engaging in diplomatic efforts, Hochstein said: We are working with government of Lebanon, the state of Lebanon, as well as the government of Israel to get to a formula that brings an end to this conflict once and for all.. The United States wants to end this conflict absolutely as soon as possible. That is what President Biden wants, that is what we all are working towards. At least one person was killed today in a “guided missile attack” on a car in the Mazzeh area of Damascus, according to Syrian state television. The circumstances surrounding the attack are unclear. We will give you more details on this as we get them. The Israeli military has apologised for an airstrike in southern Lebanon on Sunday that killed three Lebanese soldiers, the Associated Press reports. The military said it struck a truck that had entered an area where it had previously targeted a Hezbollah truck transporting a launcher and missiles. The military said its soldiers were not aware that the second truck belonged to the Lebanese army. Lebanon’s army has historically stayed out of cross-border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah, an influential Shia Muslim political party and Iranian-backed armed group. Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, is reporting that at least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed in attacks carried out by Israeli soldiers in the northern Gaza Strip today. Wafa his this report, which we have not yet been able to independently verify: Medical sources reported that seven people were killed and wounded as a result of artillery shelling targeting displaced persons inside a school in the vicinity of Abu Rashid Pool in Jabalia camp… In addition, six people, including children, were killed and others were injured with varying degrees in an occupation raid that targeted a gathering of citizens while they were trying to fill drinking water in the town of Jabalia. In Jabalia camp, four civilians were killed in an airstrike launched by an occupation drone on a group of citizens near al-Yaman al-Saeed hospital. Jabalia, the largest of Gaza’s eight historical refugee camps, has become the centrepiece of a renewed assault on northern Gaza by the Israeli military, who claim they are trying to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping. Tens of thousands of civilians are thought to be trapped in Jabalia, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating. There have been frequent reports of Palestinian civilians being killed in airstrikes there, which have caused widespread destruction, levelling civilian infrastructure. Wafa also reported today that nine “citizens” were killed by Israeli bombing in Gaza City, while three other people were killed in a bombing that targeted Ghazi Al-Shawa school, which houses displaced people in the town of Beit Hanoun, in the northeast edge of the Strip. The entirety of northern Gaza is under Israeli evacuation orders. The military has ordered residents to flee towards the so-called “humanitarian zone” of al-Mawasi, even though it has been targeted in deadly airstrikes and is severely overcrowded. The IDF said “several hundred” residents left Jabalia since this morning via organised routes. The Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli airstrike on the main eastern city of Baalbek killed six people, including a child, on Monday. The state-run National News Agency reported that all six were from the same family. According to the Lebanese health ministry, four people were killed and four others injured in an Israeli attack on al Kharayib in southern Lebanon. The NNA said four Israeli airstrikes hit the southern Lebanese town of Arabsalim, and that residential neighbourhoods were targeted. An NNA correspondent said Israeli warplanes targeted Khiam, a town in the Nabatieh area of southern Lebanon, with four raids conducted there. Patrick Wintour is diplomatic editor for the Guardian Iran has written to the UN nuclear watchdog to complain formally about a threatened Israeli attack on its nuclear sites, urging its officials to warn Israel that such an attack would not only be illegal but be a breach of UN resolutions. The International Atomic Energy Authority responsible for oversight of Iran’s nuclear program has so far said little about the crisis, and its relations with Tehran have been strained recently. The warning outlined by the Iranian foreign ministry came as unnamed military sources stepped up their warnings that Iran would pursue building a nuclear weapons if what it insists is its civil nuclear program is attacked by Israel. The threat reported in Tasnim News, one of the sites closest to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Council, comes after 35 parliamentarians wrote to Iran’s national security commission urging a re-examination of Iran’s religious opposition to a bomb. But the foreign ministry spokesperson Ismail Baqaei, responding to media speculation, insisted that Iran has no plan to change the Fatwa against the use of nuclear weapons issued by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as far back as 2003. The Fatwa is based on Islamic teaching, as much as foreign policy. But the leak of the US classified documents over the weekend setting out how Iran might be attacked is widely seen in Iran either as an effort inside the Biden administration to warn Israel off from mounting such a large attack on Iran, or else an attempt to persuade Iran to back down. The mood in Tehran is that an attack is imminent, and trust in US assurances that Iran’s nuclear sites will be spared is low. Baqaei said Iran’s planned response to any Israeli attack was already in place. The recent call to abandon the Fatwa was originally led by an Iranian MP Mohammad Reza Sabaghiani who said “to preserve the deterrent capability and ensure national security, the ability to develop nuclear weapons is necessary. While having nuclear weapons is possible for Israel, Iran must pursue nuclear weapons for self-defense”. On Monday, a second MP, Fathollah Tousi, who is a member of the parliament’s economic commission, said Iran had the ability to make a bomb, but the decision rested with the Supreme Leader. It has also been noticed in Iran that their leaked documents implicitly assume that Israel has a nuclear weapon, something that had been widely assumed in Tehran. The Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was continuing with his regional tour visiting Bahrain and Kuwait as part of his effort to form a united front against Israel and explain Iran’s support for the so-called axis of resistance in Lebanon and Gaza. He has also been seeking assurances that Gulf States will not cooperate in any Israeli attack on Iran by allowing its airspace to be used. The foreign ministry said: “We are sure that the countries of the region, understanding the sensitivity of the region and the conditions, will not allow their space to be used to attack an Islamic country.” The Israeli military said air force helicopters and fighter jets intercepted five drones in the Mediterranean Sea before they crossed into the country. Israel’s airport authority briefly halted the takeoff and landing of flights at the country’s main airport – Ben Gurion – this afternoon. “In coordination with the security system, landings and takeoffs at the airport were stopped,” the airport authority said in a statement earlier, without elaborating further. Israeli media reported that a suspicious object had been seen near the airport, though this has not officially been confirmed. Services have now resumed at the airport. Israel’s police and intelligence agencies claimed to have broken up a network of Israeli citizens who have been providing military intelligence useful for missile targeting to Iran and were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. The investigation claimed the network had been active for around two years, and according to reports in the Israeli the suspects are accused of photographing and collecting information on IDF bases and facilities, including the Kirya defence headquarters in Tel Aviv and the Nevatim and Ramat David airbases. The Nevatim base was targeted in both Iranian missile attacks this year, and Ramat David has been targeted by Hezbollah. According to a statement released on Monday, the seven Israeli citizens were arrested for gathering sensitive information on Israeli Defense Force bases and energy infrastructure. According to Haaretz, the suspects allegedly received hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash transfers from Russian tourists, as well as in crypto currencies. Three of the suspects were apprehended while photographing sensitive sites in southern Israel, and the police discovered dozens of documents in their possession. “Investigations revealed that over a period exceeding two years, the suspects executed multiple security missions under the direction of two Iranian intelligence agents known as ‘Alkhan’ and ‘Orkhan’. The network members were aware that the intelligence they provided compromised national security and could aid enemy missile attacks. “The network conducted extensive reconnaissance missions on IDF bases nationwide, focusing on air force and navy installations, ports, Iron Dome system locations, and energy infrastructure such as the Hadera power plant. These activities were financially compensated with payments totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars, often facilitated through cryptocurrencies. “The operation involved photographing and documenting strategic sites, with the collected data being transferred to Iranian agents. Network members utilised advanced equipment procured specifically for these tasks under Iranian guidance.” The arrested were also allegedly tasked with collecting intelligence on several Israeli citizens at the behest of Iranian agents. This included conducting surveillance on targeted individuals. Some members were apprehended while attempting to gather intelligence on an Israeli citizen residing near their location, with security assessments indicating potential Iranian plans to harm this individual. The latest arrests, which follow previous recent arrests of Israeli citizens for allegedly spying fpor Iran, suggests that the well-developed intelligence operations run by Israel targeting Iran, Gaza and Hezbollah have not been a one way street, with Iran and its proxies also running operations in Israel. Israel’s security services have broken up a spy ring that was gathering information on behalf of Iranian intelligence in the latest attempt by Tehran to recruit Israelis for espionage, the Shin Bet and police said on Monday. Seven Israelis from Israel’s north, including the port city of Haifa, were arrested after an investigation found they had gathered intelligence on Israeli military bases and energy and port infrastructure, a joint Shin Bet and police statement said. Israeli police said the security breach was among the most serious ever seen by Israel, Reuters reported. “The assessment is that the activity of the members of the ring has caused security damage to the security of the state,” a senior source with the Shin Bet security service said. Iran’s foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. Israeli authorities are still preventing humanitarian missions from reaching areas of northern Gaza with critical supplies including medicine and food for people under siege, the head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa said on Monday. Hospitals have been hit and are without power while injured people are left without care, Philippe Lazzarini said on X. “@Unrwa remaining shelters are so overcrowded, some displaced people are now forced to live in the toilets. According to reports, people attempting to flee are getting killed, their bodies left on the street. Missions to rescue people from under the rubble are also being denied,” he added. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the Unrwa statement, Reuters reported. Fabian Hinz, a Middle East expert and missile analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank, described the leak as “quite damaging” because it reveals previously secret Israeli weapons and capabilities. The air-launched Golden Horizon ballistic missiles have never been disclosed before and so key details, their range, payload and degree of manoeuvrability mid-flight are unknown, he said. Because they would be launched from a long way away – possibly from over Iraqi airspace – “defending against them is quite difficult,” Hinz said, particularly for Iran whose air defence systems are not considered particularly robust. Israel was not known to possess a covert long-range drone, which the documents say is used for long-range reconnaissance. Its existing Heron and Hermes drones are thought to be vulnerable to Iranian detection, Hinz said. The US monitoring is described as sophisticated because a high degree of understanding is required to make sense of military movements as recorded by satellite imagery and other means. “Everybody knows spying happens. But when you have a country, the closest ally of Israel, shown publicly to be spying [on its ally], that’s embarrassing.” Germany on Monday demanded Israel “clarify every incident” involving the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon (Unifil), including the reported destruction of a Unifil observation tower and fence. UN peacekeepers on Sunday said an Israeli “army bulldozer deliberately demolished” a UN observation tower and fence in southern Lebanon. Israel launched ground and air attacks on Lebanon in September, saying it wanted to crush Hezbollah, a powerful political party and armed group. Berlin voiced “great concern” about the latest in a series of incidents reported by the Blue Helmet force, which have sparked international condemnation. The German government expects “the Israeli side to clarify every incident” and to release “the results of the investigations into this specific incident”, said foreign ministry spokesperson Kathrin Deschauer. “The safety of an operation mandated by the UN security council and its personnel must not be endangered,” she added. Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz has said the country and its military have “no intention” of harming the peacekeepers. Unifil has accused Israel of attacking their members multiple times in recent weeks. Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley early on Monday morning, striking buildings belonging to the Hezbollah-run banking institution Al-Qard Al-Hassan. At least 10 airstrikes were carried out in the southern suburbs of Beirut, with an entire building collapsing and a jet of fire streaming into the air in the Chiyah neighbourhood of greater Beirut. A building close to Lebanon’s only commercial airport was also struck, video footage showing a smoke plume billowing while a nearby airplane sat on the runway. “They struck empty buildings in residential neighbourhoods, and destroyed those surrounding neighbourhoods. These weren’t military centres or weapons caches,” Ma’an Khalil, the mayor of Ghobeiry municipality in the southern suburbs of Beirut, said. Flames and smoke rise form an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday. Israel issued several warnings via X prior to the bombings, pinpointing buildings belonging to Al-Qard Al-Hassan in the southern suburbs of Beirut and across Lebanon, warning people to move at least 500 metres away from these buildings. Streets from the affected areas were soon choked with traffic as people fled in anticipation of Israeli bombing. Al-Qard Al-Hassan has branches across Lebanon, with 15 in greater Beirut alone. French president Emmanuel Macron told Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he sees the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar as a chance for a possible new phase of negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza, Macron’s office said on Monday. Macron, whose government has had increasingly tense public exchanges with Israel over the past few weeks, also reiterated previous calls for ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza and condemnations of Israeli army action towards UN forces in Lebanon. Macron also expressed solidarity with Netanyahu after a drone was launched towards the prime minister’s home, the French president’s office said. US envoy Amos Hochstein said on Monday that a UN security council resolution that ended the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict would be the basis of a new ceasefire, but would require more than just commitments from the warring parties. “The commitment that we have is to resolve this conflict based on (UN Resolution) 1701 that is what the solution is going to have to look like,” Hochstein told reporters, adding that “both sides simply committing to 1701, is just not enough” after years of weak implementation. Arab League secretary general Ahmed Aboul Gheit said on Monday in Beirut that the league’s priority was to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon, and he called for Israel’s prompt withdrawal from any Lebanese territories it has occupied or entered. Aboul Gheit was also asked if Hezbollah could be destroyed, to which he replied: “You cannot destroy an idea.” After they burned down his family home in northern Gaza, Israeli troops separated Ramez al-Skafi from his family and detained him. They had a particular job in mind for him, he said. For the next 11 days in early July, the 30-year-old Palestinian said he was sent into one house after another in his home district, Shuja’iya, watched by his Israeli military minders. According to the account he gave the Guardian, they turned him into a human shield against booby-traps and Hamas gunmen. “I tried to resist their proposal, but they started beating me and the officer told me it was not my choice to make and that I have to do whatever they want,” Skafi said. “He told me that my work would be searching the houses and telling them information about the homeowners. After some extreme pressure, I was left no choice. “The next day I was told to go out on patrol with the Israeli soldiers, and I was very scared because of the tanks in front of me and the planes in the sky above me,” he continued. “When [his minders] noticed my fear, they assured me: ‘They know you are with us.’” US secretary of state Antony Blinken will depart for the Middle East on Monday, the state department said, as Washington is pushing to kickstart ceasefire negotiations to end the Gaza war after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The top US diplomat’s latest trip to the region, his eleventh since the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that triggered the Gaza war, comes even as Israel has intensified its military campaign in Gaza and in Lebanon against Iran-aligned militia Hezbollah. Blinken will discuss with regional leaders the importance of ending the Gaza war, ways to chart a post-conflict plan for the Palestinian territory, as well as how to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the state department said in a statement. The top diplomat’s trip will start with Israel, the state department said, but did not provide the other exact destinations. “Throughout the region, secretary Blinken will discuss the importance of bringing the war in Gaza to an end, securing the release of all hostages, and alleviating the suffering of the Palestinian people,” the state department said in a statement. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati said there was no alternative to UN Resolution 1701, but added that “new understandings” could be reached to implement it, a statement issued by his office cited him as saying on Monday. A UN peacekeeping mission is mandated by Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006, to help the Lebanese army keep its southern border area with Israel free of weapons or armed personnel other than those of the Lebanese state. Israeli forces blew up homes and besieged schools and shelters for displaced people on Monday as they deepened their operations in Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, residents and medics said. They also rounded up men and ordered women to leave the camp, they said. Medics at the Indonesian hospital told Reuters that Israeli troops stormed a school and detained the men before setting the facility ablaze. The fire reached the hospital generators and caused a power outage, they added. Health officials said they refused orders by the Israeli army, which began a new incursion into the north of the Palestinian territory over two weeks ago, to evacuate the three hospitals in the area or leave the patients unattended. Troops remained outside the hospital but did not enter, they said. Medics at a second hospital, Kamal Adwan, reported heavy Israeli fire near the hospital at night. “The army is burning the schools next to the hospital, and no one can enter or leave the hospital,” said one nurse at the Indonesian hospital, who asked not to be named. Palestinian health officials said 18 people had been killed in Jabalia and eight elsewhere in Gaza in Israeli strikes. The Israeli military has apologised over a strike that killed three Lebanese soldiers in southern Lebanon the previous day, AP reported. It said it is not battling the Lebanese military, and claimed its soldiers believed they were targeting a vehicle belonging to the Hezbollah militant group. Last week, Hezbollah said it is entering a new phase in its fight against invading Israeli troops, as the region reckoned with the killing of top Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in a battle with Israeli forces in Gaza. Up to 1,000 women and children needing medical care will shortly be evacuated from Gaza to Europe, the head of the World Health Organization’s Europe branch said in comments published on Monday. Israel, which is besieging the war-devastated Palestinian territory, “is committed to 1,000 more medical evacuations within the next months to the European Union,” Hans Kluge said in an interview with AFP. He said the evacuations would be facilitated by the WHO – the United Nations health agency – and the European countries involved. On Thursday, UN investigators said Israel was deliberately targeting health facilities in Gaza, and killing and torturing medical personnel there, accusing the country of “crimes against humanity”. Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative in the occupied Palestinian territories, said in May that about 10,000 people needed evacuating from Gaza for urgent medical care. The WHO Europe has already facilitated 600 medical evacuations from Gaza to seven European countries since the latest war began there in October 2023. “This would never have happened if we did not keep the dialogue [open],” Kluge said. “The same [is true] for Ukraine,” he added. “I keep the dialogue [open] with all partners. Iran has warned the UN nuclear watchdog about Israel’s threats against its nuclear sites, foreign ministry, spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday at a weekly news conference. Israel has vowed to attack Iran in retaliation for a volley of Iranian missiles launched on 1 October, leading to widespread speculation that Iran’s nuclear sites could be among Israel’s targets. “Threats to attack nuclear sites are against UN resolutions …. And are condemned … we have sent a letter about it to … the UN nuclear watchdog,” Baghaei said in the televised news conference. Ali Daher first heard the explosion and then he felt the pain. An Israeli aircraft loitering high above had shot two rockets at the building next door, collapsing the top two floors and showering him and his two sons with a deadly spray of concrete and jagged metal. The target of the strike was the Dar al-Salaam hotel – Arabic for “house of peace” – in the southern Lebanese town of Wardaniyah, converted in the last weeks into a government displacement centre for 24 families forced to flee their homes under Israeli bombing. Originally a German-Lebanese centre set up to promote cultural understanding, bronze statuettes and pieces of Lebanese antiquities had been pushed to the side to make room for mattresses and boxes of aid. The strike on 9 October killed five people and injured 12. It was the first time that Wardaniyah had been targeted by Israel, but was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on buildings hosting displaced people in parts of Lebanon thought to be safe and that have otherwise not seen any fighting. “We wanted to go somewhere safe, where there is no bombing, war or [militias], so we came here. Why did they strike here? We don’t know,” said Ali Daher, a 36-year-old mine clearance operator who was displaced from Tyre, south Lebanon, on 30 September. He held out his fractured wrist and pointed to his one-year-old son Kareem’s arm, which had been bandaged after a piece of debris tore it open. The effects are also being felt in Lebanese society, where local officials have said the fear of strikes have inflamed tensions between members of the country’s many sects and the largely Shia Muslim displaced, who they are afraid to welcome. Unconfirmed rumours of Hezbollah fighters hiding among the displaced have proliferated, despite the vast majority of displaced them being civilians. More than 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon over the last year, most of them since 23 September, when Israel escalated its aerial campaign over wide swathes of the country. Many have sought shelter in Christian and Druze-majority areas that had previously been spared Israeli bombing. US envoy Amos Hochstein will be in Beirut on Monday for talks with Lebanese officials on conditions for a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, two sources in Lebanon told Reuters, as Israel expanded its air campaign on the group’s assets overnight. Israeli strikes late on Sunday hit several branches of a financial institution linked to Hezbollah in Beirut, Lebanon’s south and the Bekaa valley, but no casualties were immediately reported. Israel has reportedly given the United States a document with its conditions for a diplomatic solution to end the war in Lebanon, Axios reported on Sunday, citing two US officials and two Israeli officials. Israel has demanded its IDF forces be allowed to engage in “active enforcement” to make sure Hezbollah doesn’t rearm and rebuild its military infrastructure close to the border, Axios reported, citing an Israeli official. Israel also demanded its air force have freedom of operation in Lebanese airspace, the report added. A US official told Axios it was highly unlikely that Lebanon and the international community would agree to Israel’s conditions. The US military has rushed its advanced anti-missile system to Israel and it is now “in place”, defence secretary Lloyd Austin said. THAAD, or the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, is a critical part of the US military’s layered air defence systems and adds to Israel’s already formidable anti-missile defences. “The THAAD system is in place,” Austin said, speaking to reporters before his arrival in Ukraine on Monday. He declined to say whether it was operational, but added: “We have the ability to put it into operation very quickly and we’re on pace with our expectations.” President Joe Biden said the THAAD’s deployment, along with about 100 US soldiers, was meant to help defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on 1 October. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the conflict in the Middle East. Israel launched a wave of attacks on buildings belonging to al-Qard al-Hassan, a US-sanctioned financial organisation that has more than 30 branches across Lebanon including 15 in densely populated parts of central Beirut and its suburbs. Lebanon’s national news agency reported 11 strikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs late on Sunday. Other strikes hit the association in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa valley and in the country’s south, NNA added. One strike hit close to Beirut’s airport. The Israeli military had earlier issued a warning that it would begin attacks on infrastructure belonging to the association and ordered people to evacuate those areas, causing panicked crowds and traffic jams to clog the streets of the Lebanese capital. Meanwhile, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) warned that Israel may be causing the “destruction of the Palestinian population in Gaza’s northernmost governate through death and displacement” with its latest military campaign there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has made life in north Gaza “impossible” for Palestinians, many of whom were already facing starvation, while also ordering their displacement and preventing supplies from entering, it said in a statement. Israel has “continued to relentlessly bomb and attack the area” making it “extremely dangerous” for civilians to flee, the body wrote, adding that it had received reports of civilians being deliberately targeted. It added: Many Palestinians in the north have also expressed fears that should they flee; they will never be allowed to return to their homes in north Gaza. Israel has attacked two of the three main hospitals in the area – which were already damaged in previous attacks – and also bombed schools serving as shelters for displaced people, with many casualties appearing to be women and children, the OHCHR said. The statement ended by reminding Israel of the provisional measures ordered by the international court of justice in January, which said Israel must ensure it did not commit acts of genocide in Gaza and reminded it that as an occupying power, it has a duty to ensure the provision of food, medicine and shelter to the population. The IDF have nominally held complete control of northern Gaza since January, but launched a new assault on the area two weeks ago that they said was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from regrouping. In other developments: Several Palestinians were reportedly killed and others injured late on Sunday when Israeli airstrikes hit two schools housing displaced people in Jabalia, the area in northern Gaza that Israel has placed under siege for more than two weeks. Other deadly Israeli attacks took place in Beit Lahia and Gaza City’s al-Tuffah neighbourhood, both in northern Gaza, and in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israeli forces have “deliberately demolished an observation tower and perimeter fence of a UN position in Marwahin,” Unifil said on Sunday. The UN peacekeeping mission added: “Yet again, we remind the IDF and all actors of their obligations to ensure the safety and security of UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises at all times.” The commander of the Israeli armoured brigade that was leading the Israeli offensive on Jabalia has been killed in northern Gaza, the Israeli military (IDF) has said. Col. Ehsan Daxa, the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade, is the highest ranking Israeli officer to have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the Palestinian territory last year, according to Israeli media. The US government is investigating an unauthorised release of classified documents that assess Israel’s plans to attack Iran. The US House speaker, Mike Johnson, confirmed the investigation in remarks to CNN’s State of the Union program on Sunday, saying “the leak is very concerning.” Médecins Sans Frontières has condemned Israel’s siege on the last remaining hospitals in Gaza, saying: “This is purely and simply a collective punishment imposed on Palestinians in Gaza, who must choose between being forcibly displaced from the North or killed. We fear that this will not stop.” Hezbollah said on Sunday that it launched rockets at Haifa in Israel after the latest Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon, Agence France-Presse reports. According to the group, its fighters launched a “rocket salvo” at the “city of Haifa,” adding that it was “in response to the aggressions on [Beirut’s] southern suburbs” from Sunday morning."

          "bodyText": "Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, has said the employment rights bill will be good for growth. Speaking during the opening of its second reading debate, she said an impact assessment published by the government today (see 3.48pm) made it clear the bill would have “a positive impact on growth and more than 10 million workers will benefit from Labour’s plan in every corner of this country”. She went on: And the money in their pockets will go back into the economy and will support businesses, in particular, those on the high street. But many Tory MPs pointed out that the official analysis said the impact of the bill on growth was uncertain, and that even if there was a positive effect, it would be small. (See 4.41pm.) They also highlighted figures saying the cost to business could be close to £5bn a year. Some NHS patients have received a “death sentence” due to delays within the health service, Wes Streeting has said, as Keir Starmer stressed the need for more use of AI and technology. Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting have launched a consultation on the future of the NHS. (See 9.13am.) In a post on social media, Streeting joked about some of the less serious responses already submitted. Thanks to @JackElsom for sending this idea for Wetherspoons in every hospital. Great idea, but sadly vetoed by the Chancellor during Budget negotiations. Thanks also to the person who suggested I be fired out of a cannon to raise money for the NHS. No Downing Street has said that Keir Starmer will not be offering reparations or an apology for Britain’s role in slavery at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting this week. (See 12.56pm.) The Serious Fraud Office is investigating the construction of a hotel and conference centre owned by the Unite union, the BBC is reporting. A Sinn Féin spokesperson has said that a party employee has resigned due to involvement in an incident where a DUP portrait was damaged at Belfast City Hall, PA Media reports. PA says: An investigation was launched after the official portrait of former DUP lord mayor Lord Browne of Belfast was damaged during an event at the weekend. A Sinn Féin spokesperson said: “Today, 21 October, a Sinn Féin employee, who works in the Assembly, made the party chief whip aware of their involvement in an incident regarding a portrait in Belfast City Hall which took place on Saturday 19th October. “The employee was immediately suspended, and we have notified the PSNI today. “The employee has now resigned from their employment and their party membership.” Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has said that the government’s anti-smoking bill will be “more ambitous” than the version introduced by the Conservatives before the general election. Rishi Sunak’s government published a tobacco and vapes bill that would have banned anyone born after 1 January 2009 from legally smoking by gradually raising the age at which tobacco can be bought. It did not become law because it ran out of time. Labour supported the Sunak bill, and in the king’s speech it promised to revive it. But Streeting is now considering using it to ban smoking in some outdoor public spaces, like pub gardens. In an interview earlier today, Streeting said the bill will be published before Christmas. He went on: When the smoking bill is introduced, it will be more ambitious than the bill introduced by the previous government. Keir Starmer has declined to comment on King Charles being heckled in Canberra by an Indigenous Australian senator. In an interview earlier today, when he was asked if this was '“disgraceful”, Starmer replied: Look, I think the King is doing a fantastic job, an incredible ambassador, not just for our country, but across the Commonwealth … and we should remember in the context of health, that he is out there doing his public service notwithstanding, you know, the health challenges he himself has had – so I think he’s doing a great job. James Cleverly, the shadow home secretary, has claimed that that the decision to give Taylor Swift police protection for concerts in London will encourage foreign VIPs to demand the same treatment. Speaking during Home Office questions in the Commons, Cleverly said: Having been home secretary I have on numerous occasions had to deal with a request from foreign VIPs for a level of protection that they demanded or requested but that we did not feel was appropriate. Does [the minister] recognise the difficult position that she has put her own foreign secretary into when those future requests come in and they have to be denied? When those individuals will pray in aid the protection package put in place for a rockstar. Jess Phillips, the Home Office minister who was responding to the question, defended the Swift decision, saying that her concerts were “cancelled in Vienna because of a terror threat that the CIA identified could harm tens of thousands of people”. Cleverly also repeated Tory claims that the Metropolitan police gave Swift an escort only because of pressure from ministers, and that ministers got free concert tickets as a thank you. Ministers have rejected these claims, saying ultimately the Met had the final say over a police escort. Referring to the role Swift’s mother was said to play in the negotiations with the Met and the government, Cleverly said: After the appalling results from recent negotiations with the BMA, the RMT and Mauritius, has [the minister] considered recruiting Taylor Swift’s mum as a government negotiator? Phillips said she would like to see Swift’s mum standing to be next Tory leader, because she would “really offer something that is not currently available”. At the afternoon Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson defended the employment rights bill. Asked about figures showing it would increase direct costs for business (see 3.48pm), the spokesperson said: What this bill represents is an investment by businesses, by employers into their employees. For too long, poor productivity, insecure work and broken industrial relations have held back the economy. Last year we saw the highest number of working days lost to strikes since the 1980s, costing the economy billions of pounds. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, is opening the debate on the employment rights bill. She said the impact assessment published by the government today says the legislation will be good for growth. But, in an early intervention, the Conservative MP Graham Stuart said that document just said the measures might be good for growth. And, if there was a postive impact on growth, it would be small in magnitude according to the document, Stuart said. In the executive summary of its economic analysis, the government says: We conclude the package could have a direct and positive impact on economic growth, but we expect this to be small. And here is the more considered conclusion, from paragraphs 168 and 169. On balance, we believe the impact on growth could be positive (i.e. the positive channels above outweigh the offsetting effects) but the direct impact would be small in magnitude. This is because the package is well targeted at low-paying sectors meaning that many of the channels covered above are less applicable for a large part of the economy. In addition, the evidence between employment rights and growth in the UK is limited, but where we do have strong, policy-specific evidence it often indicates that the policy has had a negligible effect on growth. For example, the national living wage, which has imposed a similar magnitude of costs on a similar part of the labour market in recent years as we expect the bill to have, has had a limited impact on productivity and participation (and by extension growth) in either direction. It is right that there is evidence linking flexible working to stronger productivity and this change will boost productivity for some workers and some employers, but the increase in uptake of ‘making flexible working the default’ is relatively small compared to the number of people employed and therefore, at a macroeconomic level, the impact on average productivity will be small. Whilst we conclude that the direct impact would be small, it is likely that by boosting protections and the quality of work for the poorest in the labour market, the package will enhance lower-paid workers’ share in the benefits of growth and boost equality in work. This is more than just good for equality; it could be good for the economy too as there is evidence that equality is important for ‘sustainable’ growth over the long-term. For example, the OECD note that higher inequality can lead to underinvestment in human capital and weaker adoption of technologies. They estimate that as a result of rising inequality between 1990 and 2010 output in the UK was almost nine percentage points lower than it could have otherwise been. As a result, by increasing the security, quality and equality of work, it’s possible that the bill could also indirectly support the government’s mission to grow the economy beyond a small direct impact, helping to raise living standards across the country. Suella Braverman forwarded government documents to her private email accounts on at least 127 occasions when she was attorney general, according to a story by George Greenwood at the Times. The Attorney General’s Office disclosed the figure after a lengthy Freedom of Information battle culminated in a tribunal finding against the government. Braverman, who became home secretary after serving as attorney general but who was sacked from the Home Office for sending a government document from her personal email address, did not respond to a request from the Times for comment. Greenwood said that sending documents to her personal email address when she was attorney general may have been a breach of the ministerial code. He says: A Freedom of Information request submitted by The Times has now revealed that [Braverman] was forwarding such correspondence routinely while serving as the government’s top legal officer between 2021 and 2022. The 127 emails had at least 290 documents attached. Ministers are banned from sharing sensitive emails and documents about government business with their private accounts because weak security provisions put them at greater risk of unauthorised access. It is not known whether Braverman forwarded sensitive or official documents to her personal account. The Attorney General’s Office (AGO) did not respond to a request for comment. Commenting on the economic analysis of the employment rights bill published by the government today (see 3.48pm), Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said: Despite repeated attempts to paint this bill as bad for business, this rigorous impact assessment shows that the business costs are negligible and are more than offset by the wider economic and social gains. These changes will mostly affect those companies whose business models have been built on low-paid, insecure employment. Decent employers will welcome these measures and the improvements they will bring for their businesses and workforces. The Department for Business and Trade has said the benefits of the employment rights bill will justify the costs it will impose on business amounting to nearly £5bn per year. It has set out this assessment in an economic analysis of the bill, published alongside 24 regulatory impact assessment setting out the direct costs of the measures included in the legislation. The bill, which is getting its second reading in the Commons this afternoon, has been described as “the biggest overhaul of workers rights in generations”. It will significantly strengthen workers’ rights. In its economic analysis, the government says that some of these new regulations will impose new costs on business. We expect the policies covered within the bill to impose a direct cost on business equivalent to low billion pounds per year. If we take the top-end of the range from our broad order of magnitude cost to business estimates in tables A3, A4, and A5 to get the maximum likely cost this sum to £4.5bn [sic]. As such, we are confident that the total direct cost to business will be less than £5bn annually. This represents a cautious assessment, and we expect the total cost to business to be refined downwards as our evidence improves and the policy development continues Nevertheless, to contextualise the size of this impact, total wage costs in the UK were £1.3 trillion in 2023 in nominal terms, meaning that an annual cost of up to £5bn is equivalent to an uplift of the UK’s total pay bill of up to 0.4%. This cost will be concentrated on employers in lower paid sectors, but even if we assumed all of this cost falls on such sectors, then hypothetically the equivalent uplift in the wage bill for that part of the economy would be up to 1.5%. The report says the empirical evidence about who would pay the cost of stronger employment protections is “ambiguous”. It says firms might pass on higher costs to customers. If they cannot do that, they might cut investment or training costs, or cut employment costs, it says. But the report says giving workers more rights will cut the number of days lost to stress, depression and anxiety, which it implies will more or less compensate for the increase in direct costs. It says: There will be further benefits for those in work from better job satisfaction, as well as improved wellbeing and health, which could be amount to billions of pounds a year. This will benefit their employers too as 17.1 million working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety in 2022/233 , equivalent to over £5bn of lost output. And the report says, overall, the impact of the bill will be positive. There are clear, evidence-based benefits of government action through the bill. Not acting would enable poor working conditions, insecure work, inequalities and broken industrial relations to persist. The bill will strengthen working conditions for the lowest-paid and most vulnerable in the labour market, increasing fairness and equality across Britain. It will have significant positive impacts on workers who are trapped in insecure work, face discrimination, or suffer from unscrupulous employer behaviour like ‘fire and refire’ practices. [See 2.52pm.] Many policy changes in the bill will target the issues identified by the independent Taylor review of modern working practices. Workers in adult social care, those covered by collective bargaining agreements, those grieving a loss of a loved family member, and those struggling to make work fit in around other commitments will also be notable beneficiaries … The package will be significantly positive for society (i.e., the benefits will outweigh the costs) if policy implementation is well-targeted, and the risks of unintended consequences are mitigated through consultation and policy design. We intend to refine this assessment as policy development continues. Inspectors have raised serious concerns about the care provided to child asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats, including babies who have had their fingerprints scanned and lone children left to sleep on mats on the floor. A report published today by HM Inspectorate of Prisons on short-term holding facilities in Kent, including Manston, Western Jet Foil and two Kent Intake Units, found that overall there had been improvements and improved management of new arrivals. However serious concerns are flagged about the welfare of the new arrivals, especially children. Detainees are given wrist tags with QR codes and fingerprints are repeatedly scanned including babies. The Home Office did not always keep correct records of the length of time people were detained, with one person held for 106 hours incorrectly recorded as detained for 51 hours. New arrivals are supposed to be held for a maximum of 24 hours. One ten year-old Afghan boy asked for a phone so he could call his mum but was told that would not be possible while a 15-year-old girl who said she had been sold to traffickers was interviewed without an appropriate adult. Some Border Force staff and cleaners working on the frontline had not been DBS checked and one contractor was sacked for aggressively pulling a sleeping child to their feet and making disparaging comments to them. There were examples of children being woken up at night to be interviewed with one child interviewed at 1.20am. Inspectors said that at Kent Intake Unit in Dover some of the lone child arrivals were very young ‘and had obviously been fitted on arrival with wrist tags with QR codes”. Here is our latest Politics Weekly podcast. It features Pippa Crerar and Kiran Stacey talking about the NHS consultation, and about next week’s budget. Workers in some of the lowest-paid and most insecure jobs could gain an extra £600 a year from the measures in the employment rights bill being debated later, the government claims. In a news release, the Department for Business and Trade says: Poor productivity, insecure work, and broken industrial relations have been holding back the British economy for too long. Last year the country saw the highest number of working days lost to strikes since the 1980s – costing the economy millions of pounds. This has entrenched a culture of brinkmanship that only serves to damage public services, public finances, and public faith in institutions. Today is a significant step in putting an end to that – as the Employment Rights Bill reaches its second reading, alongside a package of consultations to help inform its next steps. This includes a consultation on our new approach to Statutory Sick Pay, where the Bill will be removing the waiting period and the Lower Earnings Limit. The Bill is expected to benefit people in some of the most deprived areas of the country by saving them up to £600 in lost income from the hidden costs of insecure work. Around 2.4 million people in the UK work irregular patterns like zero or low hours contracts or agency jobs, where insecure hours can mean forking out on expensive childcare or transport to cover last-minute shifts - or losing out altogether if work is changed or cancelled at short notice. New protections like guaranteed hours and giving reasonable notice or compensation for lost work will help shift workers keep up to £600 a year, including workers in the North and Midlands where irregular work is highest. For a cleaner working night shifts on an average annual wage of £21,058, a £600 saving would be worth over £250 more a year than the last two national insurance cuts. MPs will debate the second reading of the employment rights bill later this afternoon. To coincide with the debate, the Department for Business and Trade has published more than 20 impact assessments relating to the bill. I will post more on what they say shortly. A “maximum BMI for nurses” and an “NHS TV channel” are just some of the suggestions put forward as officials launched a national consultation on the future of the health service, PA Media reports. PA says: Hundreds of suggestions were put forward in the hours after the consultation was officially launched by ministers on Monday. Billed as “the biggest national conversation about the future of the NHS since its birth”, members of the public will be able to share their views online via change.NHS.uk until the start of next year. Topics of conversation include streamlining management, providing better pay for NHS workers, improving access to dentistry and social care, among others. One contributor called for an NHS TV channel “for patients to access physiotherapy exercise sessions for various conditions”. Another called for free parking in hospitals while others suggested that the service should prescribe gym memberships to help tackle the nation’s obesity crisis. Some of the suggestions need to be taken with a pinch of salt, such as one contributor calling for all doctors to be given “Doctor Who” name badges. One contributor called for free cinema tickets “on the NHS”. Another said that staff “should lead by example” as they said that the NHS should introduce a maximum BMI score for nurses. There are other examples of joke responses at 1.29pm. In an interview with Sky News, NHS England’s national medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis defended the consultation exercise. Asked about previous public engagement activities, such as the public poll which saw Boaty McBoatface emerge as the winning choice for the naming of a polar research ship (it was vetoed and named RRS Sir David Attenborough instead), Powis said: I’m really confident that patients and staff often have the solutions to problems. I visit many, many health organisations, whether it’s in general practice or in hospitals, every week and I’m always struck that staff and patients have ideas, they have great ideas. Our job is to capture them, to test them, and where they work, to ensure that we roll them out as quickly as possible. So I’m very confident that there will be a lot of great ideas coming out of this listening exercise. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesperson was asked about the plan for digital “patient passports”, and what would be done to stop random NHS employees being able to read the records. Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, came under pressure when asked about this on the Today programme. (See 9.43am.) Asked about the same issue, the spokesperson said: The data bill will introduce strong security protocols to protect data, and all NHS organisations have got strong governance arrangements in place. But what this data bill will also do is transform patients’ experience, and that is obviously putting patients at the heart of our reforms. But the spokesperson also said that any data shared with organisations outside the NHS for medical research purposes would be anonymised. There would also be security protocols too, he said. He went on: But we do think that there is significant opportunity in this space, within those parameters and with those strict controls, to drive research and game-changing innovations that will ultimately be a benefit to patients in the NHS. Some journalists have been monitoring responses to the NHS consultation launched by Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting this morning, and they’re noting that not everyone is engaging seriously. From the Times’s Chris Smyth From Katy Balls at the Spectator From Christian Calgie at the Express And these are from James Ball from the New European I’d imagine somewhere in the Department of Health there is a civil servant currently feeling *extremely* vindicated over their attempt to explain why consultation responses aren’t usually just immediately made public. (Among the many reasons is that they’re extremely game-able by pressure groups, who think flooding them with similar responses is in any way useful, etc) At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson was also asked if Keir Starmer agreed that Britain was historically guilty of genocide in Australia, as an Indigenous Australian senator said when she hecked King Charles at Parliament House in Canberra. Lidia Thorpe told Charles: You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us – our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. Asked if Britain was guilty of genocide in Australia, the spokesperson said he would not be drawn on comments made in relation to royal matters. But he said Britain’s relationship with Australia was “fantastic” and that it was a key ally. As Eleni Courea reports, Keir Starmer is under pressure from Labour MPs and Caribbean governments to open the door to reparatory justice when he travels to Samoa this week. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokesperson said the government remained opposed to the idea of paying reparations for Britain’s historic role in the slave trade. The spokesperson also said there would be no apology at the Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) this week. He said: Reparations are not on the agenda for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. The government’s position on this has not changed, we do not pay reparations. The prime minister’s attending this week’s summit to discuss shared challenges and opportunities faced by the Commonwealth including driving growth across our economies. Asked about an apology, the spokesperson said: The position on apology remains the same. We won’t be offering an apology at Chogm, but we will continue to engage with partners on the issues as we work with them to tackle the pressing challenges of today and indeed for the future generations. Most voters will back a rise in employers’ national insurance contributions if the money goes towards the NHS, according to polling commissioned by a Labour thinktank. The YouGov polling suggests that, when people are just asked if they approve or disapprove of a rise in employers’ NICs, they disapprove by 40% to 30%. But when people are asked if they would approve this tax going up to fund healthcare and the NHS, they are in favour by 69% to 18%. People who voted Labour at the election are even more supportive, with 85% of them approving of the idea, the polling suggests. And people who voted Labour in the 2024 election having voted Conservative in 2019 are also 82% in favour. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, has strongly hinted that employers’ NICs will go up in the budget. She has said that this tax was not covered by the Labour manifesto promise not to put up national insurance generally. The polling was commissioned by Labour Together, a thintank and campaign group partly set up by Morgan McSweeney, who is now Keir Starmer’s chief of staff. It is focused on prompting policies that will help the party to carry on winning elections. YouGov also explored what other reasons might make people support a rise in employers’ NICs. Extra money for health was by far the most powerful motivator, but people would also back employers’ NICs going up if told the money would be used for education, for tax cuts or for the police. But if told the money was going on defence, on cutting the national debt or on giving public sectors a pay rise, they were not in favour. Matt Upton, director of policy at Labour Together, said: Time and time again in polls and focus groups, voters across the country have told us that Labour must deliver on their key priorities: the NHS and cost of living. If it doesn’t, it faces prompt dismissal at the next election. This polling shows that voters are overwhelmingly willing to back a potential tax rise like this on business, if the money is spent on the things they care most about. Crucially for Labour strategists, support for this is even higher among those who switched from the Tories in 2019 to Labour in 2024. This group, though small in number, were decisive at this election and will be again at the next one if Labour is to win a second term. Robert Jenrick, the Tory leadership candidate, has called for manadory life sentences for members of grooming gangs. In an interview with GB News, he said: The public want action now. They are sick of this. This is a moral stain on our country, that thousands of children have been abused in this way and public officials have turned a blind eye to it. What we need is action now to try to eliminate this, because only a fool would believe this isn’t happening today on our streets somewhere in our country. What I want to see are mandatory life sentences for these despicable predators, so that you’re not out in 14 years, as the current law suggests, or less, but actually you’re never out of prison again. I want those of these predators who are not British citizens to be removed from our country with compulsory deportations, and the public officials who turn a blind eye for fear of racism or community relations, I want them to be prosecuted and barred from working in the public sector ever again. A former council chief executive who had to apologise for attacking monarchists as bigots and xenophobes has been appointed the Scottish National party’s acting chief executive. Carol Beattie, the former chief executive at Stirling council, was given the post by the SNP national executive on Saturday less than a day after Murray Foote, suddenly quit as the party’s chief executive. Beattie sparked controversy after criticising an article about Kate Middleton’s return to public duties following her cancer diagnosis by claiming “intelligent people don’t support the monarchy”. Those that do, she added, “use them as symbols of their bigotry or xenophobic values”. Her tweets emerged last month after Beattie stood as the SNP’s candidate for a byelection in Falkirk, which was held last week, only six months after she stood down as Stirling council’s lead official. The SNP has consistently stayed clear of republicanism, to avoid alienating pro-monarchy votes. She said: “I apologise for any offence caused by the language I used and have removed the tweets.” Keith Brown, the SNP’s deputy leader, said: She brings considerable experience to the role and her appointment will continue the work, under John Swinney’s leadership, to ensure a professional, modern, dynamic election-winning organisation. The SNP remains the dominant political force in Scotland, and Carol Beattie’s appointment will ensure we remain equipped for the tasks ahead. Beattie narrowly lost the Falkirk South byelection to Labour’s Claire Aitken last Thursday. It had been called after the incumbent, Euan Stainbank, was elected as a Labour MP in July – the party’s youngest Scottish MP at 24. Scotland uses proportional voting in council elections. In a signal that Labour support is being hit by the winter fuel payment cuts and the controversies over Keir Starmer’s clothes and glasses donations, Beattie gained the most votes in the first round of voting, 1,043 – 29 votes more than Aitken. Aitken took the seat in the seventh round of voting. Craig Hoy, the Scottish Conservative chair, said: The murky appointment of Carol Beattie highlights the level of chaos unfolding within the scandal-ridden SNP. Despite saying he would stay on until a permanent replacement was found, Murray Foote obviously couldn’t leave fast enough from the turmoil of the SNP. In the past the weirdest budget tradition was the convention that the chancellor is allowed to drink alcohol while delivering the budget speech. But since no chancellor has taken advantage of the rule since the 1990s (and no one expects Rachel Reeves to be quaffing on Wednesday week), this tradition is probably best viewed as lapsed. But Sam Coates from Sky News has discovered another weird budget ritual. On his Politics at Jack and Sam’s podcast, he says: Someone messaged me to say: ‘Did you know that over in the Treasury as they’ve been going over all these spending settlements, in one of the offices, its full of balloons. And every time an individual department finalises its settlements, one of the balloons is popped.’ Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has revived claims that some patients are receiving a “death sentence” because of the problems with the NHS. Speaking at a health centre in east London, where he was launching the consultation on the future of the NHS (see 9.13am) alongside Keir Starmer, Streeting said: There couldn’t be a more important time for us to have this conversation. The NHS is going through what is objectively the worst crisis in its history, whether it’s people struggling to get access to their GP, dialling 999 and an ambulance not arriving in time, turning up to A&amp;E departments and waiting far too long, sometimes on trolleys in corridors, or going through the ordeal of knowing that you’re waiting for a diagnosis that could be the difference between life and death. Worse still, receiving a prognosis that amounts to a death sentence that could have been avoided because the NHS didn’t reach you in time. That is, I’m afraid, the daily reality in the NHS today. Streeting also said the consultation was important because the best ideas for NHS reform would not come from Whitehall. He said: We feel really strongly that the best ideas aren’t going to come from politicians in Whitehall. They’re going to come from staff working right across the country and, crucially, patients, because our experiences as patients are also really important to understanding what the future of the NHS needs to be and what it could be with the right ideas. Streeting has used the term “death sentence” before in relation to patients’ experience of the NHS (normally in relation to cancer, because some cancer survival rates are worse than in comparable countries). It has been reported that some NHS leaders don’t like this language because they worry it will deter patients and undermine staff morale. But in his speeech to Labour’s conference Streeting doubled down, claiming it was important to tell the truth because otherwise he would be “killing [the NHS] with kindness”. Robert Jenrick, who is seen as the underdog behind Kemi Badenoch in the Tory leadership contest, has said that if he wins, Conservative candidiates at the next election will have to support his plan for Britain to leave the European convention on human rights. In an interview on Radio 4’s Westminster Hour last night, he said: If we were lucky enough to win the next general election, then this would be part of our manifesto. So yes, it would be Conservative party policy, and those choosing to stand at the election would have to support it, as they do any other important policy that’s part of the manifesto. Jenrick has already said Tory MPs would have to back the policy if they wanted to take a post in his shadow cabinet. Requiring candidates at the next election to declare in favour of ECHR withdrawal goes even further, and would probably be a step too far for some current Conservative MPs. In his Westminster Hour interview, Jenrick also criticised Badenoch’s decision not to announce policy plans at this point. Badenoch says that there is no point announcing policy so far ahead of the next general election, and that it is more important for the party to decide its values and principles. (This has not stopped her saying she would reverse Labour’s imposition of VAT on private school fees.) Commenting on Badenoch’s approach, Jenrick said: I think it’s disrespectful to the members and the public to ask for their votes without saying where you stand on the big issues facing our country today. A plan today is what I offer. A promise of a plan at some point in the future is what my opponent offers, and I don’t think that’s the way to rebuild the public’s trust and confidence in us. Keir Starmer has defended plans to digitalise records in the NHS. Speaking at an event in east London to launch the consultation on the future of the NHS (see 9.13am), he said: There are some obvious things that I think we do need to do. We need to go from analogue to digital, we need to use much better technology, whether that is in the ambulance service, in our hospitals, in our neighbourhoods, making much more use of technology. He also said NHS workers had a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reshape the service for the future. Addressing claims that the government should be starting NHS reform now, instead of consulting, Starmer told health staff: We want to hear from you and from as wide a number of people as possible, both in the NHS and people who are using the NHS, because this needs to be the once-in-a-generation opportunity for you to put your fingerprints on the future – literally to craft the service that you are working for. This is a really important conversation to create that NHS of the future, a moment in our history. Andy Street, the Conservative former West Midlands mayor, has hinted that he may decline to vote for either of the two candidates left in the Tory leadership contest. Kemi Badenoch, who is seen as the favourite, and Robert Jenrick are both now firmly on the right of the party. Street, who was West Midlands mayor for seven years until he was narrowly defeated by Labour in May, is on the opposite wing of the party, and is seen as a “moderate” or “centrist”. In an interview on the Today programme, asked if he would say who he was backing in the leadership contest, Street replied: I’ve got my ballot paper. But you’re not going to get me to do that, I’m afraid. I was clear before the previous two rounds that I wanted a candidate from the centre, the moderate part of the party. I backed Tom Tugendhat publicly. I’m not going to back anyone publicly now. Asked if he would be backing either of the two candidates privately (ie, voting for one of them), Street replied: I will decide that myself. The answer to that is private. Asked if he thought either Badenoch or Jenrick could represent the future of the party, he replied: “Maybe.” If Street does boycott the contest, he won’t be alone. As Jessica Elgot reported last week, polling suggests 15% of Conservative councillors won’t vote in the contest because they do not like the choice on offer. Here are social media posts from two journalists about the plan for digital “patient passports” in the NHS. From John Burn-Murdoch, the Financial Times’ chief data reporter Everyone saying “no we can’t let the NHS use a proper joined up digital patient database, it’s all part of a plot to privatise British healthcare and sell your data” should be forced to read the dozens (hundreds?) of case studies like these From Jim Waterson, the former Guardian journalist who now writes the London Centric newsletter on Substack I hate doing personal posts but: When my mum was dying last year, NHS data sharing failures and prioritising GDPR over pain relief repeatedly left her in agony. In desperation I began to build a Google Doc of her records linked to a QR code for doctors to scan. System’s broken. Claims that Nicola Sturgeon has been banned from attending Alex Salmond’s memorial service have been rejected as “premature” by Kenny MacAskill, the acting leader of Alba, the former first minister’s nationalist party. The Sunday Mail reported at the weekend an Alba source saying there was “not a chance in hell” that Sturgeon would be invited, given the pair’s incendiary split over the allegations of sexual misconduct against Salmond. Sturgeon and Salmond have not spoken since the allegations emerged following a Scottish government inquiry in 2018. Salmond had repeatedly accused her aides of orchestrating a smear campaign against him – claims Sturgeon has consistently dismissed. In a statement rejecting the Sunday Mail’s claims, MacAskill said: Now is the time for Alex’s family to be given the privacy and time to grieve the loss of a beloved husband, brother and uncle. An announcement will be made in the coming days about arrangements for a private funeral to be attended by his family and close friends. There will be time in the coming weeks to celebrate his life and commemorate his achievements in a memorial service, the family have yet to make any arrangements for that. All other speculation is premature. Salmond’s family are expecting to hold a private funeral for the former first minister in his home village of Strichen, Aberdeenshire, next week, where he will also be buried. No date has yet been fixed for a memorial service, though some allies have suggested St Andrew’s Day on 30 November. It remains unclear whether Sturgeon would expect to be invited. Salmond told a BBC Scotland documentary which aired last month: “It’s a big regret that Nicola and I are no longer on speaking terms and I seriously doubt if it’s going to improve.” Stephen Kinnock, the care minister, was giving interviews this morning on behalf of the government. He was promoting the consultation on the future of the NHS, but many of the questions he took were about the government’s plans for a digital “patient passport”, ensuring people’s medical records are all available in one place, through the NHS app. Pippa Crerar and Denis Campbell explain that here. Kinnock sought to play down concerns that people’s data would be at risk. But, in an interview with Mishal Husain on the Today programme, he was could not give her firm assurances on this point. When Husain asked if people’s patient records would be available to all 1.5 million NHS employees under the government’s plans, Kinnock said the protocols would be set out in the forthcoming data bill. He went on: We’re absolutely committed to protecting data, and we need the cyber security in place. Of course, one of the problems is the NHS uses Excel XP which is not conducive to the most modern cyber security techniques. We’ve got to modernize the tech. Husain said protecting data from cyber attacks was a diferent matter, and she again asked if all NHS employees would be able to access someone’s medical records. Kinnock replied: What we’re proposing is no different to online banking apps. So this is definitely more NatWest than it is Star Trek. This is a system that is going to be based on common sense, on enabling a single patient record. In the end, if we don’t modernise the NHS, make it more efficient and productive, you can have the best data protection rules in the world, but you not going to have a health and care system that actually works. Husain tried twice more to get a clear answer about the restrictions on NHS staff accessing individuals’ records. Kinnock did not say in detail how the system would work, but he said ultimately it was a matter of balance. You’ve got to have a system that works and that enables the hugely important interface between GPS, hospitals and patients, and to create that single patient record. That has to be balanced against water tight data protection, and that is the balance that we’re going to strike. But if you constantly just say, we can’t do this because of data protection concerns, you’re just going to have the status quo going on and on and on, and you’re going to have a system that doesn’t work. Michael Gove has said that the most hurtful part of his political career was the attacks on his former wife, Sarah Vine, Peter Walker reports. Good morning. When the Labour government came into power, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, declared on his first day in office “the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken”. The government is going to publish a 10-year health plan to fix it, and it is due to be published next spring. Streeting has said the plan will involve three main elements: moving from analogue to digital; more focus on primary care, not hospital care; and more focus on prevention. Keir Starmer explained them in a speech on the NHS in September. But today the government is asking people who work in the NHS and use it – the “entire nation”, as the Department of Health and Social Care puts it in its news release – to contribute to a consultation how health service should change. The DHSC explains: Members of the public, as well as NHS staff and experts will be invited to share their experiences views and ideas for fixing the NHS via the online platform, change.nhs.uk, which will be live until the start of next year, and available via the NHS App. The public engagement exercise will help shape the government’s 10 Year Health Plan which will be published in spring 2025 and will be underlined by three big shifts in healthcare - hospital to community, analogue to digital, and sickness to prevention … Bold ambitions for the NHS can only be achieved by listening to the expertise and knowledge of its 1.54 million strong workforce. Their understanding of what’s holding them back from performing at their best will help us bring down waiting times and provide the world class care the public deserve. The government has already taken immediate action to address challenges in the health service and deliver an NHS fit for the future. Whether that’s agreeing a deal with resident doctors within weeks, securing a funding increase for GP practices to manage rising pressures or hiring an extra 1,000 GPs into the NHS by the end of this year, there are both short- and long-term reforms working hand in hand. Streeting has posted a link to the online consultation page on social media. Governments launch consultations for various reasons. Clearly, when ministers are making big changes to large, important institutions, it makes sense to find out first what the public think, and occasionally these exercise throw up ideas overlooked by the thinktank, policy-making world. But that is not the only, or even the main, function of these initiatives like this. Ensuring people feel consulted can be just as important as finding out what they think. More importantly, this is also about pitch-rolling – persuading people that an issue matters, and that change is needed. The public don’t need to be told that the NHS needs rescuing; it is regularly at or near the top of problems that people say matter to them most, according to polling. But we are less than two weeks away from a budget that is set to raise the tax burden by a record amount in cash terms (not necessarily as a proportion of GDP) and it is very, very important for the government to convince people that this is happening for reason (like fixing the broken NHS) and not just out of profligacy. Gordon Brown was the master of this; when he put up national insurance to raise money for the NHS, it turned out to be one of the most popular tax rises ever. Today’s NHS consultation is probably more about budget framing than about a scramble for ideas to pad out next year’s 10-year plan. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, are visiting a health centre in London to launch their public consultation on the NHS’s future. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.20pm: Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 3.30pm: Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, opens the Commons debate on the second reading of the employment rights bill.

          "headline": "Fujitsu and Post Office clash over new rules on Horizon data requests",
          "bodyText": "Fujitsu has begun forcing the Post Office to disclose whether Horizon data requests will be used to investigate a branch owner-operator for “any impropriety”, prompting objections from the state-owned body’s executives. The development emerged in documents shown to the public inquiry into how hundreds of branch owner-operators were wrongfully pursued through the courts based on evidence from Horizon that was later found to be unreliable. The documents show that Fujitsu – which developed the IT system, still runs it for the Post Office and controls access to all transactional records from branches – added two new questions to its data request form in May. The inquiry heard last week that Fujitsu made it a mandatory, non-negotiable requirement for the Post Office to provide the additional information when making a request for audit record query (ARQ) data. The first question, at the start of the form, asked whether the use of the data would be “related to the investigation of, or action taken or intended to be taken, by the Post Office against a postmaster or post office worker in connection with potential fraud, theft, breach of contract or any other impropriety which is suspected to have occurred at relevant post office branches”. The second question asked whether the data would be used to help a branch owner-operator or post office worker achieve financial redress through one of the compensation schemes being run by Post Office and the government. The counsel for the inquiry asked Simon Oldnall, the branch technology director responsible for the IT systems at the Post Office, about the Post Office’s opposition to the new questions. “Fujitsu effectively unilaterally imposed these questions on the Post Office,” Oldnall said. “We felt particularly the first question was very, very broad. The second question, Fujitsu were well aware of why we were requesting lots and lots of data for [financial] redress. Overall we didn’t think the mandatory changes were necessary.” Asked by counsel what the Post Office found so objectionable about the questions, Oldnall said: “The Post Office doesn’t take action against postmasters, so it doesn’t really stand even as a question. It felt very broadly worded and not relevant to how Post Office operates today.” The enforced change instituted by Fujitsu came at the same time as a spat between the Post Office and the software company over the use of IT data to support a criminal case against a post office owner. The issue was rapidly escalated to Paul Patterson, the chief executive of Fujitsu Europe, who wrote directly to the Post Office chief executive, Nick Read. Patterson wrote in May this year that he had “serious concerns” about the Post Office continuing to pursue enforcement against branch operators “and expects Fujitsu to support such actions”. Read responded that there had been a “fundamental misunderstanding” and that the contact had been to prompt Fujitsu to cooperate with a police investigation. Patterson said that the nature of how the request had been made by the investigations team had been “entirely inappropriate”, and said the Post Office continued to have “significant cultural issues”. It has also emerged that the Post Office is exploring an eventual resumption of the practice of taking branch owner-operators to court for the civil recovery of losses. On Tuesday last week, the inquiry was shown another document, titled Loss Recovery Update, from this summer. Under the “options and recommendations” section, the Post Office highlighted the “significant financial risk” of continuing to write off shortfalls in branches instead of pursuing them. It also said that the current practice of not pursuing a shortfall unless a post office operator is in agreement could lead to “an environment likely to embed improper financial behaviours/practices in the network of postmasters, if there is no sanction or consequence for failing to follow the proper policies or procedures”. Horizon data would be required to pursue financial shortfalls from post office operators. Oldnall, who said he was aware of the document and of the “activity” around a change in loss recovery strategy, said that in order for data to be used for such purposes he would have to “commission a piece of work” internally. The inquiry will break this week and next, but will continue hearing evidence from Monday 4 November."

          "bodyText": "This is where we’ll wrap up the blog for the day, but first a recap of the main events: The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said “the worst is behind us” when it comes to inflation. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has defended the housing plan to rezone affluent areas. And stamp duty for off-the-plan homes is being slashed in a stimulus bid. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government will accelerate the pace of an auction system that helps underwrite the rollout of renewables. Sydney’s Entertainment Quarter at Moore Park is set for redevelopment, with the state government opening a tender process for its long-term lease. Qantas was ordered to pay $170,000 to three workers illegally sacked at start of pandemic. The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, registered the purchase of a plane. Hephner the alpaca met King Charles at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. A man was arrested outside the Australian War Memorial, where King Charles and Queen Camilla were visiting earlier. Senator Lidia Thorpe turned her back on King Charles and Queen Camilla as they stood to attention for the national anthem at a parliamentary reception in Canberra. Thorpe was then removed from the reception after yelling “you stole from us” at king. Thorpe said she had intended to hand the king “a notice of complicity in genocide”. The Australian Monarchist League demanded Thorpe’s resignation after her “failed attempt to disrupt His Majesty the King” at Parliament House this afternoon. The live news blog will be back tomorrow morning. Charles marvels at rainforest gully in botanic gardens In their last formal event in Canberra during this visit at the Australian National Botanic Gardens, King Charles walked down a path of rocky stairs into the rainforest gully with the head of the gardens, Dr Rebecca Pirzl. He held tightly to the rail and at the bottom of the steep stairs, paused touching a large tree and looked up into its canopy. As Queen Camilla made her way down the steps cautiously in her heels, the king told Pirzl “it’s extraordinary” while looking down the gully, which features plants from the diverse rainforests from Tasmania to Queensland. The king and queen walked along the lower boardwalk in the gully, Charles initially striding off quickly before Camilla called to him to slow down. They paused for photos before making their way up more rocky steps to the tree planting location. The Liberal candidate for Pittwater, Georgia Ryburn, has conceded the NSW state electorate to the independent candidate, Jacqui Scruby. Ryburn was not expected to win Saturday’s byelection by the time counting finished on the night, and this afternoon said she had called Scruby to congratulate her. In a post on her Instagram account, Ryburn said: I have just called Jacqui Scruby to concede and congratulate her. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t extremely disappointed. This wasn’t the outcome I had hoped for, but I know this isn’t the end of the road. I am extremely grateful to be your Liberal candidate for Pittwater, and am humbled by the amazing support from the Pittwater community and the Liberal party. Ryburn’s career as deputy mayor of the Northern Beaches council was cut short by her party’s failure to lodge the paperwork to nominate more than a third of its candidates for the recent local government elections. The Climate 200-backed Scruby secured a historic 22% swing against the Liberal party when she ran for Pittwater at the 2023 state election. She lost by only 606 votes to the Liberals’ Rory Amon, who triggered the byelection when he resigned less than halfway through his first term as Pittwater MP. Amon quit NSW parliament after being charged in August with 10 child sexual assault offences. He has denied all charges. King and queen plant snow gums King Charles and Queen Camilla each took part in the royal tradition of planting a tree in Canberra today. The governor general escorted the king and queen for the ceremony which took place in the grounds of Government House where they met the horticultural coordinator Glenn Huender and senior horticulturist Chris Mansfield, and planted Eucalyptus pauciflora – also know as snow gum trees. Schoolchildren from Wamberal public school had travelled for four hours to see the tree planting and student Imogen Kimble was on hand to help the king plant his tree. The king asked Huender about the composting for the soil, which was all done on site. The royals then went over to talk to the schoolchildren who were very excited to have the chance to meet them. The domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty, award-winning author of See What You Made Me Do, Jess Hill, professor of domestic and family violence at the University of Technology Sydney, Dr Anne Summers, and executive general manager, inclusion and social policy, at the Australian Football League, Tanya Hosch, were among a powerful group of advocates, experts and survivors who joined Queen Camilla today for a roundtable discussion about the epidemic of domestic violence gripping Australia. During the discussion the Queen heard from key sector experts as well as women with lived experience about the measures being implemented to try to end violence against women in Australia. Hosch said sport had an important role to play: One in 20 is a paid member of the AFL sporting code. There is a lot of work to be done. Camilla asked: Are these women prepared to come forward and talk? Do Indigenous people feel able to come forward? The governor gerneral, Sam Mostyn, said: Aboriginal women had fallen out of the system. There are hundreds of women over decades whose experiences are not recorded. Katie Kiss, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner, talked to the queen about children being removed from their families. While Hill discussed the pervasiveness of coercive control: Perpetrators all study from the same handbook. It is terribly difficult to prove. Twenty-one-year-old Conor Pall from Mildura, Victoria was the sole male around the table. As a children’s author and advocate, Pall represents the rights of young people affected by family violence. He knows from personal experience how the voices of child victims are rarely heard in the justice system and is determined to use his lived experience as a male survivor to drive change. Before the roundtable Battie said it was “great” that the queen was using the tour to raise awareness of the issue. King surveys flora, meets Andrew Forrest and talks sport at botanic gardens King Charles was led on a detailed tour of the Banksia Gardens at Canberra’s National Botanic Gardens by Beverly Ardler and Kain Ardler from the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community, as well as Botanic Gardens head Dr Rebecca Pirzl. Wearing dark glasses in the hot Australian sun, the king moved slowly through the display of the iconic Australian plants, asking questions and pointing out particularly interesting examples. The Ardlers explained about the significance of banksia species to their community and how bushfires affected local ecosystems. The botanic gardens’ display is the largest collection of Australian plants in the world. The king was met at the entrance to the Banksia Gardens by Australian mining mandate Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest, with whom he spoke at length. On his way out, he was met by students from Ainslie School. Leo Turner, 12, asked the king if he’d heard of AFL. The king replied: Yes, I’ve heard of it. Leo asked: What’s your favourite sport? The king replied (before saying goodbye): I can’t do much now. Too many injuries. I used to sit on a horse. More in-home support needed for people ‘traumatised through institutions’ Back to the Senate community affairs committee hearing on the new aged care bill, the Department of Health and Aged Care says more support for in-home care is needed for all Australians who’ve been traumatised through institutions. Andrea Kelly from the department was speaking about the wish of many First Nations elders to stay on country. Kelly said she had conducted more than 135 consultations and met with around 1,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, as well as peak bodies and providers around issues of cultural safety. Kelly said: People want to stay at home, they don’t want to go into residential aged care, and that’s particularly true for Stolen Generation survivors, veterans and members of the LGBQTI community that I’ve met with. Kelly agreed that greater in-home supports would need to be provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, and other Australians who had experienced sexual child abuse. While my conversations have been specific with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, I think that model of care we need to think about for all Australians who’ve been traumatised through institutions. King watches ‘bushfire’ during CSIRO lab visit King Charles has toured the CSIRO’s National Bushfire Behaviour Research Laboratory, where he viewed a “Pyrotron” demonstration. The seven-minute demonstration replicated a bushfire in a 29-metre-long combustion wind tunnel. The experiment is used to better understand bushfire behaviour and effective methods to suppress it, senior research scientist Matt Plucinski said. The king was invited to start the experiment as he met with researchers and CSIRO head Doug Hilton, receiving a briefing about how quickly the fires could spread. The eucalyptus smoke was “the smell of science”, Hilton joked with the king. Outside, an ACT Rural Fire Service engine doused itself during a “burn over drill”, demonstrating how firefighters stuck in the truck in the middle of a fire storm would survive the worst of the blistering inferno. The king was introduced to five volunteer firefighters before they started the drill, forcing him to take a slight step back as he was sprayed with a light mist due to the breeze. He told reporters as he left the site after the drill: It was very encouraging to see what they can do. He asked the firefighters about the differences between bushfires in the northern and southern hemispheres, including comparisons with Canada. It was King Charles’ second visit to a CSIRO Canberra site, the first being February 1966, when the young prince toured the wildlife research division. Multiple arrests during king’s ACT visit ACT police made multiple arrests in Canberra in relation to the visit of King Charles today. About 11am a 62-year-old man was arrested at the Australian War Memorial for breach of the peace. He was taken to the ACT watch house, where he signed an undertaking to keep the peace and was released without charge, police said. A second arrest was made about 11.30am, when police arrested a 21-year-old woman for failing to comply with a police direction, police said. She was charged and she faced ACT magistrates court this afternoon. Police said “several” other arrests were made at the Australian War Memorial – those people were later released without charge. In relation to an “interaction” with Senator Lidia Thorpe at the memorial, police said: This morning, police spoke to a protest group near the Australian War Memorial. The group was directed to move on from the area and they complied with that direction. No arrests were made and police consider the matter finalised. One-hour cap on household services for older people is due to budget, official says Back to the Senate community affairs committee hearing, where the Department of Health and Aged Care has affirmed the goal of the new aged care bill will be to have people ageing at home for longer. Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne has raised why there is a one-hour cap on services to help older people clean their houses, including gardening, which was raised as a serious issue – alongside the lack of gardening services – preventing people staying at home longer. Allman-Payne gave the example of older renters being subject to eviction because of their inability to maintain the garden to a standard the landlord deems acceptable. Nick Morgan, from the department, said there was a one-hour cap on household services because of the need to retain budget for personal care and clinical services. Queensland LNP candidate says sorry for Nazi joke Queensland LNP candidate Bree James has apologised for making a Nazi joke in a Facebook post. On Saturday, the Barron River candidate posted an image of herself beside an election banner which had been vandalised with a spray painted moustache in the style of Adolf Hitler. “Even the banner is getting in the spirit and celebrating my German heritage”, she said, in the post advertising the city’s German festival. She apologised on the weekend, and again on Monday when Labor’s campaign bus visited her pre-poll booth. James reportedly told the cameras the post was a joke in poor taste that she had apologised for “and I hope people can forgive me”. On Monday, Labor opponent Craig Crawford said James is “unfit for office”. Bree James is unfit for office, and people should not be voting for her in the upcoming election. David Crisafulli should have cut her then and then. I’m pretty sure that if I had done something stupid like that, I certainly would have offered my position up to the premier. LNP leader David Crisafulli said on Monday that he’d spoken to his candidate and “I’ve expressed my view to her very clearly. “Is this acceptable? It’s not. It’s disappointing, it’s wrong, it’s not funny”, he said. The Australian Monarchist League is demanding the resignation of Senator Lidia Thorpe after her “failed attempt to disrupt His Majesty the King” at Parliament House this afternoon. In a statement, the league’s national chairman, Philip Benwell, said: Senator Thorpe should step down with immediate effect. The Australian Monarchist League unequivocally condemns the ill-considered behaviour of this isolated senator. Her childish demonstration has done nothing to diminish the gratitude and pride that millions of Australians have for our country, its history, its peoples and its sound system of governance. In fact, it has likely only strengthened these feelings. Should she not resign, the league is calling for Thorpe’s “misconduct” to be addressed “in accordance with what is the obvious and prevailing public sentiment.” Albanese’s $4.3m home buy not a good look, ex-Tory MP says Rory Stewart, former Tory MP and co-host of the The Rest is News podcast, says Anthony Albanese’s purchase of a multimillion-dollar home on the New South Wales Central Coast “doesn’t look great”. “The idea of buying luxury mansions doesn’t look great when you’re a leftwing leader,” he told David Speers, host of ABC Insiders, in an interviewed aired on Afternoon Briefing. Keir Starmer’s popularity ratings are tanking because he’s getting wealthy donors to buy him fancy spectacles and clothes for his wife. And Boris Johnson was not helped by having or putting £100,000 wallpaper on his walls. David Cameron understood this and deliberately cut his salary when he came in as prime minister ... travelled on EasyJet. When asked if it is fair to say voters don’t like to see their prime ministers getting anything, other than being paid, he said: That’s true, and as a working politician, I often was resentful of that. I remember that there were times when I felt like saying to voters: ‘Listen, it would be better if we returned if you like to the British parliament of the early 20th century where MPs didn’t receive salaries and we’ll just work for free for you!’ But, of course, there are problems with doing that too. When asked whether the coarseness of Trumpian politics were permeating the political culture in the Anglosphere, he said he had noticed the “dead cat strategy” in effect: Which is – if somebody is focusing on some scandal, something that you’ve got wrong, you just slap a dead cat on the table and move on. Senator Lidia Thorpe has released a statement following her remarks to the king in Parliament House this afternoon. She said she intended to hand “a notice of complicity in the genocide of the First Peoples of this county” to King Charles. The senator’s uncle, Robert Thorpe, issued the same notice to the international criminal court on 13 October, according to the statement. She said: Today I intended to hand King Charles a notice of complicity in the genocide of the First Peoples of this county. Krauatungalung elder, Uncle Robbie Thorpe, issued this notice to the international criminal court on October 13 this year, requesting King Charles be charged and prosecuted for genocide. The visit by the so-called king should be an occasion of truth-telling about the true history of this country. The colonial state has been built on the continuing genocide on First Peoples. Today I was silenced and removed from the parliamentary reception when pointing out that the Crown stole from First Peoples. The truth is, this colony is built on stolen land, stolen wealth and stolen lives. The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the First Peoples of this country. These crimes include war crimes, crimes against humanity and failure to prevent genocide. There has been no justice for these crimes. The Crown must be held accountable. Today, the AFP threatened to arrest me for wearing a T-shirt that said ‘Stolen Land, Stolen Lives, Stolen Wealth’. I was at a rally to call out the crimes committed by the Crown. This is a clear attack on free speech and expression, at the war memorial of all places. Sovereign elder Uncle Coco was arrested by AFP today for peacefully standing up against the genocide on his people and all First Peoples of this continent. This colonial government will punish our elders for protesting against a genocide but refuse to hold the perpetrators to account. Today we call for justice, an end to this ongoing genocide, for treaty and a republic. We want to be able to live in peace and finally come together as a nation. ‘Spectrum of supported decision-making’ in new aged care bill, department says Older Australians will be supported to make decisions for themselves for as long as possible under the new aged care bill, the Department of Health and Aged Care said this afternoon when answering questions from the Senate standing committee on community affairs on the bill. Mel Metz, the assistant secretary of the legislative reform branch in the department, said – after peak bodies representing older people advocated strongly for including supported decision-making arrangements in the bill – that the model on which the framework was based came from an Australian Law Reform Commission report as well as more recent endorsement through the disability royal commission. Supported decision-making recognises capacity to make decision is not black and white, and it exists on a spectrum and can fluctuate, and that’s especially true in aged care for people with dementia. What supported decision-making means is that rather than substituting a new decision-maker when a person’s decision-making capacity diminishes, people are supported to make decisions for themselves for as long as possible. There’s a single concept of supporter rather than a dual representative and supporter framework in the bill – recognising that capacity isn’t static and that a person might need different levels of assistance day to day. Drawing on state and territory arrangements in place, “there is a substitute decision-making in the bill – but that’s at the very end of that spectrum of supported decision-making for people who absolutely cannot make decisions even with support”. Thorpe’s behaviour ‘alienated a lot of people’ – Labor MP Over to Afternoon Briefing, where – you guessed it – the king and queen are on the agenda. Speaking with the ABC, the assistant minister to the prime minister, Patrick Gorman, who is responsible for much of the planning behind the king’s whistle-stop tour, commented on Lidia Thorpe’s remarks shouted to the king at the state reception in Parliament House’s Great Hall. I thought that behaviour was pretty inappropriate. I think that it alienated a lot of people. And I think most of the Australian public expect that their members and senators behave with dignity, especially at these formal state occasions. I can’t speak for the Senate, they are in charge of their own members and their own disciplinary procedures. What I hope is that this doesn’t detract from the fact that it was an incredibly warm reception for the king and the queen. There was clearly a lot of people in the room who were really honoured to have been invited to that very special occasion. As you said, the first time that we’ve had a king of Australia in fact visit Australia, and what we saw in the king’s remarks were his warm affection for this country – a country that he came here as a student. He’s visited 17 times. And I think that he really went out of his way, not just to talk about the causes that were important to him, such as climate change, but also to talk about his great appreciation of the respect that First Nations Australians have shown him on those visits. King’s visit ‘difficult for many First Nations people’, Greens senator says Greens senator Dorinda Cox says the visit of King Charles III is a reminder of colonialism’s “harrowing injustices”. The Yamatji-Noongar woman said on Monday – before Senator Lidia Thorpe’s comments disrupted a state reception in Canberra – that the federal Truth and Justice Commission Bill, introduced by the Greens, would allow for First Nations-led, trauma-informed truth telling to fully implement all pillars of the Uluru statement from the heart. In a statement, Cox said: This visit will be difficult for many First Nations people, who still feel the injustice every day of colonialism, especially our stolen generations, which are perpetuated through systemic and structural racism and discrimination. Visiting memorials and attending charity events is not changing the harrowing injustices and ongoing unacceptable rates of deaths of our people in Australia. First Nations justice, truth telling and healing needs to be a priority. The king should be clear in his recognition and support of this. He now needs to be on the right side of history. We need the Labor government to have clear instructions from their sovereign head that we can’t continue on this path if we want peace and healing, this comes with accepting responsibility for the role, actions and destructive impacts of the Crown. Cox went on to say: I invite the king to reflect on this and that sovereignty that was never ceded. There is trauma and grief for First Nations people. He needs to hear this and acknowledge it. The commonwealth has nothing to fear from this formal recognition. First Nations communities continue to feel the impact of policies rooted in colonial attitudes – such as forced removals, land and resources theft, and systemic discrimination – that has left deep scars that we need to heal from. We cannot do this without truth telling and truth listening. The time is now. It’s time to respect our inherent, sovereign right to self-determination, including the protection and preservation of our lands and waters – under our custodianship. Ensuring Australia’s First Peoples are consulted in every vital decision about our shared future. Watt welcomes compensation ruling on illegal Qantas sackings The workplace relations minister, Murray Watt, has welcomed the federal court decision for Qantas to compensate workers found to be illegally sacked during the pandemic. In a post to X, Watt wrote: I congratulate [the Transport Workers Union] for pursuing this case in the Federal Court. I also congratulate Qantas’ new management team for taking a more cooperative approach to workplace relations, which is delivering for the company and its workers alike. Tony Abbott says ‘unfortunate political exhibitionism’ from Lidia Thorpe Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who attended the event, expressed his dismay at Lidia Thorpe’s remarks to the King in the Great Hall. “It’s unfortunate political exhibitionism, that’s all I’d say,” he said after the event. Another guest, businessman Dick Smith, said the disruption was an aspect of Australian democracy. I think that’s the wonderful part of our democracy – that she’s not going to be put in jail. Smith has known the king for many years, including a meeting in 1982 when Smith landed his helicopter on the grounds of Balmoral Castle in the UK. Sewage theory investigated after Sydney beach tar balls The sewage theory floated as an explanation for the “tar balls” that closed eastern Sydney beaches last week has not been ruled out by the lead agency investigating the source of the pollution. In a statement this afternoon, a spokesperson for NSW Maritime said: Investigations are continuing, with a number of samples still being tested by the NSW Environment Protection Authority. An update will be provided once the origin is definitively known. On Friday, Jon Beves, a chemistry expert from University of New South Wales who is part of a team of scientists analysing the debris, told Guardian Australia the “most logical answer” was that the balls were formed from crude oil. However, he said the balls also contained other greasy materials including fatty acids which meant they potentially had come from a sewage outflow instead of an oil spill or leak off the coast. Later that same day, the NSW Maritime executive director, Mark Hutchings, said: Based on advice from the EPA, we can now confirm the balls are made up of fatty acids, chemicals consistent with those found in cleaning and cosmetic products, mixed with some fuel oil. They are not harmful when on the ground, but should not be touched or picked up. Thank you, Emily Wind. Let’s get on with the rest of the day’s breaking news. Over in Canberra, our team has pieced together the full transcript of senator Lidia Thorpe’s remarks to King Charles at a state reception in the Great Hall at Parliament House a short time ago: You are not our king. You are not sovereign. You are not our king. You are not sovereign. You committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us – our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. You are a genocidalist. This is not your land. This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. Fuck the colony. Fuck the colony. Fuck the colony. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Daisy Dumas will be with you for the next little while. Take care. Here’s another angle of Lidia Thorpe’s protest in parliament house earlier this afternoon, where she shouted following King Charles’ speech: ‘Offensive graffiti’ in Sydney’s eastern suburbs investigated NSW police have released CCTV footage after multiple structures were graffitied across Sydney overnight. Police said officers located “offensive graffiti” on the walls of multiple structures in Bronte, Tamarama and Bondi beaches late last night. Photographs sent to 2GB’s Ben Fordham show the word “Hamas” graffitied. Police said an investigation has commenced, and investigators had released images of a man they believed might be able to assist with inquiries. He is depicted wearing a grey long-sleeve shirt, black jeans, white/grey shoes, a grey beanie and blue face mask. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers. Greens say they will ‘keep fighting’ for republic Earlier today, deputy Greens leader Mehreen Faruqi issued a statement ahead of the parliamentary reception for King Charles and said the party would “keep fighting” for a republic. In the statement, Faruqi said: The truth is, racism and colonialism are intertwined; and the monarchy symbolises an era that should be left behind for good, not celebrated. Preserving the British monarchy is to preserve white supremacy and the systemic racist structures that were built by the empire and persist today. It’s time for Australia to embrace a republic rooted in decolonisation and sovereignty for First Nations – a crucial step towards racial justice, truth telling and treaty. RBA says it is not ‘data obsessed’ Andrew Hauser, the Reserve Bank’s deputy governor, has conceded that the strength of Australia’s labour market in September had been “surprising”, or so he told a CBA global markets conference in Sydney today. As you may recall, the jobless rate actually edged lower to 4.1% (from what had previously been reported by the Bureau of Statistics as 4.2% for August), with an addition of about 62,000 jobs. Markets had already been tilting towards an interest cut NOT landing until February and now they are pricing in that first reduction as most likely next April. (April Fool’s Day, as it happens.) Hauser, though, made it clear that the RBA was also not “data obsessed”, with the jobs figures just part of the wider “context” the board will consider. As we’ve noted in this blog previously, the September quarter inflation figures will land on 30 October, and most of the other data points (including the monthly CPI figures) are basically noise. We also asked Hauser about China, particularly in light of the latest effort to stoke growth, namely today’s cuts in official interest rates. He said: What happens in China matters for us, both in terms of our export growth and in terms of our investments, and so, you know, we are watching it closely. He didn’t say whether he thought the Chinese rate cuts would work, along with the barrage of other stimulatory efforts. “I think it’s possible to tell different stories about the outlook for China”, ranging from the pessimistic to the more optimistic. In a nod to his next speech – about the importance to Australia’s fortunes that international markets remain open – Hausers said: Trends in the Australian economy [were] very often shaped by events outside of Australia. The RBA board next meets on 4-5 November, wrapping up just as the US population goes to the polls – another overseas event that could play a big bearing not just on Australia but just about everywhere else. Earlier today, Lidia Thorpe issued a statement calling for a “treaty republic”. She said that Australia had “unfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic” – and that this “must happen through treaty”. You can read more of what she said earlier in the blog, here. Here is the moment that independent senator Lidia Thorpe shouted after King Charles’ speech in Parliament House just earlier. As Sarah Basford Canales notes, Thorpe can be heard saying: This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. More from Australia’s privacy commissioner on AI Continuing from our last post: Some companies have updated their terms since the arrival of large-language-model AI systems to say that personal data will be used unless users opt out, and in some cases this has only been picked up by users of the platform delving into the terms and sharing that information with other users. Carly Kind said only updating the policy wasn’t sufficient: Just updating a privacy policy will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the Privacy Act, in which entities have to be able to establish that it’s within users’ reasonable expectations that their personal information will be used in a different way. And so I think that’s the relevant test that entities need to turn their mind to. If you don’t have consent to use that information in a different way, then you need to be able to show it within users’ reasonable expectations. Privacy watchdog issues AI warning over people’s data Australia’s privacy commissioner, Carly Kind, has warned companies that bury how they’ll use AI on people’s data they have collected risk being investigated by her office. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner released new guidelines for both developers of AI systems and the organisations that use those systems on how personal information should be used. Kind told Guardian Australia: We think that this guidance will hopefully set out pretty clearly how they need to be thinking about that when it comes to larger players and the developments of developers of these models. We’re articulating the legal situation we would have imagined that they had also given consideration to, these laws in the development of these models. We would expect to see compliance with the Privacy Act in instances where the Privacy Act applies, and it does apply to some overseas entities. And then it will be a matter for my office to consider whether to take enforcement action if we do have a sufficient suspicion to suspect non-compliance. King ‘doing an amazing job’, longtime fan says Earlier, Elaine Hoskins spoke of the moment she got to shake Queen Camilla’s hand at the Australian War Memorial. Camilla is wonderful. Always the lady, and she is such a supporter to him, and it was a privilege to talk to her today. Hoskins drove up from Melbourne with her husband, Russell Baker, to get a glimpse of the royals. But it wasn’t her first time travelling afar to see the British monarchy. Donning a tiara, Hoskins said she was a fan of King Charles III since she was 12. Charles and I are the same age, yes, and so he was my pin-up boy on my wall from when I was about 12. He came to the throne through sadness, but as he is now, I think he’s doing an amazing job. Hoskins went to King Charles’ coronation in England, where she picked up the flag she brought to Canberra. As for Baker, does he share his wife’s love for the British monarchy too? Oh yeah, but she is an absolute monarchist. She’s just mad [about the royals] ... I don’t care. I’m a royalist more than anything – I don’t think we should be a republic. The independent senator Lidia Thorpe has been removed from a parliamentary reception for King Charles and Queen Camilla after yelling “this is not your country” and “you are not my king” and “fuck the colony”. After King Charles concluded his speech, Thorpe walked up the aisle towards the stage, yelling at the royal couple. “You stole from us,” she shouted, as officials stepped forward to stop her reaching the stage. … You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want a treaty in this country. As security officers escorted Thorpe back to the door, she shouted: This is not your land. You are not my king. You are not our king. As she left the hall and was forced back into the foyer she could be heard shouting: “Fuck the colony.” Wrap-up of Albanese and Dutton’s speeches Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton welcomed King Charles and Queen Camilla to Parliament House with warm greetings and a few jokes, thanking them for standing with Australians in good times and bad. Albanese called it honour of his life to have led the Australian delegation attending the king’s coronation. Albanese praised the king’s engagement on issues including climate change and reconciliation. You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times where we’ve debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the Crown. Nothing stands still. Dutton also welcomed the royal couple and lightened the mood, noting how much those gathered had been anticipating the visit. “People have had haircuts, people have shined shoes – and that’s just the republicans,” Dutton said, drawing laughter around the room. King’s speech ends with heckles The king has finished his speech with applause heard across the room, but a heckler can be heard from the crowd: You are not out king … Give us our land back … You destroyed our land … We want treaty. Today’s global challenges require ‘both ancient and new thinking’ – king King Charles said that with Covid-19 “barely behind us”, the impacts of climate change “deepening” and the “horrors of war, death and needless destruction all too visible”, this moment in history “requires both ancient and new thinking”. The challenges we now face call us to show not only constancy and valour but also humanity, empathy and generosity of spirit. Looking out across the global commonwealth of nations, I see a family of some 2.5 billion people striving for peace, justice and mutual respect. The commonwealth spans six continents and as a group has the size and influence to play a significant role on the global stage, while being small enough to nurture a personal relationship. It has the diversity to understand the world’s problems, and the sheer brain power and resolve to formulate practical solutions. King says Australia ‘particularly vulnerable’ to climate change King Charles noted the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, the floods of 2022-23 and the tropical cyclones last year and this year, and spoke of the importance of addressing climate change. I cannot tell you how much I have felt grief and shock of what you have gone, through having visited many of the communities myself over all of these years. Amid such overwhelming challenges, I have always been deeply impressed by the extraordinary bravery and resilience of those who look up, look out and – in that most Australian way – battle on … The regular roll of unprecedented events is an unmistaken sign of climate change, to which Australia is so particularly vulnerable. The king said that Australia’s “international leadership on global initiatives to protect our climate and biodiversity is of such absolute and critical importance”. Australia has all of the natural ingredients to create a more sustainable, regenerative way of living, by harnessing the power with which nature has endowed the nation. Whether it be wind or its famous sunshine, Australia is tracking the path towards a better and safer future. King recalls attending Victorian school in 60s King Charles is speaking about his first visit to Australia in 1966 for school in Victoria – “and, ladies and gentlemen, what an education it was!” I had thought that the school I had been attending in Scotland was remote and testing enough, but nothing had quite prepared me for the realities of the bush country around Mount Bulla. Six decades since his first visit, the king said he was “witnessed both continuity and great change.” It is worth reflecting that Australia’s unique character has endured and also evolved, and that Australia has become a stronger nation as a result of becoming one of the most multicultural on Earth. King notes Australia’s ‘long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation’ King Charles III is now addressing the crowd at the parliamentary reception, saying he is “enormously touched” by the welcome. Let me also say how deeply I appreciated this morning’s moving Welcome to Country ceremony, which offers me the opportunity to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the lands on which we meet – the Ngunnawal people and all First Nations peoples who have loved and cared for this continent for 65,000 years. In my many visits to Australia, I have witnessed the courage and hope that have guided the nation’s long and sometimes difficult journey towards reconciliation. Throughout my life, Australia’s First Nations peoples have done me the great honour of sharing so generously their stories and cultures. I can only say how much my own experience has been shaped and strengthened by such tradition and wisdom. Dutton says Australia should ‘never take British inheritance for granted’ Peter Dutton told King Charles that his presence “reminds Australians of all of the things that we love about Britain” – as well as “our great British heritage”. Representative democracy, the constitution, the separation of powers, the rule of law, the English language, freedom of speech, of association of the press, and so much more besides. We should never take our British inheritance for granted. Australia has benefited from the stability of a democracy with the monarchy as our bedrock. Through times of peace and war, constitutional and parliamentary crises, good times and bad – Australians have known stability and have taken confidence knowing that there are better days ahead, because our institutions are protected and underpinned by the independence and stoicism of the reigning monarch. Peter Dutton is now addressing the crowd at the parliamentary reception. The opposition leader took a moment to send his well wishes to Princess Catherine: Upon your return home, your majesties, I know that you will convey Australia’s well wishes to the Princess of Wales. ‘The commonwealth is family’ – PM Anthony Albanese has noted “decades of change” in Australia, stating that “bonds of respect and affection” have endured. He told King Charles during the address: The Australia you first knew has grown and evolved in so many ways. Our communities have been strengthened and enriched from people drawn from every culture [and] background … As a modern, outward-looking economy, we found our place in the world and made our home in the region. We’ve gained a deeper and truer understanding of our national story. Yet through these decades of change, our bonds of respect and affection have matured and they have endured … For Australia, the commonwealth is family. And, as with any family, we appreciate our differences … We know the institution is secure in your hands, and we know your commitment to peace and stability will act as your guide during the challenging times in which we find ourselves. PM says king has ‘long apprehended the grave reality of climate change’ Anthony Albanese is now speaking at the parliamentary reception. The prime minister told King Charles that as king, he has “an extraordinary duty to the traditions so carefully upheld, protected and generations of your forbearers, not least your mother, Queen Elizabeth II”. He noted the king’s work towards addressing climate change, and said: Your abiding duty to all that has been built on the foundations of tradition is balanced by a great responsibility to the future – both its serious challenges and its exciting possibilities. You have long apprehended the grave reality of climate change. You take seriously the threat that it represents, as well as the necessity and, crucially, the capability of humanity to take meaningful and effective action against it. Senator Lidia Thorpe turned her back on King Charles and Queen Camilla as they stood to attention for the national anthem, sung in English and the local Ngunnawal Indigenous language. Parliamentary reception begins at Parliament House The parliamentary reception, hosted by Anthony Albanese, is beginning in Parliament House. The national anthem was just sung in both English and Ngunnawal language, with Aunty Violet Sheridan welcoming King Charles and Queen Camilla, and guests, to Ngunnawal Country. Sheridan said: A Welcome to Country is a traditional Aboriginal blessing, symbolising the traditional owners of the lands welcoming you. But it also shows your respect for the first peoples of the land you are meeting on. The reason for this custom is to protect your spirit while you are on our land … I’d like to pay my respects to my elders past, present and emerging, and extend that respect to any First Nations people here this morning. But I’d also like to acknowledge all of the non-Indigenous people here as well. In keeping in the general spirit of friendship and reconciliation, it gives me great pleasure to welcome you, King Charles III, and Queen Camilla, and special guest the prime minister, distinguished guests, to the land of the Ngunnawal people. ACT police have confirmed a 62-year-old man was arrested this morning outside the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where King Charles and Queen Camilla were visiting earlier. The man was arrested for allegedly failing to comply with a police direction. He would be conveyed to the ACT watch house and was expected to be charged, police said. Child allegedly hit with rock through Queensland train window Queensland police are appealing for witnesses after a rock was allegedly thrown through a train window, striking a five-year-old boy in the head. Detectives from the Cairns Child Protection Investigation Unit are investigating the alleged incident on 19 October, that occurred around 4pm near the James and Law Street intersection. The child was taken to Cairns Hospital with serious injuries and was expected to be transported to Townsville Hospital yesterday for further treatment. Police are appealing for witnesses, and anyone with vision, to come forward. Investigations are continuing. A pool reporter has let us know that Queen Camilla is wearing a white silk crepe court dress by Anna Valentine, as well as a diamond and pearl brooch worn previously by Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother. Lidia Thorpe says Indigenous treaty must be part of becoming republic Earlier today, Lidia Thorpe released a statement saying a treaty with First Nations people must be central in any moves towards a republic. Thorpe said she was following the footsteps of her uncle, Robbie Thorpe, who has long advocated for a republic through treaty. She said in a statement there was “unfinished business that we need to resolve before this country can become a republic”. We can move towards a Treaty Republic now. The two processes are not opposed, they’re complimentary. As First Peoples, we never ceded our Sovereignty over this land. The Crown invaded this country, has not sought treaty with First Peoples, and committed a Genocide of our people. King Charles is not the legitimate Sovereign of these lands. Any move towards a republic must not continue this injustice. Treaty must play a central role in establishing an independent nation. A republic without a Treaty must not happen. Thorpe turns her back to national anthem Inside the reception hall, Independent Senator Lidia Thorpe has turned her back to the screen while the national anthem was playing. Thorpe is wearing a long possum-skin coat and is standing at the front along the royals’ route into the hall. NSW premier Chris Minns says King Charles ‘seems lovely’ The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, says King Charles III “seems lovely”. At a press conference earlier today, Minns was asked what he thought of the British monarch when they met for the first time in Sydney over the weekend. The King, who has been undergoing treatment for cancer, is midway through a quick Australian visit with his wife, Queen Camilla, their first trip here since his coronation. Minns said: It was really brief, but he seems lovely. And he seemed very happy to be in Sydney. I hope he has a good time in Canberra and in Sydney, it’s obviously a brief visit, and that’s in recognition of the fact that he’s undergoing treatment. I think most people are very happy to have him here, and I’m sure tomorrow will be a great day in Sydney. Royals arrive at Parliament House The King and Queen have arrived at Parliament House in a large motorcade of black SUVs with a police escort on motorbikes. They were greeted with a 21-gun salute that absolutely bewildered the large flock of seagulls that normally swim in the water feature out the front of parliament, with the Federation Guard of military personnel presented for inspection by the King. It’s hot out here – government staffers have been wandering through the gathered crowds, offering sunscreen and water bottles – but the King took the time to walk through the guard for an official inspection, stopping several times to speak to some members of the army and navy gathered in formation. We can’t hear what they said from our vantage point off to the side. The King and Queen are now meeting the official party, including prime minister Anthony Albanese, opposition leader Peter Dutton, governor general Sam Mostyn and other dignitaries. King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived on the forecourt of Parliament House, received by the governor general Sam Mostyn, who presented the prime minister Anthony Albanese. The King is meeting the official greeting party right now, and will soon proceed into Parliament to sign the visitor books alongside the PM, president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives. After that, the parliamentary reception will begin. Inside Parliament’s Great Hall, MPs, senators and others with a floor pass for the coming reception are watching the outside arrival proceedings on a big screen and chit-chatting in what is a standing-room morning tea, hurry-up-and-wait kind of scenario. Those in the building who’ve not been so bestowed are crowding around the balconies above the parliamentary foyer, smartphones hoisted, waiting for their majesties to set foot on the marble and glide the few metres towards the hall’s doors and all the folks inside. Me, l’m in the gallery above the supping throng, waiting like everyone else. Until something actually happens, back to you. King Charles III and Queen Camilla have greeted the crowd at the Australian War Memorial, shaking hands and high-fiving kids. The royal couple walked down a cordoned off road leading to the memorial. Queen Camila greeted fans who had waited nearly two hours in the sun on one side while King Charles greeted the other. If you’ll remember earlier in the day, we spoke to Hephner the alpaca and his owner, Robert Fletcher. Hephner was let into the war memorial and got the chance to meet the king. We’re told he sneezed, literally, at the opportunity. Fletcher told Guardian Australia earlier that Hephner wasn’t a spitter but he didn’t rule out sneezing. Crowd grows outside parliament ahead of royal visit Several hundred people have gathered on the Parliament House forecourt ahead of the royal arrival. There’s tight security and members of the military are preparing a ceremonial welcome and 21-gun salute. The crowd, gathered on both edges of the forecourt to see the royal motorcade arrive, is a mix of ages and backgrounds. We found Serena and Gabriella, dressed in suit jackets with Union Jack flags, and a stuffed corgi – famously, the late Queen’s favourites. They were Serena’s husband and their young daughter, Darcy. Serena said: It’s a historic occasion … It’s pretty special. Gabriella donned a cardboard mask of Queen Camilla. Others are dressed in Union Jack clothing, or memorabilia from other royal occasions. Out on the front lawns of Parliament House, far from the official forecourt area, are a few large flags with the slogan “abolish the monarchy”. We can’t see much more from this vantage point, but the yellow flags are visible from the area where the King and Queen will arrive. King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive at War Memorial King Charles III and Queen Camilla arrived at the Australian War Memorial a few short moments ago where they were greeted by a crowd of a few thousand. The two will lay a wreath at the memorial before greeting members of the crowd and visiting a memorial that commemorates the military service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As the king wound down his window, members of the crowd screamed with joy. One excited crowd member, Carly McCrossin, told the 10 News reporter next to me she kept shouting “I love you, Charles” while holding her young children. Her friends nearby couldn’t believe they’d picked the right side to receive a wave from the king. Small group of protestors at War Memorial ahead of royal visit A small group of protesters set up near the Australian War Memorial earlier to protest the arrival of the royals. Some media had been set up at the Australian War Memorial but we were in fixed positions, so couldn’t get much closer. The crowd was holding Aboriginal and Palestinian flags and calling out “no pride in genocide” and “always was, always will be, Aboriginal land”. Police slowly started directing them away. Crowds growing to catch glimpse of King Charles in Canberra Plenty of visitors to the Australian War Memorial for today’s royal visit have gotten into the spirit. One of those is Lynton Martin, who stood out in the crowd with his bejewelled crown and British flag suit. Martin told Guardian Australia he had already been waiting for around 1.5 hours in line before the gates opened. I got it specifically for the royal tour, and it will now be my royal outfit. I went to the coronation last year in England, and over there, there’s pump, there’s pageantry, there’s colour, there’s passion, it’s everywhere. So I wanted to make the King and Queen feel at home here in Australia. Martin explained his passion for the royal family started was influenced by his grandmother’s love of them. The Qantas chief executive, Vanessa Hudson, has apologised to almost 1,700 former ground handlers who were illegally sacked and has pledged to engage in prompt negotiations to determine the size of the compensation payout. The apology came after the federal court ruled today that three of those workers should receive a combined $170,000 for non-economic loss suffered, which is to be used as a basis to calculate a total compensation bill. Hudson said in a statement: We sincerely apologise to our former employees who were impacted by this decision and we know that the onus is on Qantas to learn from this. We recognise the emotional and financial impact this has had on these people and their families. We hope that this provides closure to those who have been affected. Qantas and the Transport Workers’ Union will now engage in mediation over the size of the compensation payout and report back to the court early next month. The total sum is expected to consist of economic and non-economic loss. Separately, the union is also seeking penalties against Qantas. The federal court previously found the airline’s decision to outsource ground handler jobs in 2020 was illegal. But it also ruled that those workers would have been retrenched one year later as Qantas sought to cut costs, limiting the anticipated payout. We love keeping an eye on the federal parliament’s register of interests for any fun updates (financial, property, gifts and hospitality) from our politicians – but deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley might have one of the more interesting disclosures we’ve seen for a while, noting that she has taken out a personal loan to buy her own plane. Ley, who says she got her pilot’s licence at 19, has picked up a Cessna 182, a four-seater, single engine plane. Her register of interests has today been updated to note a “personal loan on purchase of Cessna 182. Creditor: Westpac”. The member for the rural electorate of Farrer, a large area which takes in much of the NSW-Victoria border region, recently got back her pilot’s licence which had lapsed. Ley’s spokesperson said the Cessna was “her favourite aircraft and a reliable working bush aircraft” and that she would use it to travel around her vast electorate. Her electorate of Farrer is 126,500 square kilometres, and one of the largest in the country. It is around the same size as Greece, Bangladesh or Nepal. She is using her plane to help to fly around her electorate at her own expense. Her plane is also a way for her to continue to fly, which is a personal passion for her. She has a passion for aviation which she has spoken about over career and most recently as deputy leader and shadow minister for women. Ley recently told the Nightly newspaper about re-obtaining her pilot’s licence, saying: “This will give me opportunities to fly to parts of my electorate that I wouldn’t normally visit, but I’ve always considered it very important ... I’m always wanting to visit them more.” King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive in Canberra Vision is being broadcast of King Charles and Queen Camilla arriving in Canberra, to cheers from the crowd as they disembark from their plane. We’ll have more in a moment from Sarah Basford Canales, who is on the scene at the Australian War Memorial, where the royals will shortly visit. Allan says she is determined to ‘fight back against Nimby-style approach’ The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, was asked whether her housing plan is politically motivated – given the vast majority of the suburbs she has earmarked for development are in Liberal-held seats. She denied this, but also had a crack at the opposition in the process: This is about building more homes for more Victorians, because for too long, too many Liberals conservative politicians have chased local votes and blocked the building of more homes in their community. I’m determined to fight for those Victorians who need the government to fight back against this Nimby-style approach. We need to fight back against this approach for the simple reason that it’s just not fair. It’s just not fair on younger Victorians to be denied the opportunity people of my generation and others have had to buy their first home, to start a family, to build their long-term wealth. These younger Victorians are being locked out of being able to afford or buy a home, maybe close to where they grew up, close to their family, network of support. They’re being denied choice and opportunity, and that is not fair, and they need someone in their corner fighting for them, and that’s what I and the government will be doing. More on the Victorian stamp-duty announcement The Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the scheme will cost the government about $55m and is designed to be a short-term intervention. At the moment, we know that the industry is in a difficult situation, and what they need is the ability to be able to put away these vitally important projects. We expect that over the next 12 months, the material circumstances of the industry will improve. We know, for example, that the spike in commodity prices are already coming off, but they still continue to beset the industry with difficulties. Additionally, I anticipate that we will see – if not by the end of this year, then certainly by early next year – interest rates come down. Now, they won’t come crashing down, but they will come down modestly, is our anticipation. But that will take about another six months before … we do need this period of adjustment and support for the industry, and that’s the rationale behind the 12 months. Victorian premier announcing stamp duty holiday for off-the-plan apartments Victorians buying apartments, townhouses and units off the plan won’t have to pay any stamp duty for 12 months, under a state government initiative aimed at stimulating development. The premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing the policy, which comes into effect immediately and will be open to all buyers for properties of any price point. Currently, stamp duty concessions on off-the-plan properties are only available to first-home buyers and owner occupiers and are capped at $750,000 and $550,000, respectively The government estimates the policy will cut the stamp duty of buyers of a new $620,000 apartment down to just $4,000, a saving of $28,000. Speaking at a recently opened build-to-rent project in North Fitzroy, Allan said the move responds to feedback from the construction industry that the current interest rate burden has slowed sales and stopped developments from beginning. It will get more of these projects away sooner. And what that means [is] that [it] unlocks more homes for everyone. More homes, more opportunities – whether you want to live in an apartment, a unit or a townhouse. It provides more opportunities for more Victorians to be able to find a home where they want to live. Nick McIntosh argued that law reform is still needed, calling for the establishment of a Safe and Secure Skies Commission – for “independent oversight over the entire aviation industry”. We should never have been in this position. These workers really should have their jobs back as we speak. The problem was that the law didn’t allow that to happen. It was too difficult to reinstate 1,700 workers – it was alright if it was two workers, but 1,700 was too much. That needed to change as well so that if this ever happens again – and let’s hope it doesn’t – but if this ever happens again, these workers will have their jobs back. We won’t be going through years and years of high court challenges, we’ll have these workers back doing what they do best. Union estimates compensation will exceed $100m The assistant secretary of the Transport Workers’ Union, Nick McIntosh, also spoke with the media following the court decision. Taking questions, he said the union estimates the compensation figure is “probably worth in excess of $100m”. Clearly it’s going to be dependent on different individual cases. The really crucial element, though, is this non-economic loss. This is tax-free money that is in recognition of people’s hardship and distress suffered. This will make a big difference to every one of the 1,700 people, but we do [think] this will be a global figure in excess of $100m. Workers welcome court decision on Qantas outsourcing Damien Pollard, another illegally outsourced worker, told reporters that he was “an extremely proud” Qantas worker and expected to be there until he retired: I’ve spent the last four years fielding hundreds of phone calls from my members in Canberra, people that are going through personal problems and mental health issues that were caused by this decision. So today’s judgment by Justice Lee goes some way to facilitating a little bit of recovery from all that and hopefully allowing for us to move on with our lives. Sacked Qantas worker reacts to court decision Don Dixon, one of the illegally outsourced workers with Qantas, spoke with the media and said this was a victory for “ordinary Australian workers”. He said working for Qantas was like a family – so today’s decision is “sad in one way but it’s jubilant in all other ways”: We stood up and we fought. Every Australian now should say, you know what – this is [the] spirit of Australia. You dig in when it gets tough, and you don’t give up and here we are today having a massive victory. Dixon said that “so many families struggled” throughout the campaign and “losing your job as quickly and as brutally as it was, it was a horrible thing”: We thought we were there for the rest of our lives. Most of us are getting on in years, so getting another job out in the harsh world was very, very difficult. So this compensation will go a long way of paying people’s mortgages and giving them some hope that all isn’t lost when you group together and you have that fight. A federal court judge has rebuked Qantas for the “vast legal costs” expended to defend claims it illegally sacked almost 1,700 ground handlers in 2020, as former workers move a step closer towards a compensation payout. Justice Michael Lee has ruled that three test cases should each receive $30,000, $40,000 and $100,000 each. They suffered varying amounts of “non-economic loss”, the court ruled. Justice Lee ordered Qantas and the Transport Workers Union into mediation using the test case amounts to inform a total payout, with the parties due to report back early next month. He found that the workers would have been retrenched one year later in 2021 anyway due to Qantas’ “laser-like” focus on cutting costs, limiting compensation to the twelve months following the outsourcing decision. You can read the full story below: Trainee doctors rate training experience ‘pass’ at best in survey Trainees rated their training experience a “pass” at best in 2023, a survey from the peak body for doctors reveals. Just over one in five respondents didn’t feel comfortable raising bullying, harassment and discrimination with their college and only over half felt safe raising training and wellbeing concerns. Dr Sanjay Hettige, Council of Doctors in training chair described these figures as “far too low”, warranting greater attention from medical colleges. Only 4 in 10 trainees reported receiving useful feedback from their college, which Hettige said had a “huge impact on trainee health and wellbeing”. Almost 8 in 10 rural based trainees wanted to stay in rural practice, but only a third of metropolitan based trainees said they would consider moving to rural practice. Hettige said that greater exposure to rural training could help solve the rural doctor shortage, but graduates often have “no choice but to go to the big cities”. Unless greater focus is given to creating more rural training opportunities, this trend will continue at the detriment of patients in rural and regional Australia. People already lining up at Parliament House ahead of royal visit It’s still hours before the King and Queen arrive at Parliament House, but eager royal watchers have already been lining up for some time on the building’s forecourt. Before Parliament House staff closed up the front of the building for security reasons, we spotted around 50 people already lined up to get close to the royals; some prepared for the long haul with camp chairs and sandwiches, others bearing flowers and gifts. One family arrived wearing gold plastic crowns. There’s people of all ages, young and old, including a few kids that look like they’ve gotten the day off school to catch a glimpse of Charles and Camilla. We’ll bring you more from Parliament House later this afternoon. Brittany Higgins speaks on risks to baby during ‘acutely stressful pregnancy’ Brittany Higgins, who is currently pregnant, says that her baby is “perfectly fine and healthy” after a blood test raised red flags in the second trimester. In a post to Instagram, Higgins said it is an “understatement to say that we’ve had an acutely stressful pregnancy”, with her and her husband, David Sharaz, having the “scare of [their] lives” with a recent blood test: Our baby had a high probability of a genetic disorder – which wouldn’t have mattered to us – but scarily could mean he may be incompatible with life outside of the womb. After an amniocentesis and a seemingly never-ending wait our prayers were answered. Our little guy is perfectly fine and healthy. Higgins said she wanted to talk about this as it “takes the stigma out of these very real circumstances that people are faced with when trying to start families”. Meanwhile, Higgins and Sharaz have still not sold their French home. Higgins said in July that she was being forced to sell the home to defend the defamation action brought by the Liberal senator Linda Reynolds. Alpaca joins crowd awaiting royal couple At Canberra’s Australian War Memorial, territorians are lining up to catch a glimpse of the king and queen’s first pitstop in the nation’s capital. One of those in line is Robert Fletcher and his alpaca, Hephner. Hephner sported a sparkly gold crown and bow tie, with a blue velvet suit (see our previous post for some photos). And he was on his best behaviour, Fletcher said. We just thought, what an opportunity to dress him up as royalty and bring him today. Hephner is a monarchist, Fletcher said, and would love to meet King Charles III and Queen Camilla. I think this is probably the last opportunity that you’ll ever get to see them, certainly in my lifetime and probably my daughter’s lifetime as well. The gates opened at 10.30am, but whether Hephner with his human family will be allowed to pass through remains to be seen. People lining up to see King and Queen at War Memorial King Charles and Queen Camilla are continuing their tour of Australia, with their first stop today at the War Memorial in Canberra. Mike Bowers is there to capture all the action, and people are already lining up to catch a glimpse of the royals, including Robert Fletcher and his alpaca, Hephner: You can have a read of the full royal itinerary below: Extreme fire danger for west coast of South Australia There is an extreme fire danger rating for the west coast of South Australia today. The Bureau of Meteorology says hot and dry conditions, with gusty north-westerly winds forecast ahead of a cooler, south-westerly change this afternoon and evening. Here’s a look at today’s weather forecasts across Australia’s capital cities, from the Bureau of Meteorology: Sydney’s Entertainment Quarter at Moore Park is set for redevelopment, with the state government opening a tender process for its long-term lease. Proposals are being sought to deliver more visitors, live performances and events, a statement from the NSW government said. It is also seeking proposals for additional creative spaces that could host up to 20,000 people. The state government said the EQ is one of Sydney’s key entertainment and sports precincts but is “currently underutilised”, considering its location between Centennial Park, the SCG and Allianz Stadium, and proximity to the CBD via the light rail. The current lease has a maximum term expiring in 2046 and the open-tender will allow all parties to put forward proposals. The open tender will commence in the “near-term” and run through next year. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said in a statement that the EQ was “falling far short of meeting its full potential”: We want to turn the EQ into a thriving world-class precinct, full of dining and entertainment options, complete with a brand new venue that can host between 15,000 to 20,000 for live music and public events … From cutting through red tape that has decimated Sydney’s nightlife to getting visitors and entertainment back into the city with projects this like this, we’re focused on turning Sydney into the best entertainment destination in the world. Every Victorian who buys off-the-plan apartments, units and townhouses will have their stamp duty slashed, AAP reports, but only for a limited time. The premier, Jacinta Allan, announced Victorian stamp duty concessions would be expanded to all buyers and uncapped. Thresholds for stamp duty concessions had previously been set at $750,000 and $550,000 for first home buyers and owner-occupiers respectively. But eligibility has been expanded to investors and the value cap removed for one year from today, providing a 100% discount for outstanding construction and refurbishment costs when calculating stamp duty. Allan said the 12-month stimulus plan was in response to under-pressure builders crying out for help after successive interest rate rises. She told Sunrise earlier: It’s certainly having an impact on the housing industry. That’s why we’re providing this support. It’s good for builders, it’s certainly good for buyers who will save money, it’s good for building more homes. The premier foreshadowed she would release more housing policies and initiatives across the rest of the week. Bowen underscores gas won’t be included in any capacity scheme The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been taking questions after his speech, confirming he wouldn’t include gas into the capacity investment scheme (that was set up speed up the renewables’ rollout). Bowen noted NSW had included gas in its long-term auction system, and noted that no gas operator had bothered to bid “because it is so expensive”. Hence, putting gas into the federal scheme “achieves nothing” because such project would never get support. “It’s just a distraction,” he said. (His federal counterpart, Ted O’Brien, had argued last week: “The inclusion of gas in the CIS is crucial to addressing the immediate challenges in Australia’s gas market, ensuring reliable electricity supply, and stabilising energy prices.”) Bowen, meanwhile, downplayed reports in the past week or so in the Murdoch tabloids and the AFR about Norway’s Equinor pulling out of the running for a proposed offshore windfarm zone near Illawarra. He noted that Equinor had announced its exit from the race back in June (and hence, wondered why it was being repeated). The company was still in the running for a zone planned for the offshore Hunter River, up the NSW coast, and the much larger zone off the Gippsland coast was going “gangbusters”. As we anticipated, that second round of the CIS is only an acceleration (albeit a significant one). The overall size of the scheme will not be expanded, Bowen’s office has confirmed. Meanwhile, Bowen hinted the government won’t be releasing its 2035 emissions targets this side of the election. He would be taking advice from the Climate Change Authority (now chaired by Matt Kean, the former NSW treasurer and energy minister in a Liberal-led coalition). No nation had yet lodged 2035 carbon cuts to the UN body (the UNFCCC), Bowen noted. Perhaps Australia won’t be in a hurry to sign up. Andrew Barr speaks following election win in ACT The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier after his election win over the weekend. Barr, already the longest-serving political leader in the country, fended off a negative swing and an independent surge to win his third election as chief minister. He noted swings against some incumbent parties, including Labor, and said “there are always lessons to learn from each election campaign”: It is looking increasingly certain of 10 Labor and three Green [seats], with a possibility of an additional seat either going to Labor or Green in the southern electorate of Brindabella. But there’s postal votes and interstate votes that will need to be added to that count. We would hope this would be resolved by the end of the week. Responding to accusations that Labor is dominating the jurisdiction, Barr argued that “power is always shared in the ACT” with crossbenchers: In this instance, we will expect a crossbench of at least five and possibly six members out of our 25-member assembly. But they have generally represented progressive views. The Canberra Liberals are the most right-wing branch of the Liberal party in this country, and that’s been ably demonstrated election after election … We don’t make any apologies for running successful campaigns. Barr argued that “votes were quite sharply weaker for the Liberal party” after its leader, Elizabeth Lee, was caught giving the middle finger to a journalist. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, says the government will accelerate the pace of its capacity investment scheme, an auction system that helps underwrite the rollout of renewables. Bowen has told an AFR energy conference in Sydney that its second round of investments has been lifted to 6GW of new renewable generation from 4GW. Storage (mostly big batteries) will be lifted to 4GW from an original 2GW. He said: I expected it to work well, and it’s working better than I thought. The scheme guarantees a minimum payment for the power supply – but if wholesale prices are higher than a certain level, the government would take a share of the cut. It’s not clear if the acceleration of the plans means the overall scheme will be larger than anticipated. Perhaps there’s also an insurance element. Auction results can’t be overturned if the government were to change at the next election. The Coalition has said it wants to introduce gas in the scheme (something that states such as Victoria had opposed in the past). Plans for seven nuclear power plants are unlikely to gain market interest to include them in any action, given most reports estimate such generation to be far more expensive than wind or solar (even with storage added). Bowen said uncertainty in the industry was something the Coalition was “deliberately” creating by introducing nuclear proposals to Australia’s mix. Bowen said he remains confident that the government can meet its 2030 goal of supplying 82% of electricity from clean energy sources. Bowen noted too that some parts of the grid had record minimum demand on the grid over the weekend, something we touched a week or so ago here: Byelection results reflect shift away from major parties: Ryan Monique Ryan was also asked about Jacqui Scruby’s election results in Pittwater at the weekend, and if they makes her feel more comfortable ahead of the next federal election regarding retaining her own seat. She said: [Almost] a third of Australians did not vote for the major parties [in 2022], I don’t think we have seen anything since that time that’s changed their minds. I think people are seeing that independents can hold the governments to account at all levels of government. We play an important role, we’re pragmatic and centrist and we contribute. The results from the elections over the weekend reflected that. Ryan says Allan ‘playing politics’ with Nimby-ism suggestion Monique Ryan was also asked about suggestions from the Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, that part of the opposition to the rezoning plan is “Nimby-ism”. Ryan accused the premier of “playing politics with this” and said she is “trying to create a point of difference:” I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in ensuring … these developments will be [designed] in a way that’s sensible and sustainable, they’ll be delivered on time … and we’ll retain the character of the suburbs in which we’ve chosen to live, while welcoming hopefully hundreds of thousands of new people into the area. Independent Kooyong MP responds to Victorian government rezoning plan Monique Ryan, the federal member for Kooyong, was up on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss the Victorian government’s rezoning plan: Ryan has been quoted in the Financial Review as saying new developments proposed by the Allan government could result in buildings that were too tall, ugly, and slow to be delivered. She responded to this, and said: The announcement this weekend from the premier was for nine massive new developments just in the electorate of Kooyong. That’s huge. These could be up to 20 storeys high. Of course that will cause some concern from people who live in the area, who have chosen to live there, because it’s a beautiful part of the world. Ryan said that people need “certainty” their kids will still get into local schools and that they won’t lose green spaces and amenities, and that more detail is needed on the plan. We’re not saying we don’t want it, I think people in my part of the world are welcoming it. We’d also like some assurances from the government they will include social and affordable housing in these developments. We really don’t have any detail as of yet and that’s the stuff that’s missing at this point. Teal independent speaks following byelection results at the weekend The independent Jacqui Scruby, a Climate 200-backed former adviser to federal MPs Zali Steggall and Sophie Scamps, is set to win the Pittwater byelection in NSW. She spoke with ABC RN this morning and said “of course” her results are “part of a broader trend” towards independents, and “people wanting a different type of politics”: So this representation that is community representation, rather than party representation, and also the ability for independence, I think, to work across party lines, hold governments’ to account, but also work collaboratively with governments in order to deliver … I’ve earned the trust of traditional Liberal voters, and I will seek to maintain that trust and gain the trust of others. Scruby argued that people are “sick of divisive politics” and are “looking for representation that is not divisive, that’s really practical”: And it’s a bit more nuanced as well, because part of community representation is bringing people into their democracy and helping them understand the nuance of policies, rather than … opposition for the sake of opposition. Scruby said that in the three NSW byelections, the Liberal candidates that were chosen didn’t live in their electorate – and “how that played … maybe is a lesson to the Liberal party”. Shadow housing minister responds to business call for $10bn housing reform While on ABC RN, the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, was also asked about calls from the Business Council for a $10bn federal plan to cut the cost of construction. You can read all the details on this below: The business council is calling an increase in foreign workers with construction skills. Sukkar was asked: how can the Coalition back this if it wants to cut the number of permanent visas? Sukkar argued that “you’ve got to reorientate the composition of who you bring in”: In recent times, we’ve had the Labor party bringing in more yoga instructors than bricklayers … We’ve made clear we’re going to reduce migration to free up 100,000 homes for Australians. Now you can simultaneously ensure that of the generous migration program that Australia does have in place, that you reorientate it to the sorts of skills we need. The government and the opposition have both promised cuts to migration in response, at least partially, to Australia’s housing crisis. But how much does immigration actually contribute to the cost of housing and rent? You can read more on this below: Shadow housing minister critical of rollout of Victorian rezoning announcement The shadow minister for housing, Michael Sukkar, was up on ABC RN this morning to speak on the Victorian government’s rezoning plan, as we flagged earlier: Sukkar criticised the state government for a lack of consultation with the community and said: If you’re going to make any of these sorts of investments or changes, you’ve got to consult with the people who are affected now … For people to wake up one morning and read that there’s going to be a 20 story tower next door to them, I don’t think it’s unreasonable that they’re a bit crazy … That’s the first I’ve heard [and] that’s the problem with this announcement, there’s been no discussion with the community. Classroom mobile ban hailed success by NSW government The NSW government’s decision to ban mobile phones in thousands of public school classrooms has been hailed a success, AAP reports. An education department survey of almost 1,000 public school principals found huge support for the ban, with 95% reporting positive results. The premier, Chris Minns, said in a statement today that one year in “it’s clear, this was the right decision”: Without the distraction of a mobile phone in their pockets, students have been able to focus on their learning, while building stronger relationships with their classmates. The survey also found 81% of principals agreed students’ learning had improved, 87% said students were less distracted in the classroom and 86% said socialising had improved. The ban was introduced at the beginning of term four in 2023. Allan calls out opposition to housing plan Jacinta Allan said that “Nimby-ism” – aka a “Not In My Back Yard” approach to new housing – was “one way to describe” how opponents to her plan are feeling. She told ABC News Breakfast that for too long, “too many politicians have not addressed this key fundamental issue which is why we’ve got to this point.” We’ve got to this point because the loudest voices, who don’t necessarily represent all of the community, have particularly got in the way of building new homes. They’ve been the blockers. They’re particularly Liberal members of parliament, like we saw yesterday in Brighton, and we’ve got Monique Ryan, who is not Liberal. We have residents who are not necessarily Liberal members either. Yesterday, angry Brighton residents surrounded the pub where Allan announced the housing plan to media, chanting: “Shame, premier, shame.” Allan said what she would talk to the community about is whether it “makes sense to have taller buildings hugging the train station itself, being close to the train station, and then having lower levels as you move away from the train stations”: … we’re going to embark on a consultation, community by community, street by street, house by house. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has been speaking with ABC News Breakfast about a plan to create 50 new “activity zones” to help deliver more than 30,000 additional homes across Melbourne by 2051. Defending the plan, she said that more homes need to be built in the state, particularly for younger Victorians under 40: Anyone under the age of 40 knows just how tough it is to find a home, particularly to find a home close to where they grew up, close to families. We need to get on and build more homes, particularly in and around the suburbs of Melbourne. Allan was asked about pushback from locals, including those in Brighton, and whether she should have spoken with residents. She said 25 zoning locations had been announced, with another 25 to come, and “we’re going to get on and talk to people in those local communities.” I know from my conversations with many Victorians that putting homes next to a train station just makes sense for so many people … The status quo is just not an option any more. It’s tougher and tougher for younger people to get into a home, to start a family, to build their long-term wealth that previous generations have had that opportunity to. We’ve got to get on and find new ways to push on and build more homes, because the status quo is locking out too many people. Bid to avoid post-2032 homelessness in Queensland There are fears Brisbane could be heading toward a post-2032 Olympic Games homelessness crisis if the next state government does not take action, AAP reports. The warning comes after a Q Shelter-commissioned Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute report on the Olympics’ impact on homelessness and the local housing market. Q Shelter’s CEO, Fiona Caniglia, said the “best-case scenario is people will be pushed out to the regions”. But if you live here now and for reasons that are important to you, like work and family, then we need to create a framework so you can stay, and so you’re not forced to move because of the impact of the games. Reports will be published annually leading up to the 2032 games to monitor housing market conditions and the responses to homelessness in Brisbane. The aim is to help calibrate policy responses to ensure Brisbane 2032 delivers its intended legacy of social inclusion. However, Q Shelter said it was not out of the realm of possibility that Brisbane could be the first games host that doesn’t worsen homelessness. This could be done through legacy planning, including repurposing the athletes’ village into social housing. Overnight, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said “the worst is behind us” when it comes to inflation. Speaking to 7News’ Spotlight program, he said the peak in inflation was now “in the rear-view mirror, and we’re not complacent about that”. But we are confident that, having been through a very difficult time together, better days are ahead. Asked whether that meant interest rates would come down before a potential election next May, Chalmers said there was “really good reasons for treasurers of either political persuasion not to make predictions about interest rate movements”. The market expects that there will be interest rate cuts in 2025 … as treasurer, I’ve been very careful not to make those kinds of predictions. Chalmers said that Australia “came quite close” to recession in the first two quarters of this year, and that growth was “very, very flat” in March and June. And if I’m honest with you … there were times where we feared that the economy would go backwards. But if you’re asking me, was I worried at the time? Too right I was … There were some moments in the lead up to the release of [the national accounts] where there was a very substantial risk that the economy might have gone backwards. A lot of relief when we discovered that it hadn’t. Good morning, and welcome back to a new week on the Australia news live blog. I’m Emily Wind, and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage this Monday. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said that “the worst is behind us” when it comes to inflation. Speaking on 7News’ Spotlight program last night, he said: When it comes to inflation specifically, the worst is behind us … The peak in inflation is now in the rear-view mirror and we’re not complacent about that, we’re cautious about that, but we are confident that having been through a very difficult time together, better days are ahead. We’ll bring you more from his interview in a moment. Meanwhile, King Charles and Queen Camilla are continuing their tour of Australia as part of their first visit to the country since Charles became its reigning monarch. This morning, the couple will visit the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and the prime minister will host a reception at Parliament House. The king will meet firefighters and bushfire researchers at CSIRO, while Camilla will meet the founder of the charity donations platform GIVIT. There will also be a tour of the National Botanical Gardens.

          "headline": "Don’t let under-18s join pop bands, says leading songwriter after Liam Payne’s death",
          "bodyText": "Under-18s should not be pushed into pop stardom, one of the UK’s leading songwriters has said, in the wake of the tragic death of former One Direction star Liam Payne. As Payne’s father, Geoff, arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to arrange the repatriation of his son’s body, fans were still taking in the news of the 31-year-old’s fall from a third-floor hotel balcony. Many also joined the Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy, an ex-partner, in decrying the lurid coverage of Payne’s death scene in some news outlets. Speaking this weekend, Guy Chambers, the songwriter and friend of Robbie Williams, has called for the industry to hold back from working with talent under the age of 18. “I do think putting a 16-year-old in an adult world like that is potentially really damaging. Robbie experienced that, certainly,” he told the Observer. The need for better protection for vulnerable young male pop stars has gained urgency in the aftermath of Payne’s death, prompted by criticism of the music industry’s treatment of the former teenage star, who had spoken of his struggles to find mental stability after his sudden fame as a member of One Direction. The band was formed on ITV’s The X Factor in 2010, when a 16-year-old Payne came back for a second audition on the talent show and joined up with Harry Styles and fellow members. One of the show’s judges was Tweedy, with whom he later had a child, Bear, who is now seven. Payne had first auditioned for the show aged only 14. Louis Theroux, executive producer of the upcoming BBC series Boybands Forever has spoken of the perils of “getting everything you dreamed of, and it not being what you imagined”. Theroux’s new series, which goes out on BBC2 in the middle of next month and was made with his wife, Nancy Strang, will look at both the dramatic highs of gaining instant fame and the contrasting depths of despair it can prompt. With “searingly honest” contributions from Williams, formerly of Take That, and Brian McFadden of Westlife, it focuses on the earlier years of the boyband phenomenon in Britain and Ireland, from the 1990s to the late 2000s. Talking about his year-long work on the show, Theroux said the artists will discuss their “highs and lows” over three episodes that centre “on a generation of young men and their managers, who were wildly successful and also immensely vulnerable, having the times of their lives and, also, in some cases, cracking up.” Due to the death of Payne, issues the series examines have already prompted leading names in the British music industry to urge action. Chambers said: “I have four children, so I think about this a lot. I know in Robbie’s case, with Take That, there wasn’t any proper protection set up to look after what were teenage boys. That was a long time ago, but I don’t see much sign of change. There is not much more real care taken, that I have observed, from people involved in the big television talent shows.” Chambers, who co-wrote the hits Angels and Let Me Entertain You with Williams, believes the entertainment business should set new standards: “I would suggest that people should not be in a boyband until they are 18, and the industry should stick to that, too.” These worries are echoed by Mike Smith, the former music industry boss at Warner/Chappell, who has also worked at EMI and Columbia. “I am not sure if it is something for legislation, but the longer a young person can postpone a career in music the better,” he said. “Of course, there is nothing wrong with forming a band in your teens, but my admiration goes out to anyone who comes out of an early professional career in good mental shape. I signed a young Irish band called the Strypes once, and I was uncomfortable with the level of responsibility I felt. People are still immature at 16, so the very thought of going through all that madness when you have no idea who you are yet is alarming.” However, Smith, who has worked with many bands and singers, including Blur, Robbie Williams, Supergrass and Arctic Monkeys, as well as the X Factor winner Matt Cardle, believes there is now much more caution about handling young singers and songwriters. “When I was at Warners in 2018, we did improve on this. We set up a fund in the contract of our songwriters to cover their mental health care because we were seeing around 25% of them suffering anxiety or depression – and these were not even the frontline pop stars. “Around that time, the major music companies were all doing similar things to help – taking people on to the payroll to advise the artists and their staff. That wasn’t around early enough for Robbie, I know, but it is better now, partly because we are having the conversations about it. “I don’t think I really understood it earlier. But what hasn’t changed, of course, is the incredible pressure these young artists are under. Everyone expects you to be living your best life, but then you find you can’t function. People want you to be happy all the time and you are constantly scrutinised.”"

          "headline": "Are you better off than four years ago? Why US voters should – but can’t – say yes",
          "bodyText": "When Ronald Reagan beat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, 10 short words proved decisive. After a period in which high inflation had eroded living standards, the Republican challenger for the White House asked voters: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” The simple question that resonated so strongly with US voters 44 years ago has resurfaced in 2024 as the race between the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the former president Donald Trump goes down to the wire. By any objective measure, the answer to the question today should be “yes”. Under Joe Biden, the US economy has created more jobs (16m) than during any four-year presidential term since the second world war. In the three years before the Covid crisis caused mass – mostly temporary – layoffs in 2020, the economy under Trump created just under 7m jobs. And if growth has been modest compared with the far more rapid expansion in the 1950s and 1960s – averaging just over 2% under Biden – it has been considerably faster than in other leading industrial economies. Every member of the G7 group plunged into recession when the pandemic struck, but the US has posted by far the strongest recovery. Figures supplied by the House of Commons library showed the US economy almost 11% bigger than it was at the end of 2019, compared with a rise of 3.9% for the eurozone and 2.9% for the UK. Nor is this just a recent phenomenon. Since 2010 the US economy has grown by 34%, the EU by 21% and the gap in per-capita incomes has widened steadily over time. Last month’s hard-hitting report on EU growth by Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank president, highlights the US lead over Europe in hi-tech sectors and says the bloc is caught in a “middle-tech trap”. Europe has its share of world-beating companies but none of them were founded in the past 30 years – a period that has seen the emergence of Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Nvidia. The US and China lead the way in the development of artificial intelligence: the EU lags way behind. Germany, Europe’s powerhouse economy, is in deep trouble. It has had the weakest recovery since the pandemic, is teetering on the brink of recession, has been hard hit by the war in Ukraine and is paying the price for failure to ready the German economy for the digital age. Nor has Europe produced anything as gamechanging as Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which has used generous subsidies to spur hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in clean technology. But Harris is not – if opinion polls are right – getting as much of a fillip from the economy as she might expect. One possible explanation is that US voters may be better off than they were four years ago, but they don’t feel as if they are. As was the case in all western economies, inflation surged in the US as a result of the impact of supply-chain bottlenecks after the ending of lockdown restrictions combined with the rise in energy and food prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US was less exposed than Europe to higher gas prices and the peak in inflation was lower at 9.1% than in the eurozone (10.6%) and the UK (11.1%) and has subsequently declined to 2.4%. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank: “The divergence in economic performance among advanced economies since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has become increasingly evident, with the US notably outperforming its peers.” The NIESR says it is impressive that the US has had faster growth than Europe but lower inflation. But prices in the US are markedly higher than they were when Biden entered the White House as president and it is this, rather than the current inflation rate, that appears to have affected the public mood. Trump has been quick to tell voters that inflation was lower when he was in office between 2017 and 2021 than it has been under Biden. The closely watched University of Michigan barometer of consumer confidence slipped back in October amid lingering unhappiness about the cost of living. Adam Tooze, a professor of history at Columbia University in New York, said that while one half of him bought into the narrative of a “soft landing” and a “goldilocks economy”, the other half understood why voters were unhappy about the cost of living. “Several times I’ve been brought up short by jaw-dropping price hikes for everyday items: milk, fruit, veg, a cup of coffee, a loaf of bread, toothpaste etc. There’s been a price shock, all right,” Tooze said in his daily newsletter. “If your budget is tight, it is not hard to understand why you are feeling pinched.” A second reason Harris may not be reaping the benefits of a growing economy is that the fruits of that growth are being enjoyed disproportionately by the better off. Albert Edwards, Société Générale’s chief global strategist, said: “The US consumer has surprised on the upside recently. But these gains have been primarily driven by high-income, asset-rich households. No wonder anger about rising inequality is once again shaping the political discourse.” Economists say it is not obvious that Trump’s economic plans – which involve higher tariffs and lower immigration – would make life much better for US workers and in fact are likely to make them considerably worse off. Nicolò Tamberi, a trade policy economist at the University of Sussex, said tariffs proposed by Trump (60% on imports from China and 20% tariff on imports from everywhere else) would cut imports by 37%, and lead to markedly higher prices. “Changes in real consumption – what people can afford to buy considering rising prices – would drop by between 1.8% and 3% in the US. This could result in a welfare loss for the US of $567bn [£435bn] annually – a loss of $1,691 a year per person,” he said. Despite everything, the latest odds from the bookies suggest Trump may exploit unhappiness about the state of the economy and win on 5 November. That could prompt a simple response from European voters: count your blessings. You may think you have economic problems. Ours are a lot more serious."

          "headline": "Zelenskyy presses EU for ‘immediate invitation’ to join Nato",
          "bodyText": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged European leaders to issue an “immediate invitation” to Ukraine to join Nato as he pitched his “victory plan”, which he said would end the war in 2025 at the latest. Addressing the EU’s 27 leaders at a Brussels summit, Ukraine’s president outlined his five-point plan, which urges allies to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons on military targets inside Ukraine’s occupied territories and Russia, as well as to help increase air defences. Ukraine wants an immediate invitation to join Nato, with membership later, but in the transatlantic alliance this is widely seen as unrealistic. “If we start now and follow the victory plan, we can end this war no later than next year,” Zelenskyy told EU leaders. A “deterrence package” on Ukrainian land, he said, “would either force Russia to participate in real peace negotiations, or allow for the destruction of their military targets”. “Putin must just see that his political calculations are worthless,” he added. Zelenskyy’s visit comes at a perilous moment for Ukraine, which is steadily losing ground to Russian forces in the eastern Donbas, ahead of a daunting winter that also brings the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House. Speaking to reporters, Zelenskyy described how he gave Trump a detailed account of the 1994 Budapest memorandum signed by Russia, the US and the UK, under which Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed to give up their nuclear arsenals, inherited from the Soviet Union, in exchange for guarantees their sovereignty would be respected “within existing borders”. In a rhetorical flourish he said Ukraine faced a choice between resuming nuclear weapons and Nato membership, adding: “We are not choosing nuclear weapons, we are choosing Nato, and I think that Donald Trump heard me.” Zelenskyy declined to give further details of his conversation with the former US president, who has repeatedly claimed he could end the war in a day, without offering any explanation. Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, has set out a peace deal that would mean Kyiv giving up large swaths of occupied land to Russia. The Ukrainian leader also said his intelligence services believed 10,000 North Korean soldiers were preparing to join the war on the Russian side, “a really urgent” matter he said he had discussed with the US president, Joe Biden. Some North Korean officers are already thought to be on occupied territory in Ukraine. Zelenskyy suggested Putin was turning to allies to provide troops because he feared domestic mobilisation would prompt a public backlash. The Ukrainian discussed the war with the leaders of 27 EU countries, mostly Nato members, before heading to the alliance headquarters to meet the secretary-general, Mark Rutte, and Nato defence ministers. He has already been to Washington, Paris, Berlin, Rome and London to make the case for his plan. Rutte, who became the top civilian official at the 32-member alliance earlier this month, said he could not say when Ukraine would become a member. Nato’s members, he said, would have to study the plan in detail. The US and Germany, the two largest donors of military aid to Kyiv, remain opposed to imminent Nato membership, fearing it would put the alliance on a collision course with nuclear-armed Russia. Many other Nato members view the demand for an immediate invitation as unrealistic. In an attempt to get the US on side, Ukraine is offering, after the war, to replace US soldiers stationed in Europe with Ukrainian units trained to Nato standards. “After this war, Ukraine will have one of the most experienced and largest military contingents,” states the text of Zelenskyy’s peace plan. “By replacing certain US contingent with the Ukrainian contingent, the United States will be able to use its released troops to perform other security tasks outside Europe.” Ukraine also has an uphill task to convince Germany. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arriving at the summit, said: “You know Germany’s position on the issues involved. This will not change.” Zelenskyy also has to contend with Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s Russia-friendly prime minister and a serial disruptor of EU support for Ukraine. Before the summit Orbán described Zelenskyy’s victory plans as “more than frightening” and once again urged the EU to change its approach because “we are losing this war”. Hungary is the obstacle to US participation in a $50bn international loan, backed by Russia’s frozen assets in the west, to help Ukraine stay financially afloat. Washington has said it will only participate if the EU agreed to extend its Russia sanctions to three years, rather than the current six-month rollovers. Hungary says it cannot make this decision until after the US election. In an attempt to “Orbán proof” finance for Ukraine, the EU has already agreed to loan €35bn (£29bn), with the UK and Japan expected to make up the rest of the €46bn. But officials would prefer the US to join the plan, reducing the EU’s share of the liability. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, urged western allies to support Ukraine to press the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to the negotiating table: “Right now he thinks he is prevailing. He thinks Russia is pushing Ukraine to the corner. And this is the worst moment to start negotiations … because Russia feels to be the stronger side.”"

          "headline": "Tax-free withdrawals from pension pots surge amid fears over autumn budget",
          "bodyText": "Savers have started to withdraw cash from their pension pots amid fears over potential tax changes at the autumn budget, according to investment companies. The investment platform AJ Bell said reports that the chancellor, Rachel Reeeves, was likely to increase taxes at the budget on 30 October had spooked some of its customers into new retirement savings decisions. The wealth management firm Quilter, which manages more than £113bn of customers’ money, also said it had experienced a surge in calls from customers wanting to withdraw cash from their pension plans. Royal London Asset Management had also seen an increase in inquiries. Michael Summersgill, the chief executive of AJ Bell, said on Thursday: “Pensions are the primary retirement savings vehicle in the UK and customers are unsurprisingly sensitive to changes in their tax treatment. We have seen a noticeable change in both customer contributions to pensions and tax-free cash withdrawals.” AJ Bell has called on the Treasury to commit to a pension “tax lock” in the budget to give certainty over the rules in the coming years. Under current rules, savers who are 55 and over can withdraw 25% of their pension pot without incurring any tax charges up to £268,275. But it has been suggested that Reeves could opt to change those rules after the leftwing thinktank the Fabian Society recommended the government dropped the threshold to £100,000. Reeves is also rumoured to have considered a 30% flat rate of tax relief on pensions contributions, rather than basing relief on the income tax each individual pays. However, the chancellor reportedly backed away from the proposal after public sector unions warned it would hit 1 million of their members and erase the benefit of public sector pay increases the government had just agreed. AJ Bell and Quilter have written to the Treasury to express concern around potential pension tax changes. Quilter said customers had contacted it to withdraw cash from their pension pots “often without a clear understanding of the potential long-term consequences”. However, many did not go through with a withdrawal after speaking to an adviser from the firm. Steven Levin, Quilter’s chief executive, said: “We urge the government to provide a clear roadmap and ensure any changes to pension tax policy are introduced with ample consultation and an implementation period. “Stability and predictability are crucial for sound financial planning, and a well-informed public is essential for maintaining confidence in the pension system. A prompt statement from the Treasury, advising against changes to pension arrangements pre-budget, would be highly beneficial.” Summersgill said the change in customer behaviour represented “significant decisions for individual customers” but had not had a significant impact on AJ Bell. The firm is one of the largest investment platforms in the UK, with 542,000 customers. AJ Bell reported a 45% jump in cash inflows, to £6.1bn in the year to 30 September, pushing total assets under management up 22% to a record £86.5bn. “While the upcoming budget has introduced unhelpful uncertainty, we remain positive about the outlook for AJ Bell and the platform market more broadly,” Summersgill said. The Financial Conduct Authority, Britain’s financial watchdog, recently published guidance for firms on customers taking tax-free cash, under the heading “Where a customer wants to withdraw their tax-free cash which may result in poor outcomes”."

          "headline": "USPS accused of retaliation and harassment after employee raised racism allegations",
          "bodyText": "The United States Postal Service (USPS) is facing accusations of retaliation, harassment and intimidation from a longtime employee who alleges she experienced racism on the job. Carla Thomas Vinson has worked for the USPS in Gainesville, Florida, for about 26 years. Everything changed last February. Vinson, who is African American, overheard two white colleagues in conversation. Both used racial slurs, according to Vinson and a legal filing submitted by the USPS – which one of them would later repeat to her, directly, when recounting the exchange. In an interview with the Guardian, Vinson claimed she had been subjected to “stalking, intimidation, bullying” after she complained about the incident. “I feel as though a company that I have invested so many years in has failed me,” she said. The USPS declined to comment. “It is USPS policy not to comment on pending litigation or internal personnel matters,” a spokesperson said. The postal service has endured a string of crises in recent years, as it grappled with financial issues and declines in mail volume. Louis DeJoy, a former trucking logistics CEO and prolific fundraiser for Donald Trump with no prior postal service experience, became postmaster general in 2020; his plans for reform have faced criticism amid claims of slower deliveries. Inside the postal service, meanwhile, employees have raised the alarm over alleged workplace misconduct. People of color represent more than half its workforce, which it wants to “represent the diverse communities we serve”, according to its website. But for years, it has faced allegations of racism in its ranks. *** Vinson, a supervisor at the USPS at the time, did not normally work on Sundays. An exception was 19 February 2023. The office was mostly empty. That morning, while making a pot of coffee, she overheard a postal employee speaking to one of her fellow supervisors. William Roy complained to Alvin Tate that he felt he was being treated like a “fucking N-word”, according to Vinson. She says Tate reassured him he was not, and that he was “one of us”. “I was kind of shocked, because Roy is an older white male,” Vinson said in an interview. While she said Roy did not talk to a lot of people at the post office, she claimed that she was someone he spoke to “every day”. Roy left the office, and Tate came to her desk. At this point, according to Vinson, Tate sat down and repeated the conversation, including the racial slur that both he and Roy had used. Vinson was “just stunned”, she told the Guardian. “I didn’t say a word.” She remembers reaching for a yellow sticky tab, and making a mark each time Tate used the N-word. He did so 17 times, according to Vinson. In an affidavit, Tate claimed he only used the N-word once, when reciting the initial conversation back to Vinson. Tate walked away. “I got up. I was so shocked,” said Vinson. “I went to the bathroom and I cried. I literally cried. Because I couldn’t believe that this man, that I’ve been working with for a few years, felt the need to sit down and say these things, and just kept on saying it over and over again.” Around 45 minutes later, she decided to confront Tate. “I said: ‘Alvin, you don’t think the conversation that you and Roy had was hurtful to me’,” Vinson recalled. “And I said: ‘And then you came, you never addressed Roy by saying that as a supervisor, but then you came and sat at my desk, and you said it over and over again like it’s in your everyday vocabulary. You continue to say it.’” Vinson says she started to cry. “I didn’t even realize what I was saying,” Tate said, according to her and the USPS motion for summary judgment. He allegedly added: “Can you tell me what it means?” Tate later claimed in an affidavit he asked Vinson what the word meant to her so she can understand why it upset her. She went home early. *** Following the conversations with Roy and Tate, Vinson texted her manager, Matt Sapp, to explain what had happened. He immediately called. Vinson’s relationship with Sapp had already been strained by an incident that tested her confidence in the postal service’s handling of workplace conduct. Nine years previously, in 2014, Sapp allegedly pulled his pants down at work, exposing himself to her. In a 2014 written statement on the incident, Vinson said she was “extremely shocked and horrified” and that she tried blocking it out of her mind. Following an internal investigation, Sapp was not reprimanded and continued to work in a management role at the plant, according to Vinson. “I immediately heard about it,” said Linda O’Brien, who was a clerk in the maintenance department and nearby at the time of the incident. “Carla immediately came to me and said: ‘Matt just whipped out his penis,’” recalled O’Brien, who is now retired. She also said she received sexually graphic text messages from Sapp that were sent while she was still a USPS employee. The Guardian has reviewed these messages. “Carla, she’s a good person,” said O’Brien, “and nobody deserves to be treated like she’s being treated.” Sapp has since left the Gainesville, Florida, plant. He took up a management position at a larger postal service plant in Jacksonville, Florida. *** When Sapp called Vinson, and listened to her account, she says that he assured her he would resolve the issue, told her not to talk to anyone about it, and promised he would not relay their discussion to Tate. But when Vinson returned to work the next day, she says she realized that many of her co-workers were already aware of the incident. They were “coming into my office, which is rare”, she said, claiming they asked her if she was OK, and explained: “Matt told us what happened.” Sapp did not show up at the plant on Monday, according to Vinson, and took a sick day on Tuesday. Tate, meanwhile, showed up for an early morning shift – despite his previous schedule beginning in the afternoon. “Everybody’s talking about it, but there’s no resolution,” recalled Vinson. “All they see is that I’m at work, Alvin’s at work and Matt is ghosting us.” Sapp returned on Wednesday. Vinson says she confronted him about telling other employees about the incident, but he denied doing so. She did not believe him: aside from Vinson, her husband, Tate and Roy, no one other than Sapp had known what happened. With no resolution, Vinson started working evening shifts, on lower pay, to get away from Tate. “Maybe two, three weeks” later, however, she says Tate moved to this shift, too – in a direct supervisory role. “It was torture,” she recalled in the interview. “It had gotten to a point where I started getting disciplined for stuff. All the years I’ve been there, never been disciplined. And it’s still ongoing.” * * * William Roy was fired in March 2023, according to a statement of material facts compiled by a USPS attorney, while Tate received a written warning. Vinson contacted the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) last April, and filed a formal complaint last July, alleging that she was repeatedly subjected to a racial slur. A motion for summary judgment filed by a USPS attorney claimed that Tate only used the N-word once, while relaying his conversation with Roy to Vinson, and that “prompt” investigation and “remedial action” by USPS managers “precludes liability”. Tate was initially moved to a different shift to avoid interaction with Vinson, according to the motion, but was moved back during holiday peak season to train an employee. The case is currently awaiting a decision by administrative law judge Kimberly Greenleaf in Florida on the motion for summary judgment filed on behalf of the USPS and Louis DeJoy, the postmaster general, by a USPS attorney. In an investigative report filed as part of the EEOC process, two other USPS workers alleged that they had heard Tate use the N-word in the workplace on other occasions. “He has been heard on many occasions using the N-word not only in front of me, but many within the plant,” said one. Tate, in an affidavit, did not address those statements. He only admitted to using the N-word once, when reciting what Roy had said to Vinson. While the Guardian directly contacted Tate and Sapp for comment, a USPS spokesperson declined to comment on their behalf. Roy could not be reached for comment. *** The situation at the plant has not improved over the past year, according to Vinson. “It’s been stalking, intimidation, bullying, every single day,” she said. “I have missed a lot of work, because I literally have been sick with going there, so I’ve exhausted all of my leave, my sick leave, my vacation time, my FMLA [medical leave]. “And when you don’t go to work and you have no leave, you’re on leave without pay status. So I wasn’t getting paid for a long period of time, so I’ve had to use my credit cards to pay for this, pay for that. And then they’re blown up, because that’s what I’ve had to do.” She has filed additional complaints, which have been consolidated with her original EEOC lawsuit against the USPS and DeJoy, over examples of alleged retaliation she has experienced since the initial incident last year. The initial complaints were dismissed due to not being timely filed, though the appeal is currently being reviewed. Her claims range from having one of the two men involved in the February 2023 incident moved to directly supervise and work alongside her, to being forced to leave work by another supervisor, Noelia Lamont – an aunt of the current plant manager, Javier Pazo – and then written up for being awol after she was escorted out. Seven other USPS employees provided Vinson with written statements, which the Guardian reviewed, corroborating allegations of incidents Vinson faced with Lamont, including intimidation, aggression, an attempt to record Vinson during an investigative interview without consent – where she says she was questioned about her EEOC case – and stalking and harassment. Two Black female employees also accused Lamont of harassment due to their race in statements provided in support of Vinson’s case. A USPS employee, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said they had witnessed Lamont harassing Vinson. This included following Vinson out to her car at work. “Working with her is hostile. I don’t even try to be in the same vicinity with her,” they said of Lamont. “With Carla, I have seen her harassing her. She’ll follow her around. It had got to the point where she had got two other supervisors involved to follow her around, to follow her to the car, to stand in the parking lot, waiting on her, just all types of stuff.” After one incident, Vinson called the local police. Lamont had been following her around the workplace and into the bathroom, she said. The Gainesville police department confirmed that an officer responded to the call, but did not write an incident report. Vinson said they concluded that it was a human resources issue. While the Guardian directly contacted Lamont for comment, a USPS spokesperson declined to comment on her behalf. In a letter from the USPS on 21 June 2024 from an alternative dispute resolution specialist, Lamont disputed claims of recording Vinson without her consent or knowledge and disputed claims of raising her voice to her. The letter noted there was no resolution to her counseling request, informing Vinson she could either file a formal complaint or take no further action. Workers at the postal service’s Gainesville plant were recently mandated to watch a safety video concerning the No Fear (Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and Retaliation) Act of 2002, according to Vinson. For her, it felt like a “slap in the face”."

          "headline": "Edith Holler by Edward Carey review – an unsettling fairytale",
          "bodyText": "The year is 1901, the place is Norwich and the hero of this story is 12-year-old Edith Holler who is, as she tells us, “famous”. Edith lives in a theatre and has never set a foot outside, after warnings that the building will collapse if she leaves. A motherless child, she has grown up among a peculiar selection of theatrical stalwarts – the puppet mistress, the stage door keeper, the prompt – who have lived so long in the playhouse they have become part of it, a strange ecosystem evolved to match their environment, like creatures of the deep ocean. The Hollers are a theatrical dynasty. Edith’s father is a celebrated actor, constantly shadowed by his understudy Mr Collin, who can only be distinguished by the faintest hint of a putty nose. There are many comic moments around this cast of eccentrics, but they are frequently unsettling ones – fearing your father is an impostor is a dark fear indeed – and this shifting ground is typical of a novel that is simultaneously fairytale-like and sinister. The reasons for keeping Edith trapped inside are unclear – they involve an unlikely curse and an exploding relative – yet also provide a useful angle to draw in the punters. Edith is required to perform a one-person dumbshow in a window, under a sign that reads “The Holler Theatre, Home of the Child Who May Never Leave”. Edith is our narrator and hers is a singular, precocious voice. A sickly child, she often steals from her sickbed to hear her father’s voice echoing through the heating pipes as he acts out gruesome Shakespearean deaths – and she understands why people pay to see tragedy. “Sorrow is our business,” she says. “We supply it to the people of Norwich for a fee: that, seeing some great sadness, they will feel they have lived a little themselves and feel the more human besides.” It is rare for an adult novel to include illustrations, but Carey’s haunting, sensitive images showing Edith’s view of her limited world fit his writing well. Like Edward Lear or Mervyn Peake, Carey’s illustrations are almost grotesque but have enough of the recognisably human in them to avoid becoming cartoonish. Peake’s Gormenghast often came to mind when reading this novel – for its depiction of a warped world both like and unlike our own, one seen in a fairground mirror. Edith learns about the city outside by reading deep into its history. She believes she has discovered a terrible secret at the heart of Norwich – one that involves missing children and a popular local delicacy called Beetle Spread – and decides to write a play in order to reveal the truth. Lost children and an ominous blood-coloured spread have distinctly fairytale properties, but if you rummage in the backstory of Norfolk, you’ll find that deathwatch beetles once made its medieval timber houses unsafe, which led to the superstition that the beetle was a harbinger of death. There is also no shortage of people doing awful things to children in the history of East Anglia, or anywhere else. And this murky mix is where the novel lives – the kernel of reality in the heart of folklore, reimagined into fantasy with the ring of truth. As in PJ Harvey’s recent poetry collection Orlam, using a sensitive child’s perspective allows Carey to explore how the echoes of folkloric figures can still be experienced. And the theatre, as a haunted place of believable lies, is the perfect setting for a story about the power of stories. As Edith says: “The stage was a place where millions of words had fallen, tumbling through the floorboard cracks, but after a while some of them worked their way back up again, floating about like mites of dust and remembering themselves a very little.” Edith Holler is, in part, a love letter to the theatre, and one that gleefully embraces a Tim Burtonesque gothic theatricality. Carey, who has worked in the theatre, apparently began writing the book in lockdown when theatres had closed. It is also, more unusually, a love letter to Norwich. The book is steeped in the city’s history, featuring – among others – King Gurgunt, who sleeps beneath Norwich Castle, ready to rise in battle if needed, and the Grey Lady, a famous Norwich ghost. “We may be eastward but we are not backward,” Edith proudly says of her fellow Norfolkians. This is an enjoyably uncategorisable and atmospheric book, a richly dark and idiosyncratic fairytale for grownups. • Joanna Quinn’s The Whalebone Theatre is published by Penguin. • Edith Holler by Edward Carey is published by Gallic (£16.99).

          "headline": "Vulnerable people not at risk from proposed assisted dying law, says MP",
          "bodyText": "The lives of disabled and vulnerable people will not be at risk from a proposed assisted dying law because it will only apply to terminally ill adults, and each case is likely to be ruled on by two doctors and a judge, the MP sponsoring it has said. Kim Leadbeater said her historic “choice at the end of life” bill will include “stringent” criteria and a cooling-off period in what is likely to be one of the most controversial pieces of legislation to go before parliament in years. But people who are facing intolerable suffering but are not dying will still be denied medical assistance to end their lives, under the likely terms of the bill to be introduced on Wednesday. That decision will prompt debate over whether the threshold for medical assistance to die should relate to suffering rather than time left to live. Some campaigners argue people whose conditions mean they can be trapped and suffering in their bodies long before they meet a narrow definition of terminal illness will be left out. A major poll has suggested most of the public support an assisted dying law in every constituency of Great Britain apart from Bradford West. It found 74% agreed that adults “who are intolerably suffering from an incurable condition and who wish to end their lives” should be allowed medical help to do so. More than 7,000 adults were canvassed this month in an MRP poll by Electoral Calculus for Humanists UK, a campaign group that supports assisted dying. A separate poll for King’s College London last week found 66% support for a bill becoming law restricted to people with six months or less to live, but about half of respondents said they would probably change their mind if it turned out someone had been put under pressure (55%) or ended their life because they were denied the care they needed (48%). Opponents of the bill, which would become law in England and Wales only, are planning to protest outside parliament on Wednesday, where supporters will also rally. Gordon MacDonald, the chief executive of Care Not Killing, claimed the bill amounted to “state-sanctioned killing”. “This bill sends a dog-whistle message to the terminally ill, vulnerable, elderly and disabled people, especially those on low or fixed incomes, that their lives are worth less than others,” he said on Tuesday. But campaigners in favour of an assisted dying law welcomed the first reading of the bill as a “historic day”. “This bill gives dying people hope that they will live the rest of their lives with the comfort of knowing they will have a say in how they die,” said Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying. The broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, who alongside Esther Rantzen is one of several high-profile backers of a law change, said: “My brother Nicholas was required to die from motor neurone disease and he wanted that right [to choose assisted dying] … he fervently wanted the choice … he would have welcomed the fact that this bill is going before the Commons.” Dimbleby also accused “the leadership of some parts of the church” of “scaremongering” by warning of a “slippery slope” towards assisted dying for people who are not terminally ill. He called for the debate to be “measured and balanced and not overwhelmed by emotive assertions”. Speaking to the Guardian, Leadbeater confirmed the bill will require adults to have a prognosis of being no more than a fixed number of months from death, with options including six, nine and 12 months all still under consideration. “My concern about the conversation around people with disabilities is that issue … has been conflated with this piece of legislation, which is actually about people who are already dying – shortening their deaths because of terminal illness,” she said. “So I will be the loudest voice in the room shouting for the rights of people with disabilities.” Concerns were expressed to a recent parliamentary inquiry into assisted dying that people living with a disability, and elderly people, may worry about being a burden on their family and may pursue assisted dying for that reason. “I get a bit worried there’s a panic and potentially some scaremongering about people having to do this,” Leadbeater said. “No one has to do anything. This is about finding a choice for people. The two other really important words that will be on the face of the bill tomorrow are ‘safeguards’ and ‘protections’.” She insisted there would be “no slippery” slope towards wider interpretation of the bill. The Catholic church this week launched a letter-writing campaign targeting MPs and encouraging the faithful to oppose the bill, warning “a right to die can become a duty to die”. Leadbeater added: “[The bill] will send a very clear message to people that this is not about disabled people. It’s not about people with mental health conditions. It is about terminally ill adults.” The proposed law will be closer to those already in use in Oregon in the US, Australia and New Zealand than more widely drawn laws in Canada and the Netherlands where illness need not be terminal. In the Netherlands some children are included in a law that allows assisted dying where a doctor agrees suffering is “lasting and unbearable”. Leadbeater will publish the detail of the bill in the coming weeks before a first Commons debate in late November. “We need law that is robust and clear and by having really strict, stringent criteria, [we] will create a much better situation than we have currently got,” she said. However, Dr Graham Winyard, a former medical director of NHS England, warned that the proposal would not end “death tourism” to Switzerland. About 40 people travelled from the UK to Dignitas last year to end their lives and Winyard’s research found that less than half of UK residents who have obtained an assisted death in Switzerland in recent years would have been spared the journey by a law limited to terminal illness with a six-month prognosis. Writing to the Guardian, he urged Leadbeater to “ensure that those who are incurably suffering – as well as the terminally ill – are provided with the comfort of choice. It is our strong belief that a bill which encompasses both the terminally ill and the incurably suffering would best reflect the values of compassion and dignity that we all strive for in end-of-life care.” • This article was amended on 16 October 2024 to clarify that the assisted dying bill would become law in England and Wales only."

          "bodyText": "Students in New South Wales have queried whether a “photograph” used as a stimulus in an HSC English exam was in fact AI-generated, sparking accusations of hypocrisy given the strict rules around students themselves using AI. The standard and advanced English paper 1, a compulsory subject taken by thousands of students on Tuesday, was on the subject of “texts and human experiences”. Question 3, worth five marks, required students to compare how an extract from Elizabeth Strout’s My Name is Lucy Barton and an image of a table covered in electronics and wires, looking out to the ocean, offered “a perspective on the ways individuals perceive their surroundings”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email In the exam, the image was listed as a “photograph” without further attribution. A spokesperson for NSW Education Standards Authority did not confirm whether the image was AI-generated beyond linking to its source article. They said whether students thought the image was AI-generated or not would have no bearing on their results and marks would be awarded for “how they responded to the question, using the image as stimulus”. Students, however, took to social media to express their frustration. “I just finished the exam … and the fact that this was AI distracted me all the way through,” one wrote. “I can’t believe the contradictory nature of adding this AI image into the exam … if you’re going to use this new technology because it’s easier and more suited, why can’t we? My biggest peeve is AI content not being flagged, I’d like to know what I’m looking at, thanks.” The image’s source was a post by tech blogger “Florian Schroeder” on medium.com titled “The Power of Digital Detox: Unlocking Productivity Through Switching Off”. Online, Schroeder – who shares his name with a famous German television personality – describes himself as “passionate about AI”, having “integrated it firmly into his daily work”. He is the co-founder for data and AI magazine AI Rockstars. Schroeder only has one display picture – which appears to be an AI-generated image of the actor. According to Nesa’s policy on the use of AI in schools, AI will “never replace strong curriculum, effective assessment and good teaching practices” and unapproved use is a breach of academic integrity. All work presented in assessment tasks and external examinations must be a student’s own or acknowledged appropriately. Nesa also notes AI can be “unreliable” and must “always be monitored by a human”. “AI can produce biased and/or toxic content, false information or facts that are not based on real data or events and false citations,” it says. A lecturer in English and writing at the University of Sydney, Dr Benjamin Miller, who is working with its educational innovation team on approaches to generative AI, said the students’ reaction may point more to a sense of “surprise” that they felt unprepared to address a different kind of text. “If this pushes us to think about how we can prepare students to have a set of critical skills that are useful to engage with AI tools and texts, then it’s a good outcome,” he said. “There could be a sense of excitement – this is an inevitable future, and we’re witnessing a major transition. “Right now … educational institutions are catching up – while debates are being had about whether and how teachers can use AI in classrooms, students are not getting opportunity to practice analysis.” Miller said the image had the “hallmarks” of AI, which could be the intention of the artist or the result of using an AI-generative program. Regardless, he said it was “inevitable” AI-produced texts would be part of the world students lived and work in, citing artists such as Jazz Money exploring the relationship between AI and ethics. “Questions of authorship, meaning and identity are the same if human generated or AI,” he said. “Education has to keep up.” On a community page for Australian teachers, one user encouraged readers to file a formal complaint to Nesa for the probable use of AI. “English is a subject hinged upon finding deeper meaning in texts, how are HSC students supposed to find deeper meaning in something where no deeper meaning is possible?” they wrote. Others disagreed, arguing that if it was AI-generated it would have been an appropriate image in the context if it was labelled correctly, rather than as a photograph. “It’s really rather timely and young people should have a lot to say about it,” one user wrote. Elsewhere on the exam, American-Argentinian writer Hernan Diaz appeared in prose, as did Australian writer Kate Morton with an extract from her latest novel, Homecoming. Young adult bestseller John Green appeared in the nonfiction section with an excerpt from his collection of essays, The Anthropocene Reviewed, as did UK author and journalist James Vincent for his exploration into measurement – Beyond Measure."

          "bodyText": "Andrew Reece was 37 and sleeping rough in Stoke-on-Trent when on 10 May 2023 he took his own life in an abandoned and roofless children’s home. Reece, known locally as Pud, was one of an estimated 155 people who died in the UK last year while rough sleeping, an annual increase of 42%, according to a count by the Museum of Homelessness project. The jump in fatalities, described by the campaign organisation as “an emergency on our streets”, appears to be disproportionately large compared with the government’s estimate of the rise in rough sleeping, which in England increased 27% over a similar period. The museum’s count, which used different methods to the collection of official figures, also found that at least 38 people died by suicide while homeless in the UK in 2023, half of them under 35. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said: “Every one of these deaths is a tragedy and is a damning indictment of the disgraceful rise in homelessness in recent years.” Homelessness campaigners are frustrated at the lack of funding announcements, which are not expected until after the budget. The Museum of Homelessness said rising deaths among rough sleepers were “clearly linked to insufficient investment in life-saving off-the-streets accommodation and to the widespread closure of winter shelters since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic”. Other deceased included in the numbers were Stephen Cook, 45, who was murdered while rough sleeping in Exeter in January 2023, and Alison Dodds, 51, who was murdered in Blackpool by a man who had offered her a place to stay. The museum counts the deaths of homeless people by checking coroners’ reports, local newspapers, family testimonies and by making freedom of information requests. Official figures on homeless deaths have not been released for two years. The last time they were released, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated there had been 741 deaths of homeless people in England and Wales in 2021. Earlier this year the ONS faced opposition to a plan to stop publishing a count of homeless deaths, and then announced it would continue to do so. Campaigners said the annual release was a regular reminder of society’s need to make sure it doesn’t fail people who are struggling with homelessness. The ONS said it would publish the numbers again, using a revised methodology, in 2025. Across all forms of homelessness in the UK, which includes people living in temporary accommodation, fatalities increased by 12% between 2022 and 2023, according to the museum. That was broadly in line with the wider increase in homelessness recorded in England by the ONS. Matt Turtle, a co-director of the Museum of Homelessness, said: “People are dying on the street at terrifying rates. The only way to tackle this emergency is with an increase in support for off-the-streets accommodation, like winter shelters. Labour has not yet set out plans to mitigate the damage caused by the last government. Our analysis indicates things are set to get much grimmer unless the government acts now to save lives.” An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are taking action by setting up a dedicated cross-government group, chaired by the deputy prime minister, to develop a long-term strategy to get us back on track to end homelessness. Councils and their partners deliver vital work to tackle rough sleeping, including drug and alcohol treatment and wrap-around support. Funding allocations will be set out following the budget.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

          "headline": "Australia’s pesky fee for debit card purchases may be about to disappear. What happens next?",
          "bodyText": "It might be chump change when it comes to buying a coffee, but the surcharge on debit purchases adds up to billions of dollars a year – and it could be about to disappear. Australia’s payments sector could be overhauled amid a government pledge to reform a system of fee charges that is deeply unpopular with consumers already grappling with punishing living costs. While the Albanese government has flagged its intention to ban debit card surcharges, it will also consider wider measures flowing out of a Reserve Bank review of the sector that started on Tuesday. What happens next? Why is there a sudden focus on card fees? As the Independent Payment Forum notes, debit card fees can add more than $12 to the cost of a school laptop, and $6.40 to a car service. Card payments now account for the lion’s share of transactions, with about 80% of consumer payments conducted via debit, credit, prepaid and charge cards, RBA data shows. But a complicated system of opaque fees has long perplexed consumers, who might not know they are paying a surcharge until they tap their card. This disproportionately affects younger Australians, given they use cards more often than older cohorts. Shoppers have also found they are often charged the same amount for a debit or credit transaction, even though they rightly assume the latter is more expensive to process. All up, Australia’s banks, payment platforms and global card companies charge $6.9bn in fees a year, according to the Independent Payments Forum, which are costs either paid by businesses or passed to customers. Transaction fees in Australia are higher than in several comparable economies such as the UK, but lower than in the US. The Biden administration is trying to combat high card charges as part of a wider campaign to tackle high consumer prices. What is the solution? While banning surcharges on debit transactions would be a relief to consumers, there are concerns businesses, especially smaller ones, will need to bear the transaction cost or raise their prices. The RBA, which has regulatory powers over the payments sector, said in its discussion paper that the average transaction fee paid by small merchants is around three times that paid by larger ones. This is because they generally cannot negotiate the same types of deals with payments networks as big businesses. The ability for the government to ban debit surcharges therefore relies on broader reforms to lower transaction costs for small businesses. “These two issues are linked as merchants would be less likely to surcharge consumers if card payment costs were lower,” the RBA says. It says a debit surcharge ban may prompt payment platforms to price debit and credit card transactions differently. For consumers, this would mean debit transactions are free, and credit card payments are charged a higher rate. The measure could also stir competition among payment platforms to offer businesses more competitive rates on debit transactions, given merchants will no longer be able to pass the fees to their customers. The RBA has invited feedback on whether all card surcharges should be banned, but notes that this could drive a shift towards more credit card transactions, which would also increase transaction costs for businesses. The RBA is also considering making “least-cost routing”, a policy designed to process payments via the cheapest network – usually Eftpos – a default setting for merchants’ terminals, which should decrease costs. Who are the winners and losers? The government’s proposed ban sparked an immediate sell-off in payments platforms, with shares in SmartPay Holdings and Tyro Payments suffering double-digit share price falls on Tuesday. The Tyro chief executive, Jon Davey, said in a statement that consumers should not pay excessive surcharges, nor should businesses fund the consumer benefits that come with high-cost cards and loyalty programs. “We support any review that assesses the true cost of card acceptance, including both debit and credit, for the fair regulation of payment acceptance in Australia,” Davey said. Many payment platforms, including the US company Square, design packages for businesses that blend fees for debit and credit charges, with the costs passed to customers. This model could be disrupted by a ban on debit surcharges because it relies on subsidising credit card transactions by charging debit card users far more than the cost of the transaction. It’s unclear what impact the government’s proposed ban would have on the major card networks, Visa and Mastercard, which were contacted for comment. The RBA review, which is designed to increase transparency and competition in the payments sector, could fast-track a shift to alternative payment options such as “pay by bank”. This system is a type of direct debit which cuts card networks out of the process and should be cheaper for merchants. Australia’s banking sector broadly supports a ban on debit surcharges, which means there is little opposition to the government banning the unpopular fees. “This would be a win for consumers and lead to more clarity and certainty for them,” the Australian Banking Association CEO, Anna Bligh, said."

          "bodyText": "Simon Burnton’s report is in, so it’s time for me to say goodbye. Rob Smyth and Adam Collins will provide you company tomorrow. See ya! Jeremy Boyce provides his verdict: I’m thinking Captain Stokes and his merry band will be well happy to have 5 down before the end of the first day, possibly more now with the new ball. They could be batting by lunch tomorrow at which point they’ll be planning for lots of beef from the openers, followed by lots of Yorkshire Pudding and lower order gravy train. Which should help deliver them their just desserts. Leach has two wickets but Carse gets my nod for the bowler of the day, taking 1-14 from 11 overs. He managed to find control with the reversing ball, nicking off Saud Shakeel. The batting star was Kamran Ghulam, hitting a century in his maiden Test innings. That’s some achievement when you’ve been selected in place of Babar Azam, one of Pakistan’s finest ever. 90th over: Pakistan 259-5 (Salman 5, Rizwan 37) Leach is granted the honour of bowling the day’s final over. Rizwan turns a fuller ball into a full toss, getting down the pitch to hit straight for four. Dots follow to close the day, one both sides will be pleased with. Pakistan have a platform but they haven’t run away with it. 89th over: Pakistan 255-5 (Salman 5, Rizwan 33) Nice bowling from Bashir, who slides through a non-turning delivery past Salman’s outside edge. 88th over: Pakistan 254-5 (Salman 5, Rizwan 32) Leach concedes a couple of singles before very nearly sneaking a low one through Salman. Pakistan’s No 7 does well to get down and stop it from creeping past. 87th over: Pakistan 252-5 (Salman 4, Rizwan 31) Bashir gives the ball some decent hang-time, trying to invite something silly from the two batters late in the day. They opt for an exchange of singles. 86th over: Pakistan 249-5 (Salman 2, Rizwan 30) Leach is called in to get that new ball to skid on to the stumps. Rizwan cuts off the back foot for a couple; he’s relished spin today, looking uneasy against the quicks. 85th over: Pakistan 245-5 (Salman 1, Rizwan 27) Salman Ali Agha, very much a man in form, partners up with Rizwan. Bashir gets a go, Stokes backing his off-spinner – and it works! Ghulam, as he’s done all day, skips down the pitch but misses the ball this time round. It clips the bails and the centurion departs. Bashir roars. 84th over: Pakistan 243-4 (Ghulam 118, Rizwan 26) Smith, whose glovework has been solid today, collects down the leg side as England appeal for a tickle from Ghulam. “WAIT ON!” shouts Ghulam, who has a touch of Smith/Labuschagne exuberance about him. He drives Potts through the covers for three. This was the debutant’s special moment from before, one he would have spent years, decades dreaming of. 83rd over: Pakistan 240-4 (Ghulam 115, Rizwan 26) Carse looks such a threat against Rizwan whenever he angles the ball into the stumps. It’s how he got rid of him in the last Test on that wild fourth day. 82nd over: Pakistan 239-4 (Ghulam 114, Rizwan 26) Potts gets some sharp movement into Rizwan and then away from him, the batter left shotless on both occasions. A wild charge down the pitch follows from Rizwan, an admission that he’s struggling against this fresh cherry – he only makes contact with the air. 81st over: Pakistan 239-4 (Ghulam 114, Rizwan 26) Stokes takes the second new ball and turns to the impressive Carse. But Ghulam opts to immediately punish, driving down the ground for four. The quick recovers to nip a couple away from Ghulam. 80th over: Pakistan 235-4 (Ghulam 110, Rizwan 26) Ghulam sweeps Root away for four and then tries a reverse that doesn’t beat the field. But, hey, he looks as if he’s having a great time. 79th over: Pakistan 228-4 (Ghulam 103, Rizwan 26) England opt for a review after Rizwan tries to swat Bashir through the leg side, the ball instead skipping into Jamie Smith’s gloves. Was there a little tickle? Absolutely not – the bat’s in Multan, the ball’s in Karachi. 78th over: Pakistan 226-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 25) I get the sense England are trying to quickly get to that new ball, with Root running briskly through another set. 77th over: Pakistan 225-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 24) Bashir bowls what he needs: a quiet over. There’s just one off it. 76th over: Pakistan 224-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 23) Root continues from the other end, with Rizwan sweeping for one. The Pakistan keeper has started to find some joy after a tough start against the quicks with the reversing ball. 75th over: Pakistan 223-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 22) Shoaib Bashir re-enters the game and is immediately under the pump, Rizwan discarding him for two boundaries through deep midwicket. Excuse the shameless plug, but this is something I wrote about first Test hundreds a few years ago. Joe Root gets to have a twirl, with Ghulam nicking a single to move to 98. Another single brings Ghulam back for the last two deliveries, and he swings across the line off the final ball, all the way to the ropes to celebrate his maiden Test hundred! Root offered a tempter, and Ghulam, who’s been mighty happy to take some risks, slapped that one hard through midwicket. An emphatic celebration follows. He’s the first Pakistani to hit a hundred on Test debut since Abid Ali in 2019. 74th over: Pakistan 218-4 (Ghulam 102, Rizwan 13) 73rd over: Pakistan 208-4 (Ghulam 97, Rizwan 12) Rizwan tries to channel his inner Ghulam, charging Potts for a wild hack; he doesn’t find the middle. A maiden follows, with Ghulam, on the cusp of a debut hundred, going two overs without the strike. And to test his patience further, it’s drinks. 72nd over: Pakistan 208-4 (Ghulam 97, Rizwan 12) Rizwan gets the forward defence out, again and again, before punching for a single to end Leach’s over. 71st over: Pakistan 207-4 (Ghulam 97, Rizwan 11) Potts finds some late swing with a yorker to Ghulam, who gets his toes out of the way to find three through the leg side. He moves to 97. Kim Thonger lays out some bars: There once was a batter named Ghulam, Whose bat was as sturdy as glulam. He swung with great might, Hit sixes in flight, Till the crowd broke out into bedlam! 70th over: Pakistan 203-4 (Ghulam 94, Rizwan 10) Leach locates some sharp spin and bounce, getting one to rip past Rizwan’s forward prod. 69th over: Pakistan 200-4 (Ghulam 93, Rizwan 8) Matt Potts replaces Carse, who’s earned a breather. A snorter squares up Rizwan, beating the outside edge. An edge follows, running low to give Rizwan a couple. Ooooh, a replay at the end of the over shows there was a very thin edge on that Potts pearler. Osman is the man to listen to here: 68th over: Pakistan 197-4 (Ghulam 92, Rizwan 6) Ghulam knocks Leach down the ground for one, bringing Rizwan on strike. He finally gets himself off none, driving through cover for a couple. A sweep for four follows. Rizwan’s a wonderful player, a key man in Pakistan’s strong middle to lower order – he averages above 40 in every format of the game. 67th over: Pakistan 190-4 (Ghulam 91, Rizwan 0) Carse is causing Rizwan serious bother, finding the outside edge, but the ball doesn’t carry to slip. A wonderful away swinger follows, with Rizwan still waiting to score his first runs – he got a duck in the first innings of the last Test. This is a spell of tight lines, decent movement and sharp pace from Carse. A maiden keeps Rizwan scoreless after facing 18 balls. 66th over: Pakistan 190-4 (Ghulam 91, Rizwan 0) Better from Ghulam, who runs down to Leach again but gets to the pitch of the ball, swinging safely to nail a straight four. A similar shot is repeated, the ball launched over mid-on for another boundary, moving Ghulam into the 90s. 65th over: Pakistan 182-4 (Ghulam 83, Rizwan 0) Ghulam plays another wild shot, trying to smash Carse over Stokes’ umbrella field – he gets away with it, the ball flying high but safely over the cover region. 64th over: Pakistan 179-4 (Ghulam 80, Rizwan 0) This could be some relief for the hosts, with Leach back on; the quicks were really troubling Pakistan. Don’t mind me: Ghulam is dropped at mid-on. The right-hander shimmies down the pitch to try and hit over mid-on, doesn’t get the required contact, but a leaping Duckett, moving high and to his right, can’t hold on. 63rd over: Pakistan 178-4 (Ghulam 79, Rizwan 0) Carse nips the ball into Mohammad Rizwan’s pads to prompt a hearty lbw appeal … it’s an excellent shout but the finger doesn’t go up. England opt against the review, perhaps thinking it’s going over the stumps. Carse has one keep low to close the over, with Rizwan nearly chopping on to the stumps. Pakistan are in a tricky spot. 62nd over: Pakistan 178-4 (Ghulam 79, Rizwan 0) Stokes has set up one of his intimidating fields, with Ghulam staring at three men hovering in the close cover region. Potts produces a maiden; Ghulam is on 79 but has struggled to score for a while now. 61st over: Pakistan 178-4 (Ghulam 79, Rizwan 0) Carse has figures of 1-6 after six overs. He’s been so impressive over the last week. Carse tests Shakeel’s ticker, striking the left-hander’s gloves with a bouncer. There’s still reverse swing out there, with Carse moving it into Shakeel. And then the one that moves away to nab Shakeel’s outside edge! It’s a wonderful setup, inviting the prod outside off, and Jamie Smith takes a brilliant catch behind the stumps, a very sharp effort from a rapid Carse delivery. 60th over: Pakistan 177-3 (Ghulam 79, Shakeel 4) Ghulam, having hit just one off his previous 21 deliveries, decides to take a risk, making room for a basebally swing through mid-off for four off Potts. 59th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Ghulam 75, Shakeel 4) It’s Carse, not Stokes, who thunders in from the other end, short mid-on and short-mid-off waiting for a loose drive from Saud Shakeel. Another maiden follows to build further pressure. 58th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Ghulam 75, Shakeel 4) Stokes continues with pace, Potts keeping things tight with a maiden to Ghulam. Time for the third session, with Pakistan operating responsibly thus far. Which brings me to my commute this morning: on a packed Northern Line, the man stood next to me – his armpit threatening to envelop my face – was watching Luca Guadagnino’s intensely NSFW 2024 release, Challengers. It wasn’t something he was continuing from the night before; no, he was watching it right from the start. Thoroughly maverick behaviour from the gilet-wearing finance bro. Now to see if Pakistan – those well-known agents of chaos – replicate such wild behaviour. They’re capable of it. They’re running through the replays of Potts’ dismissal of Saim: it’s a fine setup, the seamer sending the ball across the left-hander on a good length before pitching fuller to invite the tentative push forward, Stokes positioned perfectly at short mid-off. 57th over: Pakistan 173-3 (Ghulam 75, Shakeel 4) Stokes continues, bowling the final over of the session. Ghulam has been happy to just survive against the England captain, and a single brings Saud Shakeel on to strike for the last two balls of the over. Stokes finds the outside edge with the final ball, but Shakeel plays with soft hands, the ball staying low to run away past slip for four. Time for some chai. Matt Potts changes things up, going over the wicket to Saim. The seamer’s third delivery of the over jags away from the left-hander before a wider ball is slashed hard … to point. After five dots … a wicket! Saim drives without conviction, finding Stokes at short mid-off. A productive stand comes to a close, Saim walking off with a Test-best if not a century. 56th over: Pakistan 168-3 (Ghulam 74) 55th over: Pakistan 168-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 77) Stokes is operating at an average speed of 80mph, still feeling his way back from injury. He continues to look more threatening against Ghulam, who plays out four consecutive dots. 54th over: Pakistan 167-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 76) Potts continues to skip in from around the wicket to Saim, keeping it stump-to-stump for the first three balls, perhaps setting him up for a wider delivery outside off to invite the edge. No, it’s the bouncer that follows with the fourth, but it flies a touch too high. Saim then delivers a gorgeous straight drive, with Harry Brook leaping spectacularly to stop the boundary. 53rd over: Pakistan 164-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 73) Stokes finds Ghulam’s outside edge again … but the ball drops short of Joe Root at slip. It’s one thing getting the ball to reverse, but there’s very little carry in this surface. Ghulam’s dealing with cramp again, so there’s a break in play. England use it to get a helmet on Root’s head – he comes in closer to the stumps. I don’t think I’ve ever seen slip wear a helmet before. 52nd over: Pakistan 162-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 72) Potts looks a threat to Saim Ayub, getting the ball to hoop in and challenge the left-hander’s pads and stumps. He then gets one to move away from Saim, who chases it and edges away to third man for a boundary. A more convincing stroke follows from Saim, who flicks off his pads for four, Potts going a touch too straight from around the wicket. An inside-edge closes the over, Saim nearly chopping on to his stumps. 51st over: Pakistan 152-2 (Ghulam 74, Saim 63) Stokes continues and unfurls a gorgeous outswinger against Ghulam, the ball sneaking past the outside edge. Another edge follows next ball, the ball keeping low to run away to the third-man rope. Ghulam is getting a serious test here, with Stokes deciding to challenge the toes; out comes the yorker, dug out by the right-hander. They’ve got a proper 2013 playlist going in Multan as John Newman’s Love Me Again rings out. 50th over: Pakistan 145-2 (Ghulam 68, Saim 62) Matt Potts is called in, Stokes recognising that it’s time for the quicks to go to work. Potts brings the ball back into the left-handed Saim Ayub, conceding one from the over. Showbizguru writes: “The theme tune from the 2012 Bond movie Skyfall seems to be a regular choice for break music at the Multan stadium. What England need now is a Thunderball. I’ll get my coat.” 49th over: Pakistan 144-2 (Ghulam 68, Saim 61) Ben Stokes decides to do it himself, taking off Brydon Carse. There’s a touch of reverse swing in the air and Stokes knows how to harness it. He’s loose to begin with, though; Ghulam punches through the covers for a couple. The next ball is far more threatening, with Stokes getting the ball to move away from the right-hander. Ghulam calls over the Pakistan doc, potentially cramping up as he shakes his right hand; time for the TV cameras to intensely focus on a man eating some ice-cream. As you do. Dots follow before Stokes squares Ghulam up with the final ball of the over, moving it away again to find the outside edge, the ball running away to the boundary for four. Nevermind the runs, there’s something to play with here for England. 48th over: Pakistan 138-2 (Ghulam 62, Saim 61) Hello, all, lovely to be here. Jack Leach continues after a few words of wisdom/affirmation/sweet nothings from captain Stokes. Kamran Ghulam skips down the pitch for a rather loose hoick across the line, getting a thick edge to collect three. Saim Ayub adventures down the wicket, too, playing a lovely lofted drive over mid-off for four. 47th over: Pakistan 131-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 59) Stokes has decided it’s time for Brydon Carse, whose name is crying out for the late Tony Greig to be on commentary. His first ball, bowled from round the wicket to Saim, beats the inside edge and is superbly taken on the bounce by Jamie Smith. There’s nothing he can do later in the over when Carse rams one down the leg side for four byes. There was a hint of reverse swing in that over – a mite, a soupçon – so this could be England’s opportunity. Taha Hashim will track every last millimeter of deviation; he’s ready to take over for the rest of the day’s play. Bye! 46th over: Pakistan 127-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 59) Ghulam’s fast hands allow him to back cut Leach for two. It’s one thing to come out at 19 for two on debut, quite another when your team are on their knees and you’re replacing their best player. In that context this has been a gem of an innings. 45th over: Pakistan 125-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 57) Ghulam reverse sweeps Bashir for for, the first sign of impudence from him. Pakistan are inching towards what might be a very handy position. Let’s be honest, we’re all hedging our bets because we have no idea what this pitch will do. It might crumble completely; it might stay like this. Ben Stokes has a look at the ball, decides it isn’t reverse-ready and throws it back to Jack Leach. 44th over: Pakistan 120-2 (Saim 57, Ghulam 52) Not for the first time today, Leach almost skids an arm ball through Ghulam. He’s quick enough on his feet to get out of trouble but that looks a potential mode of dismissal for England. Saim carts a slog sweep for two to bring up the hundred partnership. It was a slightly loose shot but safe enough with nobody at deep midwicket. “Picking up on Kim Thonger’s comments on the Elon Morgan robot,” begins Oliver Haill. “It made me think of Dennis Lillee coming out to the middle with an aluminium bat. (The ComBat, it was called, apparently.) As this was not allowed and he was forced to change back to a traditional willow number, I’m thinking the laws of cricket might allow wooden robots...?” Heh. There was a funny story about that aluminium bat on the recent Cricket Et Al podcast with Greg Chappell. My short-term memory has gone to pot so I can’t remember the detail, only that it made me chuckle. But the whole podcast is great, including a fascinating discussion of the book Psycho-Cybernetics. That it was easier to remember. 43rd over: Pakistan 115-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 50) Bashir, bowling round the wicket, gets one to bounce awkwardly at Ghulam. He fends that wide of leg slip and turns the next ball for a single to reach fine half-century, full of poise and pride. He’s the first No4 to make a debut fifty for Pakistan since the man he replaced, Babar Azam, against West Indies eight years ago. And he celebrates by blowing a kiss to the Pakistan balcony. 42nd over: Pakistan 114-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 49) England submit a polite enquiry for LBW when Saim misses a sweep off Leach. Outside the line. Leach is starting to get some quicker turn and beats Ghulam with a classic delivery to the right-hander: drift in, turn away, lots of oohs and aahs. “Woke up to a horrible thought this morning,” begins Pete Salmon. “Pakistan keep losing, there are no crowds, they don’t even seem to know where the next Test will be, and must be losing money on the series. We’ve seen players decide not to play Test cricket anymore, but might we be getting to a point where teams make that decision? Most teams now get nothing from Y=Test cricket financially, or in terms of crowds or prestige. Our worry with the big three has always been that teams will be squeezed out, but I can see a scenario where one team, Pakistan or otherwise, simply says they are going to stop playing Tests concentrate on T20... Allay my fears!” Well, the good news is that AI is going to kill us all by the year 2030 so the future of Test cricket shouldn’t impact us. 41st over: Pakistan 112-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 48) 40th over: Pakistan 110-2 (Saim 54, Ghulam 46) Thwack! Saim launches Leach over midwicket for an eyecatching boundary, his fourth of the innings. It hasn’t been a perfect innings, none are, but for the most part he has defended and attacked with an authority that belies his inexperience. 39th over: Pakistan 106-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 46) Kamran Ghulam came into his debut in abysmal form, with no centuries in six innings across formats. Trust me, for him that’s a drought. He looks a good player: organised, assured and fearless, as he shows by slog-sweeping Bashir handsomely for a one-bounce four. Bashir, whose line to the right-hander has been much more aggressive today, continues to toss the ball up and almost gets one through Ghulam’s attempted drive. Whatever the right and wrongs of the pitch, and we probably have to defer judgement on that until the end of the game, it has produced an engaging contest today. 38th over: Pakistan 100-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 40) Ghulam throws his entire being into a slog-sweep at Leach, misses and is lucky that the ball turns past off stump. Had it not turned so extravagantly he would have been cleaned up. Leach, who has bowled on plenty of helpful pitches at Ciderabad, is getting into a nice rhythm. Later in thbe over he also gets through Ghulam with a quicker arm ball. Almost. 37th over: Pakistan 99-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 39) Just when you think Pakistan are getting on top, something happens to remind you that a batter is probably never truly ‘in’ on this pitch. Those Leach deliveries have briefly spooked Saim, who trusts nothing but defence in that over from Shoaib. “Irksome partnership needing breaking?” says Ian Copestake. “You know who to call! Ghostb... er, Stokes.” Doug Walters was apparently one of the great partnership breakers and ‘Who ya gonna call? DOUG WALTERS’ scans nicely. The fact he took his last wicket in 1977, seven years before Ghostbusters was released, might be considered problematic in some cultures though. 36th over: Pakistan 98-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 38) Leach beats Saim with successive deliveries, the second a beauty that somehow misses both the outside edge and the off stump. Leach starts to celebrate, then appeals, then asks Ben Stokes to review it. The response is the same as when he asks to put mid-off or mid-on back. 35th over: Pakistan 97-2 (Saim 50, Ghulam 37) Saim drives Bashir for two to reach an excellent half-century, the third of his fledgling Test career, from 98 balls with three fours. It’s been a mature innings, a fine response to his lamentable dismissal in the second innings of the first Test. There are oohs and aahs later in the over when he offers no stroke to a ball that doesn’t miss off stump by all that much. It looked a safe leave to me. Bashir’s last four Test wickets have cost over 100 runs apiece but he’s bowled well today. Nothing to worry about yet. 34th over: Pakistan 95-2 (Saim 48, Ghulam 37) Between overs, Joe Root shines the ball on Jack Leach’s head #baldcommunity. England will be looking for reverse swing soon because this partnership is becoming irksome. Saim cuts Leach firmly for four, despite the best efforts of Potts haring back from point, and a sikngle takes him to within two of a fine half-century. 33rd over: Pakistan 90-2 (Saim 43, Ghulam 37) Ghulam gives Bashir the charge and clumps the ball down the ground for couple, with Potts doing well to save the boundary. It was in the air, not off the middle, but it was safely wide of the diving Bashir. The shot has the desired effect. Bashir pulls his length back ever so slightly and Ghulam heaves two more through midwicket. 32nd over: Pakistan 85-2 (Saim 42, Ghulam 33) Now then. Leach beats Ghulam with a jaffa that turns sharply and quickly. That went through the top of the surface and was nigh-on unplayable. 31st over: Pakistan 84-2 (Saim 41, Ghulam 33) Shoaib Bashir, who arguably outbowled Leach this morning even though Leach took both wickets, returns to the attack and finds Saim’s edge with a good ball that straightens and bounces. For the second time today it goes wide of the diving Stokes at slip and through the vacant gully region. Bashir tosses one up outside off stump, a much more aggressive line, and Ghulam drives for four with authority. “Risk and reward,” says Nasser on commentary. 30th over: Pakistan 79-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 24) The morning session hinted that this is might be the rarest of surfaces, a new-ball pitch for the spinners. Or maybe Saim Ayub and Kamran Ghumal made it look that way by batting so well after Pakistan’s poor start. Leach’s first over is an accurate maiden to Ghulam. He’s still hit just the one boundary, a perky straight six off Leach early in his innings. The players are back on the field. Jack Leach is going to replace Brydon Carse, who bowled a solitary over just before lunch. “There’s been a lot of publicity about Elon Musk’s Optimus humanoid robots since the last Test,” says Kim Thonger, bringing news to me. “As a visionary he’ll very likely already have spotted the success of the IPL and will have told his R&amp;D team to teach a few of the robots how to apply their superhuman skills to the white ball game. Imagine a robot with Shane Warne’s bowling, Ben Stokes batting, and Eoin Morgan’s captaincy skills. Unstoppable. I have a question. Do the laws of cricket permit a robot to be selected and deployed?” They don’t offer it yet, but Merlin is patiently awaiting the call. IS NOTHING SACRED England Women have a huge game later today, an effective quarter-final against West Indies at the T20 World Cup. Here’s what Raf Nicholson has leared from the tournament to date. 29th over: Pakistan 79-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 29) Saim looks a bit skittish as we approach lunch. He tries to pulls Potts, is too early on the shot and bottom-edges the ball short of Jamie Smith behind the stumps. So ends an intriguing morning session. Jack Leach, brought on inside the first half hour, took two early wickets to reduce Pakistan to 19 for two. But this used Multan pitch, while never entirely trustworthy, started to behave itself as the ball got a bit older and Saim Ayub put together an assured, positive partnership of 6o with the impressive debutant Kamran Ghulam. So far, so goodish for Pakistan. 28th over: Pakistan 78-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 28) Brydon Carse also comes back into the attack just before lunch. Ben Stokes is the most accomplished reverse-swing bowler in this team so I’m sure we’ll see him after lunch unless England run through Pakistan like a dose of salts. I don’t think that’s going to happen. Carse has no slips and is generally attacking the stumps. He tries one bouncer that is ignored by Saim and goes through to Smith almost in slow motion; I wouldn’t bother, Brydon. Saim looks for a quick single and is loudly sent back by Ghulam, then misses a loose cut stroke at a ball that’s far too close for the shot. He could easily have dragged that back onto the stumps. 27th over: Pakistan 78-2 (Saim 40, Ghulam 28) No reverse swing for Potts, but he threatens the left-handed Saim with low bounce on a couple of occasions. The second was pretty close, a late inside-edge strangling England’s LBW shout. Potts will always be dangerous on pitches like this because he bowls so straight. “I’ve just joined the action and am surprised to see England bowling already,” says Jeremy Boyce. “Did I miss some new Stokes mind games? Did he win the toss, elect to bat, declare at 0-0 after one ball, seeing the need to bowl a lot to take the 20 wickets, and backing his batt(er)ers to perform in their only appearance at the crease?” Indulgent declarations are so Bazball 1.0. Edit: It looks like Ben Stokes will not wait until after lunch to see if there’s any reverse swing. Matthew Potts is coming back into the attack. 26th over: Pakistan 75-2 (Saim 37, Ghulam 28) It looks like Ben Stokes will wait until after lunch to see if there’s any reverse swing. Leach continues and bowls another grubber that is well defened by Saim. When I say ‘grubber’ I mean it bounced around shin height, not the full Nasser. We need a different word for that, or maybe an abjective such as ‘vile’. 25th over: Pakistan 73-2 (Saim 36, Ghulam 27) Ah, Bashir has switched back to his original end. Saim almost runs himself out by trying to take a single to cover. He’s rightly sent back and has to scramble to make his ground. The umpires go upstairs to check whether his bat bounced up, but he’s okay. Later in the over Ghulam reaches outside off stump and edges wide of slip for three. Bashir has bowled nicely this morning and probably deserves a wicket. But then Saim and Ghulam have batted nicely and probably don’t deserve to get out, so now what? 24th over: Pakistan 69-2 (Saim 35, Ghulam 24) Root replaces Bashir, who bowled a threatening spell of 8-1-17-0, althoguh technically they were two spells as he changed ends at one point. Saim drives a single to bring up a positive, clear-headed fifty partnership from 85 balls. “Pity that you have to get up so early for your duty,” writes Krishnamoorthy V. “But the vicarious summer must feel good in this gloomy weather. Pakistan’s strategy, should one call it that, appears like the last desperate lunge of blind man’s bluff when jeering pirates have already slashed the man to a state of profuse bleeding.” I’d say the dastardly plan is working pretty well so far. 23rd over: Pakistan 67-2 (Saim 34, Ghulam 23) Not even CricViz’s finest algorithm knows what would be a par score is on this pitch, but you suspect Pakistan would be happy with 250, thrilled with 300 and rhapsodic with 400. Saim Ayub smiles after repelling a grubber from Leach, then plonks his front foot down and hammers a slog-sweep for four. That’s a terrific shot. “Wasn’t there a to-do last winter that the pitch in Dharamsala was a used one?” asks John W. Ah yes, I’d forgotten that – it was used for a Ranji Trophy game, although from memory that was three weeks before the Test rather than three days. 22nd over: Pakistan 61-2 (Saim 28, Ghulam 23) Bashir has also changed ends. “Very slow, very slow off the surface,” says Aamir Sohail when Ghulam has time to defend a nice off-break. Bashir decides to change the angle by going round the wicket to the right-handed Ghulam, but his first ball is down the leg side. He can have another go next over. 21st over: Pakistan 59-2 (Saim 28, Ghulam 21) As expected Leach has changed ends. Ghulam rocks back to force him square on the off side for three runs, which takes him into the twenties. Whisper it but batting looks almost comfortable. 20th over: Pakistan 55-2 (Saim 27, Ghulam 18) Root replaces Leach, who might be about to change ends. England will be wary of bowling Root too much, even on this pitch, because his run-scoring drops off considerably when he bowls a lot of overs, particularly in Asia. Ghulam, who has started with impressive intent on debut, clatters three runs through the covers to bring up the Pakistan fifty. Saim drives two to deep extra cover and keeps the strike with a single off the last ball. He’s also played well, especially as he was under pressure after that wretched dismissal in the first Test. 19th over: Pakistan 48-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 15) Saying which, Bashir gets some sharp spin to Ghulam, who inside-edges onto his stomach. He sweeps the next ball in the air for two, a premeditated and risky shot. 18th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 13) Leach almost skids one through Ghulam, who defends across his front pad at the last possible moment. James Walsh (14th over) was right – though the pitch is turning more than you’d expect before lunch on day one, it’s far from a minefield. 17th over: Pakistan 45-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 12) 16th over: Pakistan 44-2 (Saim 23, Ghulam 11) Leach continues with a very funky field for Ghulam: slip, leg slip, short leg and two short extra covers. Two singles from the over. 15th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Saim 22, Ghulam 10) Saim edges Bashir wide of Stokes at slip for a couple. I think it would have carried to gully. Leach has taken the two wickets but Bashir is probably getting more out of the pitch, particularly to the left-handed Saim. But Pakistan are starting to counter-punch and Saim back cuts a short delivery for three more. That makes it 19 runs from the last three overs, a big improvement on 23 from the first 12. Time for drinks. 14th over: Pakistan 37-2 (Saim 17, Ghulam 10) Saim flashes Leach wristily through the covers for three, then Ghulam bashed his down the ground for six! That’s a brilliant and brave shot; he’d have received all sorts of abuse had he run past the ball and been stumped. One consequence of this pitch is that England are in serious danger of keeping up with the over rate; we’re still inside the first hour and Shoaib Bashir is about to bowl the 15th. “Speaking as an under-the-duvet pre-dawn punter,” flutters James Walsh, “I’m enjoying this a lot more than the start of the first Test. And I don’t think there’s masses of turn…” No you’re right; it’s hardly a bunsen. I’m probably guilty of putting two and two together to make a two-day Test. 13th over: Pakistan 27-2 (Saim 14, Ghulam 3) Saim tries to sweep Bashir and is beaten by a mile. That ball turned grotesquely. The only good thing for the batters is that, one delivery from Leach aside, the turn has been fairly slow and low. 12th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Saim 11, Ghulam 2) Forty-nine minutes into the Test match, a delivery from Leach bursts nastily at Saim, who gloves it wide of the diving short leg for a single. This is entertaining cricket but I’m not sure it passes the smell test. I guess we should reserve judgement for now. In other news I forgot the Test Match Special overseas link, again, sorry. Here it is. 11th over: Pakistan 22-2 (Saim 10, Ghulam 2) I’m not 100 per cent sure but I think this is the first time since Melbourne 1901-02 that England have had two spinners bowling inside the first half hour of a Test match. In the first Test there was a lot of talk of Bashir’s defensive line to the right-handers. His first ball to Ghulam is more attacking, outside off, and Ghulam pushes it for a single. Saim drives another down the ground. 10th over: Pakistan 20-2 (Saim 8, Ghulam 1) Welcome to Test cricket, Kamran Ghulam. He’s a 29-year-old right-hander with an excellent record in first-class cricket, and he gets off the mark with a slightly nervous thick edge. Leach strikes again. Shan flicks with hard hands at a delivery that turns just enough to induce a false stroke, and Crawley – such a reliable fielder – takes a superb low catch at short midwicket. I’m not sure whether this is a burgeoning farce or merely a reflection of Pakistan’s subterranean confidence. 9th over: Pakistan 17-1 (Saim 8, Shan 2) The arrival of Shan Masood means Bashir has two left-handers to play with. Saim is focussing entirely on defence against Bashir for now and there’s just a single to Shan in that over. “With Leach getting that amount of movement after 30 mins, this match will be done in two days,” says Gareth Wilson. “England likely to be all out 220 off 40 overs.” Surely they won’t try to dig in on this pitch? 8th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Saim 8, Shan 1) England appeal unsuccessfully for LBW when the captain Shan Masood tries to sweep his first ball and misses. He was outside the line. England have four catchers on the leg side for Shan: leg slip, short leg, short midwicket and short mid-on. “What’s the story with the music between overs at Multan this morning?” asks Julian. “I’m sure I’ve already heard AC/DC and Aerosmith, which all seems a somewhat incongruous in a practically empty stadium. Are the new selectors responsible for this as well?” Haha. Each selector gets to pick one player and two bangers for the playlist. Tihngs are starting to happen on day six. Shafique has been bowled by a beauty from Leach, which curved onto off stump and then turned sharply to beat his defensive lunge. 7th over: Pakistan 15-0 (Shafique 7, Saim 8) Shoaib Bashir is coming as well. I wonder when England last used two spinners inside the first half hour of a Test match; not sure it has ever happened. On Sky, Mike Atherton makes the point that Stokes is probably keeping his seamers fresh for when/if the ball reverse swings. The expectation is that it will reverse in this game because the square is much drier. It will certainly turn, and Bashir serves notice of that by getting one to grip and beat Saim. Nicely bowled. 6th over: Pakistan 15-0 (Shafique 7, Saim 8) Jack Leach comes into the attack inside the first half hour of the game. He has a slip, short leg and short mid-on for Saim, who tries to drive the first ball and is beaten. Not a great shot. After he takes a single, Shafique clips a leg-stump full toss through midwicket for his first boundary. Leach has a similar field for the right-handed Shafique, but with short mid-on moved to short mid-off. No sign of extravagant turn in his first over. 5th over: Pakistan 10-0 (Shafique 3, Saim 7) Potts must be a pain in the arse to face. He’s always making the batsmen play, usually from a length that brings both the edge and the front pad into play. Nag nag nag nag nag. His third over is a maiden to Shafique, and I’m pretty sure all 18 deliveries so far have hit the bat. Jack Leach is already warming up. “Pakistan cricket is the nation’s perfect metaphor for overnight chaos managed by a carousel of committees,” says Zain Malik. “They’ve turned up for this game like philosophers with a sledgehammer, smashing the idols of their biggest stars and conjuring a regiment of spinners on a pitch that’s been through some sort of voodoo ritual. But don’t write Pakistan off just yet. It’s out of these absurd shake-ups that their most outlandish victories often emerge.” Quite. But can we still call them cornered tigers if they beat England with spin rather than stumpbusting pace and reverse swing? 4th over: Pakistan 10-0 (Shafique 3, Saim 7) Shafique ducks under a bouncer, the first leave of the morning session from the 23rd delivery. That tells you how straight England are bowling in an attempt to maximise the uneven bounce. How weird it is to be talking about uneven bounce in the fourth over of a Test match. Carse puts his hands on his head when Shafique, who has started quite tentatively, inside-edges past leg stump for a single. 3rd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Shafique 2, Saim 7) Saim forces Potts crisply past point for four, making this the highest opening partnership he and Shafique have managed in nine attempts. Potts continues to make the batters play at pretty much every delivery. The last ball of the over keeps very low; thankfully for Pakistan it wasn’t gunbarrel straight and Saim edges it well short of Smith. “You don’t often see a sixth-day field,” says Gary Naylor, “but we have one now.” I’d love to see some of the fields in this game. Day nine, and Alan Melville has tried literally every field known to mankind, yet Bill Edrich is still batting. 2nd over: Pakistan 5-0 (Shafique 2, Saim 3) Brydon Carse’s optimum role is as first-change enforcer, but the balance of England’s side means he’ll take the new ball in this game. Shafique is beaten by a heavy ball outside off stump and then works a single off the hip. Saim Ayub, who played a hideous shot off Carse in the second innings last week, pulls confidently for three to get off the mark. And then there’s the first sign of uneven bounce: a shortish delivery that keeps low and is inside-edged onto the pad by Shafique. 1st over: Pakistan 1-0 (Shafique 1, Saim 0) With Woakes and Atkinson rested, Matthew Potts takes the first over for the first time in his Test career. He starts with two slips and a leg slip for Shafique, although Ben Stokes takes out the second slip after three balls. Potts starts well, making the batters play at all six deliveries. That’s one of his great strengths: tight line, good-to-full length, always at the batter. Here come the Pakistan openers, Saim Ayub and Abdullah Shafique. The first target is to reach 10. Their eight opening partnership in Tests have all ended in single figures, with a miserable average of 2.87. Yep. “Pakistan, it seems, have taken the phrase ‘lucky number seven’ quite literally, winning the toss and tossing in not one, but s-e-v-e-n spinners,” writes Zain Malik. “Desperation? Maybe. Innovation? Definitely. The pitch? Rumored to turn faster than a drift car on a tight corner. But let’s hope we don’t get a repeat of the Pindi fiasco, where Shan and the boys brought four pacers expecting Headingley, only to find themselves bowling on something closer to a runway at Jinnah International.” Does this constitute pitch doctoring? “The last Test was quite the thing, huh?” says Felix Wood. “Pakistan have thrown aside all the best practice guides of how Test cricket should be done ahead of this match... is this their tribute to Bazball?” Ha, I hadn’t thought of it like that. The trouble is we can’t give it a name as nobody knows which of the 427-man selection committee has driven this change. Rameez Raja, talking on Sky Sports, doesn’t think much of Pakistan’s volte farce They’re trying to change the DNA of Pakistan cricket… it’s a cocktail of confusion… this is a leap of faith… they’re trying to win at any cost… it’s a rudderless ship, I don’t know who’s in charge… there’s no consistency… this is a desperate move… I just hope for Pakistan’s sake that somehow it works. After picking three new spinners and a used pitch, it’s fair to say that’s an important toss for Pakistan to win. “Yeah,” smiles Ben Stokes, “we would have batted as well.” Kamran Ghulam, a 29-year-old with a first-class average of 49, replaces Babar Azam and will make his Test debut. The three recalled spinners are Sajid Khan, Noman Ali and Zahid Mehmood; they come in for Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and the unwell Abrar Ahmed. Including occasional bowlers like Salman Agha, Pakistan have seven spinners in the team. England make two changes from the first Test. Ben Stokes and Matthew Potts are in; Chris Woakes and Gus Atkinson are putting their feet up. Pakistan Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique, Shan Masood (c), Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Salman Agha, Aamer Jamal, Sajid Khan, Noman Ali, Zahid Mehmood. England Crawley, Duckett, Pope, Root, Brook, Stokes (c), Smith (wk), Carse, Potts, Leach, Bashir. In using the same pitch Pakistan are, counterintuitively, breaking new ground. “We can discuss what we think it’s going to do, but we won’t really know until a day or a session has been played on it,” said Ben Stokes, who has never seen the like and no idea what to expect. “You’d like to think it will offer spinners more than it did last game. I’m not sure the bowlers will like it, but you can still see the footmarks from the last Test. Who knows what’s going to happen?” The more things stay the same, the more they change. Pakistan and England are back at the Multan Cricket Stadium for the second Test, playing on the same surface as last week, but Pakistan are hoping for a completely different ball game. They have recalled three spinners with a combined age of 105 and are gambling that the dead pitch of the first Test will come dramatically to life like a slasher movie villain. It’s quite a gamble, but maybe Pakistan don’t have much left to lose. They’ve been beaten in their last six Tests, equalling their worst-ever run, and responded to defeat in the first Test by leaving out arguably their three best players: Babar Azam, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah. If they’re not at rock bottom, they’re certainly in the same postcode. Pakistan are in such a mess, in fact, that it feels inevitable they will rout England to square the series. There’s are few teams in world sport who are more dangerous when they are in complete disarray, and Pakistan will aim to play with the freedom of the cornered tiger. England have also made changes, with the fit-again Ben Stokes and Matthew Potts replacing Chris Woakes and Gus Atkinson. Stokes will bowl a bit in an all-Durham pace attack that also includes Brydon Carse, the man who drew the short straw and will have to go again on that thing, in that heat. It’s common for white-ball games to be played on used pitches. But nobody can remember it happening in a Test and anything is possible over the next few days. For all we know, by days nine and ten the ball might be turning backwards. Mind the cracks."

          "bodyText": "South Korea has condemned North Korea after it destroyed roads linking the countries on Tuesday, in another blow to bilateral ties on the increasingly tense peninsula. The South Korean unification ministry, which overseas inter-Korean relations, described the North’s decision to blow up roads on its side of the countries’ heavily armed border as “abnormal” and a violation of bilateral agreements designed to lower tensions. The South’s joint chiefs of staff said its military had fired “retaliatory” warning shots near the border after the North blew up sections of road that, while not in use, are seen as symbolic of efforts to improve ties and, eventually, reunite the peninsula. “North Korean has detonated parts of the Gyeongui and Donghae roads north of the military demarcation line,” the JCS said, adding that the South had boosted its military readiness in response. It did not provide details of the warning shots and it was not immediately known if North Korea had responded. The North has laid fresh mines, erected anti-tank barriers and deployed missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads along the border since its leader, Kim Jong-un, declared the South his country’s “principal enemy” earlier this year. Last week Pyongyang said it would permanently seal its southern border in response to joint military exercises between South Korea and the US and the recent arrival in the South of a nuclear-powered US submarine. On Monday, the North said it was preparing to blow up the roads, days after it accused Seoul of using drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang in what it called a political and military provocation that could lead to war. Kim convened a security meeting to direct a plan of “immediate military action” in response, state media reported on Tuesday, while his influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, said the regime had “clear proof” that the South’s military was behind the reported drone incursions. Using typically florid language, she said: “If sovereignty of a nuclear weapons state … by mongrels tamed by Yankees, the master of those dogs should be held accountable for this,” according to the KCNA state news agency. The two Koreas are connected by roads and railway lines that were built with South Korean loans worth $133m, the South’s Yonhap news agency said. The roads and railways have been closed for years, but destroying them sent a clear message that Kim Jong-un did not wish to negotiate with the South, experts said. Destroying physical connections between North and South would be in line with Kim’s order in January to ditch the goal of a peaceful Korean unification, in a break with his predecessors’ long-held dream of creating a united peninsula in the image of North Korea. “This is a practical military measure related to the hostile dual-state system that North Korea has frequently mentioned,” said Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. The North may be looking to erect more physical barriers along the border, Yang said, adding that the detonations could be “preparatory work for its construction of those walls”. Seoul’s military initially denied sending drones north but has subsequently declined to comment, even as Pyongyang has blamed them directly, warning it would consider it “a declaration of war” if another drone was detected. Activist groups have long sent propaganda northwards, typically by balloon, and enthusiasts are also known to have flown small, hard-to-detect drones into the North. At Kim’s meeting on Monday, officials heard a report on the “enemy’s serious provocation”, KCNA said, adding that Kim had “expressed a tough political and military stand”. In 2022, five North Korean drones crossed into the South, the first such incident in five years, prompting the South Korean military to fire warning shots and deploy fighter jets. The jets failed to shoot down any of the drones. In July, Seoul said it would deploy drone-melting lasers this year, saying the South’s ability to respond to provocations would be “significantly enhanced”. The new laser weapons – called the “StarWars Project” by the South – shoot an invisible, silent beam that costs just 2,000 won ($1.45) a use, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration. After Kim’s meeting in Pyongyang, “attention is turning to whether North Korea will respond by sending drones into the South or take strong action if drones infiltrate its territory again”, said Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute. “North Korea is likely to engage in strong provocations along the border if there is a recurrence of drone infiltrations.” Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report"

          "headline": "Israeli attacks on UN forces in Lebanon must stop, say UK, Italy, France and Germany – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "This blog has now closed. You can read our latest full report here and all our coverage from the region here. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has hit out at the United Nations for failing to prevent Israel from firing at its peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. Erdogan said on Monday the UN was also to blame for failing to sanction Israel over its wars with Hezbollah and with Hamas in Gaza. AFP reports: “The image of the UN which cannot protect its own personnel is shameful and worrying,” Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel, said in a televised address. “Frankly, we ask ourselves what the (UN) security council is waiting for to stop Israel. “Can you believe it? The Israeli tanks penetrate into the Unifil zone, attack peacekeeping soldiers, even wounding some of them, but the UN security council decides to just watch all this criminality from its stands -- that’s what we call powerlessness.” The UN condemned the attacks with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying they “may constitute a war crime”. There are reports in Israeli media that rocket sirens are sounding in the northern town of Shtula near the western Galilee. The alert comes minutes after a rocket alarm sounded in Margaliyot near Kiryat Shmona in the eastern Galilee Panhandle. There were no immediate reports of impacts or injuries. The United Nations security council voiced “strong concerns” Monday after incidents in which UN peacekeepers in Lebanon have been injured, AFP reports, as Israel presses its campaign against Hezbollah militants in its northern neighbour. “Against the backdrop of ongoing hostilities along the Blue Line, the members of the Security Council expressed their strong concerns after several Unifil positions came under fire in the past days. Several peacekeepers have been wounded,” said the council’s rotating presidency, currently Switzerland’s UN ambassador Pascale Baeriswyl. In the statement, which did not single out Israel, the 15 council members “urged all parties to respect the safety and security of Unifil personnel and premises. They recalled that UN peacekeepers and UN premises must never be the target of an attack.” The council’s intervention followed two closed meetings on the deteriorating situation in Lebanon. It’s 1am in Gaza, Beirut and Tel Aviv. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: More than 20 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a Christian town in northern Lebanon on Monday, far from Hezbollah’s power centres in Beirut and the south and east of the country. The bombing struck Aitou, a Maronite village near the northern city of Tripoli, hit a small apartment building, killing 21 people according to the Lebanese Red Cross. The village’s mayor told Reuters that the building had been rented to families displaced by the war. The Israeli strike on Aitou was one of several over the past two weeks targeting areas thought to be “safe”, including the bombing of a displacement centre in the southern town of Wardaniyeh last week. Israel is facing international criticism for at least three violations that have injured five members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon. It was also a particularly bloody 24 hours in the Gaza Strip. Four people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a hospital courtyard in central Gaza, another strike on a nearby school used as a shelter killed at least 20 people, and a drone strike killed five children playing on the street in al-Shati camp in Gaza City, according to local health authorities. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties in the three incidents on Sunday and Monday. At least four people were killed after an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah early on Monday. The bombing triggered a large fire, leaving 25 people with severe burns. Footage showed people desperately trying to extinguish the flames as explosions could be heard within the camp. An Israeli airstrike killed at least 20 people, including children, at the Al-Mufti school in central Gaza on Sunday night, medics said. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war when it was struck by a volley of artillery, killing entire families and wounding dozens more. An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians and wounded many others in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, medics said on Monday. At least 10 Palestinians were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Palestinian medics said. Five children in al-Shati camp in Gaza City were also killed on Sunday in a drone strike, Gaza’s civil defence agency said. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday. Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas, according to a report. The plan proposed by a group of retired generals would give Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants – meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them – and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to the Associated Press. Lebanese officials said an Israeli airstrike hit near an aid convoy in Lebanon on Monday, wounding a driver and lightly damaging the trucks. The humanitarian aid, which reached Beirut on Monday, was marked with the flags of Turkey and the United Arab Emirates as well as the Red Cross insignia. Hezbollah appeared to respond to the strike on Aitou by firing a salvo of at least three rockets at Israel’s commercial and diplomatic centre, Tel Aviv, on Monday. Air raid sirens were triggered across vast swathes of central and northern Israel, but the attack was intercepted by Israel’s air defence systems. Hezbollah inflicted the deadliest attack so far on Israel during the two-week-old war on Sunday, in a drone strike on a military base near Binyamina that killed four soldiers and severely wounded another seven. Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, vowed “a forceful response” to the attack during a phone call with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Monday. Netanyahu vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy. “We will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon – including Beirut,” the Israeli prime minister said on Monday. Israel’s military said that three projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, and that all of them had been intercepted, following reports that sirens were sounding across the country. The Israeli military said it also intercepted two drones approaching from Syria, a day after a drone attack by Hezbollah on a base killed four soldiers. The UN’s secretary-general, António Guterres, condemned the “large number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza”, his spokesperson said on Monday. The UN chief “strongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,” spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. The UN’s human rights office said it was appalled by more than a week of heavy Israeli strikes on northern Gaza, where it said tens of thousands of civilians are trapped without food or supplies. It said the Israeli army “appears to be cutting off north Gaza completely from the rest of the Gaza Strip and conducting hostilities with absolute disregard for the lives and security of Palestinian civilians”. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the Palestinian health ministry said. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Italy, Britain, France and Germany released a joint statement on Monday condemning Israel for repeatedly attacking UN peacekeepers. “These attacks must stop immediately,” they said, adding deliberate attacks were against international law.. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said there would be “no withdrawal” of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Unifil’s work “is very important. It’s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.” Netanyahu said accusations Israeli troops had deliberately harmed peacekeepers were “completely false”, as he repeated a call for them to withdraw from combat zones close to the border. The Israeli leader said Hezbollah used Unifil positions as cover for attacks that have killed Israelis. Israel’s infrastructure minister, Eli Cohen, accused Unifil of being a “shield for Hezbollah” and called on Guterres to remove the force. The UN’s peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said peacekeepers would stay in all positions in Lebanon despite Israel’s calls for them to move. Unifil earlier said Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one position early Sunday and destroyed the main gate. They later fired smoke rounds near peacekeepers, causing skin irritation. The UN peacekeeping mission called the incident a “further flagrant violation of international law”. Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN. Asked what Israel’s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: “essentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein”. Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, and economics minister Robert Habeck, are said to have blocked German arms exports to Israel over concerns as to what the weapons would be used for, according to German media reports. No military exports to Israel have been approved since March according to the reports. Officials from the US’s main humanitarian agency attend daily meetings on an Israeli military base that also hosts a notorious prison for Palestinian detainees where torture reportedly runs rampant, the Guardian has learned. Australia has warned its citizens not to travel to Israel and urged Australians there to leave the country while commercial flights remained available. In a post on Twitter/X on Monday reported by Reuters, the Australian foreign minister Penny Wong wrote: The Australian government has serious concerns the security situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories could deteriorate rapidly. There continues to be a high threat of military and terrorist attacks against Israel and Israeli interests across the region, according to the Australian government’s travel advisory. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has told the Biden administration he is willing to strike military rather than oil or nuclear facilities in Iran, according to a report. Citing sources, the Washington Post writes that this suggests that Netanyahu is considering a more limited counterstrike in retaliation for Iran’s missile barrage launched on 1 October. UN peacekeepers will stay in all positions in Lebanon, the UN’s peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said on Monday, despite Israeli calls for them to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon. Israel is facing international criticism for at least three violations in the past week that have injured five members of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, Unifil. On Sunday, two Israeli tanks destroyed a gate and forcibly entered a Unifil base. As we reported earlier, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated a call for peacekeepers to withdraw from combat zones close to the border. Lacroix said: The decision was made that Unifil would currently stay in all its positions in spite of the calls that were made by the Israel Defense Forces to vacate the positions that are in the vicinity of the Blue Line. Here are some of the latest images sent from the newswires from the city of Deir al Balah in central Gaza: Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected accusations that Israeli forces deliberately targeted UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. “The charge that Israel deliberately attacked Unifil personnel is completely false,” the Israeli prime minister said in a video posted on Monday. It’s exactly the opposite. Israel repeatedly asked Unifil to get out of harm’s way. It repeatedly asked them to temporarily leave the combat zone, which is right next to Israel’s border with Lebanon. He said the military did its utmost to avoid harming Unifil personnel, while striking Hezbollah fighters. “Israel has every right to defend itself against Hezbollah and will continue to do so,” he said, adding: But the best way to assure the safety of Unifil personnel is for Unifil to heed Israel’s request and to temporarily get out of harm’s way. As Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah and Iran has escalated, it has begun to show a degree of vulnerability. A Hezbollah drone evaded Israel’s much vaunted air defences on Sunday and struck a military canteen when it was busy with soldiers eating dinner. Four were killed and 58 wounded, seven seriously, at a location 40 miles south of the Lebanese border. The drone that hit the canteen of the Golani base near Binyamina appears to have been part of a synchronised attack that allowed it to elude the country’s well organised air defences. Hezbollah has been refining its attack strategy, and timing the drone attack with rockets helped complicate the picture for the defenders. It is not the first time in recent days that a drone has got through. A retirement home in Herzliya was struck by a drone on Friday during the Yom Kippur holiday – one of two that crossed the border from Lebanon. The other was shot down successfully by a fighter jet, but the second struck the building a few miles north of Tel Aviv. Read the full story here: US intervention points to growing concerns over Israel’s air defences The International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) has called for Lebanon’s heathcare system to be protected after reports that Israeli strikes hit medical staff during fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. “I really ... appeal for the protection of healthcare workers, for ambulances, for hospitals, for primary health centres,” Nicolas Von Arx, the ICRC’s regional director for the Near and Middle East, said on Monday, AFP reported. “Attacks on health facilities are deeply worrying,” he added. Such strikes mean “a hospital that doesn’t function any more. That means thousands, tens of thousands of people who cannot get healthcare, who cannot deliver in a safe place, who cannot get their wounds treated. Of the 207 primary health care centres in Lebanon’s conflict areas, 100 are now closed due to the escalating violence, according to the World Health Organization (Who). Von Arx said: We are very, very concerned about the displacements, about the functioning of health care systems, about the continuous suffering now in Lebanon. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said one of its workers was killed by shrapnel injuries suffered to the legs and chest in Jabalia in northern Gaza, which has come under “relentless attacks” by Israeli forces. Nasser Hamdi Abdelatif Al Shalfouh, 31, died of his injuries on 10 October in Kamal Adwan hospital, the medical charity said. It said he was “unable to receive the necessary level of care due to the hospital’s lack of capacity and an overwhelming number of patients in the facility”. In a statement on Monday, MSF said it was “horrified” by the killing and called again for the “respect and protection of civilians”. It added: Nasser is the seventh MSF colleague killed in Gaza since the beginning of the war. This bloodshed needs to end. As we reported earlier, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a volley of artillery at a school used to shelter displaced Palestinians in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza on Sunday. At least 22 people were killed, including 15 children, as well as dozens others injured by the Israeli attack, according to the Palestinian territory’s civil defence authority. The school-turned-shelter in Nuseirat had been intended for use as a polio vaccination site on Monday, but a spokesperson for the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) told the BBC that Sunday’s attack left the site unusable for vaccines today. Unrwa spokesperson Louise Wateridge told the UN: Throughout the night, I spoke to a colleague sheltering in the compound who told me, ‘We miraculously survived, the fire caught everywhere even the tent where we were sleeping burnt. The scene is terrifying.’ The German government has sharply criticised the shelling of UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. A spokesperson for Germany’s foreign office, Sebastian Fischer, told reporters on Monday: All parties to the conflict, including the Israeli army, are obliged to direct their combat operations exclusively against military targets of the other party to the conflict He added that a comprehensive investigation is expected and that discussions on the matter were being held with the Israeli side. The situation in southern Lebanon is causing growing concern, Fischer added, saying: The shelling of UN peacekeepers and the intrusion into their bases is in no way acceptable. It’s just past 9pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in northern Lebanon on Monday has risen to at least 21 people. The strike targeted the Christian-majority village of Aitou, far from the Hezbollah group’s main areas of influence in the south and east of Lebanon. The Lebanese health ministry said DNA tests were being conducted to identify body parts. So far the main focus of Israel’s military operations in Lebanon has been in the south, the eastern Bekaa valley and the suburbs of Beirut. An Israeli airstrike killed at least 20 people including children at the Al-Mufti school in central Gaza on Sunday night, medics said. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war when it was struck by a volley of artillery, killing entire families and wounding dozens more. An Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians and wounded many others in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, medics said on Monday. At least 10 Palestinians were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Palestinian medics said. At least four people were killed after an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, causing a fire that engulfed several tents housing displaced Palestinians. Footage showed people desperately trying to extinguish the flames as explosions could be heard within the camp. At least 42,289 Palestinians have been killed and 98,684 wounded in Israeli strikes since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian health ministry said on Monday.

Hezbollah said it launched a barrage of rockets at the north Israeli town of Safed on Monday. Hezbollah said it battled Israeli troops in south Lebanon, and claimed several new attacks on Israel after a drone strike on an Israeli base near Binyamina, south of Haifa, killed four soldiers on Sunday night. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant vowed “a forceful response” to the Hezbollah drone attack during a conversation with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin. Israel’s military said that three projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, and that all of them had been intercepted, following reports that sirens were sounding across the country.

Israeli attacks on the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon (Unifil) are contrary to international humanitarian law and must stop at once, according to a joint statement by Italy, Britain, France and Germany on Monday. The four nations reaffirmed “the essential stabilising role” played by Unifil in southern Lebanon, adding that Israel and other parties had to ensure the safety of the peacekeepers at all times. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez said there would be “no withdrawal” of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Unifil’s work “is very important.

Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin, accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN.

Israeli attacks on the United Nations’ peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are contrary to international humanitarian law and must stop at once, Italy, Britain, France and Germany said, Reuters reports. In a joint statement, the four nations reaffirmed “the essential stabilising role” played by UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, adding that Israel and other parties had to ensure the safety of the peacekeepers at all times. The UNIFIL mission, which includes hundreds of European soldiers, has said it has repeatedly come under attack from the Israeli military in recent days. Israel has called on the UN to move troops out of the area as it targets Hezbollah forces. CCTV caught the moment a Hezbollah rocket hit a northern Israeli town. Israeli ambulances and firefighters rushed to the northern Israeli town of Karmiel on 14 October after Hezbollah launched a rocket barrage into Israel. Firefighters struggled to extinguish a car that caught fire in the middle of the street, while medics treated one lightly wounded woman, Israel’s ambulances service MDA said. United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned the “large number of civilian casualties in the intensifying Israeli campaign in northern Gaza,” his spokesperson said. “He strongly urges all parties to the conflict to comply with international humanitarian law and emphasises that civilians must be respected and protected at all times,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. At least 10 people were reportedly killed by Israeli fire at a food distribution centre at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, where Israeli tanks and troops are continuing a ground offensive. Some more on the two Palestinians reportedly shot and killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank earlier today. The governor of Jenin, Kamal Abu al-Rub, said Israeli soldiers surrounded a house in the Jenin refugee camp adjacent to the city. “The occupation (Israeli) soldiers climbed on the roofs of the houses and started shooting at anything that moved, resulting in the martyrdom of a minor and a young man in his 20s,” he told AFP. The Palestinian news agency Wafa said one of the dead was a 17-year-old boy. The Israeli military said it was “looking into the reports”. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to strike Hezbollah without mercy following the drone strike on a military base in Israel on Sunday that killed four. He said retaliation would extend to targets in Beirut, AFP reports. “We will continue to mercilessly strike Hezbollah in all parts of Lebanon – including Beirut. All this according to operational considerations. We have proven it recently and we will continue to prove it in the days to come,” he said while visiting the military base. An Israeli airstrike has killed at least eight Palestinians and wounded many others in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, medics told Reuters on Monday. We will provide more details as we get them. Hezbollah said it launched a barrage of rockets at the north Israeli town of Safed, AFP reports. Hezbollah fighters fired a “big rocket salvo” at Safed, the group said in a statement, adding it was “in defence of Lebanon” and in response to Israeli attacks on Lebanese “cities, villages and civilians”. Some analysis from AP on the drone strike that killed four Israeli soldiers last night: One of the worst mass casualty strikes on Israel in a year of war came not from dozens of Iranian ballistic missiles nor the repeated barrages of rocket fire launched by Hamas and Hezbollah. Instead, it was a single drone. The unmanned aerial vehicle, laden with explosives, evaded Israel’s multilayered air-defence system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel, killing four soldiers and wounding over 60. It shined a light on Israel’s struggle over the past year of war to knock down unmanned aircraft incoming from as far away as Yemen, Iraq and Iran. Over the years, Israel has built up its aerial defence array to provide broad protection against short-range rocket fire and medium- and long-range missiles, although experts caution it is not airtight. While the system has taken down drones repeatedly, many have penetrated Israel’s airspace and sidestepped its defences, in some cases with deadly results. An Israeli security official said Israel was still investigating how the drone made it through Israel’s air defences. A pair of drones initially entered Israeli airspace, but while one was shot down, the other one continued to its target. Air raid sirens had blared in northern Israel as the aircraft flew overhead. But no sirens sounded at the base, giving the soldiers no advance warning and indicating that the drone may have fallen off Israel’s radar. Hezbollah said the drone was “able to penetrate the Israeli air defence radars without being detected” and reach its target. It claimed it had outsmarted Israel’s air defences by simultaneously launching dozens of missiles and “squadrons” of drones. It was the second deadly drone strike in just two weeks. Earlier this month, a drone launched from Iraq killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded roughly two dozen, according to Israeli media. On Friday, during a major Jewish holiday, a Hezbollah drone slammed into a nursing home in central Israel, causing damage. Israel said it allowed 30 trucks of aid to reach northern Gaza, breaking a 2-week-long stretch during which the UN said aid levels fell precipitously in the area, AP reports. The Israeli body managing aid crossings into the territory, COGAT, said 30 trucks carrying flour and food from the UN’s main food agency traveled through the northern crossing after inspection. The UN has not yet confirmed Israel’s claims. For the last two weeks, nearly no food, water, fuel or supplies have reached the north, the UN said, with both major crossings closed since 1 October. The cutoff, combined with a renewed Israeli offensive in the area, has raised fears that Israel is pursuing an extreme plan proposed to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that would besiege the northern third of the strip in an effort to prompt a Hamas surrender. News agency AFP has spoken to volunteer rescuers in Lebanon. When rescue worker Aya Wehbeh was called to respond to a rare Israeli strike in central Beirut last week, she was terrified it had hit her family home. “This period is really tough,” the 25-year-old said days after the twin strikes on the Nweiri and Basta districts of the capital left at least 22 dead. “I could have ended up pulling my mother, father, aunt or neighbour from the rubble,” she said. Across the country, rescue workers are struggling to respond to Israeli air strikes, with their resources already depleted by five years of economic crisis and fearing that they could be killed like dozens of colleagues over the past year. Wissam al-Qubeissi, 29, said he was determined to continue trying to save people despite the challenges. “We’re many and highly motivated,” said the volunteer, wearing a grey uniform he paid for himself. “But what’s the point if we lack bulldozers, equipment and protective gear?” he asked. In the storage room, he showed AFP rusty helmets, worn-out fire hoses and extinguishers about to reach their expiry dates. In the south of the country, the job is even more tiring. Israeli air strikes have pounded the area, while Israeli troops have clashed with Hezbollah on the frontier in recent days. Anis Abla, civil defence chief in the southern border town of Marjayoun, said he suffered severe burns to his face and hands two months ago while extinguishing a fire caused by Israeli shelling. “Our rescue missions are becoming more and more difficult, because the strikes are never-ending and target us,” he said. “We’re exhausted.” The Lebanese Red Cross says the death toll from the Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in northern Lebanon is now at least 21. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military and it was not clear what the target was. The strike on Monday hit a small apartment building in the majority-Christian village of Aitou, far from the Hezbollah militant group’s main areas of influence in the south and east of Lebanon. Hezbollah released a new video showcasing their drone fleet on Monday afternoon, with the message “our capabilities are fine”. The slickly produced slip showed fighters preparing several drones for flight with pictures of late secretary general Hassan Nasrallah and slain military chief of staff Fouad Shukur. The video was released the day after Hezbollah’s deadliest attack on Israel since the beginning of fighting one year prior, killing four soldiers and injuring over 60 in a drone attack on Haifa. It was one of 64 attacks carried out on Sunday by the group, according to the Israeli Alma Research and Education Center. Hezbollah has insisted that its military capabilities and structure remain intact and ready to fight Israel, despite the massive aerial campaign carried out against it since 23 September and the elimination of almost all of its senior military leadership. In a speech on Friday, head of Hezbollah’s military office Mohammed Afif said that the group’s fighters on the border with Israel were “fine” and ready for “fierce fighting.” Fighting in Lebanon’s south over the last two weeks has killed over a dozen Israeli soldiers and an unknown amount of Hezbollah fighters – the Lebanese group stopped releasing death notices of its fighters last month. Israel carried out a strike on an apartment building hosting displaced people in Zgharta, north Lebanon, on Monday, killing at least 18. Israel said that it had targeted the head of Hezbollah’s Radwan force’s anti-tank unit, Mohammed Kamel Naim. Monday’s strike was one of several over the last two weeks targeting residences hosting displaced people in areas of Lebanon thought to be ‘safe’, including a strike on a displacement center in Wardaniyeh, south Lebanon, on Wednesday. Israel’s military said that three projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, and that all of them had been intercepted, following reports that sirens were sounding across the country. Israeli fighter jets struck the launcher from which the projectiles were fired, the military added. It said no injuries had been reported. Israel’s deadly air strike in northern Lebanon earlier today marked a departure from the usual pattern of its attacks, AFP reports. The strike hit far from the main combat area of the country and in a mostly Christian area. Israel has focused its firepower mostly on Hezbollah strongholds in Shiite Muslim-majority areas in the country and in the southern suburbs of Beirut. An AFP photographer at the site of the strike in Aitou said it had levelled a residential building at the entrance to the village. Body parts were scattered in the rubble, with Red Cross volunteers searching for survivors while ambulances evacuated wounded people. AFP provides a report on the latest clashes between Hezbollah and Israel. Hezbollah said it battled Israeli troops in south Lebanon, and claimed several new attacks on Israel after a drone strike on an Israeli base near Binyamina, south of Haifa, killed four soldiers on Sunday night. Israeli forces launched a string of new air strikes on targets in Lebanon today, including one on the north of the country which killed at least 18 people, according to the Lebanese Red Cross. Israel also faced new criticism over their alleged attacks on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. The IDF said millions of Israelis were rushing to shelters as sirens sounded across central Israel, including Tel Aviv, in response to projectiles fired from Lebanon. The Israeli military says it has sent out 1.7 million text messages, 3.4 million voice messages and made 3,700 voice calls notifying civilians in Lebanon to evacuate as it continues its ground invasion there, AP reports. Some 2,300 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since last October, more than three-quarters of them in the past month, according to the Lebanese government. At least 1.2 million people have been displaced — the vast majority since Israel ramped up airstrikes across the country last month. Israel says it is making an effort to communicate with civilians ahead of airstrikes, but people interviewed by the the AP news agency say that they don’t receive the warnings – or that they come in the middle of the night or don’t adequately cover the area that is struck. Lebanese sources say the orders often come at very short notice, and it’s not clear where people can go or when they will be able to return home. One quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the UN’s human rights division. The United Nations human rights office has said it was appalled by more than a week of heavy Israeli strikes on northern Gaza where it said tens of thousands of civilians are trapped without food or supplies, Reuters reports. “In the shadow of the escalation of hostilities across the Middle East, the Israeli military appears to be cutting off North Gaza completely from the rest of the Gaza Strip and conducting hostilities with absolute disregard for the lives and security of Palestinian civilians,” the rights office said. It added in a statement that it had received reports that Israeli forces had erected sand mounds at a key juncture, effectively “sealing off north Gaza” and firing on those attempting to flee. The US embassy in Lebanon said its citizens were strongly encouraged to leave Lebanon “now”, Reuters reports. The embassy added that additional flights it organised for its citizens traveling out of Beirut would not continue indefinitely. Israeli forces shot dead two Palestinians in the northern West Bank city of Jenin, the Palestinian Health Ministry said, AP reports. Commenting on the incident, the Israeli army official said its troops exchanged fire with armed militants during what it termed a “counterterrorism operation” in the Jenin area, killing one of the gunmen. According to Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, one of the men was 17 years old. Four others were injured by Israeli fire during the raid, it said. Wafa reported that Israel had deployed their snipers on the roofs of a number of tall buildings in the city. Officials said an Israeli airstrike hit near an aid convoy in Lebanon, wounding a driver and lightly damaging the trucks, AP reports. The humanitarian aid, which reached Beirut on Monday, was marked with the flags of Turkey and the United Arab Emirates as well as the Red Cross insignia. Governor of the Baalbek-Hermel region, Bachir Khodr accompanied the convoy. He said the airstrike hit as it was passing through northeastern Lebanon. He shared a picture on X taken from inside a vehicle showing a large cloud of smoke on the road ahead. It was not clear how badly the driver was wounded. The Guardian could not independently verify the image. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant briefed his US counterpart Lloyd Austin on the deadly Hezbollah drone attack on a military base in Israel yesterday and vowed “a forceful response.” The attack near the city of Binyamina killed four soldiers and wounded 61. It was the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon two weeks ago. In his talk with Austin, Gallant “highlighted the severity of the attack and the forceful response that would be taken against Hezbollah,” his office said. He also “reiterated the measures” taken by the military to coordinate with UNIFIL peacekeepers in southern Lebanon and to avoid harming them, after mounting criticism of Israel for repeatedly firing on UN soldiers. Gallant’s office said he expressed his appreciation to Austin and the US administration for deciding to send a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery – used to shoot down ballistic missiles – to Israel “in the coming days.” Ireland’s prime minister Simon Harris has spoken to the Israeli president Isaac Herzog to speak about the security of Irish and other peacekeeping troops in southern Lebanon. He relayed the government’s “serious concern about the deteriorating situation” in southern Lebanon as well as emphasising the expectation that Unifil’s mandate was respected. The Irish government statement said: The Taoiseach was clear that the deliberate firing at UNIFIL posts is an outrageous and totally unacceptable breach of international law, and a cause of the deepest concern to the Irish people, especially the families of the Irish Defence Forces personnel serving in Lebanon. He also told Herzog Irish people taken “enormous pride” in their role and their safety was a matter of “the highest priority” for the government. He also spoke about Gaza, expressing solidarity with the families of hostages, but warning the “scale of a humanitarian catastrophe is unimaginable and that children and civilians are starving and dying”. The Israeli military said it has intercepted two drones approaching from Syria, a day after a drone attack by Lebanon’s Hezbollah on a base killed four soldiers. The military said in a statement: A short while ago, two UAVs that approached Israeli territory from Syria were successfully intercepted by the IAF (air force). The UAVs were intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory. Israel is fighting a war on two fronts, one on its northern border with Lebanon, the other with Hamas in Gaza, while it also faces attacks from Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Earlier on Monday, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq - a loose alliance of armed groups backed by Iran - said it had fired drones at Israel in two separate attacks. The group said in a statement before later announcing a second salvo: The Islamic Resistance in Iraq attacked at dawn... a vital target in the Jordan Valley in our occupied lands, using drones. Israel has expanded its targets in its war with the Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon on Monday, killing at least 18 people in its first strike on the Christian-majority town of Aitou in the north, the Lebanese Red Cross said. Reuters reports: So far the main focus of Israel’s military operations in Lebanon has been in the south, the eastern Bekaa Valley and the suburbs of Beirut. The strike in the northern region hit a house that had been rented to displaced families, Aitou Mayor Joseph Trad told Reuters. In addition to the deaths, four people were injured, the Red Cross said. Israel on Monday ordered residents of 25 villages to evacuate to areas north of the Awali River, which flows through southern Lebanon, as it intensifies its attacks in the region. An Israeli strike killed Muhammad Kamel Naim, the commander of the anti-tank missile unit of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force, in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon, the military said. Britain has imposed sanctions against Iranian individuals and organisations following Iran’s attack on Israel on 1 October, Britain’s Foreign Office said on Monday. The sanctions target senior figures in Iran’s army, air force and organisations linked to Iran’s ballistic and cruise missile development. Hezbollah said its fighters were battling Israeli troops inside a Lebanese border village on Monday, and that they had launched a guided missile at an Israeli troop carrier in the same area. Hezbollah fighters “are engaged in violent clashes with the Israeli enemy forces... in the village of Aita al-Shaab with... machine guns, rockets and artillery shells,” the group said, later adding it targeted an “Israeli troop carrier with a guided missile” in the village. Separately, at least nine people were killed and one person was injured on Monday in an initial toll following an Israeli air strike on the Christian-majority region of Aitou in north Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry said. The Lebanese Red Cross has put the death toll at 18. Meanwhile, Israel’s defence minister Yoav Gallant told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin that Israel would deliver a strong response to Hezbollah after the Lebanese armed group struck an Israeli army base killing four soldiers. Gallant spoke to Austin overnight and “highlighted the severity of the attack and the forceful response that would be taken against Hezbollah”, the minister’s office said in a statement. Israel’s infrastructure minister has responded to the UN in a post on X. Eli Cohen accused the UN forces of contributing “nothing to maintaining stability and security in the region” but denied Israel was deliberately targeting peacekeepers. He wrote: UN Secretary-General Guterres, it’s time for you to respond to the request sent to you, remove UNIFIL from the conflict areas, and stop playing into Iran’s hands. AP provides some background … The UN Interim Force in Lebanon was created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after Israel invaded and occupied southern Lebanon. Israel invaded again in 1982, and it wasn’t until 2000 that it withdrew. In the absence of an agreed-upon border, the U.N. drew up a boundary between Lebanon and Israel known as the Blue Line, which UNIFIL monitors and patrols. The United Nations expanded UNIFIL’s mission following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border to monitor the cessation of hostilities and patrol a buffer zone along the border. The force currently has around 10,000 peacekeepers in southern Lebanon drawn from around 50 countries, including 16 European Union countries. The largest contributors of troops are Indonesia, with 1,231 peacekeepers, and Italy with 1,068. They are lightly armed, and while they have the right to self-defense under certain circumstances, their role is mainly observational. This includes patrols, monitoring and reporting violations of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 fighting. The force also provides support to local communities. France has joined the chorus of EU voices rejecting demands made by Israel’s prime minister for UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon to pull back from its position in the country. “The protection of peacekeepers is an obligation incumbent on all parties”, the foreign ministry in Paris said. Iran has stopped indirect talks with the United States in Oman as tensions remain high over a possible Israeli retaliatory strike on Tehran, AP reports. Oman has long has been an interlocutor between Iran and the US, particularly in the secret talks that birthed Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. “For the time being, the Muscat process is stopped because of special situation in the region,” Foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state media while still in Muscat, Oman. “We do not see any ground for the talks until we can pass the current crisis.” The health ministry in the Gaza Strip said it launched the second round of a polio vaccination campaign in the war-ravaged territory. It said that a second does of the vaccine will be administered to children under 10 in the central part of the territory over the next three days before the campaign is expanded to the north and south. The campaign began last month after the territory registered its first polio case in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralysed in one leg. Health workers succeeded in administering the first dose of the vaccine to around 560,000 children despite challenges, including ongoing fighting, the breakdown of law and order and widespread damage to roads and infrastructure. The World Health Organization said humanitarian pauses to facilitate the campaign last month were largely observed. The European Union condemned attacks on UN peacekeepers by Israel in Lebanon and rejected allegations that UN secretary general António Guterres is responsible for obstructing the Israeli army, AP reports. Sixteen EU countries are contributing to the UNIFIL peacekeeping force. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that “their work is very important. It’s completely unacceptable attacking United Nations troops.” Five peacekeepers have been wounded in recent attacks, with most blamed on Israeli forces. Speaking in Luxembourg before chairing talks between EU foreign ministers, Borrell underlined that the UN security council decides whether UNIFIL peacekeepers should be moved, “so stop blaming Secretary Guterres.” Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called for UNIFIL to heed Israel’s warnings to evacuate, accusing them of “providing a human shield” to Hezbollah. In a video addressed to Guterres, who has been banned from entering Israel, Netanyahu told the UN chief “to get (UNIFIL) out of the danger zone.” Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg, whose country is one of Europe’s strongest backers of Israel, said the attacks are “simply unacceptable” and that UNFIL will not be leaving. “No, they will not withdraw. Yes, they will continue to fulfil the mandate. And yes, we demand on each and every party to respect this mandate and respect the security and safety of our blue helmets,” he told reporters. Israel’s Shin Bet domestic security agency said police had charged two Israelis on accusations that they planned to carry out an assassination at the behest of Iran, AP reports. The agency said Vladislav Victorson, 30, was approached online by a person called Mari Hossi and was instructed to carry out missions that ranged from petty vandalism to torching cars, and paid more than $5,000. The Shin Bet said Victorson was asked to damage communications infrastructure and ATMs, although a statement did not say whether he carried out these acts. It also did not name the Israeli figure he allegedly agreed to assassinate. The Shin Bet said he also sought to acquire weapons, including a sniper rifle, guns and grenades. According to the agency, Victorson enlisted two other people, including his girlfriend, Anna Bernstein, 18, to assist in his missions. The Shin Bet said Iranian agents are known to use social media and promises of cash in efforts to recruit Israelis to carry out such attacks. Ireland’s foreign minister, Micheál Martin accused Israel of trying to prevent the world from seeing what its troops are doing in Lebanon and Gaza, and of working to undermine the UN, AP reports. Asked what Israel’s aim might be in demanding that UN peacekeepers leave their bases in Lebanon after a series of attacks, Martin said: “essentially to drive the eyes and ears out of south Lebanon and to give itself free rein.” “We cannot have an undermining and a chipping away of the status or the credibility or structures of the United Nations and particularly its peacekeeping forces,” Martin said in Luxembourg, where EU foreign ministers are meeting. “We see what’s happening in northern Gaza, for example, in terms of the necessity of eyes and ears on the ground. The world has really no full picture of what’s happening in Gaza,” he told reporters. Five peacekeepers have been wounded in attacks that struck their positions in Lebanon since Israel began a ground campaign against the Hezbollah militant group in the country. The Associated Press provides some more detail on the Israeli strike on a Gaza hospital earlier today: The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Several secondary explosions could be heard after the initial strike, but it was not immediately clear if they were caused by weapons or fuel tanks. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. The UN has stressed the urgent need for ceasefires in both Lebanon and Gaza to avert a broader regional conflict with ramifications for the whole world, AFP reports. “A ceasefire that is sustained by a meaningful peace process ... is the only way to break the cycle of violence, of hatred, of misery,” said UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi. Speaking at the start of the UNHCR refugee agency’s annual executive committee meeting in Geneva, he insisted that only a ceasefire could “stem the tide to a major regional war with global implications”. “You will have seen the images and heard the numbers; hundreds of thousands of displaced inside Lebanon, seeking reprieve from Israeli airstrikes,” Grandi said. “Once again, the distinction made between civilians and combatants has almost become meaningless.” Grandi paid tribute to two UNHCR workers killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon last month, and also highlighted the 226 staff working for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, killed in Gaza in the past year. “We cannot accept that lives of humanitarians are dismissed as mere collateral damage, or worse, maligned as somehow culpable or complicit,” he said. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday said there would be “no withdrawal” of the UN peacekeeping force from southern Lebanon after Israeli attacks and calls to leave. Spain condemns Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s call on Sunday for the force to pull back “because there will be no withdrawal of UNIFIL”, Sanchez told a forum in Barcelona. A former senior officer at the UN peace keeping forces in southern Lebanon has said that Unifil troops should not leave their posting. John Durnin, who works in Lebanon and in Iraq, told RTE he believed Israel wanted them to move out of the way as part of an escalatory mission designed to be disproportionate. Of course, Benjamin Netanyahu is going to say that the UN are in the way or human shields – in fact, they’re an obstacle or a constraint for the Israeli troops who are moving into the area. Commentators from various [media] have noted that these attacks that have been taking place in Gaza seem to fulfil that use of overwhelming force by the Israelis to get the civilians to turn their backs on the militants - I think that that’s what Israel wants to do in southern Lebanon, and at the moment, the UN are in their way. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is examining a plan to seal off humanitarian aid to northern Gaza in an attempt to starve out Hamas militants, according to the Associated Press news agency. If implemented, this could trap hundreds of thousands of Palestinians unwilling or unable to leave their homes. The plan proposed to Netanyahu and the Israeli parliament by a group of retired generals would escalate the pressure, giving Palestinians a week to leave the northern third of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza City, before declaring it a closed military zone. Those who remain would be considered combatants — meaning military regulations would allow troops to kill them - and denied food, water, medicine and fuel, according to a copy of the plan given to The Associated Press by its chief architect, who says the plan is the only way to break Hamas in the north and pressure it to release the remaining hostages. The plan calls for Israel to maintain control over the north for an indefinite period to attempt to create a new administration without Hamas, splitting the Gaza Strip in two. There has been no decision by the government to fully carry out the so-called “Generals’ Plan,” and it is unclear how strongly it’s being considered. When asked if the evacuation orders in northern Gaza marked the first stages of the “Generals’ Plan,” Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said: We have not received a plan like that. But one official with knowledge of the matter said parts of the plan are already being implemented, without specifying which parts. A second official, who is Israeli, said Netanyahu “had read and studied” the plan, “like many plans that have reached him throughout the war,” but didn’t say whether any of it had been adopted. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity, because the plan isn’t supposed to be discussed publicly. Human rights groups say the plan would likely starve civilians and that it flies in the face of international law, which prohibits using food as a weapon and forcible transfers. Accusations that Israel is intentionally limiting food to Gaza are central to the genocide case brought against it at the International Court of Justice, charges Israel denies. A coalition of Israeli NGOs on Monday urged the international community to act, noting that “there are alarming signs that the Israeli military is beginning to quietly implement” the plan. They wrote: States have an obligation to prevent the crimes of starvation and forcible transfer. Continuing a ‘wait and see’ approach will enable Israel to liquidate northern Gaza. An AFP alert says the Israeli army has intercepted two drones approaching Israel from Syria. The Israeli military said it intercepted two drones approaching from Syria on Monday, a day after a drone attack by the Lebanese group Hezbollah on an Israeli military base killed four soldiers. A statement read: A short while ago, two UAVs that approached Israeli territory from Syria were successfully intercepted by the IAF (air force). The UAVs were intercepted before crossing into Israeli territory. Here are the latest images coming out of Gaza: Here’s a round up of the key events from overnight: On Sunday night, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed at least 20 people including children at the Al-Mufti school, according to two local hospitals. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war. Explosions hit early Monday outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, killing three people and injuring about 50 others, the hospital said. Tents caught fire, and residents of the Central Gaza community carried the injured into the hospital. Palestinian medics have said that at least 10 people were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, with casualties including women and children. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday urged other members of the European Union to respond to Madrid and Ireland’s request to suspend the bloc’s free trade agreement with Israel over its actions in Gaza and Lebanon. For months, both Spain and Ireland have been in talks with other EU countries who want a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the basis that Israel may be breaching the agreement’s human rights clause. The Guardian’s middle east correspondent Bethan McKernan has interviewed Gazans and aid workers in the strip, who say “no one is talking about” the bloodshed there and ceasefire hopes are receding as focus shifts to Lebanon. Mai al-Afifa, 24, was teaching a workshop about how to identify unexploded ordnance in a school turned shelter in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday when an Israeli missile hit the next building in the compound. Twenty-eight people were killed and 54 injured, according to medics at the scene. Through the smoke and rubble dust Afifa saw the body parts of two women and a male aid worker as she stumbled to safety. The Israeli military said it had used a precise strike to target Hamas fighters using the school as a command centre. She said: We are very sad about what is happening now in Lebanon … We have experienced this pain and loss. But we also fear that Gaza will be forgotten: the massacres have increased here and no one is talking about it. All the TV channels are talking about the regional war, Iran, Israel and what is happening in Lebanon. Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, and economics minister Robert Habeck, both of the Greens party, are said to have blocked German arms exports to Israel over concerns as to what the weapons would be used for, according to reports in German media. No military exports to Israel have been approved since March according to the reports, which initially emerged in the tabloid Bild, citing government sources, and are now being reported more widely in German media. According to these, the leading Greens are said to have insisted transports of weapons and spare parts could only go ahead once the Israeli government signed a guarantee that it would not use the weapons to commit acts of genocide. If confirmed, this would effectively put the German government at odds with Washington. Despite its clear criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza, the US government has made clear it sees no indication that it has carried out genocide. By even raising the question, via the Federal Security Council, observers say, Baerbock and Habeck are implicitly expressing a suspicion over Israel’s intentions which has not been voiced by the government of Olaf Scholz. Germany’s government holds the belief that due to the Nazi-perpetrated crimes of the Holocaust, Israel’s security is Germany’s “reason of state”. Military experts point out that Germany has no comparable conditions for sending arms to countries such as Turkey or Saudi Arabia, despite misgivings about the intended use of hundreds of millions of Euros worth of weapons that have recently been exported to them. Some close to the weapons export process have reportedly described the position adopted by Baerbock and Habeck, as “absurd”, suggesting that it was questionable the extent to which any written guarantee would be either practical or legally-binding. As recently as September the German economics ministry denied that there was an arms export boycott to Israel. Instead, a spokesman said that every application for weapons was examined on a “case by case basis”. According to Bild, Israel gave Germany the required written agreement last week. Between 2019 and 2023, almost a third of weapons imports Israel has received have come from Germany, which after the USA is its most important supplier of arms. In particular Israel has stressed the importance of submarines and warships built in Germany which it says it needs to defend itself from constant threats, especially from Iran. The second round of a polio vaccination campaign has been launched in the Gaza strip. The Health Ministry has said that a second does of the vaccine will be administered to children under 10 in the central part of the territory over the next three days before the campaign is expanded to the north and south. The campaign began last month after the territory registered its first polio case in Gaza in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralysed in one leg. Health workers succeeded in administering the first dose of the vaccine to around 560,000 children despite myriad challenges, including ongoing fighting, the breakdown of law and order and widespread damage to roads and infrastructure. The World Health Organization said humanitarian pauses to facilitate the campaign last month were largely observed. Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 42,289 Palestinians and wounded 98,684 since 7 October 2023 the, Palestinian enclave’s health ministry said on Monday. Here is video footage of the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike hit near the grounds of al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza, which caused a fire that engulfed several tents housing displaced Palestinians. Footage from Deir al-Balah showed people desperately trying to extinguish the flames as explosions could be heard within the camp. According to reports, the strike hit while emergency services were receiving scores of injured people from an earlier bombardment in nearby Nuseirat A Reuters snap says that sirens sounded in central Israel due to a number of projectiles fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory, the Israeli military said Meanwhile AFP is reporting that Hezbollah says it has targeted Israeli troops in a south Lebanon village. AFP is also reporting that the Israeli army says it has intercepted projectiles from Lebanon over central Israel. One of its journalists has heard blasts over the Israel army base hit by a Hezbollah drone. More to follow. Hezbollah said it targeted an Israeli naval base near north Israel’s Haifa on Monday, a day after claiming a drone attack near the city that the Israeli military said killed four soldiers. Hezbollah fighters launched “a rocket salvo” at the “Stella Maris” naval base near Haifa, the Lebanese group said in a statement, adding the attack was at the “service” of Hassan Nasrallah, the group’s longtime leader who was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs last month. Attacks by Israel on the United Nations’ peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are “unacceptable” and contrary to UN rules, Spain’s Foreign minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Monday. He told reporters ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers held in Luxembourg: It is contrary to what we expect from any member state of the United Nations, which is ultimately an organisation that protects world peace. EU countries, led by Italy, France and Spain, have thousands of troops in the 10,000-strong peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has said it has repeatedly come under attack from Israeli forces in recent days. Israel has called on the UN to move the troops out of the combat zone. Albares said only the UN can order the withdrawal of UNIFIL. More now on the Hezbollah strike on an IDF training base we reported on earlier (see post 7.33BST) The drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel’s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defence systems during the assault by “squadrons” of drones. Israel’s national rescue service said the attack wounded 61. With Israel’s advanced air-defence systems, it is rare for so many people to be hurt by drones or missiles. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily in the year since the war in Gaza began, and fighting has escalated. Here are the latest images coming out of Gaza: An Israeli attack on a school used to shelter displaced Palestinians has killed at least 20 people in central Gaza, officials say. Gaza’s Hamas-run Civil Defence Agency said the site in Nuseirat camp was struck by a volley of artillery on Sunday, killing entire families and wounding dozens more, the BBC reported. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it was looking into these reports. Earlier, five children were reportedly killed by a drone strike while playing on a street corner in northern Gaza. A civil defence spokesman said the attack on al-Mufti school, where hundreds of displaced people from around Gaza were sheltering, had injured at least 50 people and more than a dozen were killed. The five children in northern Gaza were reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike while playing on a street corner in al-Shati camp. Graphic images from the scene in the aftermath show the bloodied bodies of what appeared to be young teenage boys. One of them looked to be clutching several glass marbles in his hand. According to a report from the scene, told to a BBC correspondent, a drone strike hit a person walking down the street, which killed the children and injured seven other people. Later images showed the bodies of the five boys wrapped in white shrouds and laid out on the floor side-by-side. An aunt of one of the boys, named Rami, wrote a moving tribute to him on social media. She said the family had moved to al-Shati after being forced to leave their homes in Jabalia to a “safer area” because of the war. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has met with Mohammed Abdelsalam, a senior official from Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi movement, in Muscat, according to his office. The foreign ministry released pictures of the pair holding talks during Araghchi’s visit to the Omani capital, the latest in a series of diplomatic trips in the region following Israel’s vow to retaliate against an Iranian missile attack. Palestinian medics have said that at least 10 people were killed and at least 30 injured in Israeli airstrikes on a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, with casualties including women and children. The European Union’s member states have taken too long to condemn Israel’s attacks on UNIFIL soldiers in Lebanon, the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday, describing the attacks as “completely unacceptable”. Speaking at an EU ministerial meeting in Luxembourg, he said: We should be against Israeli attacks against UNIFIL. Our soldiers are there, many soldiers are there. EU countries, led by Italy, France and Spain, have thousands of troops in the 10,000-strong peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon, which has said it has repeatedly come under attack from Israeli forces in recent days. Israel has called on the United Nations to move the troops out of the combat zone. The European Union has condemned all attacks against United Nations missions, the union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a response to targeting of the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, by the Israel Defence Forces. Borrell said in a statement on behalf of the EU published on Sunday night: Such attacks against UN peacekeepers constitute a grave violation of international law and are totally unacceptable. The EU condemns all attacks against UN missions. It expresses particularly grave concern regarding the attacks by the Israeli Defence Forces against UNIFIL, which left several peacekeepers wounded. We urgently await explanations and a thorough investigation from the Israeli authorities about the attacks against UNIFIL, which plays a fundamental role in the stability of South Lebanon. Israel’s army chief has described a Hezbollah drone strike on a military training base that killed at least four soldiers at the weekend as “difficult and painful”. Lieutenant Geneal Herzi Halevi told soldiers during a visit to the Golani Brigade training base that was hit Sunday night in the area of Binyamina, south of the city of Haifa: We are at war, and an attack on a training base on the home front is difficult and the results are painful. An Israeli airstrike on a hospital courtyard in the Gaza Strip early Monday killed at least four people and sent flames sweeping through a packed tent camp for people displaced by the war, leaving more than two dozen with severe burns, according to Palestinian medics. Associated Press reports: The Israeli military said it targeted militants hiding out among civilians, without providing evidence. In recent months it has repeatedly struck crowded shelters and tent camps, alleging that Hamas fighters were using them as staging grounds for attacks. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central city of Deir al-Balah was already struggling to treat a large number of wounded people from an earlier strike on a school-turned-shelter nearby that killed at least 20 people when the early morning airstrike hit and fire engulfed many of the tents. Associated Press footage showed children among the wounded. A man sobbed as he carried a toddler with a bandaged head in his arms. Another small child with a bandaged leg was given a blood transfusion on the floor of the packed hospital. Hospital records showed that four people were killed and 40 wounded. Twenty-five people were transferred to the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after suffering severe burns, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the crisis in the Middle East. On Sunday night, an Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed at least 20 people including children at a school, according to two local hospitals. The school in Nuseirat was sheltering some of the many Palestinians displaced by the war. Meanwhile, explosions hit early Monday outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, killing three people and injuring about 50 others, the hospital said. Tents caught fire, and residents of the Central Gaza community carried the injured into the hospital. The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon known as UNIFIL said Israeli tanks forcibly entered the gates of one position early Sunday and destroyed the main gate. They later fired smoke rounds near peacekeepers, causing skin irritation. UNIFIL called the incident a “further flagrant violation of international law.” US vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has said Israel must “urgently do more to facilitate the flow of aid to those in need” in northern Gaza. Civilians must be protected and must have access to food, water, and medicine. International humanitarian law must be respected.” In recent days Israeli forces have widened their raid into northern Gaza forcing many families to leave their homes. The territory’s ministry of health appealed on Friday for medical teams to be allowed access to the northern half of the strip to evacuate the wounded, and for fuel deliveries to the north’s struggling hospitals, warning that civilians caught up in the intense shelling and airstrikes are running out of food and water. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli shelling late on Sunday had killed at least 15 people at a school serving as a shelter for displaced Palestinians in central Gaza’s Nuseirat camp. The Al-Mufti school was bombarded with a large volley of Israeli artillery, resulting in an initial death toll of 15 martyrs, including children, women and entire families, and 50 wounded,” the officials said. The Israeli military said it was “looking into the reports”. A Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others on Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the deadliest strike by the militant group since Israel launched its ground invasion of Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. Hezbollah called the attack near Binyamina city retaliation for Israeli strikes on Beirut on Thursday that killed 22 people. It later said it targeted Israel’s elite Golani brigade, launching dozens of missiles to occupy Israeli air defence systems during the assault by “squadrons” of drones. The US will send an antimissile system to Israel as well as a crew of US military personnel to operate the system. In a statement released on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj Gen Pat Ryder said that the US will also send an “associated crew of US military personnel to Israel to help bolster Israel’s air defenses”. Sixteen people have been killed during Israel’s raid on Al Ma’asara in Lebanon’s Keserwan district. In a post on Sunday updating the death toll from yesterday’s attacks, the Lebanese health ministry said that in addition to the 16 people killed, 21 people were injured. United Nations secretary general António Guterres warned on Sunday that any attacks against peacekeepers “may constitute a war crime”, his spokesperson said, after Israeli tanks burst through the gates of a peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon. Reuters reports it was the latest accusation of Israeli violations and attacks against the UN peacekeeping mission, known as Unifil, in recent days. In a statement released late on Sunday, the Israeli military said a Merkava tank had been trying to evacuate injured soldiers and had backed into the Unifil post accidentally while under fire amid a smokescreen. In a videoed statement addressed to Guterres on Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterated Israeli calls for Unifil troops to evacuate. “The time has come for you to withdraw Unifil from Hezbollah strongholds and from the combat zones,” he said. “The IDF has requested this repeatedly and has met with repeated refusal, which has the effect of providing Hezbollah terrorists with human shields.” French president Emmanuel Macron urged his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian to support a “general de-escalation” in the Middle East during a phone conversation on Sunday, the presidential office said. Reuters reports that in a separate discussion, Macron reiterated to Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister Najib Mikati the “absolute necessity” of obtaining a ceasefire in Lebanon without further delay."

          "headline": "Shares in UK gambling firms fall £2bn amid talk of higher taxes in budget",
          "bodyText": "Shares in British gambling companies have dropped sharply, reducing the stock market value of large operators by more than £2bn, after the Guardian reported that Treasury officials could tap the sector for between £900m and £3bn in extra taxes. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has come under pressure from two influential thinktanks to raise taxes on the industry, as she pulls every available lever to plug a £22bn “black hole” in the nation’s finances. Treasury officials working on Labour’s first budget in 14 years, which will be announced on 30 October, are understood to be open to raising the amount of duty paid by an industry that takes in £11bn a year from British punters. There are two separate proposals, one from the Social Market Foundation (SMF) that would increase online gaming taxes by £900m, and another, from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), that would lift a range of duties levied on the sector by nearly £3bn. Analysts said the government was unlikely to opt for the higher range of duty but warned that the sector was facing tougher regulation and taxes. In response, investors sold off shares in gambling companies on Monday, collectively cutting their value by more than £2bn. Ladbrokes-owner Entain fell 8% while Flutter, which owns brands including Paddy Power and SkyBet, fell nearly 6%. Other fallers included the William Hill owner, Evoke, down by 14%, and the gambling software maker Playtech, which fell by 1%. There was a 3% fall at Rank, which owns Mecca Bingo but also has online gambling brands. Between them, shares in gambling companies listed on the FTSE fell by more than £2bn. Bet365, one of the largest gambling operators in the UK, is not listed. One of the tax plans that Treasury officials are looking at hails from the left-leaning IPPR. The thinktank’s report estimates the government could raise £2.9bn next year – and up to £3.4bn by 2030 – by doubling taxes on “higher harm” products such as online casino games. Last year, the taxes raised £3.3bn, or about £2.2bn excluding lottery duty. Under the IPPR proposals, the Treasury would leave duties untouched on “lower harm” activities such as the lottery and bingo. Instead, they argue the chancellor should double taxes such as the 15% general betting duty levied on high-street bookmakers’ profits. Remote gaming duty, which affects online operators, is charged at 21% but would be raised to 50% under the IPPR plan. Another thinktank, the SMF, is working on a more moderate proposal, due to be published on Tuesday, that would double the tax on online gambling companies from 21% to 42%, raising about £900m. A poll of more than 2,000 adults by Survation for the SMF said 52% of Britons believe the government should increase tax on online gambling. Dr Aveek Bhattacharya, research director at the SMF, said: “For too long, online gambling operators have profited from lower tax rates in the UK than many of our peer countries. Doubling remote gaming duty to 42% would better reflect the social and economic harm they cause, and raise up to £900m for the public purse.” The SMF is backed by Derek Webb, who has emerged as one of Labour’s top five individual donors after giving the party £1.3m since the start of 2023. Webb, who made his fortune inventing casino games, is the foremost backer of campaigns to reform gambling regulations, including the tax regime governing the sector. The broker Jefferies said it thought the government was unlikely to opt for very sharp increases on the tax paid by the sector because they would “effectively wipe out listed operator profitability and likely pose an existential threat to many smaller operators”. Analysts at AJ Bell said the tax proposals provided a “salient reminder of the strengthening headwinds the sector faces in terms of regulation and tax and that this remains a live risk for investors to consider”. Grainne Hurst, the chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council, said: “The current speculation around taxes is being driven by anti-gambling campaigners, based on fantasy economics, and [is] simply not credible. “I want to be very clear with government, any further tax rises now will not only slam the breaks on growth for our sector, but it will threaten jobs and completely derail horse racing. “Our industry is at a crossroads as we seek to implement the measures contained in the white paper, measures that will cost our sector more than £1bn. We also can’t ignore the new levy on research, prevention and treatment for problem gambling, which will raise £100m a year from bookmakers.”"

          "headline": "Battery-operated items from Temu tested by Choice fail Australian safety standards",
          "bodyText": "An LED-lit tutu skirt, a spinning top and a set of building blocks are among a number of dangerous toys that were sold by Chinese-owned shopping platform Temu, Choice has found. Choice tested 15 toys operated by circular coin or button-style batteries, including watches, a writing tablet, a musical keyboard, a cartoon projector and a electronic pet game from Temu in May. Most of the randomly chosen toys had unsafe, insecure battery compartments and all failed at least one requirement of mandatory button-battery safety standards, said Choice’s chief executive, Ashley de Silva. A $12.79 LED tutu skirt was one of the worst products tested, with a non-compliant lithium battery compartment that was not child-proof and was “very easy to open with just a fingernail”, Choice said. “Our results are a worrying reminder of the potential for these kinds of products to slip through the net, putting children in Australia at risk of serious injury or even death,” said De Silva. Since 2022, coin and button battery-operated products sold in Australia must have child-resistant battery compartments and carry warning labels. Andy Kelly, Choice’s deputy director of campaigns, said more people were turning to the “easy option” of Temu – which entered the Australian market a year ago – due to mounting cost-of-living pressures as Halloween and Christmas approach. Choice tested the low-cost toys for compliance with battery safety laws after observing some products on the platform appeared “concerning”, he said. “The price point does make you wonder whether the products are actually compliant with the mandatory standards that we have,” he said. “When we did the test, it basically confirmed that all of them had failed at least one requirement of the button battery regulation.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email He said ingested button batteries had caused the death of three children in Australia. “We can’t say for sure whether the remaining toys that contain button batteries on the Temu website are compliant or not compliant,” he said. “If I was considering purchasing one of these products, I would definitely think twice.” Temu is not a signatory to Australia’s online product safety pledge, which goes beyond the law by asking retailers to remove unsafe products within two business days of notification, replying to consumers who report an unsafe product and having effective processes in place to ensure that unsafe products are not being sold, he said. “It’s impossible to keep tabs on operators like Temu,” he said. Choice is calling for a general safety provision which would introduce a duty not to sell unsafe products and would be backed by heavy penalties for non-compliant sellers. A Temu spokesperson said that it takes product safety “very seriously” and requires its third-party sellers to ensure their products meet regulations wherever they are sold. “Upon receiving Choice’s inquiry, we immediately launched a review of the product listings in question. We found that three of the products – the TutuSkirt, LED tea light, and [the] writing tablet – had been flagged and removed by our proactive monitoring in July and August, before we received the notice from Choice. We have removed the remaining 12 products from our platform,” they said. They said that as part of the platform’s onboarding process, prospective sellers sign agreements affirming their commitment to product safety and adherence to regulations in their intended markets. “When concerns arise, we take prompt action to investigate and, if necessary, remove any products suspected of being non-compliant. “Accountability and penalties are clearly defined within Temu’s quality control framework. We continually guide sellers on the need for strict product safety compliance, ensuring they are fully aware of their responsibilities. Violations can lead to warnings, penalties, product delisting, account closure and Temu maintains a blocklist to prevent problematic sellers from re-entering the platform.” The ACCC advises shoppers to check for a secure battery compartment and warning labels, even when shopping with a trusted seller. The battery compartments in toys should regularly be checked for damage, it advises. Individuals should contact triple zero if a child has swallowed or inserted a button battery and is having difficulty breathing. Consumers can report an unsafe product via the ACCC product safety website."

          "bodyText": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused North Korea on Sunday of sending military personnel to Russia’s army and once again appealed for more support to prevent “a bigger war”. “We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like in North Korea,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “It is no longer just about transferring weapons. It is actually about the transfer of people from North Korea to the occupier’s military forces.” He added: “It is obvious that under such conditions our relationship with our partners needs to evolve. The front line needs more support. We are talking about more long-range capabilities for Ukraine and more sustained supplies for our forces rather than a simple list of military hardware.” Last week, South Korea’s defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun, said “there was a high possibility” North Korea could deploy troops to help Russia in the war with Ukraine. Kim also told a parliamentary hearing that news reports of North Korean military officers having been killed in a Ukrainian strike on territory controlled by Russian forces were likely to be true. Joe Biden will visit Germany this week, government sources in Berlin said. German media said the US president would meet the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, for talks in Berlin on Friday expected to cover Ukraine and the Middle East. Biden’s visit was originally slated to last four days but Hurricane Milton forced it to be delayed, and causing Zelenskyy to embark on tour of European capitals to make the case for their enduring support. Changes announced by Russia to its nuclear weapons policy were long overdue and will probably “cool the ardour” of its western enemies, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview released on Sunday. Lukashenko, a close ally of Vladimir Putin, said “hotheads” in the west had already heard the nuclear signals being sent by Moscow even before the Kremlin leader announced the changes last month. Putin said last month that Russia was extending the list of scenarios that could prompt it to consider launching a nuclear weapon. He said Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman has urged international organisations to respond to a claim that several Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed in Russia’s Kursk region where Kyiv had launched an incursion in August. Dmytro Lubinets said on Telegram that he sent letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding the claim. Ukrainian battlefield analysis site DeepState which is close to Ukraine’s defence ministry said on Sunday that Russian troops shot and killed nine Ukrainian “drone operators and contractors” on 10 October after they had surrendered. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s Prosecutor-General’s Office said Russian troops had killed 16 captured Ukrainian soldiers in the partially occupied Donetsk region. Russian glide bombs have struck a “concentration” of Ukrainian troops near the border of Russia’s western Kursk region, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. It said the attack was directed against “a strongpoint and concentration of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel”, and the bombs were delivered by a Russian Su-34 warplane. Ukraine caught Moscow by surprise on 6 August by bursting across the border into the Kursk region, in the first invasion of Russian sovereign territory since the second world war. Russia has been trying for more than two months to eject the Ukrainian forces. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had taken control of the village of Mykhailivka in eastern Ukraine, where they have been advancing towards the important logistics hub of Pokrovsk. The Ukrainian military said in its daily report that its troops repelled 36 Russian assaults in the Pokrovsk area, including near Mykhailivka. Russia launched 68 drones and four missiles targeting Ukrainian territory overnight, Ukraine’s air force said on Sunday. Two Iskander-M ballistic missiles struck Poltava and Odesa regions and two Kh-59 guided air missiles targeted the Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the air forces said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine’s air defence units destroyed 31 of the drones, while 36 were unaccounted for, most likely intercepted by Ukraine’s electronic warfare, the air force said. The remaining drone was still in the air, it said. Russia’s air defence units destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones overnight over three regions bordering Ukraine, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday. Six drones each were downed over the Belgorod and Kursk region, the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app. One drone was destroyed over the Bryansk region."

          "headline": "Tributes paid to Alex Salmond’s ‘colossal contribution’ to Scottish and UK politics",
          "bodyText": "John Swinney has paid tribute to Alex Salmond’s “colossal contribution” to Scottish and UK politics, as allies of the former first minister mourned his sudden death on Saturday. Swinney, the incumbent first minister, said Salmond had had a huge impact on public life by forging the Scottish National party into a force capable of winning successive elections and then by bringing Scotland “incredibly close” to independence. “Alex made a colossal contribution to Scottish politics,” Swinney told Trevor Phillips on Sky News on Sunday. “I think it’s been universally acknowledged that politically, Alex Salmond had a huge impact on our public life within Scotland and the United Kingdom.” Salmond had “a sense of absolute determination to succeed in his politics”, married to an ability to bring people together, he added. “There was real drive and energy right at the heart of it. It was that combination of real drive and strategic thinking, which was at the heart of the success that Alex Salmond delivered.” Despite the deep fracture between Salmond and some in the SNP, which prompted him to resign his membership and set up the rival pro-independence Alba party in fury at the Scottish government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against him, SNP activists were asked on Sunday to pause campaigning in key council byelections as a mark of respect. Salmond fell out bitterly with Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister who described Salmond as her mentor, over her independence strategy and then investigations into his alleged sexual misconduct. Salmond was found not guilty of 12 charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault after a criminal trial in 2020, while the jury delivered the uniquely Scottish verdict of not proven on one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape. Giving evidence, Salmond admitted with hindsight he wished he had been “more careful with people’s personal space”, while his defence lawyer, Gordon Jackson, described his behaviour as “inappropriate” and “touchy-feely” during cross-examination. Salmond, 69, died of a suspected heart attack on Saturday in North Macedonia, where he had been attending a forum organised by the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy along with Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, the chair of his Alba party. Kenny Macaskill, the acting Alba leader, told BBC Scotland News that he heard the news when he took a call from Salmond’s “deeply distressed” companions in North Macedonia. Mark Donfried of the Academy for Cultural Diplomacy, which organised the youth leadership conference Salmond was attending, said the former first minister was caught by a fellow delegate as he fell backwards at a lunch event. Donfried said he rushed to call for an ambulance but that paramedics were unable to resuscitate him. He said Salmond had been in good spirits at the annual conference, which brings together young people to learn leadership skills and critical thinking, and was planning a return event in Scotland. A senior aide from Alba is thought to be in Skopje to arrange the repatriation of his body, with the help of officials from the Foreign Office. Salmond’s family described him as a “formidable politician, an amazing orator, an outstanding intellect, and admired throughout the world”. In a statement released by the Alba party, they said: “He loved meeting people and hearing their stories, and showed incredible kindness to those who needed it. “He dedicated his adult life to the cause he believed in – independence for Scotland. His vision and enthusiasm for Scotland and the ‘yes’ movement were both inspirational and contagious. “But to us, first and foremost, he was a devoted and loving husband, a fiercely loyal brother, a proud and thoughtful uncle and a faithful and trusted friend.” Joanna Cherry, the former SNP MP who became a close ally of Salmond after they were elected to Westminster in the 2015 election, described his death as “shocking and devastating”. “Alec was one of the finest politicians of his generation, and the finest first minister we’ve had to date,” she said on BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show. “As well as being a strong leader, he had an ability to reach out to people who disagreed with him.” As an indication of the depth of sadness felt by friends and colleagues, Geoff Aberdein, one of Salmond’s closest advisers as first minister, fought back tears on the same BBC programme as he described the “transformational” impact working for the politician had on his life. Floral tributes were accumulating outside the Scottish parliament building in Edinburgh on Sunday afternoon. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s former Westminster leader, who fell out with Salmond while party treasurer, said he was “utterly shocked and saddened” to hear of his death. “Alex’s talents were extraordinary in leading people, leading a government and in leading a country,” he said. “There is no doubt that Alex’s strength of character and personality were critical in the SNP achieving electoral success.” Senior SNP figures are now reflecting on the wider impact Salmond’s death may have on the party. His passing leaves Swinney as the only substantial figure in Scottish nationalism left in a leadership position, and some raise concerns that he is not of sufficient stature to see off the significant challenge from Labour at the 2026 Scottish parliament elections. Others suggest that this could prompt a much-needed period of reflection, both about the extent of the rift between Salmond and Sturgeon and the party’s domination by those two figures, perhaps with the result of bringing people back together. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Swinney said: “Obviously it has been a difficult few years, and there’ll be time to reflect on all of those issues in the days to come, but I think today all of us can recognise the formidable contribution Alex Salmond made to transforming the SNP into a party of government, transforming Scotland into a country that believed ever more that its future was as an independent country.”"

          "bodyText": "Has anyone ever told you to “stop worrying” or that “it will all work out in the end”? It doesn’t really help, does it? After more than 10 years of working with clients as a psychotherapist, I am so aware of the headspace that worry and anxiety consumes. I know how uncertainty can taint otherwise wonderful experiences, catch us restless in the dark while those around us sleep, and find us living much of life from a braced position. As a child, I was full of worry, having lived through one of my own worst-case scenarios: losing a sibling. No matter how many times someone told me not to worry, it never silenced the thoughts and fears in my mind. How can someone reassure me that the worst probably won’t happen when, in one way, it already has? We reassure each other that “it’s fine, nobody is judging you”, or “I’m sure that medical test will come back clear”, yet these well-meaning words don’t tend to offer much of the reassurance we crave, because we know full well that bad things do happen, we do get judged by others and there’s always a chance the test will come back positive. Ploughing endless energy into trying to control the uncontrollable is keeping us all tired and troubled. The fact is that ignoring fears doesn’t make them less true, it makes them more powerful. After years of struggling with my own anxiety, I decided to try a different tack – and it changed my world. Instead of doing everything I could to ease and avoid life’s uncomfortable truths, I sought a deeper acceptance of them. Through using this approach, I discovered that anxiety finally began to loosen its grip. In researching my book I discovered 10 uncomfortable realities that many of us are afraid to face – ways you can thrive amid these uncertainties and embrace more of life’s joy, despite full awareness of what’s at stake. 1. Some people don’t like me. Ask yourself this. If planning a holiday, would you trust an opinion given by someone who had never set foot in the country? Of course you wouldn’t. You’d seek advice from someone who had visited, stayed in a great location, eaten around the town. Remember this next time you find yourself ruminating over someone’s judgment of you. If they don’t truly know you, does their assessment deserve to take up so much bandwidth in your mind? 2. I am going to fail. If you are someone who fears failing at things, or you find your inner critic goes haywire when something didn’t go as you’d hoped, ask yourself whether your expectations were realistic. Remember, failing at something doesn’t mean you are a failure, it just means that something didn’t work out as you’d hoped, either because your expectations were sky-high, something happened outside your control, or because you’re a human who makes mistakes sometimes. 3. Life isn’t fair. We can expend so much energy shaking our fist at life’s curveballs and feeling the injustice of situations we see happening to or around us. It’s important to seek fairness despite the fact that life isn’t inherently fair. Bad things happen to good people, people hurt one another. But feeling like a victim of life’s unfairness can keep us stuck and unmotivated. As we accept that life isn’t fair, and stop shaking our fists, we free up energy to take a small (or large) step in doing something about it. 4. I will hurt people I love. Oh, the things we’ve swallowed down and the truths we haven’t told out of fear of hurting people. The thing is that, in avoiding honest (albeit sometimes difficult) conversations, we aren’t protecting our treasured relationships as much as we like to think – we’re welcoming an elephant into the room. It is your responsibility to be authentic and to do it as kindly as you can, but you cannot control how someone chooses to respond to that honesty. A good relationship can withstand healthy boundaries and tricky conversations. 5. I can’t always be fully present. We are encouraged to be more mindful in our daily lives, but this can add pressure. Our minds are created to hop between awareness of the past, present and future. Instead of feeling guilty for not being “present enough”, here’s a piece of advice. Every now and again, pause, look around and let your eyes rest on something beautiful, intriguing or interesting. Inhale and acknowledge what is going on in and around you. Now, as you reflect on your day, which may have passed in a busy blur, these are the moments that stay with you. 6. People misunderstand me. It can feel painful when, despite trying to articulate yourself, someone doesn’t “get you”. You can feel isolated and self-questioning when you don’t have two or three people in your life who truly understand where you’re coming from. Consider who those two or three people might be and invest in those relationships, taking steps to be open and honest with those you feel safe with and cared for by. Nurturing these relationships mean that it takes the pressure off and disempowers the importance of others “getting” you. 7. I am not good enough. If you experience a feeling of “not being good enough”, it may well be because you’re not. Ask whether you don’t feel good enough because the bar of expectation you’ve set, or has been set for you, is simply too high to reach for alone. Sometimes when we question whether we’re good enough, it’s important to recognise that we may be asking ourselves “am I perfect enough?”. Amending the bar of expectation to reflect your humanly limited resources means you’ll find you’re more often than not “good enough” to reach it. 8. Bad things will happen. Anxiety can make life feel as if you’re in a waiting room for bad things to happen, meaning you miss out on the joy, adventure and rest that is there for the taking. Next time you feel a wave of anxiety roll over you, or you catch yourself ruminating over the worst-case scenarios, repeat the mantra, “I will cross that bridge if I get to it.” This doubles as a reminder that you have crossed many bridges of challenge thus far, and survived. The “if” reminds you that many of the things you fear don’t come to fruition. It invites you to draw your attention to what is happening rather than what may happen. 9. I will lose people I love. This is a big one, isn’t it? The instigator of nightmares and the theme of our worst-case scenarios. Grief and loss are the flipsides of the richness that love brings to our lives. If your fear of loss is creating a shadow over your enjoyment of the relationships that you have, seek out stories of those who have journeyed through healthy grief and found ways to build their life. Speak to friends who’ve lost loved ones and are still living and thriving. When I fear that I couldn’t withstand the heartbreak of losing one of my kids, I consider my mother who lives a full and happy life despite the unending awareness of who is missing. 10. I am going to die. In my book, I speak about a friend who told me she often feels aware that she’s standing in one massive queue to her death, and has no idea of the position in the queue, nor can she change it. At first, I found this quite horrifying but, in time, I found it rather liberating. When you hold a gentle awareness of life’s limitations in mind, it can prompt you to live more fully and in line with your values. When I come to the end of my life, I want to be glad I prioritised my relationships and didn’t sweat the small stuff, so it prompts me to live in line with that value now. What about you? It can be confronting to see these truths in black and white. But we know, deep down, that these are truths that none of us can escape, and the less mental space the fear consumes, the more space you’ll create for joy and authenticity. There is an African proverb that captures my motivation behind seeking more acceptance of these truths. It goes: “When death finds you, may it find you alive.” I don’t want to wait until a curveball trauma forces me to be grateful for the joys in my life and the limited opportunity I have to embrace them, nor do I want to wait until I’m older and (more) grey to care less what others think. I don’t want to live a half-life blighted by fear of failure or bad things happening, and I don’t want you to have that either.

          "bodyText": "I spend a lot of my life being other people, spending years inside the lives of my fictional protagonists, and, when the creative alchemy is going well, it is intensely satisfying. It’s not that I can’t bear being myself, but to be honest, I find other people much more interesting. Creating characters and unravelling their stories is an invigorating and unpredictable adventure into the unknown. It might be daunting sometimes, and I’m never sure of the outcome, but when I’m in the zone, it’s one helluva ride. When I wrote my 2013 novel, Mr Loverman, I felt deliciously consumed by my 74-year-old Caribbean protagonist, Barrington Jedidiah Walker Esq. He arrived easily – no birthing pains – and when my husband came home in the evenings, I’d inhabited him so deeply, I found myself unwittingly talking to him in Barrington’s Antiguan accent. “Y’all right, spar?” I’d ask him, the boundaries between character and creator momentarily blurred, much to my husband’s amusement. I don’t fall in love with all of my characters, but I had a platonic crush on Barrington, as mad as that sounds. Not because he’s perfect, God forbid, who is? But because he’s a larger-than-life unreliable narrator who is complicated and passionate, with a strong and opinionated internal commentary, who couldn’t wait to regale me with his escapades and lay bare his traumas and dilemmas. This is a novel of two very long relationships – public and private. On the surface, Barrington is a traditional family man, married to his deeply religious wife, Carmel, for 50 years. The pair of them arrived from Antigua in 1960 and settled in Stoke Newington in north London, where they still live, conjoined in an increasingly unhappy union. Barrington is also the father of their middle-aged daughters, Donna, a social worker, and Maxine, a fashion stylist, and he’s the grandfather of schoolboy Daniel, privately educated and intent on becoming Britain’s first black prime minister. The family appears pretty conventional, except Barrington leads a double life – as a closet homosexual. He’s still sexually active with his lover Morris, in an affair that began when they were 14. Carmel has no idea her husband is gay or that their treasured family friend is her husband’s lover. At the start of the novel, Barrington’s marriage is blown apart, and he must decide if he’s going to be brave enough to leave it and live freely as a gay man. He has choices: he’s rich, he bought his house years ago when it was dirt cheap, and he can live anywhere. But he’s terrified, or as he puts it: “I am too used to being in a prison of my own making: judge, jailer and jackass cellmate.” The novel asks the question: what does it mean to spend a lifetime hiding your sexuality, and what are the consequences of this deception on yourself, and those closest to you? Each of my novels has a different starting point – a character, an era, a theme, a place – but Mr Loverman had unusual origins. In 2009, as a writing mentor for a development programme, I attended a workshop led by one of my co-mentors, the playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz. She set an exercise whereby she laid out a selection of old passport photographs on a table, asked each of us to pick one, and to then describe the person in the picture taking their clothes off in front of a mirror while delivering a monologue. Who knew that my chosen photo of a 1950s black man wearing a trenchcoat and hat would produce the character of Barrington? It was a simple prompt, but it generated a voice that so excited me with fictional potential, I went home and continued writing until he had filled a novel. Prior to this I’d spent years on another novel about a Gambian seaman who migrates to Cornwall in the 1900s, yet I never fully managed to bring his character to life. Try as I might, I couldn’t fix it. As soon as Barrington came on the scene, I unceremoniously dumped my Gambian seaman in the bin, salvaging a few thousand words that became a short story. There are several stages in the lifetime of a novel, which, I believe, begins when it’s unborn, unformed and floating around our subconscious landscapes, long before a single word has been written. As a writer, I’m aware that in my everyday life, I soak up experiences, stories, histories, passions, problems, worldviews, arts, literature, politics and, of course, people, cultures and communities. These influences eventually coalesce and metamorphose into fiction. Barrington, who seemed to appear fully formed, actually materialised from the nebula of my imagination. His voice is also influenced by an Antiguan friend I’ve known since we were teenagers. When I wrote him, I heard her. While I’m not from the Caribbean but of British-Nigerian heritage, I’ve been around Caribbean people my entire adult life – friends, lovers, associates, colleagues. I would have struggled to conceive, let alone write, this novel, without this personal context. Barrington may dominate the novel, but his family give him a run for his money, especially Carmel, who has chapters spliced in between his. He writes in the first person, she writes in the second. He speaks in prose, her sections are poetic. Carmel’s chapters were added to the novel at a late stage after I received feedback from my publisher that the reader only sees her through Barrington’s bitterly negative perspective. Horrified that I’d been so seduced by his charisma that I’d not done Carmel justice, I subsequently gave her the space to tell her side of the story. Barrington is the showman, Carmel the support act. Yet we get to know her intimately, from her troubled childhood through the difficult decades of marriage up to the present day. The women in the novel are significant but secondary figures. In a sense my later novel Girl, Woman, Other was written to redress the balance. My books are often in conversation with each other. I’ve always been interested in writing marginalised figures, to fill the silences in our society with fiction from underexplored demographics. When I began writing this novel, I had long registered the overwhelmingly heteronormative portrayal of the Windrush generation, which simply wasn’t representative. It seemed to me that Windrush gays had been erased, although occasionally younger, black gay figures appeared on television or in literature. I became aware that British colonial legislation criminalising sex between men was still prevalent in many Caribbean countries. Barrington was raised under these oppressive laws, which in Antigua and Barbuda were only repealed in 2022. In the novel, Barrington recalls: “I’d been under such pressure back home. A young man showing no interest in girls, when he could have any one of them? I was 24 when I married Carmel, and I’d almost left it too late for some. They was talking, and I was afraid I’d be up before a judge on some trumped-up charge of indecent exposure; or end up lying on an operating table with a bar of wood between my teeth and electric volts destroying parts of my brain for ever; or in the crazy house pumped full of drugs that would eventually drive a sane man mad.” Like many of his Caribbean generation, Barrington migrated to Britain expecting a utopia, only to be sorely disappointed. As a gay man, he had the added challenge of landing in another culture where homosexuality was illegal. Therefore, in Barrington’s original and adopted countries, legislative and social persecution were the norm. Further, as a black man rooted in his Caribbean community, which typically offered support and survival in a hostile new home, he couldn’t risk ignoring the pressures to conform. While Barrington describes his hidden sexuality as akin to living in a prison of his own making, the reader understands he had little choice.Barrington is arguably, mischievously, an unreconstructed sexist male, which sometimes confuses people. They ask me how I can justify this when I am a feminist. My answer is that I don’t impose my politics on my characters, although of course my politics underpin the themes of my novels. I have to let my characters breathe and be their own difficult, contradictory selves, rather than using them as a vehicle for my personal beliefs. While writing Mr Loverman, I was aware that I was challenging assumptions and limitations around sexuality, culture and ageing. The novel is about many things, but, at its heart, it celebrates the greatness of a longstanding love affair between two men – a lifetime of chemistry, compatibility and companionship, not without its vicissitudes, but that has survived and thrived, in spite of the obstacles thrown at it. • Mr Loverman is on BBC One on 14 October.

          "headline": "Two Lebanese soldiers killed in Israeli airstrike hours after UN peacekeepers HQ fired on",
          "bodyText": "An Israeli airstrike has killed two Lebanese soldiers and wounded three others, hours after the Israeli military fired on the headquarters of a UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon for the second time in as many days. The two incidents on Friday prompted further concern over Israel’s escalating campaign, amid waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon. Lebanon’s army has not been involved in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, and it withdrew its forces from the border between the countries when Israel launched its invasion last month. The Lebanese army said its soldiers died in an Israeli airstrike near a military checkpoint in the southern Bint Jbeil province. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that it had been targeting Hezbollah positions and was “unaware of any Lebanese army facilities found in the area of the strike”. That airstrike came soon after two Sri Lankan members of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) were injured when the IDF opened fire near the peacekeeper’s base in Naqoura. The Israeli army said that its soldiers had targeted what they believed to be a threat 50 metres from the base, adding that it would continue to “examine the circumstances of the incident”. Late on Friday night, Hezbollah warned Israelis to stay away from army sites in residential areas in the north of the country, saying Israel “uses the homes of settlers in some settlements”, and has military bases “inside settlement neighbourhoods. “We warn the settlers from being near these military gatherings in order to preserve their lives.” The shelling of UN positions has come as the conflict, which began a year ago in Gaza, continues to spread. Overnight Israeli airstrikes on central Beirut killed 22 people when they hit a densely populated residential neighbourhood of apartment blocks and small shops in the heart of the Lebanese capital. Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Friday that at least 30 people were killed by Israeli strikes throughout the day in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya town and refugee camp. At least 12 people were killed, including women and children, by a strike that occurred before 9.40pm local time (7.40pm BST), according to the agency. Before that incident, the director of the agency said 18 people had been killed by several Israeli strikes, including hits on eight schools in Jabaliya camp that were serving as shelters for displaced people. The health ministry in Gaza said on Friday that at least 42,126 Palestinians had been killed by the Israeli military in the territory since the war, 61 of them in the most recent 24-hour period. The conflict was triggered on 7 October by a Hamas raid into southern Israel, in which its militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostage. The Unifil statement issued on Friday pointed out that the UN security council had sent peacekeepers to Lebanon in 2006 as part of arrangements that ended the last Israel-Hezbollah war, and the multilateral force had been exposed to “very serious risks”. Two Indonesian Unifil peacekeepers were lightly wounded on Thursday when they were thrown from an observation tower that was hit by an Israeli tank round, and two other Unifil outposts had come under fire. Joe Biden, the US president, said he was asking Israel to not hit UN peacekeepers, and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told Israel that attacks on the peacekeeping force were intolerable. Lt Col Nadav Shoshani, an IDF spokesperson, said on Friday the force was looking into the cases of UN peacekeepers being “inadvertently hurt during IDF combat”. “The IDF expresses deep concern over incidents of this kind and is currently conducting a thorough review at the highest levels of command,” he said. Unifil’s spokesperson, Andrea Tenenti, said the attacks on the UN bases had impaired the peacekeepers’ ability to monitor the conflict in southern Lebanon and ground incursions by IDF units. “We have not been able to monitor the area as much as we want to because, for the safety and security of our troops, it’s important to stay inside the bases,” he told CNN in India. He said 350,000 of the 500,000 people who live in southern Lebanon had fled their homes since the fighting started. “We’re trying to do whatever we can to assist and to provide humanitarian assistance,” Tenenti said. “But the security concerns are very high.” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN relief organisation for Palestinian refugees across the region (Unrwa), said people in Gaza had become accustomed to being moved about “like pinballs” by IDF operations. He feared that the people of southern Lebanon were facing the same plight. “One of the fears is that we replicate a situation similar to the one we have seen until now in Gaza,” he said. The Israeli shelling of UN positions marks the culmination of a downward spiral of Israel’s relations with the international body. The Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, declared Guterres persona non grata earlier this month, accusing him of “lending support to terrorists” after the secretary general’s calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking at an Asian summit in Laos on Friday, Guterres said the spread of the Middle East conflict would have dramatic effects on the world. “I have never seen in my time as secretary general any example of death and destruction as dramatic as what we are witnessing here,” he said. “We are seeing escalation after escalation, a regionalisation of the conflict that is becoming a threat to global peace and security.” The incidents at Unifil positions drew outrage from countries that contribute soldiers to serve as peacekeepers. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, condemned the attacks and called on the international community to stop selling weapons to Israel. The French foreign ministry summoned Israel’s ambassador over an incident in which Israeli troops opened fire at three positions held by UN peacekeepers. Human Rights Watch called for the UN to set up a formal inquiry into Israeli attacks on Unifil peacekeepers, pointing out they could violate the laws of war."

          "headline": "Trump demands CBS be stripped of licence over edited Harris interview",
          "bodyText": "America’s top broadcasting regulatory body, the Federal Communications Commission, has denounced Donald Trump after the former US president demanded that CBS be stripped of its licence for airing an edited answer in a primetime interview with Kamala Harris. He also called the network a “threat to democracy” and targeted other broadcasters for having their licences revoked also. In a furious onslaught that seemed to bode ill for freedom of the press in the US if he returns to the White House, Trump accused the network of “a giant fake news scam” for broadcasting a clip from Harris about Israel in Monday’s 60 Minutes programme that was shorter and snappier than the version transmitted in the trailer. Trump claimed the contrasting answers proved CBS and the Democrats were colluding to commit “election interference” in next month’s presidential poll and said both were “threats to democracy”. His outburst was condemned as “threats against free speech” by the chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Jessica Rosenworcel, who said broadcasting licences could not be revoked because a candidate dislikes coverage. Challenged by the interviewer Bill Whitaker over whether Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, listens to US advice on Gaza , Monday’s programme broadcast Harris answering: “We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States – to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.” Rightwing critics on social media pointed out that the trailer had featured a more convoluted answer which they branded a “word salad” – a criticism often leveled at the vice-president’s media pronouncements. The trailer version, in response to the same prompt from Whitaker, had Harris answering: “Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.” Both segments were part of a longer exposition by Harris on support for Israel while trying to influence its conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza, in which more than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed. The answer came in the opening section of the interview, which was broadcast on the first anniversary of Hamas’s attack on Israel last October, which resulted in about 1,200 Israelis being murdered and 250 taken hostage. Neither CBS nor the Harris campaign has commented on the controversy, although the differing responses appeared to be part of a standard editing process that is not unusual for 60 Minutes. However, Trump seized on the differences on his Truth Social platform to allege a conspiracy to make Harris appear more coherent and thereby sway next month’s election. “A giant Fake News Scam by CBS &amp; 60 Minutes,” he wrote. “Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better. A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal. TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE. Election Interference.” He returned to the theme several hours later in two more posts. “60 Minutes is a major part of the News Organization of CBS, which has just created the Greatest Fraud in Broadcast History,” he wrote. “CBS should lose its license, and it should be bid out to the Highest Bidder, as should all other Broadcast Licenses, because they are just as corrupt as CBS – and maybe even WORSE!” Minutes later, he added: “With me, 60 Minutes does the exact opposite! They take everything I say, realize how totally BRILLIANT it is, and take it out. So, with Kamala they add, with ‘TRUMP,’ they delete. Like the Democrat Party, THEY ARE A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!” The latter comment appeared to be an oblique reference to Trump’s withdrawal from an interview he had previously agreed to give the programme, which has been airing pre-election interviews with presidential candidates for more than half a century. In a segment during the Harris broadcast, Scott Pelley – who had been due to interview Trump – told viewers that the former president’s campaign staff had offered “shifting explanations” for the cancellation, including complaining that it would be factchecked and demanding an apology over a contentious interview he gave the programme before the 2020 election. Calls from Trump to cancel broadcasters’ licences are not unprecedented. He issued a similar demand against ABC last month after it hosted his debate with Harris, widely regarded as a win for the vice-president. Trump and his supporters complained of unfair treatment, alleging that the debate’s moderators factchecked him while failing to subject Harris to similar scrutiny. Similar threats were made during his presidency, when he frequently denounced the media as “enemies of the people” and called for journalists to be jailed for refusing to reveal their sources. However, Rosenworcel, the FCC chair, said the latest threats should not go unchallenged and asserted that they amounted to an assault against the US constitution’s first amendment guaranteeing free speech. “While repeated attacks against broadcast stations by the former president may now be familiar, these threats against free speech are serious and should not be ignored,” she told the Hill. “The first amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy. The FCC does not and will not revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.”"

          "headline": "Republican Senate candidate’s hedge fund managed $415m in Russian debt",
          "bodyText": "David McCormick, the Republican candidate for US Senate in Pennsylvania, led the largest hedge fund in the world while it managed and advised funds holding hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian debt, documents obtained by the Guardian show. Filings with the US Department of Labor, known as form 5500s, show that from 2017 to 2021, Bridgewater Associates managed funds holding as much as $415m in Russian sovereign bonds. Since 2019 these types of investment have been subject to increasingly stringent US sanctions, in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Holding such assets is not illegal, but the question of McCormick’s work with foreign investments and how it might influence his political career has already coloured his current campaign, against the incumbent Democratic senator, Bob Casey. McCormick stepped down as Bridgewater CEO in 2022, in order to run for Congress and a month before Russia mounted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But sanctions were first levied three years before that when, according to the firm itself, as co-CEO from 2017 to 2020 and then as sole CEO, McCormick was responsible for “overseeing the firm’s strategy, governance, and operations”. McCormick himself has said about his time as Bridgewater boss: “Whatever we did I’m responsible for.” Sovereign bonds are issued by governments to raise money for operations, to pay debt, and for any other spending needs. They represent a major source of government financing. The value of Russian sovereign bonds managed by Bridgewater between 2017 and 2021 and listed on labor department 5500 forms fluctuated, standing at $415,207,202 in 2017; $234,982,243 in 2018; $36,557,325 in 2019; $80,553,252 in 2020; and $119,884,817 in 2021. Starting under Donald Trump and continuing under Joe Biden, the US imposed significant sanctions on Russian financial assets and institutions. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), sanctions now “restrict dealings with 80% of Russian banking sector assets”. The CRS adds: “The Biden administration expanded sanctions on Russian sovereign debt … including prohibiting US financial institutions from processing debt payments from the Russian government to foreign investors. As a result, Russia defaulted on its debt in June 2022.” Bridgewater’s links to Russia have proved persistently controversial. In 2017, founder Ray Dalio appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with Kirill Dmitriev, executive officer of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), and Igor Shuvalov, then first deputy prime minister. Referring to US responses to Russia’s election interference in support of Trump in 2016, Dalio said: “It would be better if the sanctions were lifted.” In 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that Dalio had met Vladimir Putin “several times in person”. In 2022, the US levied sanctions on Dmitriev and the RDIF, which the US treasury called “a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin … emblematic of Russia’s broader kleptocracy”. [See footnote]. On US shores, to Republicans seeking to retake the Senate, McCormick seems a good bet to take a prized swing state seat. Polling puts him behind Casey but the race is close. The two men recently debated. It is McCormick’s second Senate run, after losing the 2022 primary to the TV doctor Mehmet Oz. A controversial candidate who alienated some Pennsylvania voters, not least amid claims he actually lived in New Jersey, Oz lost to the Democrat John Fetterman. This year, McCormick has been dogged by reporting about his finances and whether he really lives in Connecticut. McCormick is a graduate of the US Military Academy and veteran of the first Gulf war, married to Dina Powell, a deputy national security adviser under Donald Trump. On foreign policy, he presents a hawkish aspect. Blaming Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for showing “our adversaries … a weakening America”, he says this has been seen “first in the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Then through an emboldened Russia waging war on Ukraine. And most recently in Israel, where Hamas launched an assault on the Israeli people with the support of Iran.” Contacted for comment about Bridgewater’s management of Russian investments, McCormick’s spokesperson, Elizabeth Gregory, said: “Given that countless public and private investors across the western world – including the pensions of Pennsylvania firefighters and police officers that [state] treasurer Bob Casey oversaw [between 2005 and 2007] – held Russian debt prior to its invasion of Ukraine, there’s nothing noteworthy here.” Nonetheless, news of McCormick’s old firm’s links to significant Russian funds may prompt awkward questions – as did previous reporting of connections between Bridgewater and China and Saudi Arabia. Casey recently told a crowd in Harrisburg: “While I was fighting for union rights and fighting for working families in Pennsylvania, [McCormick] was making a lot of money investing in China. He not only invested in Chinese companies, he invested in companies that built the Chinese military.” McCormick has said he has “been calling China a threat and adversary for more than 20 years. I’ve negotiated against the Chinese … as part of the national security team [as a deputy national security adviser under George W Bush] and I’m someone who’s had a vision for where we should take our relationship with China … “As the CEO of a large investment firm we invested 3% of our … portfolio in China. Most Americans have 30% of the products in their house manufactured in China. So I’ve laid out a vision for decoupling from China to make sure we’re not dependent on China for things like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.” He has also testified about China in Congress, saying the US should “provide clarity to the private sector on which investments and financial relationships in China are permitted and which are not. Private sector leaders who often lack deep understanding of the national security threat posed by the [Chinese Communist party] and who may be conflicted by near-term opportunities for growth there cannot and should not be left to navigate these choices on their own.” In the case of Saudi Arabia, in early 2020, amid international anger over the murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi ordered by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, it was reported that McCormick had urged that Bridgewater show loyalty to Riyadh. Analysts voiced concern. Last year, Ben Freeman, of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, told HuffPost: “The Saudi regime has made clear over and over again that it’s willing to use financial, economic, any sort of business incentive it has to garner influence over American politics. “So whenever we hear of anybody running for office, I think it’s imperative to know: Do they have business interests in Saudi? Have the Saudis invested in their business here? What sort of interactions have they had with Saudi lobbying or [public relations] firms? It’ll give [voters] a sense of how potentially vulnerable this person might be to Saudi influence.” Congress has attempted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia, over its war in Yemen. Freeman said: “If you’re a sitting senator and you have the opportunity to vote on stopping an arms sale but you know you have financial ties in Saudi Arabia, there’s a clear conflict of interest there.” McCormick did not comment to HuffPost. But if elected as a senator, he could be an influential voice on foreign policy. And earlier this year, after Congress overcame opposition from Trump to approve aid to Ukraine in its fight with Russia, McCormick said he would not have supported the deal. TaNisha Cameron, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Democratic party, said then: “David McCormick sold himself out to America’s adversaries at the expense of Pennsylvanians. When it comes time to stand up for our allies against Russia and China, McCormick has shown once again that he is only out for himself and his bottom line.” • Footnote added 16 October 2024: Following publication the RDIF contacted the Guardian to say: “Since its inception RDIF has received numerous domestic and international professional awards recognizing its role as one of the world’s leading and innovative investment funds. The only reason for imposition of sanctions against RDIF articulated by the US Department of the Treasury was “for being owned or controlled by, or for acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of Russia.”"

          "bodyText": "A Turkish Airlines flight from Seattle to Istanbul made an emergency landing at New York’s John F Kennedy airport after its 59-year-old captain died mid-flight. Flight 8JK, an Airbus A350-900, landed around 6am, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, after initial medical intervention to help the man who had lost consciousness onboard proved ineffective. A co-pilot took over the plane and successfully landed it. The dead pilot has been identified as Ilcehin Pehlivan. Turkish Airlines told NBC News that it had employed him since 2007 and he last had a routine health check in March when no health issues that would affect his duties were found. “As Turkish Airlines, we deeply feel the loss of our captain and extend our sincerest condolences to his bereaved family, colleagues, and all his loved ones,” the airline said in a statement. The airline said arrangements are being made for passengers to return to Istanbul out of JFK. The FAA requires two crew members in the cockpit at all times and pilots over 40 are required by the agency to get two physical examinations a year. In 2015, an American Airlines pilot died after becoming ill on an overnight red-eye flight from Phoenix to Boston."

          "headline": "Rejoice! The charade of having to change our passwords every few months is coming to an end",
          "bodyText": "Over the past decade or so, people have accumulated a vast array of logins for dozens of sites and apps, as more of our work and home lives moves on to the internet. That’s why it has never made sense that so many IT departments have belligerently insisted on maintaining a major hurdle to password management. Namely, the need to change passwords regularly. It’s a familiar scenario. You arrive at the office and need to log on to your company laptop quickly, before your morning meeting. But speed is not going to be of the essence today, because an annoying prompt has appeared: you need to change your password. Thank goodness, then, for new US government guidance, which suggests an end to requiring such mandatory password resets. Previously, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommended organisations enforce password expiration every 365 days, but now it says this is not necessary at all – unless a password has been compromised in a breach. It’s another nail in the coffin for the practice, which is no longer recommended by organisations including the US Federal Trade Commission, Microsoft and the UK’s National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) – which has advised against regularly changing passwords since 2015. Indeed, NIST is only just catching up with the general consensus as people’s digital footprints reach unmanageable levels, leading to a pile-up of passwords that are difficult enough to remember, let alone change. The issue with changing passwords regularly is easy to imagine, especially at work. You want to get into a required website, you are in a rush, you’re not feeling at your most creative – and frankly, you don’t care what you need to do to log in. What was once “password1” becomes “password2” and once you’ve accessed the site successfully, you forget all about it. Attackers know these patterns, so if they were able to work out your old password, they’ll also be able to guess your new one. “It’s one of those counterintuitive security scenarios; the more often users are forced to change passwords, the greater the overall vulnerability to attack,” says Emma W, people-centred security lead at the UK’s NCSC. “Attackers can often work out the new password if they have the old one. And users, forced to change another password, will often choose a weaker one that they won’t forget.” And studies reveal that in general people are still using usernames or passwords that are too simple, despite warnings from government and the industry. A recent report by the cybersecurity experts Redcentric suggests that one in five people use just one or two passwords to access all of their online log-ins. If people are terrible at choosing passwords in the first place, changing them isn’t going to fix the problem. An annual study by the password manager company NordPass reveals the most common and therefore easy to crack credentials each year, and the same ones regularly come up. As well as the expected “password1” and “1234567”, people often revert to using favourite football teams or celebrity names. Tech giants know that passwords are a flawed system, so they’ve started to make changes to get rid of them altogether, including industry initiatives such as the FIDO Alliance. These aim to push users towards biometrics such as Apple’s Face ID and Touch ID, and even physical tokens such as the Yubico YubiKey, but at the moment, they’re in addition to passwords, rather than instead of them. So what about passwords themselves? Should we be choosing a complex array of numbers and letters and unique characters to make up our logins? Apparently not. Experts, including NIST, now say it’s far better to use something you can remember. According to the latest guidelines, passwords should be at least eight characters – preferably more like 15 – up to a maximum of 64. So what about an obscure but memorable song lyric, or a line from a book you love (just don’t use A Tale of Two Cities; it’s too obvious). Or better still, the NCSC recommends using three random words to create a password that will be “long enough and strong enough” to protect your accounts. But if you’re thinking of changing certain characters in your password – swapping the letter “o” with a zero, for example – the NCSC warns that cyber-criminals know these tricks too. “Your password won’t be significantly stronger, but it will be harder for you to remember,” the NCSC says. So what should people do? First, pay attention to the NCSC and NIST guidance as these institutions really know the latest research on security, which can help in your personal password choices. At work, you should follow the advice of your IT department and perhaps make them aware of NCSC and NIST guidelines if they aren’t already. The NIST guidelines mark a shift away from the rigid views of the past. The US helps set the standard for the tech world, and they are saying it’s more realistic to meet people where they are, accepting they have different levels of technical ability, which should ultimately help make everyone more secure.

          "bodyText": "I am Tara Boom; I work in cabarets and circuses. I juggle things with my feet and I do a stupid act where I place a popcorn machine atop my head, pour corn kernels into it, plug myself into 420 volts and hope for the best, all while hula hooping and getting creative with dairy-free spread and a salt shaker. OK OK … Now to the rest of it. I was embarrassingly stumped when I was invited to write this, as funny is so subjective. But the prompt is what I find funny. So, HA! Kiss my butt and welcome to my mind sweet Guardian readers. Take a seat behind my eyes, snuggle up into the couch of my cortex and enjoy (or don’t). 1. Isabella Rossellini has sex as a praying mantis The best thing about Isabella Rossellini’s Green Porno videos is there’s so many of them! Hilarious, eccentric and heavily stylised. The temptation for this list to be composed entirely of the mating habits of insects recreated through puppetry was unbelievably strong. But my limited self-control prevailed. Also, I fucking adore praying mantises! Like many women I have a lot of rage and there is something very cathartic about watching a female bite the head off a man. 2. Werner Herzog reading AI poetry on This American Life This segment in a 2024 episode of This American Life contains absolutely terrifying and unsettling poetry written by Chat GPT precursor code-davinci-002 about the experience of being AI. This started playing in my ears as I was passing through Texan airport security machines after I thought it was best to munch down on my remaining magic mushrooms. It is narrated by legendary German film-maker Werner Herzog – do I need to say more? It was harrowing! 10/10, would recommend. 3. Michel Lauziere – Horn This is the video that changed my life; I was 15 years old and was just starting to perform. Watching Michel Lauziere’s act opened my eyes to the limitless idea of what performance could be. A man in an orange boiler suit strapped with honky horns performs an absurdist musical piece using his body. I love art that makes you question why, and the answer is “Because why not?” I am a big fan of “why not”. If we all did a bit more “why not”, the world would be much more beautiful. 4. Butter sculptures Not only are these beautiful and impressive pieces of art in such a delicious medium, but the more you learn about butter sculptures the funnier it gets. Did you know there was also a golden age of butter sculpting? No? Well, there was: 1890-1930. It even dates to ancient Tibetan monks. Contemporary butter sculptures are mainly showcased at state fairs across the US, and range from butter recreations of the Last Supper to presidential candidates (who are much more palatable in butter form than reality). The next time you are feeling a little blue, close your eyes and remember that someone right now is carving a life-sized cow out of butter. You are welcome. 5. Australian PM Tony Abbott winks during sex-line worker call on radio show Oh no. This should not be funny, why am I laughing? Here is the prime minister being caught throwing a wink when on a live radio call with a pensioner with health issues who says she works on a phone sex line to make ends meet. What is it with the men in control of our countries who seem to show complete incapacity to control themselves? Parallels can be made with former New Zealand prime minister John Key pulling ponytails, or even Trump’s pussy-grabbing comments. But why is this funny? Is it the fact these ball sacks have been finally caught doing something disgusting? 6. Kazoo orchestra does Pachelbel’s Canon Q. What is funnier than one Kazoo? A. Multiple Kazoos. Real-time audio from inside my brain. Truly hits its stride midway. 7. The Furby organ OK OK, in compiling this list I’ve realised I might have a bit of an affinity with obnoxious sounds and people spending an insane amount of time and effort on the ridiculous. This man is a genius and the harbinger of nightmares. He has dismantled, soldered and reimagined hundreds of Furbys into a monstrosity of an instrument. Building on a wonderfully unpalatable fad toy of the 90s, which I loved and I suspect my family murdered (my older sister remembers surreptitiously removing batteries), the Furby organ brings a whole new meaning to deranged. 8. Flamingos in a bathroom during a hurricane God I’m a sucker for anthropomorphism. These flamingos look like they’re in a dingy club bathroom swapping lip gloss, gossiping about the hot bartender and doing cocaine off each other’s tail feathers. Yes, this article about how this picture isn’t funny explains why the flamingos in a bathroom are actually canaries in a coalmine in this ol’ climate collapse we are in. But I’m going to argue this is why humour is so important! We have become desensitised and avoidant of bad news, but a hilarious image or joke can lure us in. Laughter is a great tool to knock off the blinders we have so intently strapped to our heads, allowing us to re-engage with our impending doom. Flamingos in a bathroom … hilarious. 9. People trying to sell mirrors I never realised how hard it is to sell a secondhand mirror. What are you supposed to do? Unless you’re a Photoshop expert or vampire you’re inevitably going to be in the snap. There are many of these mirror threads on the internet and some people get pretty darn creative. Inventive stupidity restores my faith in humans. I like this a lot. 10. Benedict Cumberbatch reads a hilarious letter of apology to a hotel An apology letter to a hotel. Spoiler alert: it includes sausages, open windows and seagulls. This letter is so descriptive, and you constantly think the story is at its climax, but it keeps going and going. I love the Letters Live YouTube channel. So many incredible stories on here. Some make me cry, such as Tom Hiddleston reading Gerald Durrell’s letter to his future wife Lee McGeorge. And some you just laugh and laugh, like Taika Waititi’s letter about a speeding ticket. The stupidity in the detail is delicious. Tara Boom appears in La Clique from 10 October to 17 November at the Sydney Opera House."

          "bodyText": "Earlier this year, Anna, a Jewish woman in her mid-30s, put a single watermelon emoji in a prompt on her Hinge profile – a symbolic indicator of solidarity with the Palestinian people. Not long after, a man she assumed was also Jewish matched with her and asked what the watermelon meant. “When I responded, he immediately unmatched me,” she said. The only thing she could think to do was laugh. The war in Gaza, which is stretching into its second year and has killed more than 43,000 people, has influenced every aspect of American life – from college campuses to workplaces, family dinners to the conversation at synagogues and mosques. In the US, where the conflict pulls on deep-rooted allegiances and senses of identity, diverging views have put an undeniable strain on intimate relationships – including even the most nascent of romantic connections. Single people in the US who spoke to the Guardian, both Jewish and Muslim, said the events of the last year had deepened their connections to their religious and ethnic identities, bringing them closer to their communities. But it also left them more polarized and less likely to forge relationships with – or even have conversations with – people with opposing views on Gaza. Even those dating within their own religion said they struggled at times to find people whose views on, or passion about, the war and its repercussions matched theirs. “Everything about dating is hard,” Anna said. “[But] differences that maybe a year ago may have been difficult to navigate … feel much bigger now.” Ari, a graduate student in his late 20s, is a Jewish man who probably would have swiped left on someone like Anna. Though the admission troubles him, he said the events of the last year had made him more intent on dating someone who shares not only his religion, but also his views on Israel: critical of the rightwing government, but still “passionately Zionist”. Lately, he’s noticed himself swiping past people he might have otherwise found attractive, because he assumes they won’t share his stance. “I can feel that I’m being less nuanced [in my thinking], and I still am unable to lift myself out of this hole because I’m in pain,” he said. The war has exacerbated this tension within the Jewish community in the US, some of whom believe their Judaism requires them to support Israel, and others who believe Jews have a responsibility to be more outspoken against Israeli violence. (Jewish anti-Zionist groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace have led some of the largest anti-Israel demonstrations in the last year.) Ari said the debates and protests of the last year had made him feel “really judged by and uncomfortable around anti-Zionists”, including other Jews, and he was anxious about facing that judgment in his romantic life. “I don’t want to have to defend the most core parts of my identity in my most intimate relationships,” he said. Hoda Abrahim, a Muslim matchmaker from Houston, Texas, said she had worked with thousands of Muslim singles over the past 10 years, from many different cultures and backgrounds. Many of them already wanted to marry someone from the same country of origin, she said, but in the last year, that had become non-negotiable for many of her Palestinian clients. “A majority of my Palestinian clients will be like, ‘You know, I used to be open, but actually now I just want somebody from Palestine,’” she said. “A lot of them are dealing with family members getting killed or their homes destroyed, and they want to be able to connect over that with their life partner. They kind of feel like there’s something missing if they don’t have these shared experiences.” Clients who previously did not think much about their heritage are now “really leaning into it”, she said, telling her: “I want the shared common language, I want the shared food that we cook in our home.’” But even for those who do find a partner who shares their religion and culture, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll be aligned on their views about Gaza. The lawyer and writer Tahirah Nailah Dean, a 29-year-old Muslim woman from Oakland, had been married to her husband for just over a year when the war broke out. She was crying nearly every day, she said, and protesting in person and on social media, while her husband – also a Muslim – seemed largely unaffected. Soon after, he told her he wanted a divorce. His reasons were largely unrelated to their reactions to the war, but for Dean, “it was really devastating, because for ever the end of the marriage is going to be coupled with this new waging of genocide of my brothers and sisters in Palestine,” she said. “It’ll never be disconnected from that.” Looking back, Dean said, it had been clear their differing responses to the war were a sign of conflicting values. “When I do start to date again, it’s going to be someone that goes out into the streets and is actually doing something to bring attention to issues like this,” she said. “Me and my friend circle, we’re not interested in someone who’s going to be passive about this.” Shahzad Younas, the founder of the Muslim dating app Muzz, said the war had also changed the tenor of conversation on the app – so much so that it drove him to launch a social media platform inside it earlier this year, where members can discuss their opinions without necessarily looking for love. “There wasn’t really a space online for Muslims,” he said. “For us, providing that space for people to be able to talk and learn about [the war] is super important.” A woman had recently posted a thread on the social platform about meeting a Muslim man who “wasn’t empathizing with the Palestinian cause”, he said. “For her, it was a bit of a dealbreaker.” Some Jewish dating apps are also seeing an increase in users, with the members-only app Lox Club telling the Guardian it had seen more than 1m matches on its platform this year – more than twice as many as the year before. “We have a lot of anecdotes around people valuing finding a Jewish partner more than ever, because they ‘get it’,” the app’s founder, Austin Kevitch, said in an email. “And extra pressure from Jewish parents for their kids to marry Jewish now more than ever.” While dating apps provide an easy way to filter by religion or political belief, they’re also a clunky medium for addressing a sprawling international conflict. Talking about the subject on apps like Bumble and Hinge – the domain of smiling selfies and enthusiasm for the cold side of the pillow and the New York Times crossword – can feel jarring. There’s a sense that the apps, with their limited character counts and pithy prompts, can flatten views on the subject, leaving those who choose to address it on their profiles seeming one-sided and without nuance. Ari said he was not a fan of Zionists with pro-Israel messages in their profiles: “I kind of resent that they choose to express their beliefs that way,” he said. Still, he acknowledged that anyone who expresses pro-Palestinian views on their profile would also be “an immediate swipe left – I hope not because I’m judging them for their beliefs, but because I’m positive that they will judge me for mine.” Another Jewish man, who described himself as largely pro-Palestinian, said his reaction depended on the potential match’s tone. “It’s like, ‘Can you express yourself and let people know where you are – and where you’d like them to be – without making it look like you’ve forgotten you’re on a dating app?’” he said. But for others the war is simply impossible to ignore, even in dating. “This time is really painful and horrifying to me, so when you get on the apps and have to be like, ‘Hey just chillin’, how are you?’ it feels really inauthentic,” Anna said. And some feel stating their views loudly and proudly on the apps acts as a kind of filter, weeding out those whose beliefs would be a non-starter. Sanya, a 29-year-old living in Phoenix, Arizona, was born in Pakistan and raised Muslim, and is passionately pro-Palestine. She has tried out Muslim dating apps, but said it was hard to find connections there because of her more westernized, less traditional lifestyle. “I think a lot of Muslim people look down on how I practice my religion because I don’t fit into the stereotype that they want me to,” she said. Because of this, Sanya tends to frequent secular apps like Hinge, where she can meet Muslim and non-Muslim men who better match her lifestyle. In these multicultural spaces, however, she feels the need to be more explicit about her views on Palestine. After getting out of a long-term relationship with a man that ended, in part, because of his ambivalence toward the situation in Gaza, she updated one of her Hinge profile prompts to read: “Let’s make sure we’re on the same page about Israel being a terrorist state.” Sanya said she wasn’t worried about people on the apps judging her for the stance. “My profile also says I’m Muslim,” she said. “If you can’t read those two things and put them together and understand that this is an issue that’s very personal to me, and you’re going to say I don’t want to give this person a chance because they’re very forthright about their feelings on this, then you’re rejecting a part of my identity.” She added: “I’m not worried about not getting [those] matches, because that’s not my person.” That’s why Anna, who was raised in a Zionist household but is now deeply involved in pro-Palestinian Jewish activism, said she wasn’t too concerned about being unmatched over the watermelon emoji in her Hinge bio. “I wouldn’t have wanted to go on a date with that person anyway,” she said. “For me, what this is all about is: are you curious? Are you self-reflective? Do you care about injustice and are you willing to engage in these tough subjects, even if that might be painful for you?” She added: “That’s what I would be looking for in a partner anyways.” Some people interviewed asked for their names to be changed The image in this article was replaced on 9 October 2024 to include a wider range of screenshots from dating apps."

          "headline": "La Máquina review – Gael García Bernal’s boxing drama feels like it was written by bashing random keys",
          "bodyText": "La Máquina has all the tools to be a roaringly entertaining comedy thriller. It unites Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna, so effective together in Y Tu Mama Tambien and a handful of other movies, for the first time on the small screen, as an ageing boxing champion and his beloved but deeply dodgy manager. Few duos are better at playing best pals competing to see who is the more lovable screw-up. Episode one is indeed a riot, dominated by Luna as Andy, a showboating pillock who bluffs through every moment of every day. Clearly addicted to cosmetic surgery – he is described with cruel accuracy as “condom-faced” – and happy to sport a cravat with wet-look hair, his default term of endearment for anyone he speaks to is “asshole” and his motivation is always to earn bigger bucks. At home, however, he is burdened with a wife who is desperate for a child Andy can’t provide and a mother whose close relationship with her son really is much too close. “Only two men have known how to touch me: you and your father,” she says as he dutifully gives her a foot massage. Andy is a juicy creation, played by Luna with a comic relish not quite matched by Garcia Bernal as the sporting “machine” of the title. Esteban “La Máquina” Osuna, as he describes himself, is a legendary welterweight now rapidly declining. We don’t see the bout he is about to compete in when we first meet him, against a younger, faster challenger: instead we smash-cut from the hoopla of his grand arena entrance to him lolling in a neck brace in the back of an ambulance, asking Andy whether or not he won. Later on, when a doctor asks if Esteban has noticed any cognitive decline, such as seeing or hearing things, Esteban lies and says no. In fact, he has been having strange visions that point to the cracks in his psyche. Once we learn that Andy is not just a Mexican Del Boy but is properly corrupt and has been fixing Estaban’s bouts for some time, the thriller storyline emerges. Andy has scored Esteban a lucrative tilt at the unified world welterweight title, but a sinister organisation demands that he throw the match. It becomes clear that these mysterious baddies have frightening power when they issue their ultimatum by taking over the lyric prompt in the karaoke bar where Andy and Esteban are celebrating their latest ill-deserved victory, replacing the song words with a message: Esteban loses, or both of you will be killed. So far so good, but by the second or third episode of six, La Máquina has punched itself out. Eiza González is much too good for the role of Irasema, a tired caricature of the patient ex-wife: her marriage to Esteban– the father of her children – may not have worked out due to his twin obsessions of boxing and partying, not to mention his loyalty to Andy, a man to whom Irasema is forever having to issue world-weary tellings-off; but by heck she still loves Esteban and, handily, she is also an investigative journalist whose late father was looking into boxing corruption before he died. That’s one of several story strands that gets forgotten about as La Mâquina focuses far too much on Esteban’s mid-life masculinity crisis. The tendency his visions have to form an unsophisticated running commentary on the action worsens as we slide towards the sadly inevitable hallucination/flashback where all his problems are explained via a tableau of him as a young boy. This will match so exactly with what you’ve predicted, you may groan out loud. Meanwhile, the bad guys are conveniently omnipotent but vague with it, allowing La Máquina to add conspiracy-drama overtones to its already chaotic mix. A scene where a potentially important character is introduced, opens their mouth to deliver some earth-shattering revelation, but is then shot in the head by an unseen assassin is a sign of writing that has lost the run of itself and started pushing buttons at random. Much as Andy and Esteban long for glory days that may never have been all that glorious, La Máquina is never as much fun as that freewheeling opening episode. Even Garcia Bernal and Luna struggle to follow through on what seems like a classic bromance between two old soldiers tending each other’s self-inflicted wounds. They’re surrounded by too many storytelling elements that fail to work for any profundity or chemistry to evolve. La Máquina bursts with energy at the beginning, but in the end it’s just tiring. • La Máquina is on Disney+ now."

          "bodyText": "A man shot by police in Wentworthville in Sydney last week after an alleged car theft has died, NSW police said. Two men were shot by police after officers were called to the scene at about 12.10pm on Friday, responding to a report of a stolen car in a Wentworthville car park in Sydney’s west. The officers fired their guns at the vehicle after it was allegedly driven at them. The pair were discovered as a result of an in-vehicle tracker which led police to the car with the assistance of its owner, later confirmed to be the husband of the Labor MP for Penrith, Karen McKeown. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Officers then rendered first aid to the two men until the arrival of NSW Ambulance paramedics, police said. The men were transported to Westmead hospital, where a 26-year-old man was in a “very serious” condition on Friday afternoon and the second, a 34-year-old man, was in a serious but stable condition. NSW police said the 26-year-old man died in hospital on Wednesday. Police said the five officers on the scene were not injured in the incident. Three shot their firearms and were assisting police with their inquiries. A critical incident team from the state crime command’s homicide squad is investigating the incident and the investigation is also subject to an independent review. In a statement on Friday after the incident, McKeown alleged her home was broken into on Thursday evening and her husband’s car was stolen. She said she reported the incident to the police. “While I am shaken from the events, thankfully I am unharmed,” she said. “I want to thank NSW police, in particular the local area command at both Penrith and Cumberland police for their prompt response. “Political leaders often praise police for their bravery. Today, I have had a first-hand experience of this.”"

          "bodyText": "Al Pacino has revealed he almost died from Covid-19 in 2020, saying he “didn’t have a pulse” for several minutes. In interviews with the New York Times and People magazine published on the weekend, the 84-year-old Godfather and Scarface actor detailed his experience with the virus, which he contracted in 2020 before a vaccine was available. “They said my pulse was gone. It was so – you’re here, you’re not. I thought: Wow, you don’t even have your memories. You have nothing. Strange porridge,” Pacino told the New York Times. The actor said he “felt not good – unusually not good”, and recalled having a fever and dehydration before losing consciousness. “I was sitting there in my house, and I was gone. Like that. I didn’t have a pulse,” he said. An ambulance arrived and he woke up to a medical team in his living room including six paramedics and two doctors. “They had these outfits on that looked like they were from outer space or something,” he said. “It was kind of shocking to open your eyes and see that. Everybody was around me, and they said: ‘He’s back. He’s here.’” Speaking to People, Pacino questioned whether he had actually died, despite a nurse confirming his lack of pulse. “I thought I experienced death. I might not have … I don’t think I died. Everybody thought I was dead. How could I be dead? If I was dead, I fainted.” The Oscar winner told the New York Times he “didn’t see the white light or anything” and that “there’s nothing there” after death – though the experience did prompt some existential reflection. “As Hamlet says, ‘To be or not to be’; ‘The undiscovered country from whose bourn, no traveler returns.’ And he says two words: ‘No more’. It was no more. You’re gone. I’d never thought about it in my life,” Pacino said. “But you know actors: it sounds good to say I died once. What is it when there’s no more?” When asked by People whether his brush with death had changed how he lives, he replied: “Not at all.” Pacino details the experience in his upcoming memoir, Sonny Boy. His latest movie – titled Modì, Three Days on the Wing of Madness – premiered last week at the 72nd San Sebastián film festival."

          "bodyText": "In her first year of culinary school, Reanna Bryan, 18, was told her braided hairstyle was not suitable for the kitchen. “I was like, ‘What do you mean, you can’t have braids or dreads?’ because this is what I wear. My hair is in braids the majority of the time,” she says. When she shared her experience with the young woman’s circle she is a member of at Rise.365, a community support group based in Hackney, similar stories were echoed back. “Straight hair is the norm,” she says, “and [afro hair] is just not represented.” This discussion spiralled into an idea for a campaign to tackle one area with poor representation of afro hairstyles: emojis. There are 3,790 emojis, among them mermaids, vampires and an afro pick comb, but none feature afro hairstyles typically worn by Black people. “It’s sad and disappointing because it’s just showing how we [Black people] are not really seen in a bright light, because you’ve got a blond or ginger girl, and you haven’t got just a simple girl with an afro, braids or anything like that,” Bryan says. For Amina Gray, a youth mentor and facilitator at Rise.365, this is exactly why the campaign is important. “Black people, and women in particular, tend to have so many different hairstyles but none of these are represented. “We need to normalise that our hair – whether it’s in its natural state or it’s in a protective hairstyle – is acceptable … is professional.” To address the imbalance, Bryan and other young members of the group were asked to design emojis with common hairstyles worn by Black people. “I asked all of our young people to draw something that either reflects them or an emoji they would like to see on the keyboard,” Gray says. The group whittled it down to the four they felt best reflected the array of hairstyles in the community – braids, afro, locs and cornrows. “I always wear braids so I thought ‘let’s do braids’ because obviously that represents me. It’s like a protective hairstyle and you can have it in different ways – long, short, coloured,” Bryan says. Vanita Brown, a junior designer at Good Relations PR, helped bring the sketches to life. “Most emojis tend to reflect the majority. I feel that Black and mixed-race hairstyles weren’t prioritised in the initial designs because the creators didn’t necessarily consider or prioritise the diversity of Black hairstyles.” Proposals for new emojis can be submitted to the Unicode Consortium, which sets standards for digital typography, but only a fraction are accepted for encoding. The group will submit the designs in April. In 2019, Rhianna Jones submitted an official afro hair emoji proposal with more than 65,000 signatures from an online petition. However, it was declined on the basis that the “curly hair emoji was designed to reflect a variety of hairstyles”. That year, submissions for bubble tea and the dotted line face were accepted and released as emojis. Brown says Unicode relies heavily on proposals and feedback, such as how often terms relating to the submission are used in Google searches, to make decisions about future emojis. “This is why we’re working with Rise.365 to rally enough support to encourage Unicode to add these new emojis. Every [Google] search for the phrase ‘afro hair’ helps to make these emojis a reality.” The campaign is an opportunity to prompt discussions about hair representation and discrimination more broadly, not just emojis, Gray says. “The four we have designed are just the start. [The campaign] is a teaching opportunity. I don’t want people to think we just want emojis because we want to be represented that way. It’s because there’s a much deeper message behind it, about empowering people and helping people realise that their hair is beautiful.” Why is it important for Bryan? “My young siblings will be able to see an emoji that looks like them,” she says. “If this works, we’re actually gonna change history.”"

          "headline": "Doubts grow over Labour’s VAT plan for private schools",
          "bodyText": "Government plans to impose VAT on private schools from 1 January next year may have to be delayed because of warnings from unions, tax experts and school leaders that meeting the deadline will cause administrative chaos and teacher job losses, and put pressure on the state sector. The Treasury on Saturday night refused to confirm that the plan to impose 20% VAT on private school fees would go ahead from 1 January, as confirmed by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in July, instead saying it would be introduced “as soon as possible”. Later, however, after publication of this story, the Treasury changed its line and said it was planning to stick by the 1 January deadline. Numerous organisations in the education sector, including ones that back the principle of imposing VAT, are calling for a delay until next September to give private schools more time to register for the new tax, assess the impact and adapt. There are also concerns about the effect on the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) sector if more state schools have to carry out Send assessments on pupils moving over from private schools. Leaders of private schools say they are still unable to register for VAT because the plans are not yet enshrined in law and will not be until after the budget on 30 October. Accountants and tax experts says this will be too little time for organisations, often with little tax expertise, to adapt. Bills for the term starting in January are normally sent out in December. Doubts about the timetable are being raised after the Treasury was bombarded with calls for a delay and demands to carry out a proper impact assessment in the responses to an official consultation, which ended last month. The NASUWT teaching union said in its response that while it shares the government’s ambition to “break down the barriers to opportunity” and to recruit 6,500 more teachers to the state sector, it is worried about redundancies for those in the private sector and the risk of a permanent loss of jobs from the profession. It suggests that an impact assessment should be carried out on the possible increase in Send assessments in the state sector and the level of provision needed. It says: “We request that a more reasonable timeframe is proposed in order to implement the change fairly and without excessive disruption for teachers, pupils and parents.” The Association of School and College Leaders says in its submission: “We would strongly recommend that the government undertakes and publishes a comprehensive impact assessment and a full consultation on these proposals before they are formalised in legislation, and that it delays their implementation until September 2025 at the earliest.” While the government is not considering the watering down of the plan’s content, any delay would be an embarrassment for the Treasury, which has already made clear it is reconsidering parts of Labour’s manifesto plan to scrap non-dom tax status over worries that the reforms will bring in less money than expected. There is concern that planned changes on tax arrangements for non-doms, which aimed to raise extra money to spend on public services such as the NHS, could prompt wealthy foreigners to simply leave the UK. The VAT plan for private school was, like that for non-doms and their tax arrangements, one of Labour’s more eye-catching policies, which it said would help pay for new teachers, as well as free breakfast clubs in all primary schools. Asked whether the plans could be delayed, the Treasury issued a statement from a government spokesman that did not address the question directly: “We want to ensure all children have the best chance in life to succeed. Ending tax breaks on private schools will help to raise the revenue needed to fund our education priorities for next year, such as recruiting 6,500 new teachers. “The government has carefully considered representations on this policy and will publish a response to the consultation at the budget.” Sources said only that the plans would be introduced “as soon as possible”. In its submission to the Treasury consultation, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the leading professional UK body on aspects of taxation, said: “We are concerned that neither HMRC [HM Revenue and Customs] nor the private schools will be ready to implement the change in VAT liability effectively with a commencement date of 1 January 2025. “As there is currently no tax information and impact note or published guidance, with an implementation date of 1 January 2025 that is effectively shortened by schools closing mid-December, we recommend that the implementation date be delayed accordingly.” The Association of Taxation Technicians said: “The proposed commencement date of 1 January does not give sufficient time for schools or HMRC to adequately prepare and deliver the proposed changes. Commencing partway through an academic year could also introduce additional difficulties for schools and pupils. Consideration should be given to deferring commencement to September 2025.” Julie Robinson, chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, said: “Even those who are in favour of imposing VAT on the independent sector are saying that January 1 is not feasible.” • This article, first published on 5 October 2024, was amended on 6 October 2024 to reflect that, after publication, the Treasury said that it would be sticking to its original 1 January 2025 deadline for the imposition of VAT on private school fees."

Another day of misery for Gary O’Neil is complete: the substitute Fabio Carvalho has scored Brentford’s fifth. Championship The Plymouth manager Wayne Rooney has been sent off, and we should all look forward to hearing what he said to merit this particular punishment. By hook or by crook, Arsenal keep winning football matches. Bukayo Saka has finished Southampton off with a crisp first-time finish. Fulham won’t go quietly. The substitute Rodrigo Muniz has made it 3-2 at the Emirates; he was given a lot of time to collect Reiss Nelson’s cross, turn and ping the ball into the roof of the net. It might have taken a deflection. Championship Joe Rankin-Costello has scored a late equaliser for Blackburn at Plymouth. Meanwhile… The top of the table as things stand The substitution Jeremy Doku seals an important if nervy victory for the champions. It was all his own work. He cut inside from the left, shuffled past Castagne and hammered a rising drive that flew into the centre of the goal. Bernd Leno seemed to run past the ball so maybe it moved in the air.

Your prompt attention in this matter would be most appreciated.” Never mind conceding goals: trying to decipher that second sentence of yours almost gave me palpitations. Man City 2-1 Fulham “If Traore could finish,” says Michael Dawson of Fulham’s Adama Traore on Soccer Saturday, “they’d be winning five.” “Particularly without Odegaard, I just don’t see Arsenal mounting an actual challenge at the sharp end for the title,” says Dave Watton. “When was the last time they did, 2005?” Well they did take it to the last day of last season. I think they’ll go the distance again this year. 70 min: Arsenal 2-1 Southampton There was a long VAR check on the Arsenal goal but it has been given. The question was whether Mikel Merino, who was in an offside position, tried to head the ball before it reached Martinelli. I can see both sides! Moyes out!

Scottish Premiership James Humphries’ reverse curse is working: Apostolos Stamatelopoulos has put Motherwell 1-0 up at Hibs. Yeah, Southampton scored too early. Kai Havertz has scored for the fourth game in a row to bring Arsenal level at the Emirates. Downes’ lazy pass was intercepted by Partey, who fed the ball quickly into Havertz on the edge of the D. He moved the ball onto his left foot and lasered a shot off the inside of the post and into the net. Ramsdale had no chance. Cameron Archer has put Southampton ahead at the Emirates! Fernandes released him on the left wing with an early crossfield pass. Archer cut inside, stood Saliba (I think) up and guided a low shot into the far corner. Excellent finish. They’ve scored too early, haven’t they. “I think you’re right about the extreme specificity of the defensive midfielder role,” says Phil Podolsky. “It’s hardly a coincidence that Spanish football’s two great DMs this century were coached by Guardiola. During Sergio Busquets’s long twilight at Barcelona he kept hearing that he should be shifted forward to the Xavi role because he no longer has the athleticism for defensive duties, yet he kept saying it can’t be done, the body shape you need to adopt when you receive the ball is too different!” Yeah, and I guess the role is even more specific in a Pep team. West Ham are heading for their first home win under Julen Lopetegui. Michail Antonio forced the goalkeeper into a desperate clearance that was collected on the right wing by Bowen. He moved into the area and threaded a lovely left-foot shot into the far corner. 49 min: Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Mateus Fernandes has missed a really good chance to give Southampton an unlikely lead. RODRI WHO? Mateo Kovacic has scored a beautiful second goal to put City ahead. Foden’s cross was controlled by Bernardo Silva, who teed up the onrushing Kovacic on the edge of the D. He skilfully ignored Berge’s challenge and swept an emphatic shot past Bernd Leno. “Need Rodri?” sniffs Zach Neeley. “Pep’s teams don’t need anyone! The whole endeavour is to prevent needing any one player. The players don’t even need to decide what to do, Pep scripts that for them. He is a rock, he is an island. I think I have him figured out now, Pep and Paul Simon even both like cable knits.” GOAL! Leverkusen 2-2 Holstein Kiel (Arp 69 pen) Long afternoon my foot! Jann-Fiete Arp’s penalty has equalised for the bottom club Kiel, who were 2-0 down after eight minutes at Leverkusen Bundesliga Julian Ryerson has given Dortmund a sniff away to Union Berlin. They trail 2-1 with around 20 minutes to play. “For some reason,” says Stephen Cottrell, “your admission that you hadn’t seen the chance in the West Ham game reminded me of Alan Partridge not having seen Driving Miss Daisy, or indeed Bangkok Chick Boys.” Diverting stuff as always in the Premier League. These are the half-time scores. Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 4-2 Wolves Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Man City 1-1 Fulham West Ham 2-1 Ipswich Wolves can’t stop conceding goals. Ethan Pinnock, weirdly unmarked at a corner, has headed powerfully past Sam Johnstone to put Brentford 4-2 ahead. Mohammed Kudus gives West Ham a deserved lead just before half-time. Michail Antonio’s header hit the underside of the crossbar and Kudus hung in the air for an age to head past Arijanet Muric. The top of the Premier League table (as it stands) 43 min: Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Even though Arsenal have dominated throughout, Aaron Ramsdale hasn’t had a save to make. Yet. West Ham 1-1 Ipswich Two near misses for West Ham: Mohammed Kudus hits the post when he should have scored*, then Tomas Soucek has a shot cleared off the line. * Allegedly, I haven’t seen it Man City 1-1 Fulham “I made this point earlier, but for a top side to not have a ready-made replacement for a key player - or even one that can do 90 per cent of the role - and have to use a squarer peg in the round hole left, is bordering on negligent, doubly so if you have almost unlimited oil wealth behind you,” says Andy Flintoff. Maybe the problem is that, because it’s such a specific role, the back up is unlikely to start more than 10 games a season when Rodri is fit, and anyone worth a damn won’t settle for that. There aren’t many top-class No6s who can also play another role. Declan Rice I guess, and City did go for him didn’t they? I still The latest scores in our featured games Premier League Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 3-2 Wolves Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Man City 1-1 Fulham West Ham 1-1 Ipswich Bundesliga Leverkusen 2-1 Holstein Kiel (2.30pm) Union Berlin 2-0 Dortmund (2.30pm) “﻿It can only be a matter of time,” begins Simon McMahon, “before James didn’t he say he was working Humphries mentions the 1991 Scottish Cup final. I still break out in a rash just thinking about it. Although 1987 was worse.” Who needs that lumpen galoot Rodri? His replacement Mateo Kovacic has equalised for City, rapping a deflected (I think) shot past Bernd Leno after a corner was only half cleared. 30 min: Man City 0-1 Fulham Adama Traore has missed a superb chance to make it 2-0. It sounds like Fulham are really hurting City on the counter-attack. O Rodri, Rodri, wherefore art thou Rodri? WSL match report Tom Garry was at Broadfield Stadium to watch a dramatic and controversial match. Brentford have scored straight from the kick off again, but this time it’s the fifth goal of the game. The captain Christian Norgaard, back in the team today, has put Brentford ahead for the third time. Both goals came when the opposition tried to play out and lost the ball. Jorgen Strand Larsen finished smartly at the near post; Norgaard passed the ball into the net after being put through by Vitaly Janelt. But hang on, there’s a fifth goal. Hello! Andreas Pereira has put Fulham ahead at the Etihad, stretching to volley past Ederson from close range after a superb backheel from Raul Jimenez. The latest scores in our featured games Holstein Keil, who were 2-0 down to Leverkusen after eight minutes, are back in the game thanks to Max Geschwill’s injury-time goal. He was set up by Lewis Holtby, once of Fulham, Spurs and Blackburn. Premier League Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 2-1 Wolves Leicester 1-0 Bournemouth Man City 0-0 Fulham West Ham 1-1 Ipswich Bundesliga Leverkusen 2-1 Holstein Kiel (2.30pm) Union Berlin 2-0 Dortmund (2.30pm) Bryan Mbeumo has got his weekly goal, this time from the penalty spot after a wrestling match at a Brentford corner. It was given on advice from VAR, which is unlikely to have amused Gary O’Neil. Championship Jesuran Rak-Sakyi, on loan from Crystal Palace, has put promotion-sniffing Sheffield United ahead against Luton. Michael Obafemi has done likewise for Plymouth at home to Blackburn. Facundo Buonanotte has put Leicester in front at the King Power Stadium with a fine solo goal. He cut inside from the right, beat a defender through sleight of hip and rammed a rising drive past Kepa. GOAL! Union Berlin 2-0 Dortmund (Vertessen 45) Union Berlin are (un)officially eight goals better than Celtic. St Mirren 0-0 Dundee United “McMahon’s awful confident about the Buddies-Tangerines game, isn’t he?” says James Humphries. “I feel like I’ve seen them both get... Well beat recently.” Oh that’s sheer delightful wordplay. The latest Premier League scores Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (FT) Arsenal 0-0 Southampton Brentford 1-1 Wolves Leicester 0-0 Bournemouth Man City 0-0 Fulham West Ham 1-1 Ipswich That didn’t take long either. The in-form Liam Delap has equalised for Ipswich, whacking a low shot on the turn that beat Alphonse Areola at the near post. Brentford really need to stop scoring so early. The underlapping Nelson Semedo finds space in the area and cuts tbe ball back to Matheus Cunha, who mishits (I think) a shot past Mark Flekken from 12 yards. This one was inside the first minute. Jarrod Bowen dragged a low cross towards the near post, where Michail Antonio swept a first-time shot into the net. This is absolutely bonkers. Brentford didn’t quite manage to score inside the first minute for the fourth game in a row, but Nathan Collins has put them ahead against his old club after 75 seconds. He wandered forward from the back, kept going after laying the ball off and eventually headed Sepp van den Berg’s cross into the net from six yards. On this day in 1991… Leeds close on the early leaders Man Utd after a seven-goal thriller at Elland Road. Bundesliga A bit more news from Germany, where Kevin Vogt’s penalty has given Union Berlin the lead against Dortmund. If it stays like that they’ll move above Dortmund in the table. On this day in 1993… Kevin Keegan’s Newcastle put S-E-V-E-N past Notts County. WSL: Brighton 4-2 Aston Villa Nikita Parris scored her first goal for Brighton in an eventful victory over Aston Villa. There were six goals, two for Villa’s Rachel Daly, and a red card apiece. John Brewin was at Selhurst Park to watch Diogo Jota keep Liverpool top of the Premier League. Here’s what he made of it all. “James Humphries can rest easy at work: Scotland’s game of the day is in Paisley, where St. Mirren host Dundee United,” writes Simon McMahon. “Jim Goodwin’s men have made a solid start on their return to the top league, taking nine points from their opening six games, and also defeated today’s opponents in the Scottish League Cup back in August. So hopes are high of at least a point today, ahead of the international break, which would keep United above the Buddies and in the top six. “A comfortable St. Mirren win then, to go with Hibs beating Motherwell at Easter Road, and Kilmarnock scudding Dundee at Dens. There’s also a top of the table clash in the Scottish Championship at the Falkirk Stadium as the second place Bairns host the Honest Men of Ayr, who lead them by three points but have played two games more.” GOAL! Leverkusen 2-0 Holstein Kiel (Hofmann 8) Yeah, a long afternoon ahead. Jonas Hofmann has made it 2-0 after a lamentable kick/pass by the goalkeeper Timon Weiner was blocked. I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: John Beck’s Cambridge never had this problem. On this day in 1985… After 10 straight wins at the start of the league, Manchester United are held to a draw by Luton. Look out for an astonishing miss by Paul Elliott. Bundesliga latest Victor Boniface has scored after four minutes to put the champions Leverkusen ahead against the bottom club Holstein Kiel. Could be a long afternoon. On this day in 1997… Patrik Berger’s hat-trick does for Chelsea on Super Sunday. Championship Burnley missed the chance to go top when they were held to a goalless draw. Norwich gave Hull a beating and the substitute Louie Sibley earned Oxford a point at Portsmouth. Burnley 0-0 Preston Norwich 4-0 Hull Portsmouth 1-1 Oxford “Was planning to be at Easter Road today for Hibs-Well; instead, I am at work,” weeps James Humphries. “In line with how this week’s gone so far, then, I’m predicting 3-0 Hibs and at least one long-term injury for Motherwell. Fingers crossed that the reverse jinx works, but I wouldn’t put money on it.” Which reminds me: you can follow all the games I don’t have the brain capacity/fingers to cover with our live scoreboard. Even if Erling Haaland scores 400 goals this afternoon, Liverpool will be Premier League leaders going into the international break. Diogo Jota’s excellent early goal was enough to beat Crystal Palace, although things got a bit hairy towards the end and the substitute Vitezslav Jaros had to make an important save from Ebere Eze. “Looking forward to the afternoon’s action,” says Jeremy Boyce. “Let’s hope it won’t be too Premier League-centric, other footie is available. But as I know you’re a multi-faceted sport fan like myself (I draw the line at horses and pugilism these days) I’m wondering what you make of the America’s Cup/LV Challenge these days? Obviously there’s a lot of joy at Sir Jim’s team today, qualifying for a ritual massacring at the hands of the master Peter Burling and his band of Kiwis. “I can see that it’s all highly technical these days and requires an incredible amount of coordination to constantly max the incredible new boats can achieve, not to mention the dosh to fund a challenge especially developing a boat and its foils. All great, but I’ve a kind of hankering to see boats that are actually sitting on the water, not flying above it, with wooden masts and hemp ropes and real people heaving canvas up and down, rather than everything being run by machines. “A bit like I prefer vinyl, books, craft beer.... I admit, I did buy myself a carbon fibre road bike, but the wheels stay on the road and it’s your legs and lungs that move it forwards.” I’m sorry to say I know the square root of bugger all about the America’s Cup. If it’s any consolation, I’m addicted to the smell of old books. Read Barney Ronay on, well, Euston station 78 min: Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool The leaders are still ahead thanks to Diogo Jota’s early goal, but their goalkeeper Alisson has just gone off with what looks like a hamstring injury. You can follow the rest of the game with Scott Murray. West Ham are unchanged. Ipswich bring in Ben Johnson and Wes Burns for Axel Tuanzebe and Chiedozie Ogbene. Phil Foden starts a league game for the first time this season. He replaces Kyle Walker in the only change from last weekend’s 1-1 draw at Newcastle; Rico Lewis will move to right-back. In-form Fulham also make one change: Sander Berge is preferred to Emile Smith Rowe. One change apiece. Leicester bring in Jordan Ayew for Harry WInks; Bournemouth prefer Justin Kluivert to Dango Ouatarra. The captain Christian Norgaard replaces Fabio Carvalho in Brentford’s only change. Wolves bring in Craig Dawson and Carlos Forbs for Santiago Bueno and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Raheem Sterling makes his first Premier League start for Arsenal. Jorginho replaces the injured Jurrien Timber, with Thomas Partey likely to move to right-back. Gabriel Jesus also starts, with Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard rested. They are joined on the subs bench by Mikel Merino. Aaron Ramsdale starts against his old club. Southampton bring in Ryan Manning, Joe Aribo and Ross Stewart for Lesley Ugochukwu, Ryan Fraser and Maxwel Cornet. Arsenal (4-1-2-3) Raya; Partey, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Jorginho; Havertz, Rice; Saka, Jesus, Sterling. Substitutes: Neto, Lewis-Skelly, Tomiyasu, Kiwior, Merino, Nwaneri, Martinelli, Trossard, Butler-Oyedeji. Championship There are three early games, and these are the half-time scores. Burnley 0-0 Preston Norwich 2-0 Hull Portsmouth 0-0 Oxford Burnley will go top if they beat Preston. Norwich’s goals were scored by Marcelino Nunez and Josh Sargent. Half time: Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool Diogo Jota’s ruthless finish has put the leaders ahead at Selhurst Park. You can follow the second half with Scott Murray. Hello and welcome to another busy Saturday clockwatch. Arsenal and Manchester City are among the teams in action at 3pm, and both have the chance to keep pace with/go above Liverpool, depending on the result of the early game at Selhurst Park. We’ll keep an eye on the important games elsewhere, from Burnley to Leverkusen, but our main focus will be these Premier League games. Crystal Palace 0-1 Liverpool (12.45pm) Arsenal v Southampton Brentford v Wolves Leicester v Bournemouth Man City v Fulham West Ham v Ipswich"

          "bodyText": "Robert Jenrick will be toppled by the Tory party’s right wing should he attempt to pivot to the centre ground if installed as leader, senior Conservatives have warned. Jenrick, who remains the frontrunner for the job after the party’s conference in Birmingham, has won support from the right with a series of uncompromising stances. He has said he would welcome Nigel Farage into the party, leave the European convention on human rights and vote for Donald Trump. Having started life as an MP as a moderate, some believe he has only temporarily adopted a more rightwing stance as part of his efforts to win the leadership. Some allies have suggested he will move back to the centre once in office. However, senior party figures are already warning Jenrick that if he becomes leader, his fate will be in the hands of rightwing MPs willing to attack those who have attempted to move away from their agenda. They warned that he had entrusted his fate to the “Braverman right” – a reference to the former home secretary, Suella Braverman. Jenrick was made immigration minister under Braverman in the expectation that he would be a moderating force. However, he is said to have been radicalised by his time in the Home Office on the need for tougher policies. One shadow minister compared Jenrick to Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader delivered into power by the right, but ultimately unable to widen his appeal to voters. Duncan Smith was removed as leader after just over two years. “What will happen to him is that he will suffer the fate of IDS,” they said. “He will try to pivot to the centre, but what he’ll find is that the Braverman right won’t let him. They would pull their support and threaten to submit their latest vote of no confidence for a leadership contest. They have got him by the balls. It now only takes 19 letters to prompt a confidence vote in the leader.” Allies of Jenrick strongly disputed the idea, pointing out that the likes of Victoria Atkins, Ed Argar and John Lamont – Tory figures associated with the liberal, One Nation wing of the party – also backed his leadership bid. Jenrick bolstered his credentials with the party’s grassroots during the conference by confirming that his daughter’s middle name was Thatcher. He has also appeared in a hoodie emblazoned with the words “Hamas Are Terrorists”. MPs will whittle down the four remaining candidates to two this week. Those two will then be put forward to a vote of party members. While Jenrick remains favourite, a small number of MPs changing their vote could have a major impact. James Cleverly, shadow home secretary, was thought to have had a good conference after calling on the party to be “more normal”. However, there are sobering revelations about the party’s relevance to the public in the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. It reveals that more of the public were aware of Phillip Schofield’s return to TV in his programme Cast Away than had heard about the Conservative conference. Labour still leads in most policy areas with the public, though the two main parties are now tied on the economy. Among those giving a view, Cleverly was deemed to have had a good conference, seeing an improvement in his “acceptability” score and is currently the frontrunner among the wider British public. Kemi Badenoch has taken the biggest knock to her public perception. She received criticism last week for suggesting maternity pay was “excessive”. Half (49%) of 2019 Conservative voters say Cleverly would be an acceptable leader of the Conservative party, with 41% saying the same of Jenrick, 40% of Tom Tugendhat and 37% of Badenoch. Adam Drummond, head of political and social research at Opinium, said: “To nobody’s surprise, voters are not paying a great deal of attention to the Conservative leadership contest and it is notable that, as unpopular as the Labour government already is, voters prefer them over the Tories on almost all issues, with the two parties tied on the economy.”"

          "headline": "Travel industry’s hopes soar despite fears about overtourism",
          "bodyText": "When the Covid pandemic and the subsequent cost of living crisis threatened to wipe out much of the travel industry, companies clung to one article of faith: people were desperate for a holiday and would spend what they could to get away again. So it turned out. Only now, with business booming and demand hitting new highs, parts of the world wonder if people want to travel a little too much. After a long, hot summer when local residents from the Canary Islands to Venice decided they had welcomed more than enough tourists, even Greece last month announced a new tax on visitors. The €20 (£17) levy only hits cruise passengers landing in Mykonos and Santorini, where visitors outnumber local people in the whitewashed streets by more than 100 to one; but for a country highly reliant on international tourism, even such a selective tax felt significant. Travel companies argue that the issues behind the collective headlines on overtourism are often specific and local. And Greece certainly continues to market for more tourists, albeit that it is trying to spread the love around: this week, it is hosting the UK travel industry’s leading event, Abta’s travel convention, in what is for Britons the relatively off-radar south-western Peloponnese. Responsible, sustainable travel is on the convention agenda, although the established tourism industry – cruise lines apart – has not necessarily been the focus of protests or local ire. The millions of UK customers who book trips with the likes of Tui or easyJet holidays, choosing resorts and existing hotels, appear less problematic than, say, the Airbnbs swallowing up local accommodation in Barcelona or Málaga – at least until their numbers prompt further development. Nonetheless, more customers are paying increasing sums for their holidays, apparently undeterred by any local antipathy or heatwaves. Companies are celebrating a third successive summer of growth – a marked difference from Abta’s first post-Covid summit abroad in 2022, billed by its chief executive, Mark Tanzer, as a “survivor’s celebration”. Indications are it has been a fruitful September too, with many holidaymakers – outside the captive market of families confined by school terms – seeking less intense sunshine. Surveys find consumers express concern about both overtourism and the environment when asked – making sustainable travel a hot topic and a selling point for companies who offer alternatives. Yet on a macro level, it is not clear they are in any perceptible way voting with their feet. As one industry figure puts it: “Are they booking Scandinavia? Probably not.” Figures from Iata, the global airlines body, show that demand for flying has intensified year on year, with at least 10% more passengers in the air this August than last and planes fuller than ever. And Abta’s own nascent “confidence index” is showing consumer sentiment around travel is higher compared with a year ago. The clouds on the horizon this year include the long-delayed start of the EU’s entry-exit system (EES), due until recently to have launched a date that would have landed much of the British travel industry in a long queue for biometric registration at Kalamata airport. The start of EES, requiring facial scans and fingerprinting of all visitors to Europe, is now officially slated for November but a further delay appears likely. The extra border formalities will be followed within a year by the European travel information and authorisation system – a €7 visa charge. While the greater concern has been about the logistics and costs to remodel borders and avoid chaos, Abta’s index also noted that the biggest single factor for confident travel cited by customers is knowing their documents are in order. A recent Abta conference call on EES was attended en masse by members anxious to know more. And the industry is also keen to address another post-Brexit border headache: the end of simple seasonal postings, seeing thousands of entry-level overseas jobs vanish; fewer than 4,000 UK nationals now work in tourism in the EU, 70% less than in 2017, with the youngest disproportionately affected. Many of the executives meeting this week got their first job as a chalet host or resort rep, and hope successful UK-EU talks on a youth mobility scheme can restore that pathway for a new generation."

          "headline": "Growth of far-right ‘active clubs’ in UK prompts call to tackle misogyny",
          "bodyText": "Concerns about the growth of self-styled fitness clubs organised by the far right have prompted calls for action to counter misogynistic messaging targeted at young men and boys. Campaigners want the UK government to recognise the danger presented by so-called “active clubs” – a loose movement imported from the US – and use moments such as a review of the school curriculum to challenge their ideology. While it has often been careful to avoid direct calls to violence, the decentralised grouping has links to the international far right and has a specific focus on developing members’ fitness with a view to being able to fight. Thousands of subscribers across Britain are signed up to accounts on Telegram, the encrypted messaging app. White nationalism, fascist imagery as well as homophobic and misogynistic language feature heavily, while many of the same fitness groups’ Telegram channels have been posting attempts to stir up tensions after the deaths of three young girls in Southport. A range of active club groups in the UK had upwards of 6,000 subscribers on Telegram while the latest version of a group dedicated to England had almost 1,600 subscribers, a BBC investigation reported this week. Evidence seen by the Guardian indicates that members of equivalent clubs in the US have travelled to the UK in recent months. The groups’ relative growth – researchers regard the true number of participants as being a fraction of the thousands of subscribers – comes as more overtly political British far-right groups such as Patriotic Alternative have struggled. A group using the name Active Club Scotland (ACS) is regarded by Hope Not Hate as being one of the first to have emerged in Britain, taking a cue from US clubs that grew out of the Rise Above Movement, a far-right street-fighting group in California. Patrik Hermansson, a senior researcher at Hope Not Hate who has explored the trend in detail, said: “The UK has been a late adopter to this trend, which only really took off here last summer and took inspiration from European and US counterparts. Ultimately, they are about reasserting masculinity, affirming members as strong, capable men and pushing out the message that society is weak and degenerate and the reason for that is progressive ideals and feminism.” Like their European and US equivalents, the groups mix ideological posts with images and “reports” of members taking part in martial arts activities, often in open countryside but sometimes in private and public gyms. Images and posts seen by the Guardian range from groups publicising activities such as “banner drops” of far-right propaganda from motorway bridges, through to posts showing exercising members with their faces blurred out. One from a group for the south of England showed black-clad recruits doing press-ups on Jesus Green, Cambridge. Another post, by Active Club England, forwarded an image purporting to show a visit to London last month by followers of a US white supremacist group calling themselves the Sons of Colombia. Anti-fascist researchers are also aware of at least one other visit by another US far-right active club to the UK this year. Hermansson added: “These clubs are about building a capacity for violence and imagining a future where violence is necessary to somehow save the nation. It’s highly masculine – you rarely, if ever, see a woman in their posts and there is very much a separatist side to drawing people in and radicalising them.” Christine Jardine, a Liberal Democrat MP and the party’s equalities spokesperson, described the rise of the groups as “deeply disturbing” and said the school curriculum should be updated to ensure young people can be protected from people using popular platforms to prey on vulnerable young men and boys. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, announced a review in August of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools and said children would be taught how to spot extremist content and misinformation online under planned changes. Brendan Cox, who was married to the murdered West Yorkshire MP Jo Cox and campaigns on counter-terrorism and community cohesion, said the Active Clubs should be seen in the context of research showing men were more than twice as likely as women to try to justify violence outside refugee accommodation this summer. “The other thing is that misogyny is a common strand connecting so many of the different forms of extremism,” he said. “There is an obvious opportunity in the curriculum review. We need to be talking not just about misogyny but about positive male role models.” The call for a greater focus on education was echoed by Amy O’Connor, the director of policy and advocacy at Movember, which campaigns on men’s health and is also devoting resources to researching misogyny. She said: “What we are increasingly learning is that men are just not getting the support when it comes to relationships and male identity. In so many cases they are going online and searching for answers and that’s a gap which is being filled in some cases by some extreme views, influencers and groups.”"

          "bodyText": "Three men have been shot by police in two separate and unrelated incidents – with two fighting for their lives in hospital – in Sydney and Melbourne. Acting assistant commissioner Paul Dunstan said at about 12.10pm on Friday, officers responding to a report of a stolen car in a Wentworthville car park in Sydney’s west, fired their guns at the vehicle after it was allegedly driven at them. The pair were discovered as a result of an in-vehicle tracker which led police to the car with the assistance of its owner, later confirmed to be the husband of the Labor MP for Penrith, Karen McKeown. “[The police] found a locked garage door with a car inside … as they’ve opened that garage door, the vehicle has immediately accelerated towards them,” Dunstan said. “As a result, police drew their firearms and were required to fire a number of shots.” Officers then rendered first aid to the two men until the arrival of NSW Ambulance paramedics, police said. The men were transported to Westmead hospital, where one man remained in a “very serious” condition on Friday afternoon and the second in a serious but stable condition. Police said the five officers on the scene were not injured in the incident. Three shot their firearms and were assisting police with their inquiries. Asked whether their show of force was warranted, Dunstan said it was “still too early to comment”. A critical incident investigation was ongoing, Dunstan confirmed. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, told reporters earlier on Friday that it would be subject to an independent review. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Earlier on Friday, a man was shot by police in a separate and unrelated incident in Hillside in Melbourne’s north-west after a fatal stabbing. Det Insp Dean Thomas said it was being treated as a family violence incident involving an altercation between the offender and his father. He alleged the offender was living at another address and arrived at his 61-year-old father’s home early Friday morning “unannounced and unexpected”. A 27-year-old woman, believed to be the sister of the alleged offender, was also on the scene and called triple zero. Thomas said police arrived just after 7am to find the critically injured 61-year-old on the front lawn, alleged to have been stabbed by the offender with a knife or axe. Police attempted CPR until they heard a scream from inside the house. Upon entering, they were allegedly confronted by a man armed with a knife. A shot was fired and police officers retreated out the front door, while the heavily pregnant 27-year-old woman fled through the rear door. She appeared uninjured but had been transported to hospital as a precaution, Thomas said. Thomas alleged shortly after, the armed man came outside and confronted police, who instructed him to put his weapon down and surrender. Thomas alleged the man made his way down the street under police pursuit and stabbed a police car tyre. “After that he advanced on one of our members – again they were engaging with him to drop the knife, and several shots were fired by one of our members which hit the offender,” Thomas alleged. “He dropped to the ground and was taken into custody.” The man was being treated for lower body injuries in a critical but stable condition at Royal Melbourne hospital. Thomas said while it was early in the investigation, he had spoken to the police involved and viewed body-worn camera footage and believed they had done “everything they could and followed policy”. “It was a very confronting, distressing scene for our members to turn up to,” he said. “Nobody comes to work wanting to be involved in an incident like that.” Thomas said the offender was known to police and had active intervention orders in place. He said the man also had a psychiatric history. The incident was being investigated by homicide squad detectives and Victoria’s armed crime squad and professional standards command, which police said was standard practice after a shooting. In a statement following the Sydney incident, McKeown alleged her home was broken into on Thursday evening and her husband’s car was stolen. She said she reported the incident to the police. “While I am shaken from the events, thankfully I am unharmed,” she said. “I want to thank NSW police, in particular the local area command at both Penrith and Cumberland police for their prompt response. “Political leaders often praise police for their bravery. Today, I have had a first-hand experience of this.”"

          "headline": "What are the risks involved in Israeli options for retaliatory strikes on Iran?",
          "bodyText": "Israel has several options if its leaders want to launch retaliatory strikes against Iran, and while western leaders have urged restraint, a significant assault is expected. Possibilities could include strikes against military, economic or even nuclear targets, although Joe Biden said he had told Benjamin Netanyahu’s government the US would not support the last option. Iran has relatively weak air defences and it is expected it would struggle to prevent Israeli missiles or an air force bombing run, as was revealed on 19 April. Then, Israel, responding to Iran’s previous missile barrage, damaged part of Iran’s best air defence system, a Russian S-300, in the military-industrial city of Isfahan. It was a strike intended to showcase to Iran what Israel was capable of. “If attacking nuclear sites is off the table, the two big options for Israel are whether it wants to attack military or economic targets,” said Fabian Hinz, a Middle East expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Military targets The most direct response would be for Israel to try to strike Iran’s cluster of missile and drone bases, which are located, according to Hinz, underground and in some cases “deep under mountains”. Though it may be possible to bomb and seal off entrances, the bases are designed to resist all the largest conventional explosives, and striking them may not prevent future attacks, he added. Alternatives could be to repeat the targeting of Iranian air defence bases – this time on a larger scale – which cover Tehran, Isfahan and ports on the Persian gulf. Or a more complex attack could target military-industrial production, such as a more overt repeat of the drone attack on a weapons factory in Isfahan in January 2023. However, all such attacks carry the possibility of miscalculation and risk unanticipated casualties. Oil terminals, refineries and economic infrastructure An attack on Iran’s oil infrastructure has been touted as a likely response to Tuesday’s ballistic missile assault on Israel, with Biden indicating the issue was under discussion on Thursday. The most cited target is Kharg oil terminal, which handles, on some estimates, 90% of crude oil exports, most of which are destined for China. Other key facilities include the Abadan refinery, near the border with Iraq, which handles a significant proportion of Iran’s domestic oil needs. “Iran’s oil industry is quite exposed,” said Hinz, adding that attacking economic targets could have a longer-term impact. “Iran’s economy is struggling and the regime always wants sanctions relief,” he said, noting that Israel’s bombing of the Houthis in Yemen at the end of last month was focused on fuel, power and port facilities at Ras Issa and Hodeidah. A question is whether an economic attack as a direct response to Iran’s on Tuesday is proportionate. Iran said it had selected military targets, and its missiles targeted Israeli airbases, causing light damage to the Nevatim facility and the headquarters of the Mossad spy agency. But a school east of Ashkelon was struck, causing extensive damage to a classroom. It is also more likely to lead to an Iranian retaliation than if Israel carried out a more narrowly focused military attack. Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, Iran’s military chief of staff, said, if attacked, Tehran would respond with another larger, and more wide-ranging, missile barrage. Tuesday’s attack “will be repeated with bigger intensity and all infrastructure of the regime will be targeted”, he said. Targeted killings and other covert methods Israel could take a different tack, expanding its programme of targeted killings further in Iran. It has already shown it is able to carry out assassinations in Tehran, having killed the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh at the end of July. It detonated an explosive device that had been secretly placed two months earlier in the guesthouse where he was staying, according to a report in the New York Times. Several top Iranian nuclear scientists are believed to have been killed by Israel, including Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, said to have been murdered in November 2020 by a remote-controlled machine gun. Israel, however, does not appear to be considering a low-key response to what was an overt missile attack, with the prime minister insisting Iran would “pay for it”. Nuclear targets Military experts believe it would be impossible for Israel to mount a disruptive strike on Iran’s network of nuclear sites without direct military help from the US. The key sites where Iran is enriching uranium up to 60% purity, Natanz and Fordow, are both underground, below several dozen metres of rock and concrete. A paper by Darya Dolzikova and Matthew Savill, originally published in April by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, says: “The only conventional weapon that could plausibly achieve this is the American GBU-57A/B massive ordnance penetrator, which – with over 12 tonnes and 6 metres long – can only be carried by large US bombers like the B-2 Spirit.” Though it may be possible for Israel to attack lesser sites and set back the programme by targeting facilities for the production of centrifuges used in the enrichment process or other such sites, there is a risk that an attack on its nuclear programme could prompt Tehran to speed up its efforts to obtain an atomic bomb. “Tehran may see the actual weaponization of its nuclear programme as the only option left that can guarantee the security of the Iranian regime,” the authors conclude."

          "headline": "Pro-choice Catholics protest at Vatican after abortion left off summit agenda",
          "bodyText": "A vibrantly coloured, 15-metre-long quilt woven with stories of Catholic women who have had abortions has been unrolled outside the Vatican in protest against the topic being left off the agenda of a major summit hosted by Pope Francis. Thursday’s demonstration by Catholics for Choice, a US-based abortion rights group, comes days after the pontiff emphasised his traditional views of women while reiterating that abortion was “murder” and that doctors who terminate pregnancies were “hitmen”. Those words, made during a visit to Belgium, were enough to prompt the prime minister, Alexander De Croo, to summon the Vatican’s ambassador, it emerged on Thursday. Speaking to parliament, De Croo lambasted the remarks as “unacceptable”, adding he had invited the Holy See’s top diplomat in the country, the apostolic nuncio, “for discussions.” “My message to the apostolic nuncio will be very clear: what happened there is unacceptable,” he said. “We do not need lessons on how our lawmakers democratically approve laws. The time when the church dictated the law in our country is fortunately long behind us,” he said. The month-long, closed-door summit in the Vatican, known as a synod, is the final session of a debate on the future of the church and how to adapt it to the needs of Catholics today. But decisions on some of the most divisive topics, including women’s ordination and blessings for same-sex couples, have been postponed until next year, while abortion was never on the agenda. Official Catholic church teaching condemns abortion in all circumstances, even if there is a risk to the mother’s life. But data from the Pew Research Centre earlier this year showed that the majority of Catholics in the United States, which has the fourth-largest Catholic population in the world, believed it should be legal in all or most cases. “One of the reasons we’re so focused on it in the US is because 98% of Catholic women have used birth control other than natural family planning and one in four abortion patients is Catholic,” said Ashley Wilson, a senior adviser for Catholics for Choice. “But the issue of abortion, and contraception, does not get the same amount of attention as other church justice issues, even though it affects possibly far more people. For [the Church hierarchy] to say that ‘we need to be tough on abortion’ feels really out of touch. We cannot pass up this opportunity to have our voices heard.” Catholics for Choice gathered 180 testimonies from Catholic women who had terminated a pregnancy, of which 51 were published in a book presented to the synod’s office on Thursday but which was ultimately rejected. Many of the women came forward with their abortion stories after the US supreme court overturned its landmark Roe v Wade decision in 2022, ending a constitutional right to abortion that had been in place for 50 years. The reasons behind their decisions were varied. Some chose to end their pregnancies due to health concerns or foetal abnormalities, while others were unplanned or the women did not feel ready to start a family. One woman told how, in her 20s, she fell pregnant while in an abusive relationship and didn’t want to be forced to marry the man. “The stories are heartbreaking, inspiring, empowering and everything in between,” said Wilson. “Catholics for Choice was actually founded when Roe v Wade became law, and when it was overturned many people realised that they needed to come forward.” Pope Francis sparked criticism in September after urging US Catholics to choose the “lesser evil” in the upcoming presidential election. Without mentioning the names of the two candidates, he said both were “against life”, seemingly referring to Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant policies and Kamala Harris’s stance on abortion. “A lot of people forget that Pope Francis is a head of state too and shouldn’t be commenting on elections,” added Wilson. “If Emmanuel Macron had made those comments people would have freaked out.” While in Belgium, Francis was also widely criticised for his views on the role of women in society. “It is a huge thing, but he doesn’t seem to fully realise the ripple effects of his words and the violence they can cause to people,” said Wilson. “There are women in the US who are dying of sepsis because they can’t get the abortion care they need. And the most powerful lobby behind abortion bans in any country is the Catholic church. It’s both shocking and outrageous.”"

          "headline": "Caribou: Honey review – this AI-aided album is dubious on so many levels",
          "bodyText": "Ever since Beethoven dismissed the newly invented metronome – “Whoever has the right feeling, needs none” – musicians have reacted against the advent of technology. The Musicians’ Union voiced alarm when Wurlitzer organs became appended with a drum machine in 1959, calling it a “stilted and unimaginative performer” – but today, drummers are still in a job while music from rap to techno has blossomed thanks to that very technology. There’s still plenty of concern about the newest wheeze, however: AI. Big software companies such as Adobe are creating tools where a mere text prompt can produce a piece of music. Or what if you can’t sing and don’t want to pay someone who can? Don’t worry! Numerous AI services online will take your lyrics and sing them for you in convincing simulacra of various human voices. Professional vocalists might wince at the new album from Caribou, Canada-born Dan Snaith, populated as it is with multiple ersatz AI singers – all of them altered versions of Snaith’s own voice. Rather like his friend Kieran Hebden (AKA Four Tet), Snaith has had a pleasingly Benjamin Button-ish career, starting out with spirited yet bucolic psychedelia before getting ever more youthful and dancefloor-orientated, bringing in techno, house and trip-hop (and starting a purely club-facing project, Daphni). Now, aged 46, he’s delivered his most banging album yet. Honey cocks an ear to the last 20 years or so of club music in his adopted city of London, chiefly speed garage, house and the emo-tech of the Bicep and Fred Again generation. For Honey, Snaith felt limited by his singing voice, and wanted to broaden his range of creative expression: a laudable aim. He could have sampled other artists, as he did on previous album Suddenly, but he can’t make them sing his tunes, so he manipulated his vocals via various software services that provide licensed AI voices (so someone somewhere is presumably getting paid). The AI, Snaith claims, “still captures all the phrasing, the pitch imperfections, the delivery, the breath”. On one level, it’s just another instrument or effect – like a next-gen Auto-Tune – and quite innocent. Some might find it a little weird for Snaith to turn himself into cutesy young women on Broke My Heart, Do Without You and Come Find Me, but these tracks are done with a certain amount of knowing wit and absurdity, and girl-Snaith sounds great on the latter: Honey’s strongest track, with an earwormingly rhythmic vocal hook. But it’s much more dubious to turn himself into a rapper on Campfire. A white MC would arguably use the same intonation and accent used here, but Snaith is perilously close to appropriating and imitating Black artistry – if he rapped this way on stage, it would certainly be cringe and probably be offensive. And as the album’s other highlight Over Now shows, Snaith’s own voice – appealingly shaky, naive and human – already has so much expressive potential, its melancholy pitched perfectly against cheesy high-tempo synthwave. The AI feels dismal in comparison, another part of our atomised, anti-communal digital culture; if Snaith had wanted rappers or female singers to enrich his music, wouldn’t it have been better to ask some? (For a more profound and genuinely collaborative mix of human and algorithm, look to Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst’s choral work The Call, which opens at London’s Serpentine gallery this week, and which was made with UK community choirs alongside AI.) More creative input might have helped Snaith in other ways: he is really losing his facility with melody. Not only does opener Broke My Heart boringly approximate PinkPantheress-type UKG, its central melody is a limp tweak to Suzanne Vega’s Tom’s Diner chorus without any of its cleverness or dark symmetry. The psychedelic-Italo whirl of Climbing might have been transportive if its tune didn’t sound like it had been composed with two fingers in fewer minutes. The more rhythm-led tracks are also imitative of other, better ones. The speed garage bass on the title track wobbles stiffly – further undermined by the plodding almost-groove, and synth stabs arranged in an overused house rhythm. On Volume, Snaith heavily samples a hip-house ur-text in Marrs’ Pump Up the Volume, but he can’t do anything new with it, and flattens the original’s alien dynamics (and here, as well as on Dear Life, the influence of one of the defining 00s dance tracks feels all too evident: the James Holden remix of Nathan Fake’s The Sky Was Pink). As each Caribou project goes by, it’s clear that 2010’s Swim – where his pre- and post-club eras lolloped into each other – is by some distance his greatest. Both genuinely psychedelic and genuinely funky, tracks like Odessa and Kaili were quantised but loose; today, Honey’s tracks still have his sense of starry-eyed romance, but are hemmed into a much neater and more familiar grid. AI can hypothetically be a fascinating creative partner, but when the human creativity is as limited as it is here, it’s given little to work with. • Alexis Petridis is away"

          "bodyText": "In 2005 or 2006, Nairy Baghramian arrived for a site visit at Kunsthalle Basel in Switzerland to find the pioneering artist Gustav Metzger was there, too. He was scheduled to do a show before her and was walking around the imposing space with the director Adam Szymczyk, when he suddenly became excited at a temporary wall that had been erected. “Oh my God!” he exclaimed. “I’m very happy that this is built in now. Otherwise it would be a totally fascist building, it’s huge. I love this unterbrechung”. An unterbrechung is an interruption or an intermission. Metzger, the Jewish artist and activist who fled to the UK from Nazi Germany as a child in 1939, found the idea of disrupting this example of monumental neoclassical architecture to be politically potent. Baghramian would go on to base her whole show on that sentence. She left most of the space empty, arranging just a few pieces around that wall. At first Szymczyk questioned the decision: “Do you know how big the space is and you only have these works?” he asked. But she insisted that Metzger’s neat summation of “a political experience of a space and also an architectural experience” was the only prompt she needed. Baghramian is always looking for openings. For ways of letting the outside in. She was born in Isfahan, Iran, in 1971, and after the revolution fled to Berlin with her family in 1984. She has been exhibiting since the late 1990s, but it was taking part in the once-a-decade Münster Sculpture Project in 2007 that pushed her firmly into the spotlight. From the outset, she has made her playful, deliciously tactile work in a constant back and forth between photography and sculpture. In her latest show, portraits of a young child sit alongside sculpted elements in stone and metal. It stops her from getting stuck on any one idea: “It keeps my artistic dominance in check, so that nothing becomes too tight and everything can just be what it is.” This is more than the high-level theorising of an artist steeped in abstraction. In fact, as one critic recently put it, Baghramian’s work “pops” the very notion of art existing in a bubble. For her forthcoming exhibition, the artist is occupying the various spaces of Camberwell’s South London Gallery with large colourful sculptural pieces from her Misfits series. The show takes its title, Jumbled Alphabet, from that of a double photographic portrait of a little girl in a blue jumper, also on display. The child has tousled blond hair and yellow beads round her neck. She poses head-on (albeit from behind) and then from the side. When you can glimpse her face, you see she is looking directly ahead. It’s not that the girl looks unhappy. But she is not gurning for the camera, either. “When people take photos of children, they always ask them to smile,” says Baghramian. “But if you just leave a child be, they’ll often look the way she looks here.” With girls, she says, it’s even more common that they’ll be asked to “smile, love”. And it doesn’t end with childhood. Just a few years ago, during a shoot, Baghramian was told she had a lovely smile and why did she look so stern? In 2007, for Münster, she refused to submit a proposal. For many artists, she told the curator, it does make sense. But being asked to explain what she wanted to do in advance felt, she says, like she was using sculptures to please others. “Like you’re being asked to smile for the camera?” I ask. “Exactly.” Previous installations by the artist Misfits, 2021 (Jumbled Alphabet, 2021, on wall) These sculpted bits of marble, cast aluminium and walnut wood inhabit a gallery, Baghramian says, “as if somebody left the space without cleaning it up. You don’t know if there is an order, or if things are already out of order.” Misfits, 2021 While visiting the Galleria d’Arte Moderna in Milan in 2021, Baghramian learned that the park the exhibition spaces looked out on to was reserved for children and their parents. This exclusionary inclusion – “a beautiful question”, as she puts it – resulted in a puzzle of a show that asked: Who is inside? Who is kept out? Who is in control? Scratching the Back: Drift (Tortillon orange), 2023 For last year’s Met Fifth Avenue’s Facade Commission in New York, in the niches between the pairs of monumental Corinthian columns that punctuate the main entrance pavilion, Baghramian installed this and three other buoyantly coloured pieces. They spill out at you, frozen in metal and pigment. They refuse to be subdued. Sitzengebliebene/Stay Downers: Dösender, 2020 This ongoing series of sculpted works came out of Baghramian being asked do a retrospective and declining. She wanted to make new work. She arrived instead at the idea of a sculptural class reunion for things that didn’t fit anywhere; things, as she puts it, “that have no reason to consciously meet”. She likes to exhibit these on the edges or outsides of spaces. Nairy Baghramian’s Jumbled Alphabet is at South London Gallery to 12 January."

          "bodyText": "The writer Jacob McNeal is, among other things, a bestselling and influential novelist, an esteemed winner of the Nobel prize for literature, a writer with style consistent and public enough to serve as a prompt for ChatGPT. From another view: a narcissistic cad, a terrible father, a lonely drunk. People argue whether he’s a genius, a fraud, an iconoclast. After nearly two hours with him, it’s not clear which. Though mesmerizingly brought to life by Robert Downey Jr in Ayad Akhtar’s muddled and occasionally poignant new play of the same name, McNeal remains more reflection than character – a projection of success, an outlet for anxieties over artificial intelligence, a cipher to destabilize one’s view of reality. All of these angles offer fertile material for a play of ideas, and to Akhtar’s credit, McNeal is not only a rare original Broadway play but an ambitious one, given starry billing and splashy, tech-forward staging at Lincoln Center. It’s also all over the place, a play of strong performances – Downey, in his Broadway debut, chief among them – that chafe against vague, inchoate ideas about a vaguely ghoulish technology. Things start simply enough: a giant, blue light-abundant iPhone interface looming above the stage, the home page tracking the minutes clicking by on Friday, 10 October in a way intriguingly familiar to most people in the audience. It’s sometime in the near future, when ChatGPT-like AI is even more firmly grounded in American daily life – enough, as McNeal off-handedly remarks in Dr Sahra Grewal’s (Ruthie Ann Miles) office, that several New York Times bestsellers are openly composed through machine learning. The play proceeds in chronological-ish chapters in the sunset days of McNeal’s distinguished career: an appointment diagnosing liver disease; a triumphantly tipsy and moralizing speech accepting the Nobel prize; a meeting with his hammy agent Stephie (Andrea Martin); a reunion with his estranged adult son Harlan (a jittery Rafi Gavron), who harbors intense loathing for the father he blames for his mother’s suicide decades earlier (and which features some telenovela-esque revelations that nearly took me out of the play entirely). Some border on the surreal; some, especially a tete-a-tete between proudly un-woke McNeal and a young female Black reporter at the New York Times (Brittany Bellizeare, a standout) whip up propulsive, left-field tension as the novelist plunges deeper into the whiskey bottle. (Michael Yeargan and Jake Barton’s evocative sets cover both, most pleasingly released in a luscious bookshelf full of both real and made-up titles.) But as the chapters build, the narrative cohesion slackens. For each interlude deliberately muddies the waters by introducing the prospect of AI-generated material – Downey Jr’s voice, as McNeal, prompting the machine for the scenes we are about to witness and providing personal material to synthesize. Eventually, the projections deliver dialogue as deepfakes of McNeal and his late wife/former paramour (Melora Hardin). (The program credits the “digital composites” to the company AGBO.) Akhtar, a Pulitzer-winning dramatist (in 2013, for Disgraced) and novelist, has dressed up a reliably grating inclination – a writer writing about writing – with the mind-bending and reality-questioning drama of our fears with AI. The framing devices don’t need to do much to touch on, without spoiling, the lines between inspiration and exploitation, between borrowing and theft, between assistance and cheating. Although delineating it this way feels like I’m giving the play too much credit – McNeal at most nudges these fault lines, seemingly chuffed with bringing up the topic as an end unto itself. Downey, operating firmly in his lane of wise-cracking, sardonic charisma, is at least never less than compelling, and thankfully on stage for almost the whole show; the whole exercise is worth it to see an actor in peak, seemingly easy form. He sells McNeal both as a narcissist spiraling at the end of his road and as a provocation of AI’s blurry ethical lines. Such provocation contains little insight, beyond that AI is scary and could make things worse; perhaps McNeal’s most interesting idea is the unoriginal notion that generative AI will enable narcissists, or that it will allow people to express themselves through an artistic medium without putting in the hard work of craft. McNeal ends on a confounding note, explicitly invoking the question: what is real, and how do you know? One could generously read the play’s descent into confusion as a meta treatise on what a world full of AI slop and questionably generated material will wreak on our perception, tenuous as it is already. One could also say that it’s a bit of unearned ambiguity. Our standards haven’t fallen so far yet as to not hope for art with a clear vision."

          "headline": "Labor’s 11th-hour decision on LGBTQ+ census questions prompted weekend scramble, documents reveal",
          "bodyText": "The Albanese government’s last-minute rejection of proposed questions on sexuality and gender diversity in the upcoming 2026 census sent bureaucrats into a weekend scramble, new documents show. In the late hours of Friday 23 August and Saturday 24 August, officials at the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) agreed to cancel a scheduled media briefing on Monday 26 August and the rollout of its “large-scale” test census to 50,000 households from Tuesday 27 August as a result of the 11th-hour decision. Documents released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws show how the independent statistics agency scrambled to ditch its plans within a weekend after a delayed final decision by the government. The surprise decision was made public on the Sunday following a Sky News report, prompting strong criticism from the LGBTQ+ community and health and demography experts. Shortly afterwards, the assistant minister, Andrew Leigh, who is responsible for the census, confirmed there would be no changes to the 2026 census. Despite senior ministers initially defending the decision as necessary to avoid “divisive” debates and to focus on the cost-of-living crisis, the government agreed to reintroduce two questions on sexual orientation and gender identity a fortnight later. The FoI documents show ABS staff sent two emails to media who had registered to attend the Monday briefing confirming it was going ahead. Another email sent by an ABS employee to the assistant minister’s office on Friday at 5.06pm outlined the communications plan for the following week. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The text of the media alert was also forwarded at 6.02pm on Friday 23 August by an official – whose identity was redacted – to another official – also redacted. On Saturday afternoon, a meeting was held with more than 10 ABS staff to cancel the planned media briefing on Monday and census test rollout from Tuesday. Staff agreed to destroy the census forms and instructions to 50,000 households and spiked scheduled social media and radio promotions. A trove of documents was tabled in the Senate in September revealing Leigh approved the new census questions in mid-July only to verbally reverse the decision on 13 August – a move reportedly due to an overruling by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. In a ministerial brief handed to Leigh’s office by the ABS, the assistant minister verbally informed the chief statistician, David Gruen, on 13 August of his change in decision. The brief was signed off by Leigh on Friday 23 August – two days after it was due to be actioned. In 2023, the ABS issued a statement of regret over the distress felt by the LGBTQ+ community over being left out of censuses, acknowledging a lack of questions about gender identity, sexual characteristics or orientation “meant that they felt invisible and excluded”. The ABS had warned Leigh in a submission on 16 August there was a risk that dropping the proposed new questions “will mean those feelings are repeated for the 2026 census”. “There is a risk to the successful delivery of the census if there is public criticism and campaigning while the census is under way,” the submission said. “The ABS expects a strong negative reaction from the LGBTIQ+ community and supportive members of the public. This could reduce the census response rate and quality of the data collected, and draw criticism of the ABS and government.” An Albanese government spokesperson told Guardian Australia last month “the government sets census topics”. “The ABS came to the government with potential changes it planned to trial, including changes it had not recommended for the 2026 census. The government paused the process to get it right,” the spokesperson said. “Assistant minister Leigh advised on 8 September the government would set a new topic of ‘sexual orientation and gender’ for the 2026 census.”"

          "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Worries about this month’s budget, and the Middle East crisis, have hit confidence across UK manufacturing last month. The oil price has jumped following a warning from a US official that Iran is “preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel”. Inflation across the eurozone has fallen below the official 2% target for the first time in three years, sparking speculation that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates again this month. Some of the busiest ports in the US were braced for crippling disruption after about 45,000 port workers represented by the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) began walking off the job after their contracts expired at midnight. The Horizon IT scandal inquiry has heard that there could be a repeat unless the so-called “untouchable” investigators and executives involved in the prosecution of subpostmasters not fired before the organisation rolls out its new IT system. UK domestic energy costs have jumped 10% as the new price cap kicks in. Prices in UK shops are falling at the fastest rate since 2021 despite an increase in fresh food inflation as wet weather hit UK production while the cost of olive oil and sugary snacks continues to be affected by the climate crisis. If it goes ahead, Iran’s ballistic missile attack on Israel could be as big or potentially bigger than the one in April, a US official has told Reuters. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that Iran appeared to be preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel. In April, Iran launched hundreds of drones as well as cruise missiles towards Israel, in the Islamic Republic’s first ever direct attack on the Jewish state. But the attack, mostly launched from inside Iran, caused only modest damage in Israel as most were shot down with the help of the US, Britain and Jordan. European oil and gas stocks have jumped by more than 1%, following the warning that Iran is preparing to launch an “imminent” ballistic missile attack on Israel. Financial shares are weaker, though, with the European bank stocks index down 2% and on track for its biggest daily drop in eight weeks. The oil price has now firmly shaken off its earlier losses, and pushed higher, following reports that the US believes that Iran is “preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel”. Associated Press has reported that a senior U.S. administration official has said Iran is preparing to “imminently” launch a ballistic missile attack on Israel, and warned Tuesday of “severe consequences” should it take place. AP reports: The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence, said the U.S. is actively supporting Israeli defensive preparations. This comes after the Israeli military on Tuesday warned people to evacuate nearly two dozen Lebanese border communities hours after announcing what it said were limited ground operations against Hezbollah. White House officials did not immediately offer any evidence backing its intelligence finding. The official added that the administration was confident in the determination. Iran’s state media has not suggested any attack is imminent. Iranian officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Iran already launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April, but few of the Iranian projectiles reached their targets. Many were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition, while others apparently failed at launch or crashed while in flight. Even those that reached Israel appeared to miss their marks, experts and an AP analysis in September showed. Our liveblog has full coverage of the crisis: Brent crude, which had been down over 1% earlier, briefly below $70/barrel, is now up over 2.6% at $73.61 per barrel. The US dollar, a classic safe-haven asset, is also rallying, as are government bonds. Airline shares are now falling, while shares in weapons maker BAE Systems are up 2.5%. Sky News are reporting that Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is drawing up plans for a visit to China early next year. They say the trip would include resuming a key financial services trade summit for the first time since 2019. As Sky point out, it would be Reeves’ first trip to China since Labour’s general election victory, at a time when Britain is weighing up whether it should follow the EU and US by also imposing tariffs on electric vehicle imports from China. A government spokesperson said: “Last week, the chancellor spoke with vice premier He Lifeng to discuss enhancing economic and financial cooperation and communication. “They agreed to take forward discussions on timings and areas that could be covered in future engagement.” UK-China relations have deteriorated in recent years, following Beijing’s crackdown on democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, concerns about human rights abuses against the Uyghur community in Xinjiang and national security worries about Chinese involvement in UK critical infrastructure. The Middle East conflict won’t hit global oil market, one of the world’s biggest oil traders has claimed. Torbjörn Törnqvist, the CEO of Gunvor Group, has said he was “very confident” that the escalating conflict would not have “any impact at all on oil supply”. Törnqvist told the Gulf Intelligence Energy: “I’m very confident that this will not have any impact at all on oil supply. “We have a situation around the Red Sea, Yemen, but by and large it’s more like a nuisance, but not really disruptive in any way. Törnqvist also flagged that the market was more worried about weak demand. Back in the markets, the oil price has now recovered from its earlier losses, with Brent crude now flat at $72.31 per barrel. Despite recent falls in UK business confidence, City firm Columbia Threadneedle has predicted the pound will recover to its highest level since the 2016 Brexit vote. Bloomberg reports that Steven Bell, Columbia Threadneedle’s chief EMEA economist, has predicted that sterling will move toward $1.50 next year. The forecast is based on the prospect that the UK will have comparatively high interest rates, as the Bank of England is more cautious about cutting borrowing costs due to inflation fears. Bloomberg explain: Bell’s prediction implies the pound stands to strengthen almost 13% from its current level around $1.33, already near the highest in two and a half years. The UK currency is the best-performer in the G-10 this year, advancing nearly 5% versus the greenback. Bell shrugged off concerns that the tax hikes and austerity measures expected in the UK budget at the end of the month will derail the pound’s gains. With higher taxes likely centered around capital gains, their impact on demand will be limited and are unlikely to shake consumer confidence, he said. On the night of the EU referendum eight years ago, the pond briefly touched $1.50, before plunging to $1.32, and then to $1.20 by January 2017. After the mini-budget two years ago, it briefly hit an alltime low of $1.038. The former chair of the Post Office has warned of another Horizon-style scandal if the s0-called “untouchable” investigators and executives involved in the prosecution of subpostmasters are not fired before the organisation rolls out its new IT system. Henry Staunton, who was sacked by the former business secretary Kemi Badenoch in January, told the inquiry into the scandal on Tuesday that there remains millions of pounds still in dispute between what subpostmasters have recorded and what the Post Office has in their records. Staunton said that before the replacement for the Horizon system is implemented in the future, which itself is full of bugs and has seen projected costs double to more than £800m, the Post Office must deal with staff involved in wrongful prosecution of more than 700 subpostmasters. “This is not something that relates to the past, it is something that relates to the future,” he said: “Before we implement [the new] Horizon we will be doing a path-clearing exercise. There are millions of pounds in dispute between postmasters and what is on their records and what is in the Post Office account.” The inquiry has previously heard about the so-called “untouchables” within the organisation, a phrase attributed to outgoing chief executive Nick Read, referring to a group of Post Office investigators who would never face disciplinary action relating to the Horizon IT scandal. Saf Ismail, one of two subpostmasters who sit on the current board of the Post Office, has also referred to a “red” list of 23 other employees deemed high-risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or other, none of whom who have even been suspended. “There are these people called the ‘Untouchables’ in the investigations team, or ‘reds’ or whatever,” said Staunton. He explained: “[They were] Involved with all the issues in the past of finding postmasters guilty. I am very afraid if [subpostmasters] are investigated [after the new IT system is implemented] by the so-called untouchables we could have another debacle - not to the same extent - but we could have hundreds of subpostmasters having to pay out monies. This is a big issue going forward, the involvement of the untouchables.” Staunton said that Read, who is due to appear at the inquiry for three days next week, had used the phrase “Untouchables” to him in a private conversation. He added that Read also used the phrase in a meeting with all of the Post Office’s non-executive directors. Asked by counsel for the inquiry what exactly he understood an “Untouchable” employee was, Staunton said: “They are people that were involved in prosecuting postmasters previously and are still in their roles,” he said. “And therefore would be involved in any future investigations. [They were] classified under various colours, the same as so-called reds, and would be involved in future investigations. And that seems utterly wrong.” There are 48 people employed in the investigations team, the inquiry heard, although how many of them are considered “Untouchables” is unknown. Here’s a list of the 17 Dobbies garden centres that are to close (see earlier post): Larger stores Altrincham, Greater Manchester Antrim, Northern Ireland Gloucester, Gloucestershire Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Harlestone Heath, Northamptonshire Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire Inverness, Scotland King’s Lynn, Norfolk Pennine, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire Reading, Berkshire Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire Little Dobbies Cheltenham, Gloucestershire Chiswick, Greater London Clifton , Bristol Richmond, Greater London Stockbridge, Edinburgh, Scotland Westbourne Grove, Greater London Dawn has broken at ports on the East Coast of the US, where around 45,000 workers began a strike at midnight last night. Dockworkers at 36 ports from Maine to Texas hit picket lines early this morning, in a dispute over wages and automation. Here’s the scene: The pre-market drop in Boeing’s shares today also follows news that more than 40 foreign operators of 737 airplanes may be using planes with rudder components that may pose safety risks. The warning came from the US National Transportation Safety Board, which last week issued urgent safety recommendations about the potential for a jammed rudder control system on some Boeing 737 airplanes after a February incident involving a United flight. The NTSB also disclosed on Monday that it had learned that two foreign operators suffered similar incidents in 2019 involving rollout guidance actuators. “We are concerned of the possibility that other airlines are unaware of the presence of these actuators on their 737 airplanes,” NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said Monday in a letter to Federal Aviation Administration chief Mike Whitaker. Investment bank Peel Hunt has said finance deals activity has slowed in recent weeks, amid uncertainty around the upcoming autumn Budget and the US election. In a trading statement this morning, Peel Hunt said: Market activity has slowed again in recent weeks ahead of the upcoming Budget and US election. Consequently, despite better first half revenues, we expect full year performance to be in line with market expectations and we remain well positioned across all parts of our business to take advantage of increased activity when market confidence returns. Inflation is no longer of concern in the euro area. So declares analysts at Nomura this morning, after consumer price inflation fell below the ECB’s 2% target. They predict that euro area disinflation will continue in earnest during this and next year. Nomura told clients: Part of the rationale for expecting underlying momentum in inflationary pressures to continue abating is based on our expectation of weak domestic demand. We believe the consumer-led recovery that many forecasters expect is increasingly unlikely to happen (the Bloomberg consensus expects consumer spending growth of 1.4% y-o-y by the end of 2025, we expect half that). Consumers have less available cash than prior to the pandemic, real wage growth is slowing more sharply than expected, and consumption confidence remains notably weak. Garden centre group Dobbies is to shut 17 stores, in a move which will hit 465 jobs, PA Media reports. Dobbies Garden Centres said the proposed closures are part of a restructuring plan to help return the business to profit and reduce its rent bill. The plan, which will need approval by creditors, will see the firm shut 11 larger Dobbies sites and six little Dobbies by the end of the year. Sites will continue to operate as normal until the restructuring process is given the green light. Mothercare has suspended trading in its shares as the maternity and babywear brand has been forced to delay publication of its annual accounts while it attempts to finalise a refinancing package. The group, which no longer has its own stores in the UK – only outlets in Boots stores – but trades from more than 500 stores and 50 websites run by franchise partners across 32 countries, said it was unable to publish its annual results by a deadline of 30 September but expected to do so “in the next few weeks”. The company said it was looking to raise funds from the sale of “certain IP assets”, likely to include some brand names, as well as talking to its lender. Mothercare, which is listed on London’s Aim junior stock market, has been attempting to renegotiate the terms of a lending facility to reduce costs for at least a year. The group, which was once a stalwart of UK high streets before it shut all stores in the country in 2019, has seen its share price has slump more than 50% in the past year to just 3.4p, valuing it at just £20m. In a previous statement issued in May, the company said the loan had reached £19.7m, up from £19.5m last September, on which it was paying 19.2% interest and which would require waivers on lending terms given poor sales in its key middle east market which now accounts for nearly half the group’s sales. The company said in May it was also looking at financing alternatives to including offering lenders a stake in the business. On Tuesday it added: “the challenges facing our Middle Eastern operations” remained “broadly unchanged”. Over at the Horizon IT Inquiry, the former chair of the Post Office has said that there was no interest at all in the exoneration of postmasters, and that the organisation and the government “dragged their feet” making compensation payments. Henry Staunton, who was sacked by the former business secretary Kemi Badenoch in January, said that his first impression upon taking up the role in late 2022 was that there wasn’t an acceptance among management of the conclusions of damning High Court judgements that the Post Office had been wrong to pursue prosecutions. “They didn’t fully accept it, that was my impression, that somehow the case hadn’t been put well or whatever,” said Staunton, giving testimony at the public inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal on Tuesday. “There wasn’t a feeling that this was absolutely wrong, [what] had happened. It was a feeling across the piece with the team.” He also said that from his first meeting it was obvious that the Horizon IT system was “completely and utterly unreliable”. Staunton, who has accused the last government of wanting to delay payments to postmasters until after the general election, said that his second takeaway when he started was that there was “No appetite at all for exoneration.Those were the two things that came through strongly to me”. He described the Post Office’s investigations department as “powerful” and “quite brutal” in the way they dealt with subpostmasters. Staunton said that he was shocked at the attitude of the remediation process designed to evaluate and compensate postmasters. He cited examples including a reluctance to “pause” subpostmasters having to repay money while they were being evaluated in the scheme as that might result in more subpostmasters coming forward to join the scheme. “What surprised me was we shouldn’t not be doing something because it would generate claims,” he said. “That is not the basis the remediation committee should be working. I formed a view over a period of months regarding bureaucracy and an unsympathetic and adversarial approach.” This same attitude was taken when a discussion about expanding the scheme relating to a death in the family of a postmaster. He said: “The view was if we widened the principles we open ourselves up to more claims. That seemed pretty unsympathetic to me. With respect to remediation the government and Post Office were dragging their heels.” Staunton added that one Post Office executive said that the organisation did not owe the same duty of care to subpostmasters as it did to the organisation’s own employees. After all they have been through “we owed them a greater duty of care compared to our own employees,” Staunton said. Shares in aerospace manufacturer Boeing are down around 0.7% in pre-market trading, following a report that it plans to issue new stock. Bloomberg is reporting that Boeing is considering raising at least $10bn by selling new stock, as the planemaker seeks to replenish cash reserves depleted further by the ongoing strike which began last month. They add: The company is working with advisers to explore its options, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing confidential matters. Raising equity isn’t likely to happen for at least a month, assuming the planemaker can resolve the strike, because Boeing wants a firm grasp of the financial toll from the walkout by 33,000 workers, the people said. Late last week the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said its pay deal talks with Boeing had broken off and that there were no further dates scheduled for negotiations at this time. Over in the US, the White House has said consumers will only feel a limited impact from the port strikes which began at midnight on the East Coast. In a statement, they say: “The President has directed his team to convey his message directly to both sides that they need to be at the table and negotiating in good faith - fairly and quickly.” The president has also directed his Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to meet every day and prepare to address potential disruptions, the statement added. Recent falls in energy prices could keep eurozone inflation lower than the European Central Bank has forecast, suggests GianLuigi Mandruzzato, senior economist at EFG Asset Management. Following this morning’s drop in eurozone inflation to 1.8%, Mandruzzato says: The fall of inflation below 2% year on year (yoy) for the first time in more than three years opens room for the ECB to cut rates again on October 17. The September flash estimates of 1.8% yoy for the headline and 2.7% yoy for core inflation mean that both of them were lower for the quarter than the ECB projected three weeks ago. Furthermore, the lower starting point for the fourth quarter and developments in energy prices point to a much lower inflation in the next few months than the ECB expected, further supporting the case for cutting rates sooner rather than later. Yet, services inflation at 4% yoy remains too high for comfort and warrants a gradual recalibration of monetary policy in the euro area. The drop in inflation last month could help to shift the European Central Bank’s focus onto the lacklustre growth environment in the eurozone, rather than price pressures. ING economist Bert Colijn says: The ECB knew that this inflation print would come in weak as President Christine Lagarde mentioned at the September press conference but it still came in a tad weaker than most analysts had expected. While a bounce back in the fourth quarter has been expected, the question is to what extent this can materialise as petrol prices have been dropping quickly on the back of falling oil prices. With core inflation slowly dropping at this point, it looks like the 2% target in the medium term is achievable. Recent survey data has confirmed slowing selling price expectations from businesses. This is mainly because of weak demand as the same surveys indicate that growth is slowing from an already modest pace in the second quarter. Since the summer, concerns about inflation have made way for concerns about economic growth. As the ECB seems quite convinced that inflation is on track towards 2%, the question is now how fast it wants to move interest rates back to neutral. If it keeps interest rates restrictive for too long with the economy already slowing, it risks pushing inflation below its 2% target. With growth under pressure now, it seems that the door is open for the ECB to move faster. While it does not seem like a done deal, it does bring the October meeting into play for a possible step up in easing. The oil price is falling today, which could keep European inflation pegged lower. Brent crude has dropped by 1.75% so far today to $70.44 per barrel, the lowest in almost three weeks, despite rising tensions in the Middle East today. Oil appears to be being pulled lower by the prospect of increased supplies, with the Opec+ group set to increase output in December. Fears that slowing economic growth would hit demand for energy have also pushed the oil price lower. This has helped oil traders overlook the news that Israel has launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon. Joshua Mahony, analyst at Scope Markets, says: With OPEC reconvening once again this week, there is a fear that we are set for a fresh reminder of the worsening supply situation in the event that the group raise production in December as planned. Recent rumours have been circulating that Saudi Arabia want to reestablish their position by taking back market share from the US, and thus markets will be watching closely for any indication of future output. For markets, the continued weakness seen in energy markets does help depress inflation expectations, although traders will also be wary of the reflection this has on global economic activity. Core inflation is running above the ECB’s 2% inflation target, though. The core CPI rate, which strips out energy, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco, dropped to 2.7% in September from 2.8% in August, Eurostat reports today. Michael Field, European market strategist at Morningstar, says: “Core inflation, the measure that strips out volatile components such as fuel and food, also fell by 0.1% to 2.7%. Granted, this number remains materially higher than the 2% targeted inflation level, however, it is at least moving in the right direction. “With inflation seemingly settling at or around where we need it to be and unemployment stable, the ECB should be reaffirmed in its course of action. Expectations of one more cut before the end of 2024 are very achievable, given the data.” Inflation across the eurozone has fallen below the official 2% target for the first time in three years, which may prompt further cuts to eurozone interest rates later this month. Statistics body Eurostat estimates that annual inflation across the euro area was 1.8% in September 2024, down from 2.2% in August. That’s the lowest reading for eurozone inflation since spring 2021, and the first time since June 2021 that CPI inflation has been below the European Central Bank’s 2% target. Price rises eased thanks to a drop in energy costs. Energy inflation was -6% in the year to September (meaning costs were lower than a year ago). Services inflation slowed to 4% from 4.1% in August, while food, alcohol &amp; tobacco inflation rose to 2.4% from 2.3%. Goods price inflation was unchanged at 0.4%. Natasha May, global market analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says today’s data “paves the way” for another ECB rate cut this month. While a decline in headline inflation was widely expected, the fall was accompanied by early signs of easing price pressures in services. Alongside recently weaker activity data – which implies weaker longer-term inflation – this makes the case for speedier policy normalisation. “More broadly, the eurozone rebound anticipated in early 2024 has turned out to be quite tepid. Consumers were expected to gain confidence from real income gains, driving a pick-up in spending. But confidence remains somewhat depressed and the manufacturing sector still looks very weak, raising the risk of inflation undershooting the ECB’s 2% target in the medium term. Today’s release should give the ECB more confidence that shorter-term price pressures are normalising, and therefore that interest rates should be normalised faster too.” The ECB has cut interest rates twice this year, in June and September; it’s next monetary policy meeting is 17 October. UK manufacturers also reported that their new export orders fell last month. Subdued market conditions in Europe were the main factor weighing on overseas demand, with France and Germany the principal concerns. Lower demand from US clients was also cited. Newsflash: Worries about this month’s budget, and the Middle East crisis, have hit confidence across UK manufacturing last month. Data provider S&amp;P Global has reported that business confidence among factory bosses fell to a nine-month low last month, and at the fastest pace since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the UK four and a half years ago. They say that the autumn budget led to a “wait-and-see approach” to decision making, with production and new business slowing last month. [That fits with this morning’s warning from the Institute of Directors that bosses are gloomier, following the warnings that Rachel Reeves’s first budget will be tough]. Although output and new order growth eased, S&amp;P’s UK manufacturing PMI has remained in growth territory at 51.5, down from August’s 26-month high of 52.5. That suggests there was a “solid expansion” in the UK manufacturing sector last month. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says: “The UK manufacturing sector is still expanding at a solid, albeit slightly slower, pace. Output rose for the fifth successive month in September, underpinned by a resilient domestic market. However, manufacturers have become more nervous about the outlook, suggesting that the current spell of impressive growth is fading, with business optimism about the year-ahead slumping to a nine-month low. The extent of the drop in confidence was striking, beaten only by that seen in March 2020 prior to COVID lockdowns. Uncertainty about the direction of government policy ahead of the coming Autumn Budget was a clear cause of the loss of confidence, especially given recent gloomy messaging, though firms are also worried about wider global geopolitical issues and economic growth risks. The PMI survey has also showed that input cost inflation accelerated to a 20-month high last month, which led manufacturers to further push up their selling prices. Dobson explains: Freight cost rises are a big factor underlying the resurgence in the price measures, as supply chains continue to feel the strain of the Red Sea crisis and global conflicts.” More takeover drama, this time in the UK, where handbag maker Mulberry has rejected an £83m takeover proposal from Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group. Mulberry has slapped down Ashley’s offer, insisting instead that it would push on with a planned fundraising to support a turnaround. The luxury brand said it had considered the approach carefully and consulted its 56.1% majority shareholder Challice, controlled by the Singaporean entrepreneur Christina Ong, who had “no interest” in pursuing the possible offer. Frasers, which owns Sports Direct, Evans Cycles, the House of Fraser department stores and multiple other retail brands from Slazenger to Jack Wills, has a 36.8% stake in Mulberry. On Monday, it said it was making an offer for the rest of the company worth 130p a share, pitting itself against its rival large shareholder. The Mulberry board said on Tuesday it believed the recent appointment of Andrea Baldo as chief executive, along with the emergency £10.75m share placing announced late on Friday, “provides the company with a solid platform to execute a turnaround”. “In light of this, the board has concluded that the possible offer does not recognise the company’s substantial future potential value. In addition, the board has been informed that Challice is supportive of the company’s strategy.” Frasers has been given a “put up or shut up” deadline of 5pm on 28 October to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Mulberry, or walk away. Factory production across the eurozone has shrunk at the fastest pace so far this year, according to the latest poll of purchasing managers. Production, new orders, employment and procurement activity all fell at a faster rate last month, data firm S&amp;P Global had reported. This pulled its eurozone manufacturing PMI index down to 45.0 in September, from August’s 45.8, but slightly higher than the ‘flash’ reading last week. That’s a nine-month low, and further below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. The eurozone was dragged down by its two largest members; Germany recorded the worst decline in factory conditions for 12 months, while France’s manufacturing also contracted. Spain, though, recorded its fastest growth in four months. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, says: “It is a real shame that Spain is only the fourth-largest economy in the eurozone. While handling the global manufacturing downturn surprisingly well, Spain just does not have enough weight to lift the rest of the eurozone with it. The worsening industrial slump in Germany, for example, is too big for Spain’s momentum in September to make much of a difference. According to our nowcast model, eurozone industrial production will likely drop by around 1% in the third quarter compared to the last one. With incoming orders plummeting fast, we can expect another dip in production by year-end. UK business leaders are growing more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy, the Institute of Directors (IoD) has warned. The IoD Directors’ Economic Confidence Index, released this morning, has fallen to -38 points for September, down from -12 in August. That’s the lowest reading since December 2022, when the UK economy was recovering from the shock of the mini-budget. Business leader confidence in their own organisations also fell from to +23 in August to +15 in September, having already dropped from +36 in July. Bosses are reining in their investment plans, the IoD reports, and trimming their recruitment plans. Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “Business confidence and investment expectations both took a further and larger dive in September. IoD members cite ongoing concerns over likely tax increases, the cost of workers’ rights, international competitiveness, broader cost pressures and the general outlook for UK economic growth. “There are a number of policy announcements forthcoming which could help foster a more supportive environment for growth and investment, and underpin an improvement in business confidence. In the next few weeks we expect to see more detail on industrial strategy, the business tax roadmap and a likely update to the fiscal rules to better recognise the contribution of public sector investment to the UK’s asset base. These all have the potential to create a more steady environment for business decision-makers in the UK.” The IoD’s survey follows similar recent polls which have shown a drop in both consumer and business confidence, following warnings that the budget later this month will include tax rises. There’s takeover drama in Germany this morning. Abu Dhabi state oil giant ADNOC has agreed to buy German chemicals producer Covestro in a €14.7bn deal. It’s one of the biggest foreign takeovers by a Gulf state, as ADNOC tries to transform itself into a fully integrated energy company. Over in the US, dockworkers on the East Coast and Gulf Coast have begun a strike that will disrupt about half the country’s ocean shipping. The port workers’ first large-scale stoppage in nearly 50 years began after negotiations for a new work contract broke down over the issue of wages. The strike blocks everything from food to automobile shipments across dozens of ports from Maine to Texas, in a disruption analysts warned will cost the economy billions of dollars a day, threaten jobs, and stoke inflation. Workers began picketing at the port of Philadelphia shortly after midnight, the Associated Press reported, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and chanting, “No work without a fair contract.” The port of Virginia also confirmed the work stoppage.

In a trading update today, Greggs says that it now expects the overall level of cost inflation for 2024 to be towards the lower end of the 4-5% range which it had previously expected. Greggs adds that: Whilst acknowledging ongoing economic uncertainty, the Board expects the full year outcome to be in line with its previous expectations. Greggs has reported that total sales rose by 10.6% in the last quarter, to the end of September, a slowdown on the 12.7% sales growth during 2024 so far. Greggs also reports that its autumn menu is now available, including an All-Day Breakfast Baguette and Mexican Bean &amp; Spicy Cheese Flatbread. It adds: We’ve also introduced a Pumpkin Spice Doughnut to our sweet range, complementing the return of our seasonal drinks range including the Pumpkin Spice Latte and Salted Caramel Latte which are both also available as part of our over ice range. There is some relief for households, though – shop prices are falling at the fastest rate in three years. Despite an increase in food inflation, overall prices in the shops fell by 0.6% in the year to September, twice as fast as the 0.3% deflation recorded in August, according to the British Retail Consortium. Non-food prices were 2.1% cheaper than a year ago, while food inflation rose to 2.3% in September, up from 2.0% in August. Helen Dickinson OBE, chief executive of the BRC, says: “September was a good month for bargain hunters as big discounts and fierce competition pushed shop prices further into deflation. Shop Price inflation is now at its lowest level in over three years, with monthly prices dropping in seven of the last nine months. This was driven by non-food, with Furniture and Clothing showing the biggest drops in inflation as retailers tried to entice shoppers back. Food inflation edged up slightly as poor harvests in key producing regions led to higher prices for cooking oils and sugary products. “Easing price inflation will certainly be welcomed by consumers, but ongoing geopolitical tensions, climate change, and government-imposed regulatory costs could all reverse this trend Deflation means prices are lower than they were a year ago. But, of course, while the rate of price changes is negative, the level of prices is still much higher than before the surge of inflation began in 2021. Today’s energy price cap rise comes as the company responsible for keeping Great Britain’s lights on has returned to public ownership for the first time in over thirty years as it prepares to make the electricity system 95% carbon-free by 2030. Ownership of the electricity system operator has transferred from National Grid to the government to form a new National Energy System Operator (Neso) from today. The new publicly owned organisation, which will be responsible for Great Britain’s electricity and gas systems, is expected to map a route towards the government’s green energy goals. The government hopes that by bringing together gas and electricity under one publicly owned company, the new system operator can adopt a more strategic approach to achieving a clean power system by 2030. Neso’s chief executive, Fintan Slye, told the Observer that its roadmap would stop short of the Labour party’s pre-election pledge to create a “zero carbon electricity system” by 2030 in favour of a clean power target which is 95% free of carbon emissions. He said: “That means that by 2030 95% of the generation in Great Britain over the period of a year will be from clean power sources. And that means that the remaining 5% will come from unabated gas.”. Slye said the “hugely ambitious” target to create a clean power system by 2030 would require Britain “to do everything that we can do quicker - but also very, very differently as well”. Its roadmap towards 2030 is expected to include advice on reforming the regulation around planning and consenting and speeding up the grid connections process. Neso is also expected to work alongside GB Energy, a public company set up by the Labour government to invest in low-carbon energy, to help connect new generation projects with the electricity grid. The decision to remove the ESO from National Grid’s ownership was made under the previous Conservative government because of concerns over a conflict of interest relating to the operator’s role providing strategic advice to government officials. Here’s our profile of Slye, from last weekend’s Observer: The boss of Ovo Energy has called for sweeping changes to the UK’s energy bills system so they are subsidised for poorer households, as consumers face another rise in fuel costs this winter. Chief executive David Buttress told the PA news agency the Government should introduce a social tariff, something which is already used in the telecoms industry to help people who receive benefits like Universal Credit pay their broadband bills. The measure, which campaign groups have proposed for several years, would likely take the form of a targeted discount energy deal for poorer customers, and could be below the price of the cheapest available standard energy tariff. Buttress said: “A social tariff would allow us to address the cost of energy for the poorest in our communities in a way that means, collectively, we could give them the protection they need to get through the winter months.” The Resolution Foundation is warning today that 7.7 million households in England – including the majority of families with children – are at risk of “fuel stress” this winter. Their analysis of government data found that 37% of all households faced “fuel stress”, defined as families needing to spend more than 10% of their income on heating their homes excluding housing costs. It found that 77% of single-parent households are likely to experience “fuel stress” this winter, highlighting the impact of today’s increase in the energy price cap. Alex Clegg, economist at the Resolution Foundation, says this shows how poorly targeted Winter Fuel Payments are, and why alternative support will be needed this winter. Clegg adds: “Couples with children are more than twice as likely to experience fuel stress as pensioner households, so any new support should not be limited to pensioners. Reforming and expanding Cold Weather Payments offers a viable quick-fix solution to help keep households warm when the mercury drops this winter. “Looking beyond this winter, the Government should prioritise developing a social tariff and investing in energy efficiency for our homes. This would help to ensure that vulnerable families are insulated from future energy shocks, whatever their age or circumstances.” More here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It’s October, which means the nights are drawing in, the temperature is dropping, and arguments can begin about when to turn the heating on. But flicking the boiler on has just become more expensive, adding to the burden on millions of households as winter approaches. Average energy bills across Great Britain have just risen by £149 a year today, as the latest energy price cap kicks in. The cap, set each quarter by regulator Ofgem based on the wholesale price of energy, has just risen by 10% to £1,717 a year for an average dual-fuel household in Great Britain paying by direct debit. That’s an increase of almost £150 per year compared with the cap in April-June, based on the energy use for a typical household. And while the cap is lower than the £2,500 at which the last government froze maximum bills at the height of the energy crisis, it’s still sharply higher than in autumn 2021, when average bills were capped at £1,277 a year. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation is warning today that poorer families are already struggling to cope. JRF research has found that, back in May, 2.9 million low-income households had been unable to keep their home warm in the previous six months, while 4.3 million had fallen behind with their household bills. Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, says: “Today’s energy price cap rise looms over families who are forced to heat their homes less than they should. It is more than three years since energy prices started to rise, creating an unacceptable level of prolonged hardship for millions of families who are still paying well above what they were before the cost-of-living crisis started. This looks like another winter of sleeping in a coat, not showering, and only cooking once a week, to try to keep the bills down. “Families who already can’t pay their energy bills can no longer count on cost-of-living payments to provide any relief. We need to see an urgent plan for hardship at the upcoming Budget to stop those with the least going hungry and cold this winter.” Yesterday, a seperate survey warned that almost half of British adults will ration their energy use this winter.

          "headline": "Senior doctor ‘ashamed’ he failed to protect babies from Lucy Letby",
          "bodyText": "A senior doctor has said he is “ashamed” he failed to stop the nurse Lucy Letby from harming babies and that police should have been contacted a year earlier. John Gibbs told a public inquiry that doctors received “very firm pushback” from senior nurses when they raised growing suspicions about Letby in early 2016. Gibbs, the first of Letby’s colleagues to give evidence to the Thirlwall inquiry, said the response from nursing managers made it “more difficult” for consultants to demand action or contact the police. He told Lady Justice Thirlwall on Tuesday: “I do deeply regret and I am ashamed that I failed to protect the babies from harm by Letby but I do understand that the parents concerned would probably rather have explanations rather than belated apologies.” Letby, 34, was sentenced to 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted across two trials of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others at the Countess of Chester hospital in north-west England. The Thirlwall inquiry is examining whether the nurse could have been stopped earlier as well as the response of hospital executives. Some experts have questioned Letby’s convictions but that is outside the inquiry’s terms of reference. Gibbs, a retired consultant paediatrician, said it was a “serious failing” in hindsight that doctors failed to spot unusually high insulin levels in one of Letby’s victims until two years later. Letby was last year found guilty of attempting to murder Child F, a week-old twin boy, by poisoning him with insulin on 5 August 2015. In the previous two months the nurse had murdered four newborns and attempted to kill another. Gibbs told the inquiry that insulin results indicating that Child F had been deliberately injected with insulin were seen by doctors a week after the test in August 2015 but they “didn’t understand the significance” of them. He added: “I don’t think it’s fair to say [that] just those few doctors who saw those results didn’t respond appropriately. We all had an opportunity to look at those results.” Gibbs, who worked at the Countess of Chester hospital from 1994 to 2019, said the concern of doctors grew in early 2016 after a number of other unexplained incidents. However, he said the consultants were receiving “very firm pushback” from senior nursing managers who said suspicions about Letby were “utterly wrong” and that doctors were maligning a “very competent” nurse. Asked by Nicholas de la Poer KC, on behalf of the counsel for the inquiry, why those suspicions did not prompt “immediate action” at this point, Gibbs said: “Yes, it should have done but perhaps I was, and maybe we were … influenced by the conviction that we were wrong from the nursing side.” He added: “I regret that we, or I, didn’t go to the police at this time after the thematic review. Why didn’t I go straight to police? Why didn’t paediatricians go straight to the police? “I know the parents of the later babies will not thank us for this [but] the suspicion was that there might be something that had affected a number of babies on the unit and it would be best managed through senior execs on the trust.” Gibbs went on to say that the “strong assertion” from senior nurses that Letby was innocent “influenced me but did not convince me”. He added that this conviction from senior nurses, coupled with the desire not to put parents “through the agony of a murder investigation” if Letby was innocent, explained why he did not contact the police in early 2016. Letby was convicted of the June 2016 murder of two triplet boys – months after these concerns were raised – before she was eventually removed from the neonatal unit the following month. Cheshire constabulary was contacted by hospital executives nearly a year later in May 2017. The inquiry is expected to sit at Liverpool town hall until early next year, with findings published by late autumn 2025."

          "headline": "Harry’s Bar owner sues Venice city council over waves from speeding boats",
          "bodyText": "The Harry’s Bar culinary empire is as synonymous with Venice as its canals, inventing the bellini cocktail and hosting noted guests including Orson Welles, Ernest Hemingway and Charlie Chaplin during its 93 years in business. But the lapping of the city’s waters has proved too much for the owner, Arrigo Cipriani, who is suing the city’s council and port master’s office because the feet of his well-heeled customers keep getting soaked by waves from speeding boats. Cipriani, 92, said he was fed up with the alleged failure by the authorities to take serious action against an issue that has long caused protests from Venice’s residents. Cipriani owns Harry’s Bar in St Mark’s Square but boats speeding along the Giudecca canal are hampering customers’ enjoyment on the terrace of his other establishment, Harry’s Dolci on the island of Giudecca. He opted to take legal action, an unprecedented move that is likely to prompt further cases, after a request to erect “splash guards” was rejected by Venice’s heritage superintendent. “More and more often those sitting at Harry’s Dolci find themselves with wet feet due to the waves from the Giudecca canal, which are caused by boats whizzing by without respecting the speed limits,” he told Corriere della Sera. Cipriani argued that the waves in the Giudecca canal were becoming “increasingly higher”. He added: “It’s a serious problem for those who walk along the banks because they are slippery, for those with a small boat because it is difficult to stay on course, and for those who row because rowing has become increasingly dangerous. The wave swell problem has worsened because leaders do not know the city. Those who break the speed limit should be fined.” Spokespeople for Venice council were not immediately available for comment. The authorities in Venice said at the beginning of this year that that speed cameras would be placed along the length of the city’s waterways, which are often crowded with a mix of gondolas, water buses, water taxis and other vessels. The speed limit – imposed after a series of accidents – is up to 7km/h along the city’s main canals and 5km/h in the small ones but it appears to be having little effect. Activists from Gruppo Insieme, a collective of associations that for several years has been protesting against speeding boats, said they would meet on Tuesday to prepare a report that will be presented to the judiciary listing every single infringement of the city’s navigation code. Massimo Brunzin, a spokesperson for the group, told Corriere: “It is no longer possible to navigate safely. We are witnessing a continuous drip of accidents, also because there is a lack of any effective form of control or sanction.” The accidents have occasionally been deadly. Three people were killed in September 2019 when a high-speed power boat trying to set a speed record crashed into an artificial reef in the Venetian lagoon. In 2013, a German tourist died when the gondola he was travelling in was crushed against a dock by a reversing water bus. Gondoliers often protest against water taxis and speedboats, arguing that their reckless driving risks lives as they whip up waves that rock the smaller vessels. The waves also cause damage to the buildings lining the city’s canals. Venice’s port master declined to comment on Cipriani’s legal action, but stressed that “the coast guard carries out deterrence and speed moderation of nautical traffic activities throughout the year”."

          "headline": "UK business confidence dips to lowest level since general election",
          "bodyText": "UK business confidence has dropped to its lowest level since the general election, as firms grow more pessimistic about the economic outlook. Amid fears that the Labour government’s warnings of a tough budget in October have hurt the economy, the latest Lloyds Bank Business Barometer has found that business optimism weakened this month to its lowest level since June. Business optimism had hit eight-year highs in July and August, after solid economic growth in the first half of 2024. But Lloyds’ latest survey, carried out in the first half of September, found that confidence fell three points to 47%, a three-month low, but still above the long-term average of 29%. The decline was down to mounting concerns about the economy: while 57% of businesses felt confident, 19% were less positive. This caused a nine-point fall in the net balance of economic optimism, to 38%, the lowest since March. “Although overall confidence fell this month, that fall was from an eight-year high, and businesses remain positive about their own trading prospects,” said Hann-Ju Ho, a senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. “The more mixed picture for economic optimism points to some businesses maintaining a degree of caution. While we still expect economic expansion, it may occur at a slower rate than the first half of 2024,” Ho warned. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has already said October’s budget will require “difficult decisions on tax, spending and welfare”, while also hinting last week that she could relax the government’s self-imposed fiscal rules to prioritise investment. Last week, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation reported a sharp drop in confidence among employers about hiring in August, while the British Retail Consortium found that consumer confidence fell significantly in September. A separate survey from KPMG released on Monday found that three-quarters of financial services leaders expected the budget to have at least a moderate impact on their business. More than a quarter of bosses surveyed across the banking, insurance, asset and wealth management, and private equity sectors expect a significant impact, according to KPMG’s latest UK Financial Services Sentiment Survey. Almost one-third of leaders expect the biggest impact to be sector-specific tax increases such as bank surcharges. More than a quarter expect an impact on payroll costs, while 19% say tax changes to non-doms will affect their business. “Leaders in the sector are gearing up for this budget to have a considerable impact on their business,” said Karim Haji, the global and UK head of financial services for KPMG. “While there are notable expectations about sectoral tax rises, leaders will hope for a period of stability thereafter to ensure the current tax regime for financial services remains competitive,” Haji said. British banks, which have enjoyed bumper profits in recent years thanks to higher interest rates, have been lobbying the government not to increases taxes on the sector. It emerged last week that Reeves is rethinking parts of Labour’s crackdown on super-rich non-domiciles, amid concerns inside the Treasury that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) may conclude the plans will raise no money at all and could prompt wealthy foreigners to leave the UK. KPMG found that bosses view inflation pressures as the biggest business challenge over the rest of the year, followed by interest rates. However, they remain upbeat about the prospects for business growth and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2024. Haji said: “While leaders are also optimistic about the economic outlook, the knock-on effects of a turbulent economy continue to weigh on their businesses. “Leaders are dealing with a myriad of challenges and it’s easy to see how the more immediate, closer-to-home issues could detract from challenges that pose a greater threat to business longer term, such as ESG and technology advancements.”"

DC Williams has long given up on predicting what the day will bring on Interstate 5 near Tejon Pass, an eight-lane stretch of highway that winds through the steep mountains north of Los Angeles. Williams has been an officer with the California Highway Patrol and worked in this area for 11 years. On a chilly day this spring, he wore a thick black jacket even as he sat inside his Ford Explorer on a bridge overlooking the highway. Below us lay one of the most crucial roads in the state. Traversed by more than 80,000 vehicles every day, from recreational motorists to trucks hauling heavy goods, this 40-mile stretch of Interstate 5, for more than half a century, has been the fastest route linking the bustling metropolis to the flat expanses of the Central valley, the state’s agricultural hub. Californians call this place “the Grapevine”. For most motorists, the handful of gas stations, antique shops and an old army outpost that dot the area are something to get past – a literal mountain to be climbed – on their way to more populated parts of the golden state. But for those willing to see it, the Grapevine offers something else: a window onto the effects of extreme weather as a changing climate brings more storms, more flames, more landslides and more flooding. The impacts on the highway are inescapable and far-reaching. The thoroughfare is regularly shut down due to snow or ice. Historic rains have led to landslides and wiped out portions of the road while in the summer, wildfires can be seen from passing vehicles. The closures, however brief, are highly disruptive – shifting tens of thousands of travelers east and west and creating severe traffic jams and grueling hours-long delays. The intensifying weather has made working here a daily challenge, with no sense of what the seasons could bring, Williams explained. As he spoke, snow fell over the highway, on a particularly cold day in April. Moments later, he’d step outside for an interview with a local news station about the conditions. “The weather is unpredictable. What’s going to happen up here is unpredictable,” Williams told me. *** Getting to southern California from Sacramento and San Francisco, or vice versa, almost always means going over the Grapevine. (Although the Grapevine technically only refers to a small portion of the route, most people know this section of the highway by that name). As a northern Californian who spent three years living in Los Angeles and who frequently traveled the Grapevine, I have long been occupied by its role as a portal for two disparate regions of the state. If you’re heading south, toward Los Angeles, the Grapevine emerges from the San Joaquin Valley like a sudden ladder into the sky. After leaving behind the orchards, cattle feed lots and dusty fields, the road climbs steeply up, as high as about 4,100ft. It winds through the mountains, usually covered in golden brown during the warmer months, and past the pines on the eastern edge of the Los Padres national forest. I’ve driven on the road dozens of times and have found it equal parts captivating and terrifying, depending on the weather. In the winter, rain can fall in thick sheets, making it impossible to see the cars speeding past, while the spring offers perfect balmy mornings and yellow, orange and purple wildflowers that drape the green hillsides for miles. This part of the mountains has been used as a travel route for hundreds of years. The community of Gorman, south of Tejon Pass, has been described by local historian Bonnie Kane as “one of the oldest continuously used trail and roadside rest stops in California”. Indigenous people traveling on an ancient trail system stopped in the settlement when it was a Tataviam tribe village, according to Kane, and the Spanish used the same trail. In the early 20th century, California built the first paved highway from Los Angeles to the Central valley, known as the Ridge Route, over the top of the mountains. Given a speed limit of 15mph, the journey from Los Angeles to Bakersfield, a distance of over 100 miles, took 12 hours. The road was precarious, notes Ridge Route historian Harrison Irving Scott, winding past hundreds of curves – including a particularly harrowing bend called “Deadman’s curve”. Drivers, often due to speed or brake failures, would sometimes plummet off the roadside into the canyon below, referred to as “the graveyard”, Scott noted in his book on the route. “Once you got on the Ridge Route, there was no place to get off,” Scott said. “Because of all the blind curves, they had plenty of head-on collisions. They would turn the wheel sharply and go down the cliff.” Interstate 5, a nearly 1,400-mile (2,253km) highway that runs from Mexico to Canada and cuts through the middle of California like a scalpel, eventually replaced the old highway. While it’s far safer than the Ridge Route, its steep winding curves, endless traffic and inclement weather have brought the highway its fair share of danger. In January, as fog covered the highway, two people died in a large pileup with dozens of vehicles. A few days later, the area was under a winter storm warning for snow and wind gusts of up to 80mph that the National Weather Service warned would lead to “very hazardous travel”. In warmer months, the area is prone to wildfires – this summer, the Post fire, which started just off the highway, scorched more than 15,000 acres (6,070 hectares). Then, there is the ever-present threat of earthquakes. The highway crosses over the intersection of the San Andreas and Garlock fault lines. After a 5.2-magnitude quake near Bakersfield shook the region in August, sending a large boulder off the mountainside and into the road, officials closed several lanes of the highway. In 2023, California was hit by torrential winter storms that killed at least 22 people. The immense rainfall damaged the highway, causing mud to flow into the roadway and leading to erosion that wiped away a portion of the road’s shoulder. The mountains are like a layer cake, but instead of frosting, it’s clay, said Scott, a retired engineer who has spent decades studying the Ridge Route: “There’s so many layers of dirt, clay, dirt, clay, and when it rains the clay becomes slippery and the road slides.” *** To better understand the impacts of extreme weather on the highway, I tagged along with Williams to see things first-hand. Los Angeles is defined by its perfectly moderate weather, with hundreds of days of sunshine and mild winters. But in early April, as I drove an hour north out of the city to meet Williams, the temperature dropped 30F. Over the afternoon in this rugged part of California, snow dusted the road and vehicles crawled through the mountains. Williams and I met inside the CHP office in Lebec, which features a large black-and-white photo of old cars strewn across a snow-covered road after a major storm on the highway, along with a file for Operation Snowflake (the official name for when the CHP shuts down the road). We drove through the mountain communities off the highway, where outsiders sometimes come to play in the snow, and then back on to the interstate, cars slowing as Williams passed. Speed is a constant problem, even in difficult conditions and with escorts, Williams said, as we headed north on the highway, among the passenger vehicles and the Amazon trucks and semis carrying commercial goods across the state. Williams pointed up at the mountains. On this Friday afternoon, they were a rich green. But in a few months, the hillsides, dotted with dirt paths and massive transmission lines, would dry out. “All this was on fire last year,” he said. “And see, it comes back, it burns, comes back, and it could burn again.” Those fires can ultimately increase the risk for slides, Michael Comeaux of CalTrans points out, as flames destroy vegetation leading to greater saturation of burned slopes and a looser, less stable surface. Eroding hillsides in the area are sending an increasing number of boulders tumbling down the mountain and into the roadway. Earlier in the spring, a massive rock hit the side of a patrol car. As extreme weather increases across the world amid the climate crisis, conditions on the Grapevine are likely to intensify. Last year, snow and ice prompted the highway patrol to close the road completely at least four times. That’s created logistical and cost headaches for CalTrans, the state agency responsible for managing California highways, which regularly works in the region to restore burned areas along the highway, including by hydroseeding, repairing the road and mitigating some of the sinking, Comeaux said. The agency spent $14m on an emergency project last year to build a retaining wall and rebuild a slope after heavy rain eroded part of the highway. When I got into my car to head back to Los Angeles, the snow began to pick up, forcing traffic to slow. Williams had said earlier in the day he didn’t foresee having to close the road, despite the flurries, but that that could change anytime. Eight hours after our drive, the early spring snowstorm would prompt officials to shut down the road and officers to escort thousands of vehicles up the mountain. “We’ve got our work cut out for us up here,” Williams said."

          "headline": "How to make the most of the forgotten thousands in child trust funds",
          "bodyText": "Is there a pot of thousands of pounds out there with your name on it? HM Revenue and Customs is better known for demanding money than dishing it out, but last week it urged hundreds of thousands of young people to come forward and “cash in their stash”. The tax authority says 671,000 people aged 18 to 22 have a child trust fund account that has matured, is worth £2,082 on average, and is sitting unclaimed. However, those 671,000 matured pots of cash represent a small fraction of the millions of child trust fund (CTF) accounts out there. The latest official data shows that there are about 4.2m CTF accounts in existence in total, though many of them appear to have been forgotten or neglected. In all, nearly £10bn is sitting in CTF accounts, several billion pounds of which is money that the government coughed up. And last week, parents and youngsters were being urged to use the HMRC announcement as a prompt to check how their CTF was getting on and to think about whether it would make more sense to transfer the cash to an account offering a better return and/or lower charges. What are CTFs? CTFs, nicknamed “baby bonds”, are long-term, tax-free accounts for children that were launched in 2005. More than 6.3m were opened before they were scrapped in 2011. They were replaced by junior Isas. Every child born between 1 September 2002 and 2 January 2011 was awarded a cash “endowment” of, typically, £250. Some children received top-up payments from the government, and family and friends have been able to pay money in, too. In autumn 2020 the first CTF children began turning 18, kicking off a multibillion-pound payout that will run all the way through until early 2029. It has been estimated that each month about 55,000 teenagers, about 1,800 a day, turn 18 and become entitled to a pot of cash with their name on it. The oldest CTF children – the ones who still haven’t claimed their pot of cash or transferred their account – turned 22 this month, while the youngest are 13 and a half. Roughly a third of that £10bn is money that was awarded by the government, with contributions from family and friends and investment growth/interest making up the rest. In terms of the accounts, broadly it was a choice between cash savings accounts and ones that predominantly invested in shares. The money is not held by the government but is in banks, building societies and other savings providers. It’s their cash With a CTF, the money belongs to the child, though they can only take it out when they are 18, at which point they can spend it, or reinvest it in an adult Isa. This is money that probably should be used wisely – perhaps invested, or to help with university or gap-year costs, or pay for driving lessons – but ultimately, once they reach 18, it can be spent on anything at all, which might mean they end up blowing it on freshers’ week partying or a boozy pals’ holiday. The unclaimed pots HMRC says thousands of CTF accounts belonging to 18- to 22-year-olds are sitting unclaimed, adding: “We want to reunite young people with their money, and we’re making the process as simple as possible.” Many youngsters will be unaware that there is a CTF account in their name. After all, they were opened a long time ago, and some parents will have simply forgotten about them and possibly moved house. In addition, their account might have been transferred to another provider a few years ago. If the young person (or their parents) already knows who their CTF provider is, they can simply contact them directly. If they don’t know where their account is, they can use the online tool on the gov.uk website to find out their provider. Young people will need their national insurance number and date of birth to get hold of the information. The Share Foundation, a charity, has been working with the government to help young people to find their accounts, and runs its own free-to-use search service. Go to findctf.sharefound.org and you will find a simple form you can fill in. If necessary, this will be forwarded to a special department at HMRC. To date, the Share Foundation has reunited more than 65,000 young people with their CTF accounts. Be aware that there are third-party companies advertising their services online who say they can help to track down people’s accounts, but they will always charge: HMRC says it found one asking for up to £350 or 25% of the value of the account. Do not pay to find your fund. If your child is under 18 The latest data shows that the vast majority of CTF accounts did not have any money paid into them during the 12 months from April 2023 to April 2024. That suggests that many have been forgotten. If you hold a CTF for your child, you have a number of options. For example, you can leave it as it is, or you could transfer it to another CTF provider. If you have a cash CTF, check what interest rate you are getting. If it is paltry, the Leicestershire-based Earl Shilton building society has one called a Cash Savings Account (Non-Stakeholder) that accepts transfers in and is currently paying 4.3%. It can be managed by post or at its branches. Since 2015, anyone with money in a CTF has been able to transfer it to a junior Isa, and for many that will probably be the wisest thing to do, as they will usually be able to get a better return. Top-paying junior cash Isas that accept transfers in from CTFs include the Stafford building society’s account, which pays 4.75%; Coventry building society’s Junior Cash Isa (2), which pays 4.7%; and Tesco Bank’s Junior Cash Isa paying 4%. Several smaller building societies have Junior Isas paying decent rates, but there are sometimes restrictions on who can open them. You can check the latest junior cash Isa rates and details on the website of the financial data provider Moneyfacts. Are you being overcharged? If you have an investment CTF, you may be paying too much in charges because junior investment Isas usually have lower fees. As highlighted by a parliamentary report published last year, many CTF providers are charging “huge sums” for managing the accounts, eating into people’s money, says Charlene Young, a savings expert at the investment platform AJ Bell. “The report indicates many accounts are charging 1.5% annually for a portfolio of passive funds, whereas a junior Isa on a modern platform might cost around 0.25%, plus the cost of a tracker, which can be as little as a few basis points,” she adds. On top of that, CTFs often offered a fraction of the investment choices available through junior Isas, many of which offer a vast range of funds, shares and other investments to choose from. A good first port of call for a Junior investment Isa may be a platform such as AJ Bell or Hargreaves Lansdown, both of which accept transfers in and have lots of useful information on their websites. Both firms will let you invest from £25 a month."

          "bodyText": "It’s nearly two years since OpenAI released ChatGPT on an unsuspecting world, and the world, closely followed by the stock market, lost its mind. All over the place, people were wringing their hands wondering: What This Will Mean For [enter occupation, industry, business, institution]. Within academia, for example, humanities professors agonised about how they would henceforth be able to grade essays if students were using ChatGPT or similar technology to help write them. The answer, of course, is to come up with better ways of grading, because students will use these tools for the simple reason that it would be idiotic not to – just as it would be daft to do budgeting without spreadsheets. But universities are slow-moving beasts and even as I write, there are committees in many ivory towers solemnly trying to formulate “policies on AI use”. As they deliberate, though, the callous spoilsports at OpenAI have unleashed another conundrum for academia – a new type of large language model (LLM) that can – allegedly – do “reasoning”. They’ve christened it OpenAI o1, but since internally it was known as Strawberry we will stick with that. The company describes it as the first in “a new series of AI models designed to spend more time thinking before they respond”. They “can reason through complex tasks and solve harder problems than previous models in science, coding, and math”. In a way, Strawberry and its forthcoming cousins are a response to strategies that skilled users of earlier LLMs had deployed to overcome the fact that the models were intrinsically “one-shot LLMs” – prompted with a single example to generate responses or perform tasks. The trick researchers used to improve model performance was called “chain-of-thought” prompting. This forced the model to respond to a carefully designed sequence of detailed prompts and thereby provide more sophisticated answers. What OpenAI seems to have done with Strawberry is to internalise this process. So whereas with earlier models such as GPT-4 or Claude, one would give them a prompt and they would quickly respond, with Strawberry a prompt generally produces a delay while the machine does some, er, “thinking”. This involves an internal process of coming up with a number of possible responses that are then subjected to some kind of evaluation, after which the one judged most plausible is chosen and provided to the user. As described by OpenAI, Strawberry “learns to hone its chain of thought and refine the strategies it uses. It learns to recognise and correct its mistakes. It learns to break down tricky steps into simpler ones. It learns to try a different approach when the current one isn’t working. This process dramatically improves the model’s ability to reason.” What this means is that somewhere inside the machine is a record of the “chain of thought” that led to the final output. In principle, this looks like an advance because it could reduce the opacity of LLMs – the fact that they are, essentially, black boxes. And this matters, because humanity would be crazy to entrust its future to decision-making machines whose internal processes are – by accident or corporate design – inscrutable. Frustratingly, though, OpenAI is reluctant to let users see inside the box. “We have decided,” it says, “not to show the raw chains of thought to users. We acknowledge this decision has disadvantages. We strive to partially make up for it by teaching the model to reproduce any useful ideas from the chain of thought in the answer.” Translation: Strawberry’s box is a just a slightly lighter shade of black. The new model has attracted a lot of attention because the idea of a “reasoning” machine smacks of progress towards more “intelligent” machines. But, as ever, all of these loaded terms have to be sanitised by quotation marks so that we don’t anthropomorphise the machines. They’re still just computers. Nevertheless, some people have been spooked by a few of the unexpected things that Strawberry seems capable of. Of these the most interesting was provided during OpenAI’s internal testing of the model, when its ability to do computer hacking was being explored. Researchers asked it to hack into a protected file and report on its contents. But the designers of the test made a mistake – they tried to put Strawberry in a virtual box with the protected file but they failed to notice that the file was inaccessible. According to their report, having encountered the problem, Strawberry then surveyed the computer used in the experiment, discovered a mistake in a misconfigured part of the system that it shouldn’t have been able to access, edited how the virtual boxes worked, and created a new box with the files it needed. In other words, it did what any resourceful human hacker would have done: having encountered a problem (created by a human error), it explored its software environment to find a way round it, and then took the necessary steps to accomplish the task it had been set. And it left a track that explained its reasoning. Or, to put it another way, it used its initiative. Just like a human. We could use more machines like this. What I’ve been reading Rhetoric questioned The Danger of Superhuman AI Is Not What You Think is a fabulous article by Shannon Vallor in Noema magazine on the sinister barbarism of a tech industry that talks of its creations as being “superhuman”. Guess again Benedict Evans has written an elegant piece, Asking the Wrong Questions, arguing that we don’t so much get our predictions about technology wrong as make predictions about the wrong things.

          "bodyText": "Thanks for following along today. At least nine people were killed in two consecutive Russian attacks on a hospital in Sumy. Initial shelling had killed one and damaged several floors of the building, but Russian forces struck again during the evacuation of the hospital’s patients, authorities said. At least 12 were reported injured in the attacks. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, one day after his meeting with Donald Trump in New York, condemned the Sumy attack. “Everyone in the world who speaks about this war must pay attention to what Russia is targeting,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “They are waging war on hospitals, civilian objects, and people’s lives. Only strength can force Russia into peace. Peace through strength is the only right way.” In addition to the nine killed on Saturday, at least seven other civilians were killed throughout Ukraine over the past 24 hours, authorities said. Four were killed in Kryvyi Rih after a Russian missile struck a five-storey police administration building on Friday – authorities completed rescue efforts there today. Of the four killed in Kryvyi Rih, three were police officers. Meanwhile, other missile and air strikes on residential areas of the Kherson, Donetsk and Odesa oblasts left dozens more injured. Russia is prepared to go to court over the Nord Stream pipeline explosions, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman saying on Saturday that Russia has filed “pre-trial claims” against Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. Maria Zakharova accused the West of attempting to “sweep the matter under the carpet”, maintaining that the explosions that ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipeline in September 2022 – seven months after Russia invaded Ukraine – “an egregious act of international terrorism”. NATO members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will seek European Union funding to build a network of bunkers, barriers, distribution lines and military warehouses along their borders with Russia and Belarus, Estonia’s officials have said. The three Baltic countries initially announced the plan for a “Baltic Defence Line” in January. In May, Poland announced a similar project called the “Eastern Shield” with a purpose to strengthen its borders with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus. Russia appears to be expending a “significant amount of effort” to influence the debate around allowing Ukraine to use Western-provided weapons to directly attack Russia, the Institute for the Study of War said. In a new analysis, the Institute noted that even a small number of successful Ukrainian long-range strikes on Russia “could have asymmetric impacts and prompt Russian forces to move significant military and storage facilities outside the range of Western-provided weapons”. In particular, Vladimir Putin has recently reintroduced several of the Kremlin’s previously most effective narratives into both the Western and Russian information spaces in recent weeks, the Institute said.

In May, Poland announced a similar project called the “Eastern Shield” with a purpose to strengthen its borders with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus. “The need for a (Baltic) defence line stems from the security situation and supports NATO’s new forward defence concept,” Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur said in a statement, adding that “it is extremely important to coordinate our activities with Poland.” At the same time, it strengthens the security of the European Union and the military defence of its borders, which is why we clearly see that the EU could also financially support the project. Here are some of the latest images coming in from the wires: At least nine people were killed in two consecutive Russian attacks on a hospital in Sumy.

Maria Zakharova accused the West of attempting to “sweep the matter under the carpet”, maintaining that the explosions that ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipeline in September 2022 – seven months after Russia invaded Ukraine – “an egregious act of international terrorism”. Australia’s ABC News is rejecting Moscow’s claims that two of its journalists acted illegally by entering the Ukrainian-occupied Kursk region in Russia. The Russian news agency Tass reported on Friday that the Russian Federal Security Service had “initiated and is investigating criminal cases” against the broadcaster’s Europe correspondent Kathryn Diss and camera operator Fletcher Yeung, as well as Romanian journalist Barbu Mircea, for the crime of “Illegal crossing of Russia’s State Border” – a crime punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. Diss and Yeung were escorted by a Ukrainian military unit to Sudzha in the Kursk region on 31 August, marking the first time the broadcaster had entered Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia has filed “pre-trial claims” against Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland over the Nord Stream pipeline explosions, accusing the West of trying to “sweep the matter under the carpet”, Reuters is reporting. The multi-billion dollar pipeline that carried natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea was ruptured by a series of blasts in September 2022, seven months after Russia invaded Ukraine. While no one has claimed responsibility for the explosions, Moscow – without providing evidence – has repeatedly accused the United States and the United Kingdom of carrying out the attacks. Both countries have denied the allegations. Last month, German prosecutors said they had issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diving instructor in Poland in connection with the attacks, though a spokesman for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denied any involvement from Kyiv. On Saturday, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the “pre-trial claims” that Russia has filed against Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland are based on the 1997 International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. “If the issue is not resolved at this stage, then Russia intends to take the matter to court and appeal to the International Court of Justice in connection with the violation by the countries in question of their obligations under the conventions,” she said. “Other states that may have something to do with the Nord Stream blasts are next in line. The West will not get away with the attempts to ‘sweep the matter under the carpet’.” She called the blasts “an egregious act of international terrorism that falls under a number of international treaties that establish obligations to prevent, suppress, investigate, prosecute and co-operate with other states to achieve these goals”. “Unfortunately, we see that these commitments are not being fulfilled, despite repeated appeals by Russia.” A ninth person has died following the consecutive Russian strikes on a hospital in Sumy today. The initial shelling killed just one and destroyed several floors of the hospital, but Russian forces struck again during the evacuation of the hospital’s patients, authorities said. The regional military administration for the Sumy oblast has since updated the death toll to nine people killed, with 12 reported seriously injured. Authorities have completed rescue efforts in Kryvyi Rih, where a Russian missile struck a five-storey police administration building yesterday. The National Police of Ukraine have updated the death toll from this attack to four people killed, including three police officers. Six more were injured. In addition to the eight killed in the Russian attack on a hospital in Sumy, at least six other civilians were killed throughout Ukraine over the past 24 hours, authorities said. At least three were killed when a Russian missile struck a police administration building in Kryvyi Rih in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast, while other missile and air strikes on residential areas of the Kherson, Donetsk and Odesa oblasts left dozens more injured. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has posted an update to the death toll in Saturday’s attacks on a medical centre in Sumy. Eight people have now been killed in the Russian strikes, with 11 more injured. Zelenskyy said 113 patients have been evacuated from the hospital. “Everyone in the world who speaks about this war must pay attention to what Russia is targeting,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “They are waging war on hospitals, civilian objects, and people’s lives. Only strength can force Russia into peace. Peace through strength is the only right way.” A civilian was killed in a drone attack in the city of Shebekino in Russia’s Belgorod oblast on Saturday, the regional governor said. Images and video posted on Telegram by regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov showed smoke billowing out of a window on the top floor of a building. In addition to the civilian who was killed, two more civilians were injured, Gladkov said – a man with a “mine-explosive injury and facial wounds” and a woman with a “mine-explosive injury and head and hand wounds”. The attack that struck the building caused a fire that was quickly put out, and damaged four other nearby buildings, puncturing gas and water pipes, Gladkov said. The attack blew out the glass of two social buildings and two commercial buildings, and damaged some vehicles. A drone that detonated in the courtyard of an apartment building damaged the windows of several apartments and hit four cars with shrapnel. Shebekino is located just under five miles (7.8 km) from the border of Ukraine. While Ukrainian armed forces have not claimed responsibility for the attack, there has been an increase of drones hitting Russia from across the border over the past months. Here are some images from this morning’s Russian attack on a medical centre in Sumy. Authorities said Russian kamikaze drones struck the hospital twice: once destroying several floors of the building and killing one, and again while patients were evacuating. At least even people were killed and 12 people were injured in the consecutive attack. Australia’s ABC News is rejecting Moscow’s claims that two of its journalists acted illegally by entering the Ukrainian-occupied Kursk region in Russia. The Russian news agency Tass reported on Friday that the Russian Federal Security Service had “initiated and is investigating criminal cases” against the broadcaster’s Europe correspondent Kathryn Diss and camera operator Fletcher Yeung, as well as Romanian journalist Barbu Mircea, for the crime of “Illegal crossing of Russia’s State Border” – a crime punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. Diss and Yeung were escorted by a Ukrainian military unit to Sudzha in the Kursk region on 31 August, marking the first time the broadcaster had entered Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “We reject Russia’s claim that the ABC’s reporters have done anything illegal,” an ABC spokesperson said. “They were reporting from occupied territory in a war zone and in full compliance with international law. “Their reporting was done in the interests of keeping the public fully informed on a story of international importance.” More here: The regional military administration for the Sumy oblast has updated the death toll in Saturday’s attack on a medical centre. Seven people have now been killed, with 12 reported seriously injured. The regional military administration said on Telegram that Russian forces used Shakhed unmanned aerial drones to carry out the attack. A policeman was among those killed – this comes as rescuers continue searching the rubble that once was a police administration building in the central city of Kryvyi Rih. A Russian missile attack that struck this five-storey building on Friday killed at least three people and injured six others. At least six people were killed Saturday morning following two consecutive Russian strikes on a medical centre in Sumy, a city in northeastern Ukraine. Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, said on Telegram that one person died in the initial shelling that destroyed several floors of the hospital – but during the evacuation of the hospital’s patients, Russian forces struck again, killing more. A policeman was one of the six confirmed dead. The deadly attack came after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump in New York amid concerns over the future of US aid to Ukraine if Trump – who has frequently made complimentary remarks about Vladimir Putin – wins in November. The sit-down lasted less than an hour, during which Trump told Zelesnkyy that if he won November’s presidential election he would get the Ukraine war “resolved very quickly”. “We have a very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin,” Trump said as he stood next to Zelenskyy before the meeting. “And I think if we win, I think we’re going to get it resolved very quickly … I really think we’re going to get it … but, you know, it takes two to tango.” Zelenskyy described the meeting as “very productive”. Elsewhere: China and Brazil on Friday pressed ahead with an effort to gather developing countries behind a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine – an effort that Zelenskyy has dismissed as one that serves Moscow’s interests. Seventeen countries attended a meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly chaired by China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, and Brazilian foreign policy adviser Celso Amorim. Wang told reporters they discussed the need to prevent escalation in the war, avoid the use of weapons of mass destruction and prevent attacks on nuclear power plants. Zelenskyy, in a speech to the assembly earlier this week, questioned why China and Brazil were proposing an alternative to his own peace formula. Proposing “alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called sets of principles” would only give Moscow the political space to continue the war, he said. US secretary of state Antony Blinken, speaking after a meeting with Wang, underscored strong US concerns about China’s support for Russia’s defence industrial base. He told reporters that China, while saying it seeks an end to the Ukraine conflict, “is allowing its companies to take actions that are actually helping Putin continue the aggression. That doesn’t add up.” South Korea’s foreign minister said Russia was engaging in illegal arms trade with North Korea, reiterating statements by the US, Ukraine and independent analysts that Pyongyang is supplying rockets and missiles in return for economic and other military assistance from Moscow. Misuse of Russia’s right to veto as a permanent member of the UN security council is hindering the UN’s efforts to end war, foreign minister Cho Tae-yul said during the UN general assembly on Saturday. Finland will place a key Nato base less than 200 kilometers (125 miles) from its border with Russia, “sending a message” to its eastern neighbour, the defence ministry said Friday. Finland became a Nato member last year, dropping decades of military non-alignment after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A Russian drone may have breached the national airspace of Nato member Romania for “a very brief period of under three minutes” overnight during an attack on neighbouring Ukraine, the Romanian defence ministry said on Friday. Three people were killed in the attack, according to Ukrainan officials. Russia’s FSB security service is investigating three foreign journalists for reporting in parts of Russia’s Kursk region occupied by Ukrainian forces, bringing the total of such investigations to 12. The three, Kathryn Diss and Fletcher Yeung from Australia’s ABC News and Romanian journalist Mircea Barbu, are being investigated for illegally crossing the Russian border, state news agency Ria Novosti reported."

The chancellor is reassessing the government’s manifesto promise to close loopholes in the non-domiciled tax regime Russell Findlay, the newly elected leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has said his party faces a significant threat from Reform UK in Scotland. Of the 4,155 Scottish Tory members who voted, 2,565 backed Findlay in the first round, with 1,187 votes going to his closest rival, Murdo Fraser Polling by Savanta suggests that a third of Conservative voters in the 2024 general election believe the party lost because it wasn’t right-wing enough Systemic failures in the way police deal with stalkers are leaving victims at “serious risk” with some given wrong and “potentially dangerous” advice, a damning report by police chiefs in England and Wales has found A man who was the first person in the UK to be convicted of a charge of riot after widespread disorder this summer has been jailed for four years and four months Two Just Stop Oil activists have been jailed for throwing tomato soup over Van Gogh’s Sunflowers Thank you for reading and all your comments. Andrew Sparrow will be back on Monday, and I will see you here again sometime soon. We reported earlier that DWP figures released today show the government received about 74,400 pension credit claims in the eight weeks since 29 July, when chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the winter fuel payment would be means-tested. PA Media is now carrying a government spokesperson statement about the figures: We are committed to supporting pensioners, with millions set to see their state pension rise by £1,700 this parliament through our commitment to the triple lock. Given the dire state of the public finances we have inherited, it’s right we target support to those who need it most. Over a million pensioners will still receive the winter fuel payment, and our drive to boost pension credit take-up has already seen a 152% increase in claims. Many others will also benefit from the £150 warm home discount to help with energy bills over winter while our extension of the household support fund will help with the cost of food, heating and bills. Severin Carrell, the Guardian’s Scotland editor, has this analysis of the challenge facing the newly elected leader of the Scottish Conservatives Through an accident of timing, Russell Findlay will have his first outing as Scottish Conservative leader on Sunday when he addresses the UK party’s annual conference in Birmingham, in the heat and glare of the national lens. Given his tentative performance after being confirmed as Douglas Ross’s successor earlier on Friday, it is likely to be workmanlike. But in it he needs to flesh out how he thinks the Scottish Tories can recover from their dire general election, when they won their lowest vote share in decades. The election produced two contradictory messages for the Scottish Tories: despite the UK party’s humiliation in England, the Scottish party held five of their six Westminster seats. But they did so with just 12.7% of the national vote, nearly half that for the Tories UK-wide. They were caught in a pincer movement from a resurgent Labour party, which recaptured Scotland’s centrist unionist voters, and the upstarts at Reform UK. Not only did a surge in support for Reform lead to defeat for Ross in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, it also won a Scotland-wide 7% share. If that is repeated at the next Scottish parliament election in May 2026, Reform could well win seats at Holyrood, almost certainly at the Scottish Tories’ expense. An already crowded political landscape at Holyrood, where six parties hold seats, will become more complex yet. Findlay faces a significant challenge: does he try to replicate Ross’s strategy of focusing hard on heartland issues such as championing North Sea and combating Scottish independence, or Ruth Davidson’s much more successful recasting of the Tories as centrist one nation unionists. Ross’s strategy arguably worked: the Tories saved nearly every Westminster seat (apart from his) by focusing narrowly on tribal Tory interests. But if the Scottish Tories remain at 12-13% in 2026, and with a well-funded Reform party nipping at its heels, it faces humiliation under Holyrood’s proportional voting system. For most non-nationalist voters, a second independence referendum is no longer a signficant concern. Fighting for oil jobs has little appeal outside the north-east, unless Findlay chooses to champion opposition to new windfarms in rural areas. What may help save him is Reform’s failure to replicate its UK election success in a Holyrood contest: it has no known Scottish leader and must build up a campaign apparatus from nothing. The Scottish general election contest was heavily framed by UK issues. Thankfully for Findlay, Nigel Farage will not be on the Holyrood ballot paper. Savanta has some polling today which suggests that whoever ends up as the leader of the opposition, they will face a tough time pulling back together the coalition of Conservative voters that propelled the party to successive election victories over the last 14 years. With most of the leadership hopefuls tacking to the right to try to recapture votes lost to Reform UK, the polling found that a quarter of Conservative voters in 2024 felt the party lost the election in the summer because it wasn’t moderate enough, but a third of Conservative voters in 2024 pin the defeat on the party not being right-wing enough. My colleagues Fiona Harvey and Helena Horton report that climate and the environment have hardly featured during the lengthy Conservative leadership contest, but that the party will soon have to work out where it is going to position itself on those issues for the coming few years of being in opposition … Russell Findlay, the newly appointed Conservative leader in Scotland has said on social media “It’s an absolute privilege to be elected.” He said “The hard work starts now,” adding “Under my leadership, we are going to change. We’ll represent everyone who wants some common sense for a change.” My colleague Alexandra Topping reports that a damning report by police chiefs in England and Wales has found systemic failures in the way police deal with stalkers that are leaving victims at “serious risk”, with some given wrong and “potentially dangerous” advice. Readers (and live bloggers) of a certain age may recall Martin Bell being elected as an MP in 1997 when he stood as a protest candidate against Neil Hamilton, a man the Guardian famously called a liar and a cheat on a front page in 1996 and who once danced on television while Johnny Vegas threw fish at him. Hamilton is currently honorary president of Ukip. Bell has written for the Guardian today, arguing “It’s not just the money, it’s the sense of entitlement. That’s the cause of sleaze in UK politics” Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor Murdo Fraser, the veteran Scottish Conservative MSP who came second in the party’s leadership contest, has said it could be necessary for the Scottish party to openly disagree with the next UK Tory leader, to maintain its distinct policy agenda. Fraser was soundly beaten in the contest on Friday morning by his rival Russell Findlay, a relatively inexperienced MSP and former crime reporter who won with 61.7% of the votes in the first round. Asked whether he believed the Scottish party needed to be outspoken in protecting its centre-right positioning if the new UK leader pulled the party to the right, Fraser said: I think there is a delicate balancing act here, because you don’t want to be continually at war with your colleagues south of the border. And I think there are a lot of issues that can be resolved privately behind the scenes, which is far better, but there may be instances where it’s necessary for the Scottish leader to disagree publicly with the UK leader as indeed, as was referred to earlier, Ruth [Davidson] was prepared to do when she was leader. But you know, I think these should be exceptions rather than the rule. Many pundits believe the Scottish Tories revival under Davidson was in part due to her often outspoken disagreements with UK Conservative leaders. She sought to construct a distinctively one nation centre-right policy agenda in Scotland, backing gender reforms, immigration and the European Union. Speaking to reporters after his victory was confirmed, Findlay said he would prefer to keep policy disagreements with the new UK leader confidential. He said the fact the party was in opposition made that task easier. Whoever prevails [in the UK leadership contest] will need to work closely and respectfully with the Scottish leader and inevitably it’s healthy that there will be disagreements. If that’s done privately and respectfully, that’s a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Of course the dynamic is somewhat different because the Conservatives are no longer the government, so we do perhaps have that breathing space to have those more frank discussions without the pressure of day to day government. Political correspondent Eleni Courea reports Rachel Reeves is rethinking parts of Labour’s crackdown on non-dom tax status over concerns that the plans will not raise any money. The chancellor is reassessing the government’s manifesto promise to close loopholes in the non-domiciled tax regime. The Guardian revealed this week that Treasury officials feared the spending watchdog was due to conclude the policy would fail to raise any money, because of the impact of super-rich non-domiciles leaving the UK. Reeves is now reconsidering the plans, according to multiple reports. A government official told the Financial Times: “We are looking at the details of our proposals. We will be pragmatic, not ideological. We won’t press on regardless, but we are not going to abandon this completely.” After the Conservatives unexpectedly announced plans to phase out the non-dom regime, Labour said they hoped to raise a further £2.6bn over the course of a parliament by clamping down on loopholes. The party later predicted that closing these loopholes could raise an initial £1bn in the first year, which would be put towards funding universal school breakfast clubs and more hospital and dental appointments. However, there are concerns inside the Treasury that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) may now conclude the plans will raise no money at all and could prompt wealthy foreigners to leave the UK. Andy Haldane, a former chief economist at the Bank of England, said earlier this week that there should be “cause for pause” on the government’s plan. The OBR originally forecast that scrapping the tax break for wealthy foreigners could raise about £3.2bn a year – though this was deemed to be “highly uncertain” as wealthy people could either leave Britain or find ways to avoid the tightening of tax rules. Read more from Eleni Courea here: Rachel Reeves reconsiders end to non-dom tax status over OBR forecast fears DWP figures released today show the government received about 74,400 pension credit claims in the eight weeks since 29 July, when chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the winter fuel payment would be means-tested. PA Media reports this is up from 29,500 claims in the eight weeks before the announcement, and that over 90% of the claims were made online. Only claimants of certain benefits, including pension credit and universal credit, will now receive a winter fuel payment after the decision by Keir Starmer’s government. Conservative leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch has added her congratulations to Russell Findlay on being elected the leader of the party in Scotland. She said: Congratulations Russell Findlay on being elected leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party. I look forward to working with you to renew our party in Scotland and across the whole United Kingdom. The newly elected leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, Russell Findlay, refused to be drawn earlier on who he was supporting in the national leadership contest, but James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat have been first out of the blocks among the four candidates to congratulate him on social media. The leader of the opposition, Rishi Sunak, has also welcomed the appointment, saying he looks forward “to working with you to strengthen the Union.” Regular readers will know that it doesn’t take much to persuade me to include a picture of a dog in the live blog, and the fact that Steve Darling’s guide dog Jennie has her own social media account has made that a lot easier. Jennie, styled as “leader of the opawsition”, has posted a picture* of her visit to the Dartmouth steam railway and river boat company’s 100th anniversary celebration. [*presumably Jennie had help] The government has acquired a semiconductor factory near Darlington after fears its closure would cost jobs and leave the UK with a gap in its ability to manufacture crucial electronic chips. The Ministry of Defence has said the company at Newton Aycliffe in County Durham is the only secure facility with the capability to produce gallium arsenide chips, used in electronic devices. PA Media reports defence secretary John Healey visited the site this morning, saying: Semiconductors are at the forefront of the technology we rely upon today, and will be crucial in securing our military’s capabilities for tomorrow. This acquisition is a clear signal that our government will back British defence production. We’ll protect and grow our UK defence supply chain, supporting north-east jobs, safeguarding crucial tech for our armed forces and boosting our national security. In the questions after the announcement that Russell Findlay would be the new leader of the Conservatives in Scotland he refused to be drawn over who he is supporting in the national leadership contest. Kemi Badenoch, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick, and Tom Tugendhat remain in the running to replace former prime minister Rishi Sunak as official leader of the opposition, with the result expected at the end of next month. Findlay said: Obviously we still don’t know who the new UK leader is going to be. I’ve deliberately kept out of that particular discussion, because whoever prevails at the UK level will need to work closely and respectfully with the Scottish leader. And inevitably, it’s healthy that there will be disagreements, if that’s done privately and respectfully. That’s a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Of course, the dynamic is somewhat different in that the Conservatives are no longer in government at UK level, so we do, perhaps, have that breathing space to have more frank discussions without the sort of pressure of day-to-day governance. He did, however, express a preference for the UK remaining in the ECHR “as things stand”, something that Jenrick earlier this morning committed to leaving if he won the leadership contest and then went on to be prime minister in the future. Findlay told supporters in Edinburgh: We’ve got four candidates for the UK leadership. They’re all talking about various issues, including the withdrawal potentially from the ECHR. I think it’s right that they have that discussion. And going forward, I will talk with the new leader. I’m of the view that we should remain in the ECHR as things stand. But the problem with people smuggling gangs is that nothing so far has worked. And I think, therefore, it’s quite right that now we’re not in government, now we’re trying to find a new leader, and a new way forward, nothing should be off the table. Badenoch and Cleverly have both rejected the idea of leaving the ECHR, while Tugendhat has called for reform of it. Russell Findlay took a swipe at the SNP and said he would “never apologise for standing up for the Union” during the question and answer session after the announcement in Edinburgh that he had won the Scottish Conservative leadership election. He said: We will never apologise for standing up for the Union. We are Unionists to our core, and we should take great pride in the fact that we have successfully prevented the break-up of the United Kingdom. The SNP are down, but they’re far from out. But what we need to do is not just talk about stopping another independence referendum. Not just talk about stopping the SNP in their tracks. But come up with a range of proper conservative policies that people understand are in their best interests, stuff relating to education, the economy, the health service, justice, and that’s the way in which we persuade people that what we have to offer is right for them. Russell Findlay, newly elected as leader of the Conservatives in Scotland, finished his speech by saying: We will work hard to earn your trust by doing things differently. We will be a voice for decent mainstream Scotland and the values of hard work, self reliance and value for taxpayers. We’ll spend our time and energy on your concerns, your hopes and your needs. We know that you don’t expect miracles from politicians. We know you want common sense for a change, and we are determined to deliver it. He then took questions from the media, during which he addressed voters in Scotland deserting the Conservatives for Reform UK, saying: We are acutely conscious of their vote share in the general election, and as leader, it’s our job to reconnect with those people who feel, frankly, scunnered by a lot of politicians, and persuade them that what we stand for represents their interests. Reform UK came fifth in the general election in Scotland by vote share, with 7% of the vote. The Conservatives were third with 12.7% of the vote, a share which had dropped by over 12 points. Speaking in Edinburgh after being elected the new leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Russell Findlay has said everyone in the party must “come together as one united team” to win back the trust of the public. He said: I want to deliver a message to people across Scotland who do not feel that anyone represents them, who are scunnered by the divisiveness and the fringe obsessions of the Scottish parliament, who feel let down and failed by politicians of every single party – sometimes including ours – who think politicians are all the same. If you feel that way, I get it. But I’m not the same. I’m not a career politician. I understand your frustrations, and your sense that nobody really represents the views that you share and hold, and that is going to change under my leadership, The Scottish conservatives are going to change. Findlay was first elected as an MSP in 2021. Russell Findlay is speaking, he starts by thanking all of his team, and then makes a joke by saying he thanks “every sausage … no, every supporter.” Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor Russell Findlay, a former crime reporter, has been appointed as the next leader of the Scottish Conservatives after the most fractious period in the party’s history. Findlay, a relative newcomer to the Scottish parliament, beat the party veteran Murdo Fraser and its former deputy leader Meghan Gallacher after a short contest triggered by the resignation of Douglas Ross. The clear favourite to win after a well-organised and extensive campaign, Findlay had been endorsed by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish party’s most successful recent leader, and a host of Holyrood backbenchers. Ross stood down as leader after a rebellion by MSPs and activists over his decision to replace a widely liked candidate who was recovering from a medical operation, David Duguid, as the general election candidate for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East. After the backlash, Ross became the only Scottish Tory to lose a Westminster seat that the party was defending after a surge in support for Reform UK. Reform won 5,562 votes, well above Ross’s margin of defeat by 942 votes to the Scottish National party candidate. The leadership contest was marred by infighting, accusations of dirty tricks and angry disputes involving Gallacher and John Lamont, the Tory MP who serves as shadow Scotland secretary. Those rows included the resumption of an old feud between Davidson and Fraser over Fraser’s proposals for a breakaway Scottish party dating to 2011, when they both stood for the leadership. Davidson accused Fraser of plotting to resurrect that proposal by stealth if he had won the leadership, a charge he denied. The result is … Russell Findlay, 2,565 votes Murdo Fraser, 1,187 votes Meghan Gallacher, 403 votes In Edinburgh they are about to announce the new leader of the Conservative party in Scotland. Party chair Craig Hoy is speaking, I’ll bring you the key lines … Robert Jenrick, who is still favourite at the moment for the Conservative party UK leadership, has been campaigning on immigration again this morning, posting a two minute video to social media. In the video he says “I’d like to think of myself as a reasonable, pragmatic guy, but on this issue [immigration], what I saw [when I was in government] made me realise we need radical action.” He said “When I became minister for immigration, I saw terrorists coming into our country and hundreds of known criminals in Dover.” Under his watch, murals were painted over in a reception centre for asylum-seeking children who had entered the country. Looking beyond the current leadership contest, Jenrick says “If I became Conservative leader and one day prime minister, I will end the madness.” He says he will leave the ECHR, stop international aid to countries that refuse to accept deportations, restrict visas, and “pass legislation to declare evidently safe countries as safe,” naming Turkey, Brazil and Vietnam. Referring to what he terms “asylum shoppers on the continent” he says he will end what he rermed “soft touch Britain.” If the quality of water in England is of interest to you, then Phoebe Weston has an interesting piece today worth a read here … Read more here: How drug pollution flooded England’s national parks – and put human health at risk The press pack in the US have asked Keir Starmer about his conference speech gaffe where he initially referred to “sausages” rather than “hostages”. The prime minister said “I just mangled the beginning of the word,” adding – in what appears to be a meat-related pun – “These things are there to give you all the opportunity to rib me.” Labour MP Emily Thornberry, asked about the prime minister meeting potential future US president, has said that Donald Trump “styles it out somewhat” with alleged racism. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee chair said: If he’s president and he starts caging Mexican children, then that needs to be called out. We are actually in a really strong position now, in that if you think about all the other G7 countries, we are a country that we have just had an election, we have a progressive Government with a large majority and stability in front of us - a good five years of the same leader. And if you look at the other G7 countries, they don’t necessarily have that. PA Media reports askedwhether Mr Trump should be labelled a “racist”, Thornberry said: “It depends how he is behaving. I mean, he seems – he styles it out somewhat, doesn’t he, these allegations? I mean, you know, we hear about the dogs and cats and so on just a few weeks ago. If I was at dinner with someone who said things like that, then I would call it out.” Thornberry was referring to the Trump campaign recently claiming, without evidence, that immigrants were stealing and eating pets, an oft-repeated racist trope. She went on to say: Donald Trump may be the president of the United States in a couple of months’ time so of course, it’s important to have meetings with him and to build a relationship with him. Whatever criticisms one may have of Donald Trump, the point is that the office of president is one that needs to be properly respected and the Americans are very close friends of ours. I think that this is an initial meeting, so there needs to be a certain amount of relationship building and we take it from there [but] I do think that if there are things the American president does or says that we disagree with, then we shouldn’t pull our punches. We might be about to find out who the new Scottish leader of the Conservatives is, but we are still some distance away from finding out who the next UK-wide leader of the opposition will be, as the Conservative party leadership election continues until the end of October. Frances Ryan has written for us today, suggesting there is “little sign that the Conservatives have any real understanding of what got them” to electoral defeat in July. Read more here: Frances Ryan – Of course the wannabe Tory leaders have regrets. They think they weren’t toxic or nasty enough The new leader of the Scottish Conservatives is expected to be announced at 10am. Russell Findlay, Murdo Fraser and Meghan Gallacher are the three options on the ballot paper to take over from Douglas Ross. The Conservatives are currently the second largest group in the Scottish parliament with 31 MSPs. The Conservatives returned five MPs from Scotland in July’s general election. Brian Whittle, Jamie Greene and Liam Kerr previously dropped their bids to lead the party at Holyrood. Almost immediately whoever wins will be taking part in a ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of devolution being on Saturday, before heading to the Conservative conference in Birmingham which begins on Sunday.

This week’s Meta Connect conference saw Mark take the stage in a T-shirt reading Aut Zuck Aut Nihil. Either Zuck Or Nothing. The original was Aut Caesar Aut Nihil and was enthusiastically adopted as a motto by one of the worst Borgias (tough field) … but look, I’m sure it’s ironic. Mark’s such a gifted ironist. We’ll get to the magic glasses and AI feedspam he was pushing at this week’s event in a minute – but before we do, let’s recap. Easily the most significant thing Mark Zuckerberg has said this year was that he isn’t sorry any more – in fact, that he wished he’d never said sorry for most of what he’d ever said sorry for. I paraphrase only slightly. A couple of weeks ago, Zuckerberg appeared on stage for a podcast and called Facebook’s willingness to offer stakes-free apologies for things he wasn’t to blame for – like election manipulation or the effect of social media on teen mental health – “a 20-year mistake”. “And I think it’s going to take another 10 years or so for us to fully work through that cycle,” he reflected, “before our brand is back to the place that it maybe could have been if I hadn’t messed that up in the first place.” Please: imagine the force Meta could be if only it hadn’t been held back by extremely intermittent synthetic contrition. The upshot is that we might never again hear Mark drone all those Facebook phrases for sorry – “we will learn from this”, “we know we have more work to do”. That said, the counterpoint to his soz-regret is that they’ve played quite well for him. Sure, every now and then he’s had to pitch up to Congress for hearings that are always described as “tense”, heated”, “fiery” and even “stunning”. But these have repeatedly proved themselves nothing more than the theatre of futility. Not one federal law has ever been passed to regulate Meta, or the other big tech firms. So the occasional few hours in Washington for a besuited “my bad” has been the price you pay for being the world’s most powerful oligarch, selling the lives of 3 billion monthly users via a platform that has incentivised hate, then … can you not just pay it? Apparently not any more. Of course, you may be one of those who feel trepidation at the idea of living in a world where Mark Zuckerberg is no longer minded to take responsibility for things. In which case, he has another world to sell you: the metaverse. Like so many of the tech titans, Mark really does offer an end-to-end service: they make the world worse, then they claim to be leading the escape. Elon Musk with his Mars aspiration, Jeff Bezos with his space programme, Zuckerberg with his virtual knock-off of the real world whose landmark upgrade is that he controls it absolutely. That would certainly appear to be its sole advantage. For a man seemingly without a cultural hinterland, perhaps it’s no surprise that the fantasy world Zuckerberg’s firm has come up with is a place of such utter conceptual dreariness. We are forever being told that the metaverse is a place where you can shop, have meetings, do real estate deals, attend conferences … I mean, honestly. Just add “answer infinite email” and you really have simulated paradise. We aren’t quite there yet, Mark admitted this week – honestly, it’s just round the next corner – but in the meantime he’d love to show you some augmented reality glasses and a cheaper VR headset then the one he asked you to buy last time. Also, now people don’t post so much on Facebook and Instagram any more, he is going to start gradually pumping their feeds with personalised AI images that have been created by Meta AI. Mm. Ideally, we will eventually eliminate the need for any human posters at all. Or as the Meta founder prefers it: “We are trying to build a future that is more open, more accessible, more natural, and more about human connection.” Go on. “Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.” Historically, of course, there has always been another way to feel truly present with another person, which is to be truly present with another person. But this is not what the emperor would wish for his citizens. He prefers the world atomised, mediated via his machines. One of the most lunatic moments at his event saw Zuckerberg call an affiliated creator on stage, but then proceed to have a conversation with an AI chatbot version of the creator on a giant screen, while the genuine article stood like a lemon on stage just watching. Watching this eerie spectacle, I was reminded of what Mark once said to a Facebook employee whose job eventually became functioning as his ghostwriter. Kind of a flesh-and-bones AI (very 1.0). She had asked him what he meant by the three-word essay prompt he’d given her – “companies not countries”. “I think we are moving to a world in which we all become cells in a single organism,” Zuckerberg replied, “where we can communicate automatically and can all work together seamlessly.” Oof. Well, there you go. Who could fail to be happy that a guy who thinks this is now only sorry that he was ever sorry.

          "headline": "Rachel Reeves reconsiders end to non-dom tax status over OBR forecast fears",
          "bodyText": "Rachel Reeves is rethinking parts of Labour’s crackdown on non-dom tax status over concerns that the plans will not raise any money. The chancellor is reassessing the government’s manifesto promise to close loopholes in the non-domiciled tax regime. The Guardian revealed this week that Treasury officials feared the spending watchdog was due to conclude the policy would fail to raise any money, because of the impact of super-rich non-domiciles leaving the UK. Reeves is now reconsidering the plans, according to reports. A government official told the Financial Times: “We are looking at the details of our proposals. We will be pragmatic, not ideological. We won’t press on regardless, but we are not going to abandon this completely.” After the Conservatives unexpectedly announced plans to phase out the non-dom regime, Labour said it hoped to raise a further £2.6bn over the course of a parliament by clamping down on loopholes. The party later predicted that closing these loopholes could raise an initial £1bn in the first year, which would be put towards funding universal school breakfast clubs and more hospital and dental appointments. However, there are concerns inside the Treasury that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) may conclude the plans will raise no money at all and could prompt wealthy foreigners to leave the UK. Andy Haldane, a former chief economist at the Bank of England, said earlier this week that there should be “cause for pause” on the government’s plan. The OBR originally forecast that scrapping the tax break for wealthy foreigners could raise about £3.2bn a year – though this was deemed to be “highly uncertain” as wealthy people could either leave Britain or find ways to avoid the tightening of tax rules. A Treasury spokesperson said: “These reports are speculation, not government policy. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility will certify the costings of all measures announced at the budget in the usual way. “We are committed to addressing unfairness in the tax system so we can raise the revenue to rebuild our public services. That is why we are removing the outdated non-dom tax regime and replacing it with a new internationally competitive residence-based regime focused on attracting the best talent and investment to the UK.” Ahead of the budget on 30 October, Reeves is also considering a change in how the government’s fiscal rules are calculated to allow billions of pounds more in capital spending. The chancellor told Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool that she believed the Treasury undervalued public investment and wanted to change the way public spending was seen at the top of government. The system has long been criticised by economists for disincentivising governments from making long-term investments that could promote economic growth. The Times reported that Reeves would free up as much as £50bn to spend on infrastructure projects under plans to change the rules that are being drawn up by officials. Officials are looking at changing the way the government measures debt, which could allow the government to offset “assets” – such as the £236bn owed in student loans – against the wider national debt, government sources told the paper. This would free up more money for investment in projects such as roads, housing and energy but not for day-to-day spending."

          "headline": "International students say ‘we’ve not come illegally’ after Peter Dutton makes ‘boat arrivals’ comparison",
          "bodyText": "Raghav Motani knew he would be paying $70,000 in student fees for his two-year master’s degree in Australia. He knew about the visa processing fees, insurance policy, health coverage and expensive housing – $800 a fortnight. But when the University of Technology Sydney’s international student officer heard the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, had compared him and his peers to the “modern version of boat arrivals”, he had some questions. “Why are you using these words to describe us? What have we done that’s unlawful?” he said. “We’ve not come illegally, we’ve not jumped borders, why are we framed like this? We’re helping the economy, we’re putting a lot of money into it. Protect us.” Speaking on 2GB on Thursday, Dutton was commenting on a report in the Australian highlighting a surge the administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) had experienced in student visa decisions, “most of them from Indian and Chinese students”. There were 8,204 student visa cases lodged with the tribunal in the year to 31 May, compared with 2,057 in the previous 12 months. Only people already in Australia who have had their temporary visa appealed or rejected can appeal with the tribunal, which costs $3,496. “I just think when you look at the detail, this is the modern version of the boat arrivals,” Dutton said, using rhetoric reminiscent of the Abbott-led Coalition’s 2013 campaign to “stop the boats”. “People have found a weakness in the system, they are exploiting the weakness … and ultimately have stayed in Australia or they have extended their stay.” Weihong Liang, the chair of the NSW International Student Representative Committee, said the “constant targeting” of international students was creating an “unwelcome atmosphere”. “I’m tired of hearing these negative and divisive comments,” he said. “It seems there’s a growing trend to compete over who can be tougher on international students. “People will carefully consider their study destinations and choose places that are more welcoming, open and inclusive of diverse cultures.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The International Education Association of Australia (IEAA)’s CEO, Phil Honeywood, said Dutton’s comparison also failed to acknowledge the Coalition was responsible for creating a loophole during the pandemic that made it easier for non-genuine students to stay in Australia for economic reasons. “The Morrison government – without any consultation with the international education sector – announced uncapped work rights for supposedly full-time overseas students,” he said. “Dutton was a key minister in government in the relevant portfolio that was front and centre when non-genuine students were allowed in. This created an influx [of people] … particularly from the subcontinent, who came to Australia to make money rather than to study.” The policy was reversed by Labor in July last year, capping working hours at 24 a fortnight. But by then, Honeywood said, Australia’s educational reputation had been “compromised”. He attributed the rise in appeals to a concurrent spike in student visa refusals – part of a federal government crackdown on non-genuine students found in a parliamentary inquiry to use study as a back door for work and permanent residency. Just 80% of student visas were granted in the year to 31 August, the latest data shows, compared with 95.7% in 2020-2021. To Honeywood, comparing international students appealing visa decisions with asylum seekers was “palpably wrong”. “The majority of these people were allowed in under the Morrison government on planes,” he said. “Many months ago Peter Dutton made it clear he wanted to fight an election on migration – and Labor ministers have told me they have little choice.” A spokesperson for the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said the government “won’t apologise for returning integrity to the international education system”, adding it was “unclear” what Dutton was criticising. “Is it the AAT that he stacked and we are replacing, or the issues with international education that emerged when he was minister and we have made wholesale reform to fix?” the spokesperson said. “Clearly Peter Dutton doesn’t think we should be rejecting fraudulent student visa applications – our government won’t apologise for returning integrity to the international education system.” In July, the federal government more than doubled the international student visa fee to $1,600, after adding tougher visa conditions, stronger English-language tests and more rules for education agents who bring overseas students to Australia. A month later, the education minster, Jason Clare, announced the commonwealth’s proposed international student cap which would limit student enrolments to 270,000 across the tertiary sector. Mehreen Faruqi, the Greens’ deputy leader and spokesperson for higher education, said both major parties were launching a bipartisan “attack” on the sector. “Labor … has made international students the new political footballs in this racist dog-whistling game. Migrants, international students and people of colour will yet again be harmed by this dangerous rhetoric.”"

But for now, adieu, stay safe and dry. Here were the major developments of the day: Australia has signed on to a joint statement alongside the United States, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Qatar calling for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel and Lebanon border. The statement cites an “unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation”, as Australians in Lebanon have been again urged to leave. It comes as the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has asked the Israeli government to “respond positively” to requests from Zomi Frankcom’s family to release audio related to the fatal strikes on her aid convoy in Gaza. The National Anti-Corruption Commission inspector has confirmed she is conducting an investigation into the decision by the commission not to investigate the referrals from the robodebt royal commission. Anthony Albanese has confirmed his government is not considering taking negative gearing or capital gains tax reforms to the next election. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has lashed out at the University of Sydney’s vice-chancellor over his handling of a pro-Palestine encampment this year. He told 2GB if Mark Scott had a “shred of integrity” he would resign. The university said an independent review of its policies and procedures was currently under way. And the Victorian government has announced it will have to spend an extra $837m to complete its Metro Tunnel project by the end of 2025. NSW Greens call for independent oversight body for disabled children In New South Wales, the Greens have called for an independent oversight body for children with a disability after the auditor-general released a report into the Department of Education’s practices. The performance audit found the department had effectively designed approaches and developed reforms under its disability strategy, but pointed to “longstanding issues” with funding, access to targeted supports, monitoring school practice and tracking outcomes for students with disability. It noted: This is despite the department being made aware of these performance gaps for almost two decades across multiple audits, parliamentary inquiries and the recent national Disability Royal Commission. Greens NSW MP Abigail Boyd, who chaired a recent parliamentary inquiry into the experiences of young people with disability, said the report was “damning”. We need an independent oversight body for children with disability in our education system – as unanimously recommended by all members in the recent multi-partisan parliamentary inquiry report – with the primary purpose of advocating for students with disability and their families at its core, with the ability to oversee all issues from enrolments and adjustments to exclusionary discipline and allegations of discrimination. The NSW government must commit to implementing in full all recommendations of this report, our parliamentary inquiry, and the Disability Royal Commission. Anything less than this will constitute a tragic failure of leadership and serve to perpetuate the cycle of disadvantage experienced by disabled people in this state. Cocoa shortage to leave bitter taste in mouths of chocolate lovers Bad news for sweet tooths. Chocolate prices are expected to soar again as cocoa commodity prices hit their highest level in nearly 50 years, the research arm of global agriculture and commodities bank Rabobank has warned. Cocoa prices peaked at nearly US$12,000 a tonne in the first half of 2024 in response to a global cocoa shortage. Global production for the 2023-2024 season is down 14.2%, according to the International Cocoa Organisation, due to low yields for the third year in a row in West Africa where 70% of the world’s cocoa is grown. Read the full story from our Rural Network: BoM expects wet and warm end to the year Weather news, just in! The Bureau of Meteorology has published its long range forecast for the three months to the end of December – and it’s looking wet and warm. Above average rainfall is projected for most of Australia, along with warmer than average days and nights. In western WA and the southern NT, rainfall is expected to be within its typical range for the season. Qantas says engineers’ strike has not affected passengers Strike action by Qantas engineers has not affected passengers, with plans in place to keep people moving over the AFL grand final weekend. The action kicked off in Melbourne on Thursday and will spread across the nation in coming days. “As of early Thursday afternoon, we haven’t had any impact to customers as a result of the industrial action,” a Qantas spokesperson said. We have contingencies in place for the industrial action planned on Friday and the weekend and, like today, don’t currently expect this industrial action to have an impact on customers. Unions are pushing for a 15% pay rise in 2024 and 5% a year going forward, which they say would make up for three-and-a-half years of wage freezes. Qantas made a profit of $1.25bn in the 2023-24 financial year, down 28.3% on the previous 12 months. The Australian Workers’ Union national secretary, Paul Farrow, said: You can’t expect to announce billions in profits and executive bonuses and simultaneously tell the engineers who keep your planes safe to take less and less home to their families. Further industrial action is expected on Monday, Wednesday and next Friday, which is days before the NRL grand final in Sydney. – AAP Children pulled from suspicious house fire in Melbourne’s west Children have been pulled from a burning Melbourne home, with police investigating the circumstances surrounding the fire. The house fire occurred in Albanvale in the early hours of this morning. Victoria police said: It is believed unknown offenders set fire to three vehicles in the driveway of a residential property on Jackson Circuit just before 5am. The fire spread to the residence, causing significant damage. A woman and three children home at the time were not injured. A crime scene guard remains and an arson chemist is expected to attend later today. Investigators are making enquiries into the circumstances of the fire which is being treated as suspicious. If you’re wondering what’s happening with this cold snap on the east coast, Emily Wind has the answers for you: Peter Dutton has called for Mark Scott, the vice-chancellor of the University of Sydney, to resign. Scott is facing calls to resign over the university’s handling of a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus. He has apologised and conceded the university must do better. You can read more about that here: Appearing on 2GB this afternoon, Ray Hadley asked Dutton: Can you see Mark Scott surviving as the vice-chancellor after he failed to get support from the chancellor, David Thodey, recently, over his admitted mistakes, you know, misrepresentations as the vice-chancellor, basically the CEO of Sydney Uni?” Dutton replied: No, I can’t. I think both Mark Scott and David Thodey should resign. If they had any shred of integrity, they would have resigned by now. They should, because there are people in the Jewish community, whether they’re academics or students who were treated, they were discriminated against and they’ve been treated in a way that we wouldn’t accept any other group, regardless of their religion or background or race or whatever it might be, that they would be treated like that. So, Mark Scott’s admitted that they got it wrong, and they got it wrong well and truly. Both men were aware of the situation – even though they might deny it – and I don’t think their positions are tenable. Scott and Thodey have been contacted for comment. A University of Sydney spokesperson said: The Senate is actively working with the Vice-Chancellor to make sure that the University of Sydney is a safe place for all our staff and students, and has the best governance possible. As we announced two months ago we have an independent review of our policies and processes underway, which is being led by Bruce Hodgkinson. We appreciate the time and consideration that our students, staff and broader community have taken as they shared their experiences and feedback with us. Conservationists celebrate after seismic blasting project abandoned Plans for a major seismic blasting project to search for oil and gas west of Bass Strait have been abandoned after the company behind the proposal, TGS, declared it had decided not to go ahead. The proposed testing area between Victoria’s Otway coast and north-west Tasmania had been scaled back from an initial 75,000 sq km to less than half that before being cancelled. The news was welcomed by conservation groups and the Greens, which said “immense community pressure” as leading to the decision. More than 30,000 people responded to a call for submissions on the proposal and there were protests in coastal areas. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson said it was a “historic moment” that showed “community pressure works”. This win belongs to all the people who have rallied hard for years to protect marine ecosystems and avoid irreversible changes to the earth’s climate. The Australian Marine Conservation Society’s oil and gas campaign manager, Louise Morris, said: Australians don’t want offshore oil and gas or deadly seismic blasting operations damaging marine life, especially endangered species such as the pygmy blue whale. Global cocoa shortage sees chocolate prices soar A sweet block of chocolate could soon leave a sour taste in shoppers’ mouths at the checkout, with skyrocketing cocoa prices set to reach Australian shores, AAP reports. A global cocoa shortage stemming from disappointing harvests in West Africa, which sources 70% of the world’s cocoa, is triggering price rises in chocolate, according to a report by agricultural lender Rabobank. The report said: Significantly higher chocolate prices will likely hit shelves over the coming months and going into 2025, providing a major challenge for the chocolate sector, which is already battling a longer-term, structural decline in demand. Commodity prices have hit their highest levels in nearly 50 years as cocoa stocks sunk to their lowest in 22 years, pushing producers and manufacturers to pass on costs to consumers. Minister cites pandemic, Ukraine and Gaza conflicts and interest rate rises as factors affecting Metro Tunnel cost blowout More on the $837m blow out on Victoria’s Metro Tunnel project. Danny Pearson has blamed global events, the rising cost of construction and interest rates for this latest blow out. He says: Since 2017, nobody could have predicted a once in 100 year global pandemic. Nobody could have predicted conflict in Gaza and in Ukraine, and nobody could have predicted interest rate spikes. We are just realising what we’ve had to deal with, and what we’ve seen across the world is that there’s been a pressure on projects. In relation to the Australian eastern seaboard, we’ve seen a 22% increase in building and material and labour costs since 2021 and that’s had an impact on a number of projects in Australia. So if you look at the Metro tunnel in Sydney that saw a $9bn increase in its budget last year, we’ve seen inland rail more than double to $30bn and we’ve seen Snowy Hydro 2.0 more than double to $12bn, so the reality is, it is just costing more to build anything anywhere in the world. And we are facing similar challenges here in Melbourne. Pearson says he can’t guarantee there won’t be further blowouts. He says: I cannot guarantee that there won’t be a one in 100 year event next year. I cannot guarantee there won’t be another pandemic next year. I want to be really clear on this. I can’t guarantee those things. What I’m saying to you is here and now we’ve got a investment into this project which will ensure that the project has the resources that it needs to get on and deliver this project in 2025, 12 months ahead of schedule. Katy Perry ‘super stoked’ ahead of AFL grand final appearance Speaking of the AFL, US pop singer Katy Perry will belt out her hit song Roar at Saturday’s grand final – but don’t expect her to barrack for the Lions. The star of the pre-game entertainment insists she’ll have no special allegiance towards Brisbane over the Sydney Swans when the two interstate teams battle it out at the MCG on Saturday, AAP reports. “You know, I’m Switzerland,” the performer told reporters at the MCG on Thursday. What I’m still trying to get over is that Melbourne has 10 teams, and they’re not here! Perry will perform a string of her biggest hits to the 100,000-strong crowd including I Kissed a Girl with an Australian artist, rumoured to be Tina Arena, in one of her biggest shows since the 2015 Super Bowl. It will be her second performance at the stadium following her 2020 Women’s Cricket World Cup appearance, which she said was a huge adrenaline rush. It’ll be almost 10 years since I did something like this in the States, and to be able to do something like this again after so long, that doesn’t always happen for an artist so I’m super stoked. The American tried her hand at Aussie slang and AFL references in a press conference peppered with “speccy” and “granny” after a run on the grass in heels practising handballs with AFLW stars. Why thank you, Rafqa Touma, and what a pleasure it is to be here on the eve of the AFL grand final public holiday! That I will not receive, because I live in New South Wales. That is all from me on the blog today. Handing over to Caitlin Cassidy who will roll your news updates into the evening. The Victorian government has announced it will have to spend an extra $837m to complete its Metro Tunnel project by the end of 2025. The minister for transport infrastructure, Danny Pearson, has just announced the government will provide up to $745m to the project’s builder, the Cross Yarra Partnership, and about $85m to the Metro Tunnel Authority to continue testing and trialling. He said the builders would be chipping in a “comparable amount”, though he would not provide a figure. The extra spend brings the total cost of the project to taxpayers to $13.48bn. The project was initially costed at $10.9bn. Pearson said: We know from overseas experience, the last 20% of the project represent 80% of the complexity. The 5% of the project represented 20% of the time. So these are very challenging times in terms of doing that testing and trials. But we are so close. We are three stations here with two to go, and this project will be delivered in 2025, 12 months ahead of schedule. Consisting of two 9km train tunnels under the CBD, the Metro Tunnel will connect the Sunbury line, which runs through Melbourne’s western suburbs, with the Cranbourne and Pakenham lines, in the city’s south-east, taking the pressure off the City Loop. Five new underground stations have also been created, including Anzac station, near the Shrine of Remembrance, Parkville station, near the University of Melbourne and several major hospitals, and Arden station, a developing area in North Melbourne. NSW appoints commissioners to lead community consultation on treaty and truth-telling The New South Wales government has appointed three commissioners to lead a 12-month consultation with the state’s Aboriginal communities about treaty and truth-telling. The treaty minister, David Harris, announced former senator Aden Ridgeway, academic Todd Fernando and the Koori Mail general manager, Naomi Moran, would lead the process as part of a two-year appointment. According to Harris, Aboriginal communities will be asked if they would want to participate in a formal agreement-making process and, if so, what they would want it to look like. He said: We get better outcomes when we listen to the needs of Aboriginal people and communities. We must ensure Aboriginal people have a direct say on matters that affect them. Previous reporting: Profit plunges at Star as gamblers stay away Star Entertainment has warned it is facing “significant near-term liquidity requirements” after disclosing a 71% drop in net profit in financial results lodged today. The delayed release of its financial year books comes a day after the Australian casino owner told shareholders it had secured a $200m debt facility to help it to continue trading. Its shares have been suspended since the start of the month over viability concerns. Star operates casinos in Sydney, the Gold Coast and the newly opened Brisbane casino, Queen’s Wharf, which suffered a massive cost blowout at the same time as gambling tourism fell. The weak conditions have continued into the new financial year, with Star disclosing in its results it has recorded an earnings loss of $7.7m in July and August. Last financial year, it posted an underlying net profit result of $12m, down 71%. After taking into account impairment charges, linked to regulatory changes that are forecast to weigh on profits, its result plunged to a $1.69bn loss. The casino group is in discussions with state governments to renew casino licences in NSW and Queensland, while it also grapples with demands from gambling and financial crime regulatorsthat could result in significant fines, adding more financial pressure. The National Anti-Corruption Commission inspector has confirmed she is conducting an investigation into the decision by the commission not to investigate the referrals from the robodebt royal commission. After receiving “many inquiries … from the media and the public”, the inspector said in a statement: Between June and August 2024, Nacc provided the inspector with documents the Inspector had requested. On 3 September 2024, the Inspector asked the National Anti-Corruption Commission to provide submissions on a range of specified matters. The National Anti-Corruption Commission has advised that it anticipates that it will provide those submissions by 21 October 2024. The inspector will prepare a report upon completion of the investigation. Australia has signed on to a joint statement about Lebanon. The statement – which was also signed by the United States, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Qatar – says: The situation between Lebanon and Israel since October 8th, 2023 is intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation. This is in nobody’s interest, neither of the people of Israel nor of the people of Lebanon. It is time to conclude a diplomatic settlement that enables civilians on both sides of the border to return to their homes in safety. Diplomacy however cannot succeed amid an escalation of this conflict. Thus we call for an immediate 21 day ceasefire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy towards the conclusion of a diplomatic settlement consistent with [UN security council resolution] 1701, and the implementation of [UN security council resolution] 2735 regarding a ceasefire in Gaza. We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately consistent with [UN security council resolution] 1701 during this period, and to give a real chance to a diplomatic settlement. We are then prepared to fully support all diplomatic efforts to conclude an agreement between Lebanon and Israel within this period, building on efforts over the last months, that ends this crisis altogether. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd is “doing a good job” working with officials who might be in the Trump administration, Hockey told the National Press Club: I was hoping to get through the National Press Club without mentioning his name, but Kevin Rudd is doing a pretty good job. He’s doing a good job, actually, and he has worked over the Republicans that will be influential with Trump. But in my view, it doesn’t matter where you’re Liberal, Labor, Green, whatever, Australia first. And everyone, everyone steps up. Rudd is currently working as ambassador of Australia to the United States. Joe Hockey says Trump’s economic policies ‘hugely expansionary’ Donald Trump’s economic policies are like “handing a box of chocolates to a four-year-old”, former treasurer and ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey told the National Press Club. The comment came after a conversation on the former US president’s “expansionary” economic policies. Hockey said: You’ll see the US dollar drop most particularly on the Trump because there’s no handbrake. It is singularly the worst election campaign in living memory for anyone that cares about economics. It is ground zero in terms of making promises that are unfunded and probably cannot be delivered. But who knows? I think Donald Trump’s policy platform is absurd in its largess, and I’ve said it to President Trump, he can’t keep spending. He knows that his policies are not only inflationary but they’re hugely expansionary. It’s like sugar here. It’s handing a box of chocolates to a four-year-old. RBA lists China’s woes as one of three ‘vulnerabilities’ for Australia’s financial stability In the RBA’s financial stability review (see earlier post), the central bank cites “vulnerabilities” that could derail that stability. Two of them are perhaps obvious, such as “negative surprises” that might throw financial markets into a spin (we can imagine a few of them in the Middle East, for starters), or the more esoteric uncertainties of the digital economy (perhaps cryptic crypto?). The third, though, involves “imbalances in China’s financial sector”. On-going weakness in that nation’s real estate sector might yet prompt a “further loss of confidence” that could spill over into the global economy. “The key channels of transmission of financial stress in China to Australia would likely be via increased risk aversion in financial markets, a sharp slowing in global economic activity, lower global commodity prices and reduced Chinese demand for Australian goods and services,” the review said. Perhaps the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, got an advance copy to read on his flight to Beijing to meet counterparts this week. China has been cutting its interest rates this week, among the latest efforts to revive growth. Perhaps Chalmers will learn about coming plans to throw money at consumers (as many overseas economists have been calling for to help end China’s economic funk). There’s no stated mention of risks that might stem from US elections, including the possibility of a second Trump presidency. The next financial stability review, in six months’ time, might look a lot different. AFL heads – do I have some good news for you. The Bureau of Meteorology’s official forecast for AFL grand final day in Melbourne is in, and we’re getting warm, sunny spring conditions, baby! Senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury said after a cold morning on Friday it will be dry and mostly sunny during the afternoon’s grand final parade, with maximum temperatures reaching the mid to high teens. Warmer weather is expected in Melbourne on Saturday, with temperatures reaching the low to mid 20s for the opening bounce. These fine match-day conditions are a result of a high pressure system moving across Victoria, bringing clear skies and moderate northerly winds. There is a high chance of showers developing on Sunday, increasing in the afternoon as another cold front sweeps across Victoria from the west. If the temperature reaches the forecast 23C on Saturday, this year’s grand final will rank among the warmest 20 VFL/AFL deciders. Nevertheless, it falls well short of last year’s grand final which was a balmy 29.7C day. (As a Collingwood supporter who was at the MCG, I remember it well.) The last time these two teams met in a grand final, then as Fitzroy and South Melbourne in 1899, the game was on a day with steady rain and a maximum temperature of just 14.3 degrees. Fitzroy – now Brisbane – won by a single point, so let’s see who comes out on top in warmer weather. Hockey says US election ‘hard to read’ Hockey says Trump is “very competitive” in the race to the White House, while noting Kamala Harris is “winning the enthusiasm battle”. Asked to pick a winner in the US election, Hockey says “you’d be a fool to call it now” but Hillary Clinton lost the election despite winning the popular vote. There’s been five elections in the US where … you win the popular vote but you don’t win the electoral college. And, at the moment, there are a few factors at play. Harris must win by – in my view – 2.5% … the second thing is it’s really hard to read if everyone that voted for Biden in 2020 is going to vote for Harris again. There’s no doubt she’s winning the enthusiasm battle but it’s really hard to read and she’s not only the first woman running for president from California – don’t underestimate how significant it is that it’s California – but she’s also the first woman of colour running and there is still an element in the United States that is both misogynistic and racist and, because of voluntary voting, it’s really hard to work out what the turnout is going to be. Hockey says he’s not a “definite [call for] Trump” but Trump is very competitive. I think out of every 100 people voting for Trump, four to five would not admit it. They’re just going to do it. And polls have just been consistently wrong about Trump. Take Wisconsin. They underestimated Trump’s vote by 7% in 2016 and they underestimated by 5% in 2020. Meanwhile, former treasurer and ambassador to the United States Joe Hockey is appearing at the National Press Club for the first time in some years, as America’s presidential race continues to heat up. Asked whether the upcoming election will mark the end to bitterness on opposing sides of politics in the states, Hockey says America’s division is “primarily about policy, not personality”. [At] the Republican convention, it was clear to me that there wasn’t a deep lifelong abiding affection for Donald Trump from the delegates. What they were doing was fighting for what they believed to be the policies that mattered to them – lower taxes, less regulation, stronger borders, you know, a greater focus on America first. And at the Democratic convention … I had four days at the Republican Convention talking about Trump and then I had four days at the Democratic convention talking about Trump. I was a bit Trumped-out by that stage. Hockey says the US isn’t divided now more than ever – citing 1968, when Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King were assassinated. George Bush said to me, he said he remembers it vividly and he said it was far worse. Nineteen American cities on fire over race. And every night on TV, they were losing people at Vietnam … he said it [was] far worse and the divisions in America were far deeper. Nine protesters to face court after allegedly stopping coal train near Newcastle In New South Wales, nine protesters will face court today after allegedly stopping a coal train near Newcastle in opposition to the federal government’s approval of three new mining projects. Rising Tide, the group behind the action, said on social media the mines would “turbo charge the climate crisis with 1.5bn tonnes of emissions”. In a statement, NSW police confirmed about 10am Wednesday, they were called to a rail corridor in Sandgate after reports of an unauthorised protest. Officers attended and arrested four men aged between 24 and 69 and five women aged between 18 and 66. They were taken to Newcastle police station and were all charged with cause obstruction to railway locomotive or rolling stock, enter enclosed non-agricultural lands with a serious safety risk, and enter enclosed land not prescribed premises without a lawful excuse. All were refused bail to appear before Newcastle local court today. Max Chandler-Mather says Labor ‘have come to the table’ on housing The Greens’ housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, has signalled the party will push hard for capital gains tax reform, repeating the phrase “phase out negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount” 15 times in a single press conference in Brisbane. The government acknowledged yesterday that treasury was modelling negative gearing changes. The Greens took a policy of gradually phasing out currently negatively geared houses to the 2022 election. We’ve said to the prime minister and to Labor privately and publicly we’re ready to negotiate, and we recognise we won’t get everything that we want, but we do expect some movement on negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. What that looks like is ultimately up to negotiations with the government, but we certainly won’t accept no changes to the two biggest tax handouts to property investors that are turbocharging house prices and denying millions of renters the chance to buy a home. Chandler-Mather said the government had changed its tune on negotiating with the party. At first, they said it was impossible, they were not going to move on any of the areas that the Greens wanted movement on. Now we find out that Labor is asking Treasury to model one of the solutions that the Greens have proposed, phasing out negative gearing in the capital gains tax discount. The day after that, we find out Labor MPs and Liberal MPs have also supported changes to negative gearing in the capital gains tax discount … let’s think about what might happen in the next two months, now that Labor have to come to the table. And here is Katy Perry holding the AFL premiership cup. Pain at the pump, Australians hit by fuel price hikes A record gap between the cheapest and most expensive petrol stations has been revealed, with motorists in Australia’s largest cities hit with higher prices. New research released by the NRMA today showed the nation’s three largest cities have been exposed to price cycles of four to seven weeks from 2018 to 2024. The largest gap in Sydney between the cheapest and most expensive petrol stations came at the end of August, hitting 59.2c a litre. Motorists heading to the bowser that day could have saved $29.60 for a tank had they been provided real-time data. Perth and Adelaide had cycles of between seven and 17 days. Of the six price cycles in Sydney this year, the average price for unleaded at the high mark was 212.2c a litre. Almost half of the city’s petrol stations charged the maximum price, also a record. At the top of the June cycle, six in 10 servos were charging 229.9c a litre. The lowest price on average during that cycle was 182.3c a litre, marking an almost 30c difference. – Australian Associated Press The Reserve Bank has just released its half-yearly Financial Stability Review, and its findings look at first glance to be similar to its report in March. Recall that earlier this week, the governor, Michele Bullock, made it clear the RBA wanted to see more proof inflation was under control before its board would cut its interest rate. A big jump in unemployment (unlikely given the relative abundance of job openings, see earlier post) or a lot of financial pain at the household or business level might also convince the central bank that it might need to cut borrowing costs. However, today’s review suggests most borrowers are coping so far. “Pressures from high inflation and restrictive monetary policy continue to be felt across the Australian community, but the share of borrowers experiencing severe financial stress remains small,” it found. Mortgage arrears are on the rise but remain below (for now) pre-Covid levels. One notable point is that “mortgagors tend to be more resilient to a deterioration in the labour market than other households”, the RBA said. Apparently such borrowers are less likely to lose their jobs or hours than other households – at least historically. Businesses, too, are adjusting to higher interest rates with profit margins “around the level recorded over the decade prior to the pandemic”, the RBA said. That said, hospitality and some other sectors exposed to weak consumer demand are doing it tougher than others. Of course, should interest rates remain relatively high for a long while yet, those sunny perspectives might get a bit cloudier. As expected, job vacancies have continued to shrink, dropping 5.2% in August from three months earlier to 329,900, the ABS has just reported. It was the ninth quarter in a row of falls. For all the chatter in some quarters that the public sector was on a hiring binge, vacancies in government roles fell 7.5% to 35,800. The private sector, meanwhile, had openings for 294,100 jobs, a drop of 4.9% from May. While not heading in the right direction (unless you’re a twitchy Reserve Bank board member), it’s worth noting that job vacancies remain about 45% higher, or 102,000 positions, than pre-Covid times. In August, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%, with the economy adding about 47,500 jobs. On today’s job vacancy numbers, that jobless rate probably isn’t about to soar. Cocoa commodity prices have hit their highest levels in nearly 50 years, a new report by Rabobank’s RaboResearch says. “Skyrocketing” cocoa prices are “putting strong pressure on chocolate producers around the globe, who will likely pass on the burden to consumers”. A “cocoa crisis” is triggering the price increases. There has been a 14.2% drop in global cocoa production for the 2023/24 season, causing a 462,000 metric ton shortage and the lowest cocoa stocks in 22 years. RaboResearch analyst Paul Joules said: Since January 2023, cocoa futures have shattered the calm of their previous trading range, peaking at nearly USD 12,000 per metric ton in the first half of 2024. This dramatic increase, fuelled by a global cocoa shortage, is primarily due to a disappointing harvest in West Africa, the source of 70 per cent of the world’s cocoa. And “the worst is yet to come” as companies hedge prices and supply contracts up to a year in advance. The report anticipates higher chocolate prices will hit shelves over the coming months and going into 2025: … providing a major challenge for the chocolate sector, which is already battling a longer-term, structural decline in demand. The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has announced that the Labor party would not be running any candidates at three upcoming byelections. Labor was not expected to run in Pittwater, nor Hornsby, but many had hoped it would contest former premier Dominic Perrottet’s seat of Epping after reducing the margin at the 2023 election. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Minns said: If I can be candid about it, it would be very difficult for us to win because we have to put a lot of time and effort and resources into campaigns that we would be unlikely to prevail in and a swing against [us] would be a massive distraction. He said Labor had never held Epping and that “midterm is generally a swing against incumbent governments” so it was not worth contesting. Steven Miles refuses to confirm or deny the government’s considering rent control Meanwhile, the Queensland premier, Steven Miles, was also forced to respond to reports the government is considering an ACT-style rent control system. Canberra caps rents at 110% of inflation. Miles neither confirmed nor denied a report from Channel Nine that his government was considering a similar policy. “I’m not going to get into the business of ruling in or out what we will announce between now and the election, because then you might just move on to the next thing and the next thing and, before you know it, we wouldn’t have announcements to make between now and the election,” he said. In the press conference, Miles referred media to statements he made earlier this year that the evidence around rent control is that “it could have the perverse effect of making the system worse”. Queensland premier denies reports government will bail out Star Casinos The Queensland premier, Steven Miles, has denied reports the government has reached a deal to bail out Star Casinos. The state government has been negotiating a tax agreement to help the troubled gambling firm in recent weeks. The Financial Review reported this morning that a $60m deal had been done. But Miles said at a press conference this morning that negotiations had broken down in the past week. “There’ll be no consideration of any kind of arrangement, while their executives insist on paying themselves performance bonuses,” Miles said. He said the state won’t become a lender for the company either. There’s been no agreement whatsoever reached there, and we’re unlikely to reach one. Frankly, I find it astounding that they would be asking the state to defer taxes, to delay the payment of taxes, while paying themselves performance bonuses. We’re going to put the taxpayers of Queensland ahead of those executives. It has been previously reported that the state government is considering deferring about $300m in taxes, in return for interest payments, to help the company open its new Brisbane casino at Queens’ Wharf. More women in New South Wales will have easier access to the oral contraceptive pill as a trial designed to reduce pressure on the state’s healthcare system becomes permanent. Under the changes, from Saturday women will be able to get a resupply of their pill from a certified pharmacist without needing to go back to the doctor for a new prescription – as long as they have been taking the medication for two years. Read the full story from Tamsin Rose here: Qantas engineers start industrial action over pay fight Qantas travellers have been put on alert for flight disruptions as engineers stage a fortnight of industrial action heading into football grand finals. The action kicked off in Melbourne this morning and will spread around the nation in coming days. Read more here: Star secures bailout and prepares to lodge financial accounts Embattled casino operator Star Entertainment Group says its lenders have agreed to provide a new debt facility of up to $200m, which it can start drawing on from the end of October. Shares in Star, which owns casinos in Sydney, the Gold Coast and Brisbane, have been suspended since the start of the month after it failed to lodge its financial results amid concerns over its viability. The new debt facility should allow Star to publish its financial accounts today, although it must still deal with demands from gambling and financial crime regulators that could result in significant fines. The bailout will give Star’s corporate lenders security over various assets, according to details released late on Wednesday. It will only be able to access the second tranche of the debt facility if it meets various conditions. Its precarious financial position has overshadowed the company’s recentopening of a $3.6bn project in Brisbane’s city centre. Star is in talks with the Queensland government over tax relief. A Qantas flight to the Gold Coast from Melbourne airport is “delayed due to operational requirements”. A later flight to Adelaide is “cancelled due to engineering requirements”. The notifications, seen on a departures board in Melbourne airport, come as hundreds of Qantas engineers stage a walkout in Melbourne today over pay and conditions. A Qantas spokesperson has said it put contingency plans in place and believed customers would not be affected. The strike is part of industrial action that is expected to take place at major airports across Australia over the next two weeks. The Qantas Engineers’ Alliance, which is organising the action, said the strike was “highly likely” to affect flights. In breaking news, Kylie Minogue has added three new dates to her Australia tour. “I just can’t get enough of you Australia!! 3 new tour dates added,” she posted on X. “Sooooo looking forward to this!” For more on the push by a group of nations to to take the Taliban to international court (which Penny Wong spoke about this morning), read Patrick Wintor’s article here: PM says asked if Labor ‘going to squib on gambling reform’ Asked whether “you’re going to squib on gambling reform” as the AFL grand final approaches, Albanese says the problem is “problem gambling”: We want to act against problem gambling. We are acting. We’ve got our BetStop program. We’ve already seen a reduction in advertising. We’ve changed the designation that’s there. We’ve banned credit cards for use of online. We’ve taken a range of action, more action in our two years than has ever been taken by any government. We’re examining further proposals and we will, when we’ve finished those consultations, make an appropriate policy announcement. Albanese says ‘Treasury don’t need to be directed’ to examine housing policies Anthony Albanese says the Treasury “doesn’t need to be directed” when asked who requested analysis on negative gearing be brought to the government. He says: Treasury don’t need to be directed. They’re not schoolchildren with teachers up the front of the class, telling them what to do. I want a public service that looks at ideas, that looks at policy … And the public service, whether it’s my Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet or other departments, have units within them that examine policy, and there’s nothing unusual about that. There’s nothing special about it. And I, frankly, can’t see why it’s an issue at all that, you know, the suggestion is – I haven’t seen anything from Treasury, I make that point – but the suggestion is that they’d look at housing policy or look at tax policy or look at our current account deficit or look at other things is, to my mind, just what the public service does. Asked if “negative gearing has been equitable for all Australians,” Albanese says: Well, that’s the question of whether it’s contributing to supply or not. For many people, of course, if you didn’t have investment in housing, you wouldn’t have private rentals, you would have less supply and less construction, is the concern which is there. Our build-to-rent-scheme, for example, which will provide incentives through the tax system for more construction of housing, has been blocked in the Senate. The Greens say it’s because developers will benefit. I don’t know who they think builds medium-density housing, if not developers. Anthony Albanese has confirmed his government is not considering taking negative gearing reform or capital gains tax reform to the next election. Albanese was asked: “Can we just get some clarity for our viewers. Are you considering taking negative gearing reform and capital gains tax reform to the next election?” Albanese: “No, we’re not.” He says his government is focused on “planning for our Homes for Australia policy” and “putting that downward pressure on inflation”. Albanese asked about negative gearing The prime minister has moved on to talk negative gearing. Asked where he sits on potential reform, Anthony Albanese says his government’s plans to improve housing supply has been blocked “in this No-alition”: My view is that the key to housing policy is supply, and that has been the objective of our $32bn Homes for Australia Plan, more public housing, more build-to-rent, that’s stuck in the Senate, for private rentals, more home ownership. That’s also stuck in the Senate with our Help to Buy Scheme being blocked by the Liberals and the Greens in this No-alition. Anthony Albanese urges Australian citizens in Lebanon to leave Jumping from Penny Wong, who was live from New York a moment ago, to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, currently speaking to ABC News Breakfast. Asked if Australia has “a contingency plan in place if there’s an all-out war in the region”, Albanese again urges Australians in Lebanon to leave. He says: We’ve been planning for some time but we’ve also been saying to our citizens, who are there in Lebanon – some of whom have recently travelled to Lebanon – that they should return home by commercial aircraft while that is available. The second thing I’d say is to repeat the foreign minister’s call for a ceasefire. We need for that to occur both in Gaza as well as in Lebanon. We need the conflict not to continue to escalate, we need it to de-escalate. We need the hostages released. We need a ceasefire that’s sustainable there and we need to move towards a long-term solution as well of a two-state solution there in the Middle East. This is a conflict that’s gone on for a long period of time, that has been very intense since the October 7 atrocities that occurred by Hamas. Hamas can’t have a role in the future of Gaza. But we sincerely want to see that conflict come to an end, and both Israelis and Palestinians – and, of course, the people of Lebanon – be able to live in peace and security with stability. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has joined an international push “to hold the Taliban to account” under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Wong says: We know the women and girls of Afghanistan are effectively being erased from public life by the various edicts the Taliban … have issued. The steps we are taking with Germany, Canada and the Netherlands are unprecedented. We are intending to use the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, to which Afghanistan is a party, to take action. The Taliban have demonstrated their contempt for human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and they have engaged in a campaign of sustained and systematic oppression. Penny Wong has again urged Australians in Lebanon to leave. Speaking live from New York, she says: If I can … say again to the Australian Lebanese community. This is a deeply distressing situation for so many of you. I know that there are many Australians in Lebanon. There are many Australians who have relatives, family and friends in Lebanon. I again urge Australians in Lebanon to leave now. There are flight cancelations and disruptions, and there is a risk that Beirut airport may close for an extended period of time. Please do not wait for a preferred route. Please take the first option you can to leave. We continue to monitor the situation closely. We have been working with partners on contingency plans now for many months but I again say to anyone who any Australian who is in Lebanon: please leave now. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is speaking live to press from New York. She urges “all parties should show restraint,” as Israel’s intense bombing campaign inside Lebanon stretches into a third day. She says: Lebanese civilians cannot be made to pay the price of defeating Hezbollah, so all parties should show restraint, de escalate and comply with UN security council resolutions. The global community has made clear that this destructive cycle must stop. What has happened in recent days only makes an immediate ceasefire in Gaza even more urgent. You would have heard me say this before, and I say it again, Lebanon cannot become the next Gaza. Wong says she has met with her UK counterpart, David Lammy, and discussed a “shared view that there is a need for a ceasefire in Lebanon”. I know that this is something that will be discussed by international partners and the international community, including the security council this evening. Lebanese Australians have condemned the governments “inaction” on the escalating violence and incursion. Read more from Mostafa Rachwani here: Good morning! I’ll be rolling your live blog updates today. If there is anything you don’t want us to miss, shoot it my way on X (Twitter) @At_Raf_ Lebanese Australians have watched on in horror as Israeli attacks have continued on their mother country, with many fearing for the safety of relatives they left behind. “People feel helpless and exhausted, we are all sitting around helplessly watching … our country, our villages and homes, bombed into oblivion,” Sousan Ghecham, who lives in Sydney, says. Many are traumatised by the attacks on a land they maintain strong ties with, they tell Mostafa Rachwani, and there is also frustration with the government for failing to hold Israel to account. There are more Australian suburbs than ever with a median home value of $1m or more, according to new data. New CoreLogic data from August shows 29.3% out of 4,772 suburbs surveyed are now in the “million-dollar club”, with an additional 218 suburbs joining the group. The figure has risen from a previous market peak of 26.9% in April 2022 – while at the onset of the Covid pandemic 14.3% of suburbs had a median home value of $1m or more. Sydney dominates the country’s million-dollar suburbs, comprising almost 40% of the 1,397 suburbs with houses and apartments with a seven-figure median value. In both Sydney and Brisbane, 46 suburbs rose above the $1m median value mark. Perth came in third position, followed by regional Queensland. CoreLogic economist Kaytlin Ezzy said the 7.1% increase in national dwelling values over the past year had added the equivalent of about $53,000 to the national median. But rising house values were accompanied by worsening affordability. “Despite the increase in the number of million-dollar markets, borrowers are likely to be dedicating more of their income towards servicing their mortgage”, she said. “With an $800,000 loan balance (assuming a 20% deposit) and the current average variable mortgage rate for new owner- occupiers (6.28%), a household would need an annual income close to $200,000 to keep repayments on a $1m home under 30% of their income. This marks an increase from the around $125,000 needed prior to the first interest rate hike [in May 2022].” Qantas passengers told to expect ‘busy period’ Qantas passengers have been warned to expect a “busy period” today, with some advised to swap to earlier flights out of Melbourne as a precaution as engineers go on strike. The protected industrial action at Melbourne airport is by aircraft maintenance engineers teams. There are about 1,100 employees covered by these agreements, out of 2,500 engineers across Qantas. Qantas has been notified of work stoppages in Melbourne today and on Monday 30 September, Wednesday 2 October and Friday 4 October around the country. The union wants a 5% pay rise per year plus 15% in the first year. The Qantas Engineers’ Alliance said the strike was “highly likely” to affect flights in all major capitals. A Qantas spokesperson has said it put contingency plans in place and believed customers would not be affected. However Guardian Australia has seen a message that Qantas sent to travellers out of Melbourne saying the airline was “anticipating a busy period which may affect your flight”, and advising that “to help you avoid a possible delay, we’re offering the option to change to an earlier flight, free of charge”. Our economics columnist Greg Jericho has assembled out some superb graphics to illustrate how supermarkets have helped to keep inflation high and prolong the cost of living crisis. The “competition” on the price of Coke and Pepsi is a great example, he says, and shows how they ensure they always have those products available at a discount, which is obviously bad news for independents. Here’s Greg’s column: But there is apparently one way shoppers can beat the big two, according to Choice, which has a survey today showing that Aldi shoppers save at least $15 on a basket of essential items. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has asked the Israeli government to “respond positively” to requests from Zomi Frankcom’s family to release audio related to the fatal strikes on her aid convoy in Gaza. The former Australian defence force chief Mark Binskin, who prepared a report for the Australian government about the killing of Frankcom and six World Central Kitchen colleagues in Israeli drone strikes in Gaza on 1 April, said Israeli authorities had allowed him to view 90 minutes of drone footage of the convoy and subsequent strikes. But Binskin noted in his final report that this was “without audio”. Frankcom’s brother Mal told the ABC’s 7.30 program last month that he regarded the unheard audio as “another missing piece of the puzzle” because it was important to understand “the state of mind of the people making the decisions”. Mal Frankcom told 7.30 at the time: I asked him [Binskin] about that and he said that he was told that it was in Hebrew and it wouldn’t be understood. Wong joined the ABC’s 7.30 program from New York last night and was asked about the request for audio to be released. Wong said: The family has called for that and I have expressed that to the Israeli government and I have expressed the view that, in the circumstances … we would seek that the Israeli government respond positively to Zomi Frankcom’s family’s requests. Asked whether she had had any response from the Israeli side about that audio, Wong said: Not at my level, as yet, no. The deputy leader of the Greens, Mehreen Faruqi, said in a letter to Wong earlier this month that it was “incumbent on you to do what is necessary to obtain this audio evidence”. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer and I’m going to run through some of the best overnight stories before Rafqa Touma comes along. Some Labor MPs say the government should not be afraid of considering reforms to negative gearing, with several caucus members saying they were “open” to fresh and bolder responses to the housing crisis. The debate over the possible reform of negative gearing – a plan rejected by voters when it was part of Labor’s manifesto at the 2019 election – has been reignited in recent weeks amid the standoff over the government’s housing bills. The thoughts of Labor MPs come as a report shows there are more Australian suburbs than ever with a median home value of $1m or more, according to new data. Thousands of travellers face flight disruption today when hundreds of Qantas engineers stage a walkout in Melbourne over pay and conditions, according to media reports. The strike is part of industrial action that is expected to take place at major airports across Australia over the next two weeks. The Qantas Engineers’ Alliance, which is organising the action, said the strike was “highly likely” to affect flights but the airline said it had contingencies in place. More developments coming up. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has asked the Israeli government to “respond positively” to requests from Zomi Frankcom’s family to release audio related to the fatal strikes on her aid convoy in Gaza. She told ABC’s 7.30 last night that she had passed on the family’s requests but had not received any response so far “at her level”. And as Israeli attacks continue on Lebanon, we have been speaking to Lebanese Australians about the helplessness and despair they feel while their country is under attack. More coming up on both these stories."

          "bodyText": "To grasp the real threat to Keir Starmer, ignore the chat about freebie specs or Sue Gray. Tune out the now shuttered party conference, with its secure zone of paid babblers. Listen instead to those in a group avowedly loyal to the new prime minister, because they can see the dangers in plain sight. Labour Together gets called a Westminster thinktank, but that cap doesn’t quite fit. Rather than a policy shop, its expertise is polling and focus groups – the very tools relied upon by a previous boss, Morgan McSweeney, in his strategy to make Starmer Labour leader. Those same instruments are also at the heart of its latest investigation – called How Labour Won – into why and how the party just got into Downing Street. You might imagine that a bunch of Starmeroids doing a debrief on their own historic landslide would simply puff out their chests and pat their own backs, but no. There’s the odd V-sign flicked in the direction of Jeremy Corbyn, inevitably, yet what’s most striking about their analysis is its tone of frank anxiety. Here is an organisation at the heart of the Starmer project, and it is already worried about how long it’s got left. The election may have been won by Labour, note the authors, but it was primarily thrown away by the Tories through “their corruption and incompetence”. This goes way beyond gilt wallpaper and Downing Street parties. “Britain’s democracy is not delivering. A majority of voters for all parties have little faith in politicians’ desire to help ordinary people.” Then comes the most telling line of all: “This Labour government has been cautiously hired, on a trial basis, liable to prompt dismissal if it deviates even slightly from its focus on voters’ priorities.” So what are those priorities? Drawing on interviews with 10,000 voters, the report breaks them down by party allegiance. Staunch Labour supporters say their top concerns are the NHS, the need for change and the cost of living. Liberal Democrats choose the same three, and in the same order. Ditto for those who switched to Starmer after backing Boris Johnson in 2019. Whether red or yellow or faded blue, the agreement is striking. For all the front pages and phone-ins, immigration comes way down the list for all voters apart from Tories and Faragists. Everyone else is going to judge this government by two things: whether they and their loved ones can see a doctor, and how far they’ll be protected from the rising cost of housing, food and fuel. What’s more, they want action fast: asked how long they will wait before there’s “a noticeable difference to the cost of living”, half of Britons give it till 2026. Just two years. Forget “a decade of renewal”: Starmer is on borrowed time. Indeed, these findings make nonsense of many of the nostrums of conference week. The SW1 roadshow currently touring select provincial convention centres may demand Labour “get a grip” on the running of No 10, but voters may prefer ministers to get a grip on the markets that demand they pay so much for heating, eating and the roofs over their heads. Economists get excited about an accounting trick that could allow Rachel Reeves to build more infrastructure. A fund that gets crumbly concrete off our classrooms is a great idea, but it is no substitute for recruiting and paying the teachers to staff those classrooms – or indeed upping the universal credit and other benefits needed by parents of the kids. Westminster analysts so often act as if politics is what politicians say and do, and then miss things like Brexit, or the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, or the return of the far right. Their excitement comes when the prime minister makes a speech in his new back garden, not when the watchdogs announce that the average annual heating bill will rise to more than £1,700. Meanwhile, voters in post-Brexit Britain look upon the great democratic paradox of prime ministers with bumper majorities, right and left, who protest they can’t deliver what they promised because of forces beyond their control. The Gullivers of SW1 play at being as helpless as us Lilliputians. Much more of this and the two-party system will collapse. Starmer’s team can see some of this, which is why he talks about a “government of service” and the stage set in Liverpool blared “Change begins”. Yet it still places economic growth ahead of more money in pockets and public services. As Labour Together and others point out, the public demand one thing: investment in their health service and in their households. Meanwhile, Downing Street offers something else. Its number one mission, as conference visitors were reminded, is to secure the highest sustained GDP growth of all the G7 countries. This is economic nonsense: short of physically controlling the economies of the US, Japan and the rest, the UK can’t guarantee to grow more than them. It also sounds like nonsense to voters. Survey after survey shows that more than half the public don’t understand the very term GDP. As one study from 2020 showed, Britons often get it confused with GBP or GDPR. However many speeches chancellors make, most of the gains from economic growth do not end up in the pockets of most people. Of all the growth in take-home pay between 1999 and 2020, the top 10% of earners made off with 25%, while the bottom 10% got only 3%. These figures come from the Foundational Economy collective of researchers, and they bear out the old dictum: the rich get richer, the poor get sod all. It’s why in the Brexit referendum the heckle began, “That’s your bloody GDP. Not ours.” Starmer and his ministers should heed the hecklers. As Brexit illustrated, in that gulf between the governed and the governors can grow all manner of dangerous politics – dangerous not just to a few careers, but to the entire Westminster system. The observant can already spot the resentments or conspiracy theories: about an out-of-touch political class living it up in free holiday homes, or about how immigrants get handouts while Britons are given a cold shoulder. The public are demanding the redistribution of resources into their everyday lives – and they want it now. The government should stop talking about GDP and start to listen.

          "bodyText": "Ladies, are you DEPRESSED and UNHAPPY? Do you feel POORER and LESS HEALTHY than you did four years ago? Do you pray one day your little woman brain will NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION all the time? Well, don’t worry, Donald Trump is going to FIX ALL OF THAT. So he says, anyway. At 11.42pm on Friday night Trump flexed his fingers, hit the all-caps key, and ranted on Truth Social about how UNHAPPY women are under the Biden administration. What happened at 11.41pm to prompt this, I wonder? Did he get a preview of some new polls which show him trailing Kamala Harris, partly thanks to a historic gender gap that sees Harris leading among women 58% to 37%? Did Trump decide, in his infinite wisdom, that the best way to fix this was an all-caps rant? Because I am not sure that is a winning strategy. I know you’d probably rather bleach your own eyeballs, but I do encourage you to have a look at Trump’s incoherent post for yourself. Really take in his rambling – unedited by journalists desperately trying to make his various unhinged utterances coherent – and remind yourself that there is a very real chance that this guy might become president again. We are all so desensitised to Trump that we sometimes forget that he lacks the ability even to string a sentence together. No respectable employer would hire someone who posted the sort of stuff he does, yet he might soon land the biggest job in the world. Again. While Harris may be leading Trump in the latest polls, the numbers are still within the margin of error. The race is extremely close. Like many people who desperately want the carnage in Gaza, and now Lebanon, to end, I have lost hope that Harris will do any meaningful work towards a ceasefire. I dread a Trump presidency, but I also have no enthusiasm for a Harris presidency. Still, the fact that, with just weeks to go to the election, we are in a situation where a highly credentialled woman is neck and neck with an extremist sexual predator and convicted felon who writes late-night rants in all-caps is an astounding indictment of US politics.

          "bodyText": "Good afternoon. Inflation dived last month to its lowest rate in three years as household budgets started to feel the impact of the Albanese government’s cost-of-living relief and cheaper petrol – but the Reserve Bank will wait for a more sustained drop before it starts cutting interest rates. Headline consumer price inflation in August was 2.7%, the slowest increase since August 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, called the numbers “heartening”, saying the government’s cost-of-living policies were “an important part of the story but not the whole story here”. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, said Australia “remains close to the back of the pack in dealing with our core inflation”. The CPI numbers were much as expected, with the dollar and stocks not budging much. But while the inflation slide will be welcomed by households, it is unlikely to sway the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock. Top news Panic as BoM tests tsunami warning | The Bureau of Meteorology has apologised for confusion after sending a tsunami warning, before cancelling it. The bureau said it was testing new tsunami early warning software and reiterated there was no threat to safety. Robodebt victims seek further compensation | Lawyers for victims of the debt recovery scandal will appeal against the $1.8bn settlement with the commonwealth, alleging “damning new evidence” that indicated senior public servants “knew that robodebt was unlawful but went ahead with it anyway”. Labor refuses to rule out negative gearing changes | Anthony Albanese has repeatedly declined to confirm or deny whether the federal government is considering changes to negative gearing, but conceded that public servants “do a range of proposals” on potential ideas. The Greens have welcomed the idea, but the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said “we’ve got a housing policy and that is not in it”. Renewables bounce back | Large-scale renewable energy investment and construction is rebounding this year after a slump, according to new data, but will need to accelerate to reach the pace needed to meet the Albanese government’s goal for 2030. Tasmania joins commonwealth school funding deal | Tasmania has become the third jurisdiction to sign on to the commonwealth’s school funding deal, a move the state and federal governments say will see Tasmania’s public schools become fully funded by 2029. But the Australian Education Union has dismissed the agreement as a “cloak-and-dagger deal” which will never see schools reach their full funding level. Missouri executes Marcellus Williams | The 55-year-old death row inmate was killed by lethal injection, ending a legal battle that has sparked widespread outrage as the prosecutors who originally tried the case suggested he was wrongfully convicted. AFL issues warning over black market tickets | The AFL has warned fans to be vigilant around buying grand final tickets after thousands of official barcodes were “illegally downloaded” in a digital security breach. The AFL chief executive, Andrew Dillon, said the extent of the breach was “in the small four figures”. Finland zoo returns giant pandas due to inflation | A zoo in Finland has blamed rising inflation and upkeep costs for its decision to return two giant pandas to China, more than eight years before the date they were set to go back. What they said … *** “Civilians are being killed by Israeli strikes and it is women and children who are paying the highest price … Lebanon cannot become the next Gaza. And the violence in Gaza must end.” – Penny Wong In a strengthening of the government’s language, the foreign affairs minister said the Israeli assault on southern Lebanon “only makes an immediate ceasefire in Gaza even more urgent”, and that Australians in Lebanon should “take the first opportunity” to get out. The call comes amid more Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon, hours after Hezbollah confirmed the death of a senior commander in Beirut. One big chart If you live in a major city in Australia, it might feel like there is a new smoke or vape shop popping up every other week. Yet the smoking rate has been in constant decline since the 1990s. Nick Evershed digs into the data to find out: are there actually more smoke shops? Is this due to the skyrocketing rates of vaping? And how has the government’s crackdown on vape imports affected things, if at all? Before bed read ‘Of course we’d come back’: the voices of Daria on its legacy – and future Back in the late 90s, when MTV asked for a female-centric spin-off to their hit animated show Beavis and Butt-Head, Daria rose to the challenge.

          "headline": "Australia’s annual inflation rate in August falls to lowest since 2021 at 2.7%",
          "bodyText": "Inflation dived last month to its lowest rate in three years as government cost-of-living relief and cheaper petrol helped household budgets – but the Reserve Bank will wait for a more sustained drop before it starts cutting interest rates. Headline consumer price inflation in August was 2.7%, the slowest increase since August 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That compared with the 2.7% rate expected by economists and July’s 3.5% annual pace. The underlying inflation measure, which strips out more volatile price movers, also fell. Known as the trimmed mean, this gauge came in at 3.4%, down from July’s 3.8%. Electricity prices fell by a record 17.9% thanks to government rebates, while automotive fuel was 7.6% cheaper. “Excluding the rebates, electricity prices would have risen 0.1% in August and 0.9% in July,” said Michelle Marquardt, ABS’s head of prices statistics. Renters, though, didn’t get much relief, with the annual increase at 6.8%, slightly lower than previous months. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were 3.4% higher than in August 2023, easing from the 3.8% annual increase registered in July. It was the lowest reading since February 2022. While the inflation slide will be welcomed by households, it is unlikely to sway the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock. She wants to see the more comprehensive September quarter numbers, due out on 30 October, but is doubtful the drop will be enough yet to prompt an interest rate cut. “The board needs to be confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the [2-3%] target before any decisions are made about a reduction in interest rates,” Bullock said on Tuesday. “Progress in getting underlying inflation down has slowed and is likely to have remained slow in the September quarter.” Still, Bullock’s admission that the RBA board did not “explicitly” consider lifting its cash rate at this week’s meeting shifted market expectations. Investors bet there is about a one-in-four chance of a rate cut in November and a two-in-three chance by December, prior to today’s inflation release. The inflation figures were much as the market anticipated, with the Australian dollar hovering near 18-month highs at just below 69 US cents. Stocks were little changed on the day. David Bassanese, Betashare’s chief economist, noted underlying inflation was less than the 3.5% forecast by the RBA for the December quarter. “If annual trimmed mean inflation does not once again lurch higher, but continues its recent trajectory lower, there is a growing chance it could reach the mid-point of the RBA’s 2-3% target band by year-end, which would be significantly better than current RBA forecasts,” Bassanese said. “If so, there would be a good chance the RBA could cut interest rates before Christmas.” Among other key items, the cost of building new homes or major renovations rose 5.1% from a year earlier. This gauge has remained at about 5% for the past year, “with builders passing on higher costs for labour and materials”, the ABS said. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the August inflation numbers were “very welcome, very encouraging and very heartening numbers”. “Whether it is rent, energy rebates, our cost-of-living policies are an important part of the story but not the whole story here,” Chalmers said, noting rental increases would have been at an annual pace of 8.6% without the commonwealth’s rent assistance. “We are seeing right across a number of measures of inflation including underlying inflation that it has come off considerably in the new numbers that we see today,” he said. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, said however that on average prices had “risen by now 10% since Labor came to power”, with those for “working families” up by more than 18%. “Our core inflation is higher than every other advanced country, peer country, in the world other than the UK and that is not one I would be wanting to compare myself with just now,” Taylor said."

          "headline": "Trump scapegoats migrants again at Georgia event meant to discuss economy",
          "bodyText": "At an event intended to tout economic policies that would usher in what his campaign calls a “new age of American industrialism”, Donald Trump spent as much time discussing personal grievances and blaming immigrants for everything from fentanyl overdoses to crime and taking Americans’ jobs as he did discussing the economy. “This is a speech on economic development but this is a big part of economic development,” the former president said of immigration at a speech in Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday. After about 30 minutes of sticking to prepared remarks about the economy, Trump’s speech veered into other topics like immigration, much to the crowd’s delight. “Close the border!” a man in the crowd yelled as Trump said that undocumented immigrants were responsible for myriad ills. Some of the loudest cheers from a crowd of about 2,500 came when the Republican presidential nominee claimed that the United States already has much of what it needs to become an “economic powerhouse”, as he put it, including natural resources, skilled workers and leading companies. “The only thing we don’t have is smart people leading our country,” Trump said. Among other promises – including reducing Americans’ energy bills by half and claiming he would “prevent world war three” – Trump said he would revive American manufacturing and restore it to “how it was 50 years ago”. Trump also said he would block the sale of US Steel to the Japanese company Nippon – a plan that Joe Biden has said he plans to block. The former president bashed electric cars – with the exception of those made by his supporter Elon Musk – a perhaps odd tactic considering the ongoing construction of a $5.4bn Hyundai electric car plant that will employ 8,500 workers and has been lauded by Georgia governor Brian Kemp. Trump didn’t mention the plant or Kemp in his remarks. Trump then became sidetracked with immigration, questioning Kamala Harris’s intelligence and patriotism, and reliving an assassination attempt in July in Pennsylvania and another scare in Florida earlier this month. Trump claimed it had been more than luck that saved his life the day he was grazed by an assassin’s bullet. “People say: ‘It was God, and God came down and saved you because he wants you to bring America back,’” Trump said as the crowd began to chant “USA!” Eventually returning to the economy, Trump said a plan to give away federal land to companies willing to build manufacturing facilities there would prompt “entire industries” to relocate to the United States. He also said he would cap the tax rate for corporations at 15% – but only for companies whose products are made in the United States. Trump and Republicans already reduced the highest possible corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% when Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. The top-end corporate tax rate was made permanent under the law, but individual tax reductions included in the legislation are set to expire in 2025. Both candidates have said they want to see those tax cuts extended, but Harris says she would raise the highest rate to 28%. It was Trump’s first visit to Georgia since 3 August, when he held a rally in Atlanta. Last month, Harris visited Savannah and held a rally that drew nearly 9,000 supporters. Much of Trump’s economic policies can’t be separated from his views on immigration. That line of attack – that a weak economy and even inflation and the availability of goods is the fault of immigrants – resonated with a pair of the Republican candidate’s voters waiting to get into his event on Tuesday. “We don’t have enough groceries in our stores because of all the immigrants here,” said Christy Donley, who drove from nearby Pembroke to hear Trump speak. “We’ve got Americans here who can’t get the American dream but we’re giving the American dream to illegal immigrants.” Donley’s friend, Kassie Williams, chimed in. “Loans, healthcare, drivers’ licenses – we’re giving all this stuff to immigrants whether they deserve it or not,” said Williams, who believes that the corporate tax cuts Trump has proposed will help out individual workers. “I want to hear him be more detailed when he says he’s going to give corporations tax breaks. I understand how it benefits everybody – they’ll lower the unemployment rate, which will make for more tax revenue from people – but not everybody might understand that.”"

          "bodyText": "Parents of babies attacked by Lucy Letby were not told their children had suffered life-threatening collapses until they were contacted by the police years later, an inquiry has heard. The parents of one newborn boy said it was “disgusting” they were “kept in the dark” by staff at the Countess of Chester hospital after their son’s health suffered a serious deterioration in June 2016. The boy’s mother said they only learned about this incident six years later – in late 2022 – when police told the parents that Letby had attempted to kill the infant on the night shift. Letby, 34, was found guilty of attempting to murder the boy, who can be named only as Child N, in the early hours of 3 June 2016 but a jury was unable to reach verdicts on two further counts of attempted murder. The former neonatal nurse was sentenced to 15 whole-life orders after being convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to kill another seven. She maintains her innocence. The Thirlwall inquiry into the killings was told on Tuesday that Child N’s blood oxygen levels had plummeted in the early hours of 3 June, prompting doctors to respond to a “crash call” to revive him. The days-old infant made a relatively swift recovery but Child N’s mother said she had “no idea there had been an issue” with her son that morning until six years later, a month before the criminal trial began in October 2022. She added: “I was not aware of anything significant or sinister that had occurred prior to 15 June. We were essentially kept in the dark about this.” In a statement read by the family’s barrister, Peter Skelton KC, Child N’s father said: “We did not know that Child N had had problems overnight on 3 June. I find this disgusting. As parents we have an absolute right to know what was happening to and with our son.” The boy’s mother said hospital executives were “complicit” in the harm because they had failed to launch a “thorough or prompt” investigation when concerns were first raised about Letby. She added: “They shouldn’t be able to continue in their roles and should face criminal action.” The father of twin boys attacked by Letby also told the Thirlwall inquiry on Tuesday that no one from the hospital told them that there was anything unusual or suspicious about their sons’ sudden deterioration in April 2016. He said the family only learned there was anything untoward in 2019, when they were contacted by police. One of the consultants told detectives in 2019 that he recalled seeing “very unusual … patches of pink flitting” on Child M’s abdomen after an incident in which Letby was later convicted of injecting the baby with air. But Child M’s father said on Tuesday they were not told about these “blotches” at the time, nor did they know their son was at one stage being treated for the serious intestinal condition necrotising enterocolitis (NEC). The inquiry was also told that the mother of Child N had made a formal NHS complaint about one of Letby’s colleagues for discussing her son’s case with the nurse using Facebook Messenger and text message. She said the doctor, who can be named only as Dr U, showed a “disregard for and blatant breaches of patient confidentiality”. The mother said she lodged the complaint last year with PALS, the NHS patient and liaison service, at the hospital where the doctor now works. She has yet to be told of any outcome, the inquiry heard."

          "headline": "Lions’ Dan Campbell doxxed by daughter’s classmate prompting family’s relocation – report",
          "bodyText": "Dan Campbell’s home address was publicly leaked on social media by his daughter’s classmate earlier this year, according to a report by the Detroit News published Monday, which led the Detroit Lions head coach to sell the family’s home after at least four documented instances of harassment and unwanted visitors on the property. The Detroit News reported the doxxing prompted multiple people to show up at the Campbells’ residence in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, on the night of 28 January, shortly after the Lions’ loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. An investigation conducted by police and NFL security revealed that a male high school classmate of Campbell’s daughter posted the family’s home address on Snapchat with the accompanying text of: “Dumb fuck trying to go for it”. Campbell and his wife, Holly, who were still in the Bay Area at the time, became “nervous for the safety of their daughter” at the suburban residence after vehicles and people showed up outside the house, the report stated. The daughter’s boyfriend, who was also at the house, “went outside in his vehicle and flashed his headlights at anyone approaching causing these people to turn off and leave,” according to the report. The report said the daughter’s classmate was identified the following day and questioned by investigators, but authorities informed Holly Campbell that the incident did not meet the standard to file criminal charges against the classmate. The classmate said he and his friends were “distraught” by the Lions’ loss to the 49ers and that he “found humor” in the Snapchat post. The classmate and his friends later drove to the Campbells’ residence, parked on the street and were “yelling not nice things toward the house” before leaving, according to the report. “Holly’s only concern is that their address is out there now, and she fears next season people will know when her husband is out of town and try to take advantage of that,” the investigator wrote, according to the report. Last week Crain’s Detroit Business reported the Campbells’ address got out online, leading to pranks and harassment on multiple occasions. The publication said Campbell and his wife bought what it described as a 7,800 sq ft Cape Cod-style “mansion” in Oakland County, Michigan, in 2021. “The home is beautiful,” Campbell told Crain’s. “It’s just that people figured out where we lived when we lost.” While Campbell gave no information about the family’s new home, the old one was listed on Zillow at $4.5m on Tuesday and was under contract the same day. Per Zillow information, the five-bedroom, seven-plus bathroom home set on 1.72 acres sold for $3.5m in March 2021. Campbell’s Lions were 3-13-1 in his first season in 2021 but have gone 23-14 since."

          "bodyText": "Name: Pothole vigilantism. Age: Late byproduct of broken Britain. Appearance: Endearingly amateurish. Goodness, what now? Are vigilantes digging up the road to disrupt traffic? No, quite the opposite. What do you mean? They’re filling in potholes. That should keep them busy. It certainly should. The RAC says there are at least 1m potholes in UK roads. Funny, I thought there would be more. There probably are. The road-safety campaigner Mark Morrell, who goes by Mr Pothole, launched a dashboard app that recently indicated there may be as many as 11.5m potholes in the UK. Why don’t councils just fill them in? In short, a lack of funds. Road-maintenance spending has fallen in real terms and the backlog is always growing. Hence pothole vigilantism. Exactly. Frustrated locals are taking matters – and macadam – into their own hands. For example? In August, 75-year-old Jenny Paterson felt moved to fill in the potholes outside her home in Halkirk, Caithness, using her own gardening tools. Did she do a good job? No, it looked terrible, but that’s not the point. “It’s temporary, but maybe it will shame the council into doing something,” she said. So the shame is the point? In most cases, yes. In Horsham, West Sussex, 22-year-old Harry Haggett-Smith is busy embarrassing the council into action by planting flowers in potholes. Does that work? He claims he has a near 100% success rate in getting councils to fix the potholes he plants up. It’s the flowers I feel sorry for. They don’t tend to last long, but Haggett-Smith documents his efforts on TikTok, where he gets millions of views. It sounds as if pothole vigilantism can be a creative hobby. For some. At the start of the year, 19-year old Ben Thornbury was pictured fishing in rain-filled potholes in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, to highlight their impressive depth. Previously, he had set up a crazy-golf course featuring local potholes. What do local authorities have to say about pothole vigilantism? They’re against it. Of Paterson’s efforts, Highland council said: “Whilst the council appreciates the concerns around pothole repairs, it is not appropriate for individuals to undertake repairs on the public highway.” Spoilsports. It’s the shame talking. Do say: “We encourage prompt reporting of potholes so we can effect the necessary repairs as quickly as possible.” Don’t say: “You bring a wheelbarrow and a hosepipe and I’ll bring the baby ducks.”"

          "headline": "Activists pledge to give their votes away to children in global campaign",
          "bodyText": "A group of academics and activists have launched a global campaign to enfranchise children, by pledging to give their own votes to a young person until the voting age is significantly lowered or abolished. Some members of the Children’s Voting Colloquium have already voted on behalf of a child even if this has meant opting for a different political party or candidate of their choice. The group, which has members from 12 countries including the UK and US, claims that giving votes to children as young as six would encourage governments to tackle a range of intractable long-term issues such as the climate crisis, inequality and social care. They are urging supporters of ageless suffrage to join them in signing a new online pledge to hand over their votes to their own children or the offspring of a friend, family member, or neighbour. One of the signatories, Matías Cordero Arce, a researcher and educator in a juvenile justice centre in Spain’s Basque country, has already twice given his vote to his daughter Maialen. She is now 14 but was 13 when she cast her father’s vote in regional and European elections earlier this year. Asked if she felt like a pioneer for child suffrage, Maialen said: “Maybe a little bit, because it has opened the minds of my classmates. I hope the idea will grow.” She says she now feels more interested in politics. “When I couldn’t vote I didn’t follow politics and know what was happening. Now I think more about it,” she said. Cordero Arce usually votes for Spain’s leftist Podemos party but under his daughter’s control his vote went to Pacma, a small party that campaigns for animal welfare and the environment. Maialen said: “We have to care more for the planet, because if we destroy the planet nothing else matters.” Her father said: “I have never thought about voting for Pacma – they don’t get enough votes to be represented in parliament.” The pact with his daughter means his vote goes to her even if they vehemently disagree. He said: “I’ve made my choice that she votes for me, and it is not approved beforehand. I have voted enough and I’ve left her in a very inhospitable world, so the time is overdue for her to become enfranchised, and for me to pass on the baton.” Spain’s voting system means that Cordero Arce has to show his identity card to vote, but the rest of the voting process can be done by his daughter. She picks a sheet of paper of the party of her preference, seals it in an envelope and puts in the ballot box. Cordero Arce says officials have not stopped her voting because children are often present at polling stations. “I wouldn’t say it’s legal, but I wouldn’t say it’s illegal either. In the Basque Country, you can go to the polling booth with whomever you want.” The idea of giving votes to children has been discussed in academic circles for some time and supporters include the University of Cambridge’s politics professor David Runciman. Cordero Arce said the new campaign aimed to make these ideas a practical reality and prompt a debate beyond academia. He said the idea should not be confused with a suggestion once put forward by Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, to give parents more votes than those who are childless. “His idea is about empowering parents, ours is about empowering kids,” Cordero Arce said. The online pledge says: “We, the undersigned, have decided that in solidarity with children and as a protest against this blatant injustice, until children reach voting age, each of us will transfer our vote to a child who is willing to accept it.” It says the idea “has been received with enthusiasm and eagerness by the children we have approached, some as young as six”. But the organisers are against setting an age threshold for voting. The pledge says: “No one should renounce their right to vote. But it is the more democratic solution given the current state of affairs. We call on elected representatives … to reflect on the injustice of denying children their right to vote.” It says that if the voting age was abolished or lowered, “governments might finally gain urgency on the climate crisis, properly funded education, ensure lifelong healthcare, lift families out of poverty, and advance other policies previously shunned due to ignoring children’s voices”. The only member of Cordero Arce’s family who is disenfranchised is Maialen’s 11-year-old brother, Xabier. “I feel he is old enough to vote, and it could be even younger,” she said. Her father added: “My own view is that that anyone who is materially capable should be able to vote, because you should be able to have a say on things that affect you.” • This article was amended on 24 September 2024 to correct the spelling of Xabier."

          "headline": "African football executive accused of ‘whitewashing’ report into his conduct",
          "bodyText": "The Confederation of African Football’s general secretary, Véron Mosengo-Omba, could be suspended after he was accused of “whitewashing” an investigation into allegations of serious misconduct against him. Caf’s audit and compliance committee claimed there had been “unauthorised interference” from Mosengo-Omba regarding a report into his conduct, because the external auditor had been appointed by him. Last month Caf opened an investigation into Mosengo-Omba and his office after its head of governance, risk and compliance (GRC) accused them of “impeding” members of her department from performing their duties and, among other claims, of breaching internal governance and auditing regulations. Caf said its audit and compliance committee would appoint an independent international law firm or audit and professional services firm to conduct the investigation, and its president, Patrice Motsepe, promised “appropriate action will immediately be taken if improper conduct or behaviour is identified”. When the external auditor EY submitted a report it was rejected by the committee, which wrote, in a report seen by the Guardian, that it was “unable to have reasonable assurance on the accuracy of the opening balances for the period concerned”. The committee said it had been “surprised to receive a so-called ‘draft report of the audit and compliance committee’” via Caf’s director of legal affairs. “The committee learned that this ‘draft report’ that it is asked to validate, was prepared by an external consultant recruited by the Caf secretariat, without informing the commission and without obtaining its prior agreement,” it said. An EY consultant presented her report at a meeting on 7 September but members of the audit and compliance committee decided it “was prepared in such a way as to contradict all the allegations contained in the confidential report” by the GRC. They said: “The committee is convinced that this is work oriented towards the aim of whitewashing parties to the detriment of others concerned by the ongoing independent investigation. By appointing an external consultant who interferes in the work of the committee without our agreement, the CAF secretariat contravenes the principle of independence of our committee and exceeds its statutory powers in this regard.” The committee’s report also accused its vice-chair Mouhamed Nour-Dine Assindoh of having liaised with the consultant over her report without its consent. It called for Assindoh to be suspended from the committee until the end of his term in June 2027 and for Caf to take the “necessary decisions” regarding Mosengo-Omba. It is understood the committee believes that suspending Mosengo-Omba would be an appropriate first step. Neither Caf nor Mosengo-Omba responded to repeated requests from the Guardian for comment. Mosengo-Omba posted on X in July: “My efforts to turn around and regularize this institution, which has been disrespected at times, are being sabotaged by an out-of-the-blue report containing grievances without documented proof. The planned independent investigation will expose the falsity &amp; origin of this report.” At a meeting of Caf’s executive committee in Nairobi last week, Motsepe insisted the audit and compliance commission’s investigation into Mosengo-Omba would be allowed to proceed without interference. “No one will tell them how to do their work,” he said. “They are independent.” Caf was embarrassed when a livestream of the usually private executive committee meeting in the Kenyan capital appeared on YouTube by mistake. It was taken down after Motsepe appeared to openly question the integrity of some of the executive committee’s members. “You are not my friend and you are not helping me when you are not honest with me,” he said. A proposal to extend the 70-year age limit by five years for prospective executive committee members was passed without opposition. That is expected to prompt the 71-year-old Egyptian and Fifa council member Hany Abo Rida announce that he will stand against Motsepe in next year’s elections."

          "headline": "Rightmove should keep saying no to the Murdochs",
          "bodyText": "The board of Rightmove says it will “carefully consider” the latest takeover offer from REA Group, the Australian property company majority-owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. One hopes Rightmove’s directors are merely being polite. This third bid, like the last two, deserves a flat rejection. Such a response would be consistent with Rightmove’s admirably robust stance so far – the one that has caused REA’s chief executive, Owen Wilson, to grumble about how he is “genuinely disappointed” at the lack of the engagement from the UK boardroom. What Wilson misses is that a target company is not obliged to have a cosy chat if it thinks the offer terms are too mean. In this case, the Rightmove chair, Andrew Fisher, has already called REA’s approaches at 705p and 749p “uncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive”. So Monday’s bump to 761p or £6.1bn – an improvement of only 1.6% on the second offer – should not prompt a fundamental rethink. In the coded language of takeover scraps, the difference between “unattractive” and “attractive” implies more than a tiny percentage. REA might protest that its third offer was worth slightly more – 770p – at the moment it was made, but therein lies its challenge as a bidder. Only 341p of the offer is in cash. The rest is in REA shares that, since this expedition started, have proved to be a less-than-solid acquisition currency on the Sydney stock exchange. The decline so far is 10%, presumably because REA’s non-News Corp investors fear their company will end up overpaying for a business on the other side of the world. Viewed through a UK prism, however, Rightmove fully deserves a rich premium if its shareholders are to be persuaded to sell. Yes, the share price has gone roughly sideways for two years, as the bidder has identified, but this is hardly a case of dry rot in the timbers. Rightmove’s market share in the online marketing of residential property is still about 85%, its profit margins are still a remarkable 70% and it generates enough cash to run a share buyback programme on top of its dividend. Nor has Rightmove run out of room to grow. It has started to expand into mortgage-broking and commercial property. Analysts at Bernstein observe that the company’s plan targets an effective improvement in operating profit of 55% between 2024 and 2028. Since the operational synergies between Australian and UK property portals are approximately zero, a combination of the two wouldn’t obviously accelerate the pace. For a flavour of the other analysts’ views on Monday, try Peel Hunt: “We believe the offer is still not at a level that Rightmove investors will consider.” Or Panmure Liberum in a similar vein: “We don’t see this offer as providing much in the way of incentive for long-term investors to sell.” In other words, Fisher and the Rightmove board would not be going against the grain of City opinion in telling REA to come back with a proper price – if it can – or hop off. A 37% takeover premium to the pre-approach share price is not enough. The formal “put up or shut up” deadline is still a week away and REA did not use the word “final” to describe its latest offer. So there is time for more action. For the time being, though, Rightmove’s board should continue to say no. Its standalone strategy is fine."

          "bodyText": "Oliver takes centre stage in biggest clash The Etihad showed off the best and worst of English football. Arsenal almost rolled back the years when their back five frustrated all-comers. Riccardo Calafiori’s cracking goal reminded of Ronaldinho at his improvisational best. Manchester City’s opener through Erling Haaland was a beauty, too. As for the bad – a referee taking centre stage and often losing control. Michael Oliver should not be headline-maker after this meeting of the Premier League’s best teams, but is likely to be. Sending off Leandro Trossard was correct, the Belgian foolish, but his red card generated the usual conspiracies that now swamp elite football. Arsenal then cranked up the gamesmanship as both sidelines behaved like spoiled children. That City, until John Stones’ goal, were poor – Rúben Dias is no attacking force – will concern Pep Guardiola. So will Rodri’s injury. Without him, City are a lesser force. Mikel Arteta may wonder about Arsenal’s own lack of composure: 10 men need not have meant complete submission. John Brewin Match report: Manchester City 2-2 Arsenal Nuno makes use of extra firepower Nuno Espírito Santo did not watch the end of Nottingham Forest’s draw from the dugout after his late red card, but his proactive substitutions again made the difference, extending their unbeaten start to the season. Forest were in trouble, trailing 2-1 at half-time against a purring Brighton, but Nuno’s four changes within the first 15 minutes of the second half propelled them to a hard-earned point. Jota Silva and Ramón Sosa combined from off the bench for the equaliser. It was a similar story in the stunning victory at Liverpool, when Anthony Elanga set up substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi. Nuno deserves credit for his use of Forest’s squad, showing a willingness to make positive changes rather than waiting too long. It is also further evidence of the greater depth at Forest’s disposal, suggesting there will not be any danger of being dragged into trouble after finishing one place above the relegation zone last season. Simon Mail Match report: Brighton 2-2 Nottingham Forest Maresca’s eye for detail aids Chelsea Enzo Maresca’s lack of experience was considered problematic on his appointment. He has so far shown few problems with making the step from winning the Championship with Leicester. If Stamford Bridge is a cauldron of uncertainty, of rebellion against the owners, Chelsea away from home have become a fearsome proposition. Like Wolves, beaten 6-2 in August, West Ham were picked apart by an approach full of risk but reaping rewards. Maresca’s Chelsea attack at speed, the wisdom of stockpiling wingers to play off Nicolas Jackson vindicated by the match-winning contributions of Noni Madueke, Christopher Nkunku and Jadon Sancho. “He gives us every single detail we need to be able to go into the game and put a performance in to get the points,” said Tosin Adarabioyo at the London Stadium. Maresca knows his way around English football, having been a teenage West Brom midfielder and handpicked former assistant to Pep Guardiola. His appointment is starting to look smart. JB Match report: West Ham 0-3 Chelsea Sarr not far from a start Ismaïla Sarr has only completed 90 minutes once since he joined Crystal Palace from Marseille in the summer, and that was for Senegal against Burundi in a Cup of Nations qualifier. In every game for Palace, he has come off the bench. But in the second half against Manchester United, the former Watford winger was arguably Palace’s best player, quick, direct and aggressive. The oddity was that he was played at centre-forward, replacing Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has perhaps paid the price so far this season for his exertions with France at the Olympics. Eddie Nketiah remained in one of the inside-forward positions in Oliver Glasner’s familiar 3-4-3. The assumption had been that Nketiah would become the central striker, as he operated for Arsenal, with Sarr taking up the semi-wide position. Whether that is a long-term plan or was a specific ploy to try to exploit something in United’s shape is unclear, but on that form, Sarr surely can’t be far from a start whichever position he takes up. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Crystal Palace 0-0 Manchester United Villa dig deep with strong subs When do the finishers become the starters? Aston Villa were lethargic for the first half of this comeback win over Wolves, prompting Unai Emery to change things at the break. Ian Maatsen replaced Lucas Digne in a like-for-like change at left-back and Leon Bailey came on for the captain John McGinn, who was forced off with a hamstring problem. Ross Barkley and Jhon Durán followed soon after the hour and from there Villa turned the tide. Durán has four goals in five substitute appearances and Barkley, an inspired half-time sub against Everton the previous week, again impressed. Villa’s depth ultimately proved the difference against Wolves, who faded after a strong start. “There’s a lot of fresh energy off the bench,” said Maatsen, who could be promoted to the starting lineup at Wycombe in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday. “We need to be ready and give our best. We keep calm, we know our players are going to make a difference. We always believe we can come from behind.” Ben Fisher Match report: Aston Villa 3-1 Wolves Leicester storms prompt weather question How bad does the weather have to turn for a Premier League match to be abandoned? Neither Steve Cooper nor Sean Dyche could remember a match being played in such a storm. Dyche was applying his Factor 50 before the match, so sunny were the conditions, but after about 20 minutes, the heavens opened and the rest of the first half was played in thunder, lightning and torrential rain. Cooper pointed out he could not see the assistant referee on the other side of the pitch and was mindful of player and spectator safety. The Euro 2024 tie between Germany and Denmark in the summer was suspended by Michael Oliver for 25 minutes. The start of the second half at Leicester was delayed for six minutes by Darren England after he consulted in the players’ tunnel with both managers. But the game resumed with the conditions briefly seeming to relent. Should it have done? Peter Lansley Match report: Leicester 1-1 Everton Gordon under pressure from Barnes While Fulham’s 3-1 victory over Newcastle ended up being about the old Arsenal boys – Reiss Nelson and Emile Smith Rowe scored, Alex Iwobi thrived – there was much to enjoy from their man on the right, Adama Traoré. This was the bulldozer at his best, hard running to go with end product, his cross for Raúl Jiménez’s opener followed by involvement in the second. Lloyd Kelly, the Newcastle left-back, was replaced at half-time: the winger had won. Anthony Gordon, Traoré’s counterpart, offered a contrast, beginning on the right before moving into the middle after the restart in the search for impact. Gordon was denied by Bernd Leno after a jinking run but delivered a largely blunt performance, his positional conundrum growing more complicated by Harvey Barnes’ continued success. Barnes, on the left, where Gordon shone last season, scored for the third game in succession, his case for a run of starts growing stronger. A period of adaptation could follow for Gordon. Taha Hashim Match report: Fulham 3-1 Newcastle United Martin deserves chance to march on So much in football is about perception. Both Southampton and Ipswich remain winless but while Kieran McKenna’s trajectory is still pointed upwards towards the elite, wild rumours of Russell Martin being replaced at Southampton have begun to circle. Five games into the season feels premature for the manager who hauled the club back up to the Premier League. Would John Eustace or Carlos Corberán, the Blackburn and West Brom managers linked, do any better? Pressure on Martin would surely have been released had they beaten Ipswich but there had been much to cheer, including a first senior goal for Tyler Dibling. The teenager almost assisted Cameron Archer, too, but the striker – otherwise lively – hit the woodwork. “It’s about game management, there’s too much anxiety in the team,” admitted Martin. It would be cruel if Southampton’s manager is denied his chance to fight on. JB Match report: Southampton 1-1 Ipswich Iraola and Arrizabalaga have work to do It was a bold call from Andoni Iraola to decide he wanted to change his first-choice goalkeeper late in the transfer window. Kepa Arrizabalaga arrived on loan from Chelsea and Neto headed to Arsenal to play second fiddle to David Raya. Few could complain about the efforts of the Brazilian, who was named club captain by former manager Gary O’Neil, but Iraola felt there was an upgrade to be had. Arrizabalaga has been the most expensive goalkeeper in world football since Chelsea paid £71m to sign him from Athletic Bilbao six years ago, but since then very little has gone right for the Basque. At Athletic Bilbao, Arrizabalaga played with Iraola, who must think he can extract the maximum from his new signing. The goalkeeper made a number of good saves to keep matters goalless at Anfield but made an awful mistake for the opener to drain his confidence. He and Iraola know there is work to do if they are to prove the manager’s decision right over the season. Will Unwin Match report: Liverpool 3-1 Bournemouth Defiant Frank reaction gives Bees hope The early Premier League fixture list has been particularly unkind to Brentford. Defeats at Anfield and the Etihad were followed by this 3-1 loss at Tottenham. While the angsty Spurs manager, Ange Postecoglou, finally savoured the fruits from his team’s drive and potency, even after Bryan Mbeumo put the Bees ahead inside the first minute, Thomas Frank’s defiance is certainly justified. Injury-stricken Brentford may have gifted their hosts a couple of goals via individual errors, but were subsequently thwarted several times by Guglielmo Vicario. The west London side, sitting in 12th place, have been purposeful for large chunks of all three away examinations. “There’s no away ground we are fearful of,” said Frank. “I like the bravery from my players.” There’s potential respite ahead for the Bees, with winnable home fixtures against West Ham and Wolves.
