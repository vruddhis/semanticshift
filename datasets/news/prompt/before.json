          "bodyText": "Romelu Lukaku has no intention of leaving Chelsea despite angering Thomas Tuchel with an interview in which the striker said that he was “not happy” with his situation at Stamford Bridge this season. Lukaku, who became Chelsea’s record signing after joining from Internazionale for £97.5m last summer, stumbled into a controversy of his own making when comments about his dissatisfaction with his role under Tuchel were released by Sky Italia on Thursday. The interview took place three weeks ago and was intended to help the Belgian build bridges with Inter fans. However, Lukaku ended up risking his relationship with Tuchel after questioning the manager’s system and adding that he wants to return to San Siro while still at “a good enough level”. Lukaku is not thinking about quitting Chelsea now and sources said there was “zero chance” of a reunion with Inter in January. The forward revealed that he had turned down an offer from Manchester City in 2020 and, when Inter rejected his request for a new contract last summer, decided that Chelsea were the only team he would contemplate joining. Nonetheless the interview has irritated Tuchel, whose problems increased after Reece James was ruled out for at least two months with a torn hamstring. James’s absence could prompt Chelsea to try to sign Kieran Trippier, who wants to return to the Premier League from Atlético Madrid and is being pursued by Newcastle. Tuchel would not confirm whether Lukaku would face disciplinary action and said the 28-year-old had hurt Chelsea’s focus before they try to revive their ailing title challenge by beating Liverpool on Sunday. “We don’t like it,” Tuchel said. “It brings noise that we don’t need and it’s not helpful. We don’t want to make more out of it than it actually is. It is easy to take lines out of context, shorten lines, make headlines and then realise later that it is not so bad. We need a calm environment and focus and this does not help.” Tuchel said he would speak to Lukaku, who fired Inter to the title last season. “I don’t feel him unhappy,” the German said. “I feel the exact opposite. That’s why it’s a surprise. If there is something to discuss it’s behind closed doors. It does not reflect his daily work. “But you need to ask him. Everything you say is out there if you are such a big player like Romelu. He is experienced and should know what kind of value it has when he speaks out like this.” Lukaku, who has seven goals in 18 appearances in all competitions, has endured a frustrating time since returning to Stamford Bridge. He had gone seven games without a goal before suffering an ankle injury in October and had a further spell on the sidelines after testing positive for Covid-19 just before Christmas. Lukaku had given a less explosive interview after making a goalscoring return in Chelsea’s win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day. Lukaku, who also scored in Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Brighton on Wednesday, described himself as “multidimensional” and said he had asked Tuchel for clarity about his role. “This is the problem because you have a quote in another direction and he says he had a chat with me,” Tuchel said. “Then the suggestion comes and it seems the chat was about how he was not happy how we used him. But maybe that was not the chat. We have chats with a lot of players. This is a normal chat. “We have a discussion now where it seems that we benched him because other players suited our style better. Romelu played when he came, then he got injured, then he caught Covid and when he came back, he played with no training in Aston Villa. That’s why I’m surprised. There is absolutely zero going on. Maybe he has a problem so he needs to speak up. I don’t have one.” Tuchel was asked how Lukaku could best function in his system. “Training, training, playing,” he replied. “Training, playing, training, sleeping, eating good, training, playing, sleeping, eat good, drink a lot of water, sleep, train and don’t give interviews.” Chelsea, eight points behind Manchester City, have injury problems. Ben Chilwell is out for the season and scans have confirmed that James suffered a torn hamstring against Brighton, leaving Tuchel without his first-choice wing-backs. Tuchel, who could also be without Andreas Christensen, Thiago Silva and Timo Werner against Liverpool, needs cover at left wing-back. Chelsea are looking into recalling Emerson Palmieri from his loan at Lyon, but the French club do not want to break the agreement. If Emerson stays, Chelsea could target Everton’s Lucas Digne or Barcelona’s Sergiño Dest."

          "bodyText": "A retreating ocean is often the first sign of a tsunami. The water along the shoreline is dragged back dramatically, exposing parts of the shore and seabed that are normally underwater. It’s helpful to frame the first two years of the pandemic in similar terms to this ocean drawback. Detaching from our own specific circumstances, and our own specific pandemic pain, we have a unique opportunity to actually see the metaphorical seafloor of the world. Exposed by the pandemic were the often invisible systems that organise our society. These systems are comprised of everything from the expectations of ongoing and unlimited growth via the systems of capitalism and globalisation, to the systems of class, systemic racism and patriarchy, to the more localised systems of government and public service, to the social systems of the nuclear family and individuals, and how our communities, cities, households and green spaces are organised. Also exposed in the drawback of two pandemic years has been our internal seafloor – that of our own psyches. We got to see what we are made of, with previously unimaginable circumstances creating a chance to really test ourselves, see where we fracture and where we are strong. Just like a tsunami, we can expect further devastation to come. But this exposure of our systems could also show us how to rebuild stronger. So what did we see when the virus exposed what’s underpinning our lives and our very selves? And what will we do with this newfound clarity? Economics writer George Megalogenis wrote that the “wicked genius” of Covid was to seek out where the holes and gaps were in our open economic model. In his Quarterly Essay titled Exit strategy: politics after the pandemic, Megalogenis identified that the weak points in Australia’s pandemic response were in the areas that the government had privatised. “Covid says ‘You’ve left me a gap in your safety net – I’ll start killing’,” he told Richard Fidler’s Conversations in 2021. “Australian privatisation was where the weak points were. The commonwealth contracts everything out in aged care” and “the damage done last year in Victoria was when the virus got out of hotel quarantine – also staffed by contract workers including security guards and cleaners who were under trained, underpaid and unaccountable.” But at least until Omicron came along in the final weeks of 2021 – apart from a few notable exceptions including the slow vaccine rollout, the privatisation of aged care and hotel quarantine and lack of support for the university sector and the arts – Australia’s government systems turned out to be robust enough to largely protect the population and the economy. Australia suffered a relatively low death and infection rate compared with the rest of the world, due to border closures and a high level of compliance with lockdowns. And the economy was spared the worst, largely due to the Jobkeeper and Jobseeker schemes. The approach of the federal government (and its NSW counterpart) has changed in response to the rapid emergence of the Omicron variant, stressing the “personal responsibility” of citizens and dramatically changing requirements for testing and isolation – with as yet unknown consequences. But in the initial waves of infection in 2020, according to the ABS, if “Australia had experienced the same crude case and death rates as three comparable countries – Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom – there would have been between 680,000 and 2 million cases instead of the 28,500 that did occur, and between 15 and 46 times the number of deaths”. Still, the pain was not evenly distributed. While wealthier, white-collar workers were able to work from home (and during lockdown have access to more green spaces and beaches), the brunt of exposure to the virus was found in more working-class jobs such as manufacturing, in insecure work such as food delivery and the gig economy, and in migrant and female-dominated care work, especially in the so-called “LGAs of concern”. Healthcare staff have been quitting in record numbers – due to illness, stress and burnout – and the majority of them are women. According to the Grattan Institute, women also bore the brunt of the economic and psychological impact of the virus, and their lifetime economic disadvantage will be compounded. According to a report by Australian Unions, “government responses have not adequately addressed the way the Covid-19 crisis is reproducing and deepening existing structural inequality faced by women, and intensifying work and family pressures. In many ways, government policies have made it worse.” Then there is the looming “shadow pandemic” of worsening mental health outcomes. During lockdowns, suicide rates were down but self-harm increased, particularly in young people. This does not bode well for a mental health system that was already under pressure. Two years in, despite this mess at the crossroads of capitalism, gender, class, intergenerational disadvantage, race and work, we have not moved to fix the systems that underpin inequality. Character test On a more personal level, the pandemic revealed the limitations of the nuclear family – and the need for a “village”. Healthy families need other people around to help – friends, aunts and uncles, teachers, grandparents and neighbours. Part of what was exposed on the seabed was the necessity of communities and personal support systems to stay connected to families, and acknowledgment in a person’s workplace of the whole load an employee might be carrying in their life – not just in their work. Work bled deeply into domestic life and domestic spaces, much more work fell to women, parents found it impossible to work and supervise schooling at the same time, and many families felt overwhelmed and marooned without access to the village. And then there’s the even more personal reckoning – a glimpse at our own psyches. Were we resilient? Calm? Kind? Or fearful and fretful? The great Stoic philosopher Epictetus said: “Circumstances don’t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.” And so it was here. The past two years have shown us what we are made of – and provided to us the sort of character test that only usually comes round with world wars and depressions. While countries such as America are experiencing high levels of public rage and anger, over everything from mask mandates to slow service in restaurants, in Australia the rage hasn’t been as marked, although it has been there in anti-lockdown protests and in our shops. Australia’s low level of mortality and relatively high level of compliance with lockdown rules – particularly in 2020 – are probably connected. There was the sense of caring for the stranger and not wanting to do something to endanger people in your community. This sense of cohesion bodes well for a healthy society – it’s something hopeful to hang on to. So what will we do with our newfound clarity? Seeing the truth of one’s own lives laid bare by the pandemic will no doubt prompt some to reorganise. And there’s a certain amount we can reorganise in our own lives. Maybe you have already started remaking things that were revealed during the pandemic to be broken. Friendships that were revealed to be too one-sided or unfulfilling may have been jettisoned, marriages and relationships ended, jobs quit, fitness regimes embarked on, cities swapped for the coast or country. Maybe the pandemic accelerated what was always going to happen. Or maybe it gave you a nudge of the carpe diem kind, or maybe the unique pressures of lockdowns broke the back of things that would otherwise have drifted along for decades to come – intact mostly, but never really stress-tested. Changing these elements that make up our lives – our friends, our partner, our job, family, our health and fitness, the place where we live – seems big. It’s remaking our lives. Swapping Larry for Barry, Bondi for Berry, making sales for making soap, while enormous within the unit of one life, is not grand stuff that alters the course of human history. What’s needed are systemic shifts that lead to a reorganisation of society that can better absorb large shocks – and to support each other through those shockwaves. It’s ground-up stuff. The pandemic began in Australia in March 2020 – but for me, it will be forever linked with something that started earlier. November 2019 and the skies were red and full of ash. We all wore masks that summer … just a different sort. The past two years and the things we’ve seen have given us a taste of the radical planetary reorganisation that will need to occur when the climate crisis really bares its teeth. Like all painful experiences, once this chapter of the pandemic is over, we will want to forget. With all our lovely distractions back – bars and restaurants and gyms and hairdressers – we can paste over the issues all of us have with our set-ups and our systems. We think a move to the country – our own personal revolution – is change enough. But of course it is not. We have seen the bottom of the seafloor in all its ugliness, beauty and degradation. Such clarity is a dark gift. The real work is ahead."

          "headline": "Two more stabbings bring London to its worst ever teenage homicide death toll",
          "bodyText": "London has recorded its worst ever annual death toll from teenage homicides after two boys were killed within an hour of each other in stabbing incidents, bringing the total to 30 for 2021. A 15-year-old was stabbed and killed in south London and a 16-year-old in west London on Thursday, bringing the total beyond the 29 deaths recorded in 2008. Campaigners said efforts to tackle knife crime had been inadequate and it was now so prevalent, it was becoming normalised, while a senior Labour politician called on the government to take more action to deal with the “epidemic”. “Knife crime is accepted by this generation as part-and-parcel of growing up and that’s completely unacceptable,” said Patrick Green, the chief executive of the anti-knife crime charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, which was set up in 2008 after the fatal stabbing of 16-year-old Ben in north London. “It shows that not enough has been done and, if I’m being really critical, then I’d say the approach to tackling it has been scattergun. We have to sustain our response to knife crime, it has to be over the long term and not just one and two-year funding for projects. “It is a societal problem which will continue unless it is addressed properly.” Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the news was “devastating”. She added: “It is truly awful that more young lives have been lost to the epidemic of knife crime across the country. No family should have to go through losing a child in this way. “Important further action is needed from government to tackle the knife crime epidemic – including more neighbourhood police back on the beat, stronger laws on the criminal exploitation that draws children and young people into drug and knife crime, and support for the youth services and early intervention work that keep young people safe.” They spoke after a 16-year-old boy was pronounced dead at 8.25pm on Thursday, having been stabbed at Philpot’s Farm, in Yiewsley, west London. About an hour earlier, a 15-year-old boy died after being stabbed in Ashburton Park, in Croydon, south London. Another 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of murder in relation to the Croydon stabbing. Neither victim had been named. Separate murder investigations were launched and police appealed for witnesses to come forward. The 30 killings of teenagers in the capital in the calendar year is the worst death toll on record. The latest stabbings will prompt renewed discussion about the possible causes of youth violence, with experts suggesting these include a rise in the number of children who are vulnerable, increased pressure on services such as policing, and social media fuelling conflict. The seriousness of the situation was further underlined by Pastor Beryl St James, from Shiloh Worship Centre church and charity, which is based in Thornton Heath – near the scene of the first killing. She said she had received a call from a parent who had found a knife in their child’s room on Friday morning. Speaking from the scene, she added: “I know we have to work and we all have duties to fulfil, but as a parent you cannot think that it’s OK to leave the state to continually look after your child.” Anthony King, the chair of the MyEnds programme, which aims to tackle knife crime in London, told reporters at the scene in Croydon: “Sadly, it’s because we’re having a lot of breakdowns in schools, in education; young people are being excluded too quickly, some for minor incidents, there’s breakdown in the homes. “Parents, if you see a bread knife or bun knife missing from the home, please speak to somebody, please contact an agency or an organisation and let the teachers know.” The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said he was “devastated” by the two deaths. He said: “I refuse to accept that the loss of young lives is inevitable and will continue to be relentless in taking the bold action needed to put an end to violence in our city.” Commander Alex Murray, Scotland Yard’s lead for violence in London, said: “I am deeply saddened by every single homicide this year, and greatly concerned by those that have been teenage killings. Each one is a tragedy leaving behind heartbroken families and distressed communities. “My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted. They are not statistics, not just numbers, they all have families, and they all should have had their lives ahead of them. They and their families have been robbed of something precious and we should all be doing everything we can to stop this. “These devastating losses continue to motivate every single officer at the Met to catch those responsible, bring justice to their families and take weapons off the street.” Scotland Yard said police were called to the Croydon stabbing shortly after 7pm. They gave first aid to the boy before the ambulance service arrived, but he was pronounced dead a short time later. Officers were called to the stabbing in Yiewsley shortly after 7.30pm, where they found the 16-year-old victim suffering from a puncture wound. He was also declared dead at the scene. The victims’ family members had been informed but neither boy had been formally identified, Scotland Yard said. Postmortem examinations were due to be held later. Overall, the Met believes serious violent crime is falling. Homicides, at 130 for 2021, were virtually the same as the year before. In 2019 there were 150. The Met says that in calendar year to November 2021, compared to the same period before the pandemic in 2019, knife crime fell by 32%, or 4,613 fewer offences. It says gun crime decreased by 38%, with 738 fewer offences. Murray said: “A great deal of work has already begun and plans are in motion for the new year ahead. We are using existing and innovative tactics, proactive operations, and all the powers available to us to ensure we are doing everything we can within the scope of policing to deal with violence in all its forms.”"

          "bodyText": "The Colorado governor has intervened to reduce the 110-year sentence handed down to a trucker for his role in a fatal 2019 collision after widespread outcry and calls for leniency. Jared Polis announced Thursday he would commute the sentence for Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, reducing his sentence from 110 years to 10 years. Under the new sentence, the 26-year-old would be eligible for parole in five years. “I am writing to inform you that I am granting your application for a commutation,” Polis wrote. “I believe you deserve clemency for several reasons. You were sentenced to 110 years in prison, effectively more than a life sentence, for a tragic but unintentional act.” Polis said that the sentence was “simply not commensurate” with Aguilera-Mederos’ “actions, nor with penalties handed down to others for similar crimes”. In October, a jury convicted Aguilera-Mederos of vehicular homicide and other charges related to a deadly collision that occurred while he was hauling lumber in the Rocky Mountain foothills. He has said that the brakes on his semi-trailer failed as he was descending a steep section of the highway, leading to four deaths and a multi-vehicle pileup. The lengthy sentence, which the judge said he was obligated to give Aguilera-Mederos due to minimum sentencing laws in the state, was widely condemned and fueled criticism of the US justice system. More than 5 million people signed a petition calling for Polis to grant clemency to Aguilera-Mederos or commute his sentence, an effort truckers, civil rights groups and celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West voiced support for. “It is a stark miscarriage of justice,” said Domingo Garcia, the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac), of the sentence. Lulac sent a letter to Polis on behalf of Aguilera-Mederos, a Cuban immigrant, requesting a pardon or a reduction of his sentence, and Garcia traveled to Colorado to meet with the governor. Kardashian West, a criminal justice reform advocate, was among those who praised the governor’s decision. “This case was a clear example of why mandatory minimums don’t work and need to be abolished. I’m grateful to Governor Polis for his empathy and leadership on this case,” Kardashian West said on Twitter. The decision was among several end-of-the-year commutations and pardons issued by Polis. The governor’s announcement comes after a judge scheduled a hearing next month to reconsider the sentence at the request of the district attorney, who had planned to ask that it be reduced to 20 to 30 years. The ACLU of Colorado has expressed hope that the case might prompt reform of mandatory minimum sentencing laws in the state. “The extraordinary nature of this particular case has prompted comments from some lawmakers that they may be interested in doing that,” said Mark Silverstein, the legal director of the ACLU of Colorado. “Sometimes unfortunately it takes an extraordinary case like this that put something that ought to be on the legislative agenda to the top of the legislative agenda.” The Associated Press contributed to this report"

          "headline": "Boris Johnson ‘to be cleared of breaking ministerial code’ over No 10 refurb",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is reportedly due to be cleared of breaking the ministerial code over payments for his Downing Street flat refurbishment after an independent adviser looked into whether he had been misled during an initial investigation. Lord Geidt led an inquiry that cleared the prime minister of wrongdoing in May, but is understood to have looked into a discrepancy between the findings in his report and another into the same matter published earlier this month by the Electoral Commission. The issue centred on claims a Tory peer footed the bill for refurbishments to the No 11 flat. In his first set of findings, Geidt, the adviser on ministerial interests, said Johnson told him “he knew nothing about such payments” until immediately prior to media reports in February 2021. However the Electoral Commission’s own investigation said it had seen a WhatsApp message showing Johnson had been in direct contact with the donor, Lord Brownlow, in November 2020 about the flat refurbishment. Brownlow made a £58,000 donation to the Conservatives but the Electoral Commission found it was not declared properly and fined the party £17,800. According to the Financial Times, Geidt sought an explanation from Johnson and exchanged several letters with the prime minister that could be published in the new year. The newspaper also said Johnson’s behaviour was to be “criticised” and that Geidt had described the situation to colleagues as “deeply unsatisfactory” but would not change his ruling that Johnson had not broken the ministerial code. The result of the inquiry has been closely watched, given it could prompt the launching of another inquiry by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, into whether Johnson broke the MPs’ code of conduct. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation.” They also pointed to the terms of reference of Geidt’s inquiry, which said the advice Geidt gives to Johnson “will be published in a timely manner”. Asked previously if Johnson had lied to Geidt, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “No.” Reports the prime minister is to be cleared have sparked anger from Labour. The party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: “After the Electoral Commission ruled that the Conservative party broke the law on declaring donations, the prime minister has made a mockery of the standards the public has a right to expect. “While the British public is facing a cost of living crisis, Boris Johnson is busy writing to his own adviser about why he did not give him all of the information he needed for his investigation. “Lord Geidt should publish all his correspondence with the prime minister as a first step towards providing full transparency into how Boris Johnson is explaining away his WhatsApp messages with Tory donors. “It is embarrassing that when the country needs real leadership, Boris Johnson is busy trying to clear up his own personal mess.”"

          "bodyText": "When Valentin Gendrot applied for a job with the Paris police in 2017, he didn’t expect to get through the vetting process. A thorough background check would have revealed that Gendrot, then aged 29, was an investigative journalist who specialised in exposing dubious working practices: he had previously worked undercover at a call centre, a debt recovery agency and a car plant. His application was, however, successful and he began a two-year stint as an adjoint de sécurité (ADS), a position roughly equivalent to a police community support officer in the UK. Things got off to an underwhelming start when, on completing the obligatory three months’ training, he was assigned to a dreary posting at a mental health facility, charged with transporting patients from one psychiatric unit to another. After 15 months in this role he earned a transfer to Paris’s notoriously restive 19th arrondissement, where he was finally able to experience front-line policing. Gendrot’s account of his time on the force, Flic, made waves in France last year and is now available in English, thanks to Frank Wynne’s tidy translation. It portrays a working culture in which racism and misogyny are rife and police regularly exceed their powers with impunity. “Officers dealing with members of the public, he writes, “are routinely overfamiliar, inappropriate, aggressive in their words and actions, and insulting, and they unlawfully confiscate merchandise … from those [unlicensed street hawkers] issued with fines.” In one particularly disturbing incident, an officer beats up an innocent teenager for talking back. The boy, of African heritage, is bundled into a police van and repeatedly punched; Gendrot watches as his colleague goes “completely berserk, uses his elbow to pin the boy’s chest so he can lay into him … like a man possessed”. When the victim later files a complaint, triggering an internal investigation, several officers give false testimony in support of their co-worker, who is cleared of wrongdoing. Gendrot wonders: “How can he ever trust the police again after this incident?” While the depiction of the police in these pages is unflattering and at times damning, it is not entirely unsympathetic. Gendrot cites a 2018 report by the French senate into the working conditions of officers serving in the Île-de-France region, which identified a number of chronic problems. Some, such as the psychological stress of regularly confronting violence, are intrinsic to the occupation and to a degree inevitable. Others, such as long hours, irregular work patterns and the pressure of having to meet performance targets, are endemic to the 21st-century neoliberal managerialism espoused by President Macron. The toll of these conditions is most clearly visible in the alarming suicide rate among French police officers, which is 36% higher than among the general population. In 2019, the director general of the police force responded to concerns about officers’ mental health by issuing a memorandum advising local constabularies to arrange barbecues to boost morale – an intervention derided by many officers as feeble and condescending. Any credible critique of policing must give due weight to these organisational questions, and the author does not duck this. Some matters, however, are cultural rather than structural, and Gendrot’s anecdotal snapshot of life on the force suggests the prevalence of macho and chauvinistic attitudes is a big problem: people of non-white heritage are referred to by discriminatory epithets; a male officer persistently harasses a female colleague, rigging the work schedule to ensure she is always assigned to accompany him on patrols; while sharing a dorm with a fellow ADS, Gendrot wakes one morning to find his roommate sitting naked on his face, with his balls resting on his forehead, taking a selfie. Gendrot’s encounters with male boorishness prompt him to reflect on his own conflicted relationship with masculinity. His scrawny frame and spectacles make him a somewhat unlikely copper. He is good at football, which helps him to fit in, but is uncomfortable with some other rituals of male bonding, such as sharing stories of sexual escapades (“something I wouldn’t talk about even with close friends”). These personal asides provide a pertinent subplot to the story: one wonders how many capable people are put off joining the police for fear of not fitting in. This English edition appears at a time of renewed scrutiny of policing in the UK, prompted by several egregious incidents of misconduct – including, most recently, the revelation that officers took photographs of the bodies of two murder victims, which they then shared with colleagues on WhatsApp. Many of the problems highlighted by Gendrot exist, in varying degrees, in police forces all over the world. Chief among these is the perverse code of honour that compels otherwise decent officers to cover for the violent thuggery of colleagues. Without proper accountability a police force ceases to serve the community and becomes something else entirely. As Grendot remarks after witnessing an incident of police brutality: “I feel like I’m riding with a gang that has unlimited powers.” • Cop by Valentin Gendrot is published by Scribe (£9.99).

          "headline": "Johnson blamed for Covid test shortages as cases hit record 183,000",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused of presiding over a “total shambles” as millions of people struggle to access Covid tests after a huge surge in demand, leaving essential staff unable to work. The prime minister had urged people to take precautionary rapid Covid tests before heading out for New Year’s Eve, while the Omicron wave has pushed up demand for both lateral flows and PCRs. There were a record 183,000 positive cases confirmed on Wednesday, although this data included some delayed results. With the huge increase in cases, the system was dogged by shortages and there were reports that key workers, including nurses and firefighters, were unable to access tests to allow them to do their jobs. As medical staff experienced delays in PCR test results and problems accessing rapid tests, NHS Providers called on No 10 to consider reserving some tests for health workers. Some Tory MPs were also demanding answers from government ministers about whether there should be a priority ranking for who should get tests first. Members of the public also complained that tests were hard to find, as pharmacies around England displayed signs that they had run out of lateral flow test (LFT) kits amid “patchy” deliveries and high demand. For the second day in a row the government’s websites showed at times that walk-in PCR tests were unavailable in parts of the country, such as Hartlepool, and in short supply in others, while by mid-afternoon ordering home deliveries of LFTs had again been halted. The overwhelming demand for tests in England follows record levels of infection since the arrival of the Omicron variant.With worries that the health service could be overwhelmed, even though Omicron is milder than Delta, the NHS said it was looking to create up to 4,000 beds in “mini-Nightingales” at existing hospital as surge capacity, with 800 across eight sites to begin with. The UK Health and Security Agency acknowledged there was unprecedented demand for tests and urged people not to order more than they needed. But the organisation said another eight million tests were being made available to pharmacists before New Year’s Eve celebrations begin. Pharmacists said demand has been driven by the government allowing vaccinated people out of self-isolation if they show repeated negative LFT results after a week, and among those stocking up on kits before New Year’s Eve events. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said Johnson’s plea for people to take lateral flows when there were shortages showed “spectacular incompetence”. “Congratulations to Boris Johnson who has managed to appear on television today urging people to get tested when people are struggling to access them,” he said. “People are trying to do the right thing, follow the government’s own advice, and test themselves regularly, but are prevented by the Conservative government’s incompetence.” Daisy Cooper, Lib Dem health spokesperson, added that it was “now or never to get Covid tests to frontline workers”. “If the government doesn’t get its act together today then vaccine centres could soon grind to a halt, and patient safety could be at risk from further NHS and care staff absences,” she said. Johnson’s comments on testing have been repeated by other ministers, including the health secretary, Sajid Javid, and health minister Gillian Keegan, who advised new year’s revellers: “Do be cautious, take a lateral flow test before you go out.” There were particular concerns about a lack of tests affecting staff absences in the NHS. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said it was “vital that NHS staff get prompt access to the tests they need to ensure they can return to work as quickly as possible” and suggested “looking at whether we need to reserve dedicated testing capacity for NHS staff for a period”. Dr David Wrigley, the British Medical Association’s deputy council chair, said: “In order to keep the NHS working, it is imperative that staff must be able to regularly test for Covid 19 and so supplies of lateral flow tests for key workers should be prioritised.” New London fire brigade data shows that a third of fire engines in London have been unavailable after more than 700 firefighters either tested positive or were having to self-isolate earlier this week. Staff shortages meant a 64-metre ladder appliance, bought after the Grenfell Tower disaster, was unavailable for much of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, while more than 15% of operational firefighters were off work because of Covid on 27 December. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, said deliveries of LFT kits to pharmacies had restarted on Wednesday after four days of no service. But many of those that did receive them reported quickly exhausting their supplies. Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, said: “Pharmacies are reporting that every five minutes approximately somebody comes in to the pharmacy asking for a test. “But, unfortunately, because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent, it means that those who come for the test don’t always get it, which is very stressful not just for the pharmacy team but for the patient.” In Devizes, Wiltshire, the branch of Boots had exhausted its supply of tests by 11am, with two other pharmacies in the town saying they had no kits at all. But Maria Caulfield, the government’s junior health minister, insisted there were “plenty of tests”, in a post to a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs. Caulfield said the “constant speculation that we are running out of tests is just fuelling demand”, and urged colleagues to tell constituents they should “keep trying” to book tests online. Javid is also understood to be preparing a memo for MPs confirming supplies of LFTs and PCRs were safe. However, their assurances were undermined by Tory MPs reporting first-hand problems ordering tests. Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet, tweeted that “Kent appears to be in Lateral Flow and PCR Test gridlock”. Gale later said he had spoken with Javid and been told “there is a world shortage of Lateral Flow &amp; PCR test supplies, but we are buying all that’s available”. A former minister called the situation a “shitshow” and added Javid’s letter “probably won’t immediately match reality”. A second Tory MP said availability of tests “definitely seems to be an issue”, and a third said a relative who was an essential worker had been unable to order one. The UK Health Security Agency said tests were temporarily unavailable on the government website at points throughout the day due to “exceptionally high demand” and urged people not to order more tests before using the ones they have. A spokesperson said: “During periods of exceptional demand there may be temporary pauses in ordering or receiving tests, to ensure we manage distribution across the system.” • This article was amended on 29 December 2021 to correct the location of Devizes; it is in Wiltshire, not Devon as an early version said."

          "headline": "Rights group’s closure is part of rapid dismantling of Russian civil society",
          "bodyText": "In a terrible year for human rights in Russia, beginning with the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the closure of International Memorial stands out for its ruthlessness. Founded in the late 1980s by Andrei Sakharov and other Soviet-era dissidents, the group took the new freedoms offered under Mikhail Gorbachev and used them to reveal raw truths about the fate of millions of victims of Stalin’s repressions. It was a poignant symbol of Russia’s new openness, but for many the meaning was anything but abstract: Russians discovered the tragic fates of their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents after decades of secrecy and official cowardice. Memorial’s closure is also a potent symbol – one of Russian civil society being dismantled at lightning speed. Its leadership had hoped that public support, including from prominent Russians such as Gorbachev, would stay the Kremlin’s hand. Or that closing down an organisation dedicated to uncovering Soviet atrocities would be a step too far, even for Vladimir Putin. But on Tuesday, almost exactly 30 years after the Soviet Union was dissolved, a judge showed otherwise. “When Russia chose to take a democratic, legal path forward, I couldn’t in my darkest dreams have imagined that everything would eventually start going in reverse,” Nikita Petrov, a historian and researcher who helped found Memorial, told the Guardian last month. “Probably I was naive then.” It is not hard to see how Putin, mired in historical conflicts over Crimea, Nato expansion and the fall of the Soviet Union, the second world war and more, sees investigation of Soviet history as a threat to national security. He is far more interested in perceived historical injustices committed against Russia than in the uncomfortable truths dug up by Memorial during the organisation’s three decades of work in the Russian archives. “Our country needs an honest and conscientious understanding of the Soviet past; this is the key to its future,” the organisation wrote in a statement after its liquidation. In place of Memorial, which spoke out eloquently and aggressively about mass atrocities, the state is creating a more manicured and careful presentation of the deaths of millions, one that condemns their deaths more than their murders, identifying victims but not their killers. The Russian government would like to portray Memorial’s closure as a simple, bureaucratic extension of its “foreign agents” laws. But on Tuesday a prosecutor in court made the political motive explicit, saying in an impassioned speech that Memorial was “mendaciously portraying the USSR as a terrorist state”. “Why should we, the descendants of the victors, have to see the vindication of traitors to their homeland and Nazi henchmen?” the prosecutor asked. A lawyer for Memorial said it reminded him of a 1930s show trial. Memorial’s leadership has said it is useless trying to understand which of the government’s red lines it crossed to prompt the authorities to shut it down. Some believe it has to do with its archival and historical work on Soviet terror, others with its support for political prisoners such as Navalny. Yet the truth is that Memorial has continued to do what it did since day one, while it is Russia that has changed again, perhaps ending a brief window when it would tolerate an independent reckoning of its past. “It speaks to the fears of the government that it is no longer willing to tolerate the honest accounting of its conduct that Memorial provides,” said Kenneth Roth, the head of Human Rights Watch. “If that mirror is too awful to look at, the answer is to change the conduct, not to shatter the mirror.”"

          "headline": "‘Blockchain Rock’: Gibraltar moves to become world’s first cryptocurrency hub",
          "bodyText": "On the southern Mediterranean coast, nestled in the shadow of the Rock’s sheer limestone cliffs and its tangle of wild olive trees, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX) is quietly preparing for a corporate takeover that could have global consequences for the former naval garrison. Less than half a mile away, next to the blue waters of Gibraltar’s mid-harbour marina, the peninsula’s regulators are reviewing a proposal that would prompt blockchain firm Valereum to buy the exchange in the new year – meaning the British overseas territory could soon host the world’s first integrated bourse, where conventional bonds can be traded alongside major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and dogecoin. It is a bold move for a territory of just 33,000 people, where the financial sector – which accounts for roughly a third of Gibraltar’s £2.4bn economy - is overseen by a regulator staffed by 82 employees. If all goes to plan, the enclave could become a global cryptocurrency hub; if the controls set by the small team of regulators fail, it risks reputational damage and ultimately diplomatic sanctions that could threaten its economy. While countries including China and the UK have either banned or openly warned against investments in crypto assets, Gibraltar has bucked the trend, having committed to formally regulating cryptocurrencies in an attempt to future-proof the territory’s status as a financial hub. It comes as Gibraltar struggles to shake off a reputation as a global tax haven, with the government having sued a Spanish newspaper in an attempt to restore its global standing. Albert Isola, Gibraltar’s minister for digital, financial services and public utilities, says that while Gibraltar was a tax haven 20 years ago, the territory has now overhauled its tax and information sharing policies. The introduction of crypto regulation is having a similar effect: rooting out bad actors and providing assurance to investors, he says. “If you wanted to do naughty things in crypto, you wouldn’t be in Gibraltar, because the firms are licensed and regulated, and they aren’t anywhere else in the world,” Isola says. Gibraltar’s regulator has so far approved 14 cryptocurrency and blockchain firms for its licensing scheme, attracting the attention of ex-Sirius Minerals chairman Richard Poulden, who chose Gibraltar for Valereum’s crypto-exchange project. Valereum, he says, is trying to harness a cryptocurrency sector that is worth roughly $3.5tn (£2.6tn) – roughly the combined value of all companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Poulden is the chairman of Valereum, which is based in Gibraltar and focuses on providing technology for linking mainstream conventional currencies such as the pound and the dollar with crypto assets. It will be a major task to overhaul an exchange that is currently staffed by only three employees, and will require a change in Gibraltar’s regulations to govern how crypto is going to be traded on the GSX. But Poulden says his firm is leaning on technology, rather than people, to weed out any bad actors. He says running anti-money laundering checks on cryptocurrencies is “not vastly different from running it on currency from any any other source. And indeed, in some cases, because you can trace back through the blockchain and see exactly where that money has come from, it can actually be substantially easier than trying to find where a block of funds in a bank has come from.” Other countries will be watching closely. Neil Williams, London-based deputy head of complex crime at Reeds Solicitors, ssays: “If it’s a success, you’d certainly think that other jurisdictions would look to follow, because it’s an ever increasing valuable commodity.” However, experts have warned that Gibraltar could face sanctions by countries such as the US if its regulators end up giving legal approval to crypto firms that – even inadvertently – give a pass to money launderers, black market criminals or kleptocrats who prefer the anonymity of crypto assets. It comes amid concern at major global financial regulators, including the Bank of England, over the rapid development of crypto assets and the potential consequences for consumer and investor protection, market integrity, money laundering and the financing of terror groups. “It could enable or facilitate money laundering, sanctions evasion, terrorist financing, so everyone’s wary of that as well,” says Charlie Steele, a partner at forensic accounting firm and consultancy Forensic Risk Alliance and a former US justice department official. “Regulators worldwide, almost all of them really, are approaching it from a position of deep scepticism … so it’s a little outside that strain of thinking for a country to welcome them in to buy a stock exchange.” . A month before Valereum announced its bid for the GSX in October, the head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, declared that as an asset class, crypto was “more like the wild west…rife with fraud, scams, and abuse in certain applications”, raising further concerns over the possibility of criminal funds seeping into the mainstream financial system. Lax anti-money laundering (AML) controls have resulted in jurisdictions such as Malta being grey-listed by the world’s money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog (FATF), for lacking basic financial safeguards. It could seriously damage Malta’s economy and has been a stark warning for other countries and territories that might be tempted to let regulations slip. Meanwhile, Singapore has had to U-turn on its approval for the standalone crypto exchange Bitget. It suspended the exchange earlier this month for promoting a digital currency involved in a high-profile dispute over branding, having used an unauthorised image of K-pop band BTS to allegedly maximise its profits. “If this starts to look like everyone ran to Gibraltar to get away from real regulators, it’s going to not go well for them,” Steele warns. If anti-money laundering or sanctions rules are broken or evaded, “there’s lots of things they could do, and lead internationally through the FATF, to make things hard on Gibraltar. You’ll see that the FATF can impose all kinds of measures, which will require its members to put limits on business with that country,” he adds. But Gibraltar insists that it has welcomed crypto firms with its eyes wide open, having consulted on its regulation for the sector for four years before introducing it in 2018, helping it to secure a reputation as “Blockchain Rock”. By filtering through and licensing firms, says Isola, they weed out bad actors. “I don’t understand how there can be any increased risk in Gibraltar, when you can go to any other European country today and run exactly the same business without being supervised, without being licensed, and without being regulated. So how can we be more exposed by regulating them? It’s completely the opposite,” Isola says. He stresses that the country’s regulator has approved applications for only 14 firms over three years, a number that he claims speaks to the rigours of the licensing scheme. “It’s hardly a gold rush,” he says. “The knee-jerk reaction for any commentator when it comes to blockchain-based innovations – particularly when it involves a small jurisdiction like Gibraltar – is ‘Oh my God, risk, alarm and all the rest of it,’” says Tom Keatinge, director of RUSI’s Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies.“I do think it’s very important to understand the capacity of the jurisdiction before jerking knees, and the reason I say that is because of all the small jurisdictions on the planet, the one that has invested the most time and effort in understanding the opportunity posed by blockchain is Gibraltar.” The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission declined to comment on the Valereum deal."

          "bodyText": "1. Saving grasslands The names running glade clover, cream tick-trefoil and Porter’s goldenrod may evoke the riotous colours of a summer meadow in bloom, but these particular plants are also quietly tucked away in a conservation seed bank that it is hoped will ensure the future of North America’s grassland plant populations. Changes in land and sea use is the key driver of biodiversity loss in the world – and grassland loss is “the single greatest conservation issue currently facing eastern North American biodiversity”, according to the Southeastern Grasslands Initiative (SGI) at the Center of Excellence for Field Biology, Austin Peay State University, which is working to conserve and restore this crucial ecosystem. Last year it launched a conservation seed bank (CSB) to preserve vulnerable populations of rare and declining grassland species. Cooper Breeden, the SGI’s plant conservation manager, says: “One of the reasons we decided to pursue the CSB was because the loss of our rare plant populations is outpacing efforts to conserve them in many cases, though not for lack of effort. There is simply not enough funding and capacity for conservation. “We sought to fill the gap by endeavouring to collect the rare and declining grassland species of the south-east, especially targeting those populations that are particularly vulnerable and currently not receiving much conservation attention.” Since August 2020, the team has squirrelled away more than 35,000 seeds in 66 collections of 29 species. But SGI’s work does not stop at banking seeds. “Ideally, we try to conserve populations where they occur,” says Breeden. “The ultimate goal of these collections is to support the survival of populations in the wild.” The next stage is an interactive map that will allow users to see which species are in the seed bank and where they came from. “The goal in making some of our collection data easily accessible to the public is that it could serve as a resource for our partners involved in grasslands conservation in the region,” he says. “As the capacity of our conservation community grows, there will be increasing opportunities to put these seeds back in the ground.” 2. Recycling wastewater Sixty billion tonnes of renewable and non-renewable resources are extracted globally each year, which makes the direct exploitation of resources, alongside the exploitation of organisms, the second biggest driver of biodiversity loss. When it comes to water, consumption has been increasing worldwide by about 1% a year since the 1980s, and global water demand is expected to continue increasing at a similar rate until 2050, according to the UN World Water Development Report 2019. Desalination plants have been the focus of attention, but as cities and towns from California to Sydney battle drought and water shortages they are turning to the likes of Israel and Singapore for guidance on how to recycle wastewater. Globally, 80% of wastewater currently flows back into the ecosystem without being treated or reused. Over decades, Israel has invested heavily in the treatment of wastewater, alongside desalination plants, recycling nearly 90% through sewage treatment facilities, which redirect the treated water to irrigation. The sludge byproduct is used as fertiliser and to generate biogas. In Singapore, five NEWater plants meet up to 40% of the country’s water needs by recycling, according to the national water agency. By 2060, NEWater is expected to meet up to 55% of demand. Its 48km-long deep tunnel sewerage system (DTSS), a used water superhighway, carries used water to reclamation plants to be treated and purified into reclaimed water, or discharged into the sea. When a second phase of the project, currently under way, is completed, pumping stations and conventional water reclamation plants will be phased out, freeing up land. 3. Protecting peatlands They neither sound glamorous nor hog the limelight, but bogs and peatlands hold one of the keys to combatting the climate crisis. While peatlands cover only 3% of the global land surface, they store nearly 550bn tonnes of carbon – twice as much as in all the world’s forests. About 10% of the UK is covered in peatland. However, much of this is degraded, and estimates suggest that UK peatlands could be emitting the equivalent of 23m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Restoring degraded peatlands could stop these emissions and create biodiversity benefits for wildlife, including plants, birds and insects. The Great North Bog – which includes four national parks, three areas of outstanding natural beauty, and the proposed South Pennines Park – represents about 92% of the upland peat in England and is one of the main UK restoration projects. The project, led by the North Pennines AONB Partnership, the Yorkshire Peat Partnership and the Moors for the Future Partnership, is aiming to restore nearly 7,000 sq km of upland peat, which store 400m tonnes of carbon. Damaged peat in the Great North Bog currently releases an estimated 4.4m tonnes of carbon annually but project organisers hope that “by joining up some of the most successful peatland restoration organisations in Europe we can bring about a massive and urgent step change in saving the majority of England’s upland peatlands before it is too late”. 4. Tackling plastic pollution Scientists have predicted that in the next 20 years the amount of plastic waste in the oceans is likely to nearly triple in volume, from an estimated 8m tonnes a year today to 29m tonnes by 2040. There is no single solution to the plastic crisis, but scientists, inventors and volunteers across the globe are looking at myriad ways to overcome it. A team at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University in the US is trying to gather all this information in a “plastic pollution prevention and collection technology inventory”. Among the 52 technologies included so far are the Great Bubble Barrier, where “tubes placed diagonally across the bottom of the waterway create a bubble barrier by pumping air, creating a current that brings debris to the surface and guides it to a catchment system”; the Holy Turtle, a 1,000ft floating unit which is towed by two marine vessels and captures floating waste; and Stow it, don’t throw it, a youth-driven initiative that recycles tennis ball containers into fishing line recycling bins for anglers. Zoie Diana, a PhD candidate in the marine science and conservation department at Duke University and one of the team behind the inventory, says they are aiming to add more than 40 new technologies by early next year. “We hope that our study and inventory serve as a tool to prevent plastic from entering waterways and collect existing pollution, complementing ongoing efforts to reduce the generation of plastic pollution further upstream in its life cycle.” 5. Dealing with invasive species At least 107 highly threatened birds, mammals and reptiles are estimated to have benefited from invasive mammal eradication on islands, according to a study published in 2016. “Although still few and spatially localised, such cases show that with prompt and appropriate action, it is possible to reduce human-induced extinction rates,” the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)’s global assessment noted. New Zealand is at the forefront of this action and has committed to eradicating stoats, possums and rats by the middle of the century under its Predator Free 2050 plan, using a mixture of trapping, hunting, poison and technology. But it is also trialling other projects. A purpose-built predator exclusion fence has been erected to protect 6,000 sq metres of prime habitat for the endangered robust grasshopper, thought to be the world’s first fenced habitat designed for an insect. The aim of New Zealand’s Predator Free 2050 is to “return the voices of the insects, bats, reptiles and birds back to the forests, farmland, towns, cities and coasts”. Currently, 74% of the country’s native terrestrial birds, 84% of its native reptile species and 46% of vascular plant species are threatened with extinction, or at risk of becoming threatened, according to the Department of Conservation. But in the five years since Predator Free 2050 was launched, the numbers of birds such as kea, kākā, kākāriki, the Antipodes snipe and the Tūī have all increased, according to a five-year progress report.

          "bodyText": "Passengers travelling home for Christmas have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 2,000 flights on Friday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. The U.S. will next week lift the travel ban imposed on several southern African nations when the Omicron variant of Covid was first detected, AFP reports. France reported a record 94,124 new daily Covid-19 infections on Friday while the number of people hospitalised for the disease reached a seven-month high at close to 16,200, according to official data. One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far. South Africans without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday. Additionally, people in South Africa will be offered a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its used for the general public. France will require passengers to show negative Covid tests to travel to its overseas territories, with the new measure coming into effect on 28 December. The UK Health Security Agency’s chief has suggested the government might decide on whether further restrictions are needed in England based on Omicron’s wider impact, rather than the variant’s severity alone. The UK government’s chief scientific adviser has defended Sage against the charges that the group’s modelling was fearmongering, saying it was not their job to “spread gloom”. Dozens of officials have reportedly been punished over a virus outbreak in the locked-down city of Xi’an, China’s disciplinary body said on Friday, Agence France-Presse reports. Some further data from France. Some 16,173 people are currently hospitalised for Covid-19 in the country, with 3,254 of them in emergency care. Some 122,462 people have died of Covid-19 in France since the start of the pandemic, AFP reports/ Some 76.5 percent of the population have received two vaccine doses, and nearly 21 million people in a country of 67.4 million residents have received a booster shot. On Friday, health authority recommended that adults receive a booster jab three months after their initial vaccination. New coronavirus restrictions could be in place until late March under measures examined by UK government scientific advisers. The modelling by experts from Warwick University considered a package of measures including a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors, in line with the Step 2 restrictions in place in April in England. A consensus paper published on Christmas Eve by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (Spi-M-O) said “rapidly enacted Step 2 measures reduce the peak of hospital pressure to about half its level under Plan B only”, PA reports. The U.S. will next week lift the travel ban imposed on several southern African nations when the Omicron variant of Covid was first detected, AFP reports. Countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa after the variant was detected in South Africa, which reported Omicron to the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 24. WHO and the United Nations spoke out against the travel bans and officials in South Africa said they were being punished for identifying the strain and being transparent. White House assistant press secretary Kevin Munoz defended the ban on Twitter, saying, “The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron, (especially) boosted.” He said the travel ban would be lifted on December 31. In Bethlehem, hoteliers have been disappointed. After a near-total lockdown last year, Israel has again closed its borders. Celebrations on Friday were subdued as just several hundred huddled in the city’s Manger Square to watch the Palestinian scouts and bagpipers parade past. This year, like last, midnight mass on Christmas Eve will be reserved for just a small circle of people by invitation only. “It is a bit surreal,” American student Hudson Harder told AFP. “There is a selfish part where it’s like ‘Oh I get to see this place so empty’ but on the other hand you feel for the shops, all the money they are losing, it’s really quite tragic.” The prospect of a fourth Covid booster jab in the UK is possible as immunity may subside for millions by the new year, the Telegraph newspaper reported. Protection against getting ill with the Omicron variant is as low as 35 per cent 10 weeks after a booster, according to government data. Christmas Day will start early at Sydney’s Wayside Chapel in Australia. From about 6am volunteers will be blocking off the street and “rolling out the green carpet”. “We’re going to cover Hughes Street in astroturf and lay down some picnic blankets, appropriately socially distanced spots reserved for our very important guests,” the Kings Cross charity’s chief executive, Pastor Jon Owen, says, adding: “many of whom will be waking up in the gutter that morning.” The Wayside Chapel is among many Australian organisations that will open its doors to those with nowhere else to go on Christmas Day, offering a sense of something that has been particularly hard to grasp over the past two years: togetherness. The UK government will send millions of text messages on Boxing Day urging people to get a coronavirus booster vaccine. The message, part of the Get Boosted Now campaign, is the latest attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant sweeping the UK. More than 32 million booster and third doses have already been administered, PA reports. The message will read: “Get boosted now. “Every adult needs a Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against Omicron. “Get your Covid-19 vaccine or booster. “See NHS website for details.” With all of the worrying news emerging from the fields of health and science this year, some of the incredible advances that occurred may have been overlooked. But there have been many weird and wonderful feats in the world of research. Life-saving tests, treatments and vaccines were developed and rolled-out – including those led by Australian doctors – and a world-first malaria vaccine for children was endorsed by the World Health Organization. A new species of dinosaur was discovered in south-west Queensland, adding to our understanding about how they evolved. We learned from Nasa that the much-feared asteroid, Apophis, won’t hit Earth for at least 100 years, so that’s a relief. Rebecca Miller is cooking up a Christmas Day feast – even though she can’t taste a thing. Both Miller and her partner Steven have Covid. They’ve cancelled their plans to go to Tasmania – where they were due to be celebrating her 50th birthday for 3 January, and his delayed 50th from last year. Instead they will spend Christmas at home in Adelaide instead, video-calling family and friends. “Even though I’ve lost my sense of taste and smell, I’m still cooking up a full vego roast, a big stuffed butternut pumpkin with roast veggies,” Miller said. In response to figures showing today’s 1,171 Covid hospitalisations in the UK, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the sharp rise was “really worrying” for the NHS. “Daily hospital admissions with Covid have gone up by over 40% in the last week [815 on 14/12; 1098 on 21/22 - England only] and this is really worrying for health leaders whose teams are working flat out in the context of rising staff absences and wider pressures”, he said. “While the preliminary findings suggest that omicron may be less likely to cause serious illness than other strains, positive cases are increasing and so, we must remember this virus presents a very real risk to daily life and to the NHS. The NHS will continue to be there for everyone who needs it but the best thing the public can is to continue to behave in ways that can keep themselves and others safe from illness. “This includes ventilating indoor areas, testing before social gatherings and if eligible, taking up that vital offer of a vaccine or booster.” Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “This rise, and today’s record of daily cases of infections, shows that we must keep watching these hospital numbers very closely. In particular, we need to see what happens as larger numbers of older people start to be infected with the new variant. It is likely the number of older people catching omicron will increase given the amount of inter-generational contact over the next 72 hours of Christmas” France reported a record 94,124 new daily Covid-19 infections on Friday while the number of people hospitalised for the disease reached a seven-month high at close to 16,200, according to official data. The seven-day moving average of new cases, which evens out weekly data reporting irregularities, also reached a new record of 66,417, a total that has tripled in just one month, Reuters reports. Italy reported a second successive record daily tally of Covid-19 cases on Friday, with new cases hitting 50,599 compared to 44,595 a day earlier, the health ministry said. The number of coronavirus-related deaths fell to 141 from 168 on Thursday, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 136,386 deaths linked to Covid-19, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 5.57 million cases to date. Hospital admissions due to Covid have nearly doubled week-on-week in London, the latest figures show. New data from NHS England shows that 386 Covid-19 admissions were recorded by hospitals in London on December 22, up 92% week-on-week and the highest number for a single day since February 1. Across England, 1,246 admissions were recorded on December 22, up 55% week-on-week and the highest number for a single day since February 16. But this is still well below the second wave peak of 4,134 admissions reported on January 12, PA reports. Global airline carriers cancelled more than 3,000 flights over the Christmas weekend, the FlightAware website said, as a spike in Covid-19 cases due to the Omicron variant piled on misery for travellers. The website showed that 2,175 flights around the world had been scrapped on Friday, which is Christmas Eve and a typically heavy day for travel. Around a quarter of those flights were in the U.S.. Another 1,259 Christmas Day flights were called off globally, the website said amid a surge in Covid-19 infections driven by Omicron, Reuters reports. Ministers could meet as soon as Monday to determine whether new restrictions are needed in England over the new year amid growing concerns that soaring Covid cases could hit public services. They will be expected to assess new modelling from the University of Warwick, given to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in documents published on Thursday. Scientists have looked at the effects of a potential return to step 2 restrictions from 28 December or 1 January, lasting either two weeks, four weeks or three months until 28 March. No 10 said the data had not yet been considered by ministers. Protesters in Guadeloupe are occupying the local legislature in the French Caribbean overseas territory, in a new standoff with Paris sparked by Covid rules. There have been tensions in Guadeloupe and the neighbouring island French territory of Martinique during the last weeks over rules including obligatory Covid vaccinations for health workers, which have fed into long-standing local grievances. Protesters first entered the debating chamber of the regional council while it was meeting on Thursday with several staying the night and deciding to continue their action into Friday. Councillors were able to leave peacefully. They want to negotiate with Paris over the crisis, but officials have so far indicated that there can be no talks as long as such actions are carried out, AFP reports. The protesters notably want all sanctions halted against health workers who have refused the Covid jab. There were 1,171 Covid-19 hospital admissions in the UK on 20 December, government figures show. This is up 30% week-on-week and the highest number since 19 February. During the second wave of coronavirus, UK admissions peaked at 4,583 on 12 January, PA reports. Passengers travelling home for Christmas have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 2,000 flights on Friday, according to a flight tracking website FlightAware. One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far. South Africans without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday. Additionally, people in South Africa will be offered a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its used for the general public. France will require passengers to show negative Covid tests to travel to its overseas territories, with the new measure coming into effect on 28 December. The UK Health Security Agency’s chief has suggested the government might decide on whether further restrictions are needed in England based on Omicron’s wider impact, rather than the variant’s severity alone.

Dozens of officials have reportedly been punished over a virus outbreak in the locked-down city of Xi’an, China’s disciplinary body said on Friday, Agence France-Presse reports. That’s all from me for today – thanks for reading along and happy Christmas. I’m handing over to my colleague Nadeem Badshah who will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours. Mark, 44, will be self-isolating on Christmas Day and plans to spend it relaxing. “I’ve got my two cats with me, a pile of books, and probably catching up on a few things on Netflix in bed as well,” the Church of England priest based in Manchester said. Meanwhile, Lauren, 31, from London, stressed that she would try to remember that tomorrow was just a day and that there were better days ahead. My colleague Aamna Mohdin spoke to people who will be stuck in their flats and bedrooms tomorrow about how they’re keeping their spirits up: A quick line from Reuters about the situation in France, which is dealing with a record number of cases: Emmanuel Macron will hold a Covid-19 meeting on Monday, the presidential palace has announced. The meeting, scheduled at 1500 GMT, will be followed immediately after by a cabinet meeting. The number of Christmas Eve shoppers in British city centres has slumped as people stay in to avoid the risk of being infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant, data suggests. Central London was hardest hit, with footfall down 30% compared with Friday last week, and 48% compared with Christmas Eve in 2019, according to data covering morning trading from Springboard. Footfall also fell by 10% week on week in other cities. The government has so far held off on imposing new restrictions on England. However, shopper numbers have fallen dramatically as people avoid crowds to ensure they are able to see family at Christmas. Footfall was lower than Christmas Eve 2019 across high streets, retail parks and shopping centres – although all categories were also stronger than Christmas Eve 2020, when large parts of England were placed in a surprise lockdown and other parts of the UK put restrictions in place. Read the full report, by the Guardian’s financial reporter Jasper Jolly, here: The number of Omicron cases in Scotland has more than doubled, Scottish government figures show, as nearly has the number of people in hospital confirmed to have the new strain, from 24 on Thursday to 42 on Friday. As of 5pm on Thursday, 3,832 confirmed cases were reported, taking the total number of cases of the new variant to 6,154. According to the figures, the increase was caused by a backlog of genotyping results being received by Public Health Scotland that were undertaken in mid-December, PA reports. In total, the number of cases of Covid-19 increased by 7,076 since Thursday. 10 new deaths were also logged, taking Scotland’s overall number of people who died after having first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days to 9,822. There were 536 people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 on Wednesday, down four on the day before, and 34 people were in intensive care, down four. So far 4,378,172 people have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccination, 4,006,076 have received their second dose, and 2,841,703 have received a third dose or booster. On Friday, national clinical director Jason Leitch urged Scots preparing to meet loved ones for Christmas to be cautious: The Omicron variant is coming, but behaviour and vaccines are keeping it at bay a little. But tomorrow is crucial for that, because if we suddenly throw caution to the wind, then it will find a way to infect individuals who gather. Try and [meet] carefully, test before you meet other people and get yourself vaccinated. A total of 605,561 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were recorded in the UK on Thursday, the lowest daily figure since 13 December. Nearly 32.3m booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with more than 5.9m in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK’s four health agencies. New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that people from Pakistani, Caribbean and African backgrounds have the lowest rates for receiving a booster or third dose of Covid-19 vaccine in England. Figures suggest the lowest take-up of third doses and booster jabs among people aged 50 and over in England was in the Pakistani (42.2%), black Caribbean (44.4%) and black African (45.4%) groups. More than a quarter of people of black Caribbean ethnicity are estimated to not have received a first Covid vaccine dose up to 12 December – the highest proportion of all ethnic groups, the ONS said. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair at the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: This is deeply worrying because in many ways I fear a repetition of what happened in the first wave, where ... we saw this rather alarming and disturbing disparity in illness and deaths amongst ethnic minorities from Covid. What we know now of course is that the patients, people who are becoming seriously ill, who are being hospitalised, are those who have not been vaccinated and those who have not had their boosters. Eighty percent of patients in some ICUs are those who have not been vaccinated. The ONS also said that take-up was lower among people with disabilities, people living in more deprived areas, those who have never worked or are long-term unemployed, those without qualifications and those who do not own their own home, compared to more advantaged groups. Hello, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be taking over for the next hour while my colleague Clea Skopeliti has a break. Don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have anything to flag you think we should be covering. I’m on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. In the UK, the chief of the Office for National Statistics has said there are “some indications” of people engaging in “safer behaviour” in response to the Omicron wave. However, Sir Ian Diamond told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: “At the moment I think it’s far too early to suggest that we will see anything other than a a continued rise.” Diamond denied being “shaken” by the speed of the rise in cases, saying: “I think we were gearing ourselves up for them”. “But at the same time, clearly they are really big increases, and that’s why it was incredibly important, we felt, to get them out into the public domain as soon as possible.” His comments come after figures showed that 1.7 million people in the UK had Covid last week, including one in 20 people in London. Airlines’ social media feeds have been filled with frustrated passengers asking for assistance after a spate of cancellations on Christmas Eve due to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. More than 2,000 flights were cancelled globally on Friday as the Omicron variant took a toll on airline carriers’ staff. “@Delta really?! You cancel my Christmas Eve flight at 12:30am?? I got up at 2am to get to the airport with my baby and husband and don’t see the cancellation till I’m at the airport to get my bags checked,” one passenger tweeted at the airline on Friday – one of several similar messages directed at carriers that have had to call off flights. There have been 458 cancelled flights within, into, or out of the United States, where Omicron now makes up more than 70% of new Covid cases. Passengers travelling home for Christmas have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 2,000 flights on Friday, according to a flight tracking website. The surge of Christmas Eve cancellations comes as the rapidly spreading Omicron variant means carriers are unable to staff their flights. The bulk of the cancellations came from five firms, with China Eastern cancelling 474 journeys, while Air China scrapped 188. United has cancelled 180 flights, Air India 160 and Delta has called off 127, figures from FlightAware show. At time of writing, the the flight tracking firm said the current number of Christmas Eve flights cancelled globally is 2,031. The figure includes 448 cancelled in the United States, where Omicron now accounts for more than 70% of new cases. “The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation. As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport,” United said on Thursday. Meanwhile, Delta said it has “exhausted all options and resources – including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying – before cancelling around 90 flights for Friday.” The airline attributed the impact of the Omicron variant and weather conditions for the cancellations. In response to the pre-holiday chaos, airlines have called for the relaxation of quarantine rules for vaccinated staff. Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, asked the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to cut the self-isolation period for vaccinated people experiencing breakthrough infections from 10 to five days. Airlines for America and JetBlue have seconded the request. The request comes amid a relaxation of self-isolation rules in England, allowing people to end quarantine after seven days if they test negative on two tests 24 hours apart. Similarly, the CDC in the US cut the isolation period to seven days for asymptomatic people who test negative, but only for health workers. Officials in the north-western Chinese city of Xian are facing punishment after a Covid-19 outbreak led to the lockdown of its 13 million residents. All domestic flights out of Xian and most trains from the city scheduled for Friday were cancelled, while the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said that 26 people were being held accountable for the failure to control the outbreak. Unvaccinated people in the UK should be offered a free taxi ride to their local clinic, the Liberal Democrats have said, adding that hospitals are “largely [filling] with people who are unvaccinated”. The party called for the creation of a “vaccine tracing” service to identify unvaccinated people and offer them an appointment slot, with help to get there if needed. Those who are unable to afford or access public transport should be ferried in a taxi, they said. A similar policy is already in place some parts of the country, including in Manchester. Lib Dem health spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said: “The booster programme is critical to protecting us all against Omicron. But the Ggvernment needs to also step up efforts to persuade and support the unvaccinated to get their jabs, to protect themselves and the NHS in the longer term.” She accused the government of targeting the unvaccinated in a “blame game”, which she said “risks being counterproductive and alienating communities whose trust in this government is already low”. One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far. The figure rises to one in 20 people for London, which has seen the highest number of Omicron cases detected, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data. In Wales, around one in 45 people had Covid that week, while Scotland’s rate was one in 65 and Northern Ireland’s was one in 40. The data includes people who tested positive outside of hospital or a care setting in the week ending 19 December. Russia has reported 24,703 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 horus, Reuters reports. The country has also registered 998 deaths in the same period of time. Unions have raised safety concerns about changes to ambulance staffing as an extra 90 military personnel are drafted in to support Scottish health boards. The contingency plan, first reported by the Courier, would see more ambulances staffed by only one trained medic and a driver, potentially a military one, with breaks also be cut. The Scottish ambulance service insisted the changes would only happen in “times of extremis only”, but GMB Scotland said staff and the public should be worried. The military personnel will help NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Grampian and NHS Lanarkshire from January. Kieran Whitford, a paramedic working in Aberdeen, wrote on Twitter that the changes made staff “feel like we are worth nothing”. People at risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus will have their options for treatment expanded from January after the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first two antiviral pills against Covid. Full report by Eric Berger: South Africans without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday. The move is part of a shift from containment to mitigation measures, with the health ministry changing the rules to require asymptomatic individuals to monitor their symptoms for five to seven days and avoid attending large gatherings after contact with a positive case. Only those who develop symptoms must get tested, the statement continued, adding that those with mild symptoms should isolate for eight days and severe cases for 10 days. The shift also sees the end of quarantine in facilities other than the home. Contact tracing will also be scrapped except in cases like cluster outbreaks. The ministry attributed the change in policy to the following factors: the emergence of highly infectious variants like Omicron; estimates that at least 60% of the population have some protection from vaccination or infection; and new information including on the high level of asymptomatic cases and small number of actual cases diagnosed. France will require passengers to show negative Covid tests to travel to its overseas territories. The new measure will come into effect on 28 December and affect travellers both from mainland France and abroad, the health ministry said. It comes after the country recorded a daily record of 91,608 Covid cases on Thursday (23 December), with Omicron spreading rapidly across the country. Bhutan has begun administering booster vaccine doses to older citizens and priority groups in a bid to fight the spread of the Omicron variant, health ministry officials have said. People aged 65 and above, overseas travellers, health workers, chronically ill people, and all adults living in “high risk” areas were eligible, the officials said. With a vaccine stock exceeding 250,000 doses, Bhutan plans to inoculate more than 228,000 people in a week, according to the Kuensel newspaper. “As we did for the second dose, mix and match is recommended even for the booster, given its higher efficacy,” Sonam Wangchuk, an official of the Royal Centre for Disease Control, told the newspaper. More than 93% of over-12s have been vaccinated with two doses in the nation of some 750,000 people. The kingdom has recorded just three Covid deaths since the pandemic began, while government data shows its tally of infections to stand at 2,659. The Office for National Statistics has the latest figures on take-up of booster doses in England by occupation. Around a third of sports players in England (34.1%) are estimated to have received a booster or third dose of Covid-19 vaccine as of 12 December. Other specific occupations with low take-up of extra doses include plasterers (33.3%), waiters and waitresses (33.4%), chefs (35.0%), bar staff (36.6%), fork-lift truck drivers (37.6%) and vehicle technicians and mechanics (38.2%). The figures may reflect the order in which people became eligible for a booster or third dose of vaccine, with jabs initially prioritised for older and vulnerable people before being extended to younger age groups. Austria should offer a fourth vaccine dose to some healthcare staff and other key workers, the National Vaccination Board has said in the wake of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. However, there was not enough evidence to recommend it for the general public, the board said. “In view of an imminent Omicron wave, (a fourth vaccination) can be offered in high-risk areas (eg exposed healthcare personnel) and in systemically critical areas from six months after the third vaccination,” the board said. It comes after Austria on Wednesday announced it would bolster restrictions once more from 27 December to deal with the rising tide of Omicron cases. Several hundred have been identified so far in the country, which had its fourth lockdown in November. Updating its guidelines, the board said that fourth shots could be given “off label” to some groups of key workers following medical consultation. “There is still no evidence that this additional vaccination can prevent infections. However, it can be it can be assumed that serious illnesses can be prevented,” it said. The UK Health Security Agency’s chief has suggested the government might decide on whether further restrictions are needed in England based on Omicron’s wider impact, rather than the variant’s severity alone. The risk of hospitalisation is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta, according to the first UK government study of its kind. Monday is expected to be the first day the government could consider any further restrictions after Boris Johnson said no further measures would be brought in before Christmas. Asked whether the government will have the information on Monday to make key decisions, Dr Jenny Harries told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Ministers will look at all of the data that we have available - and that isn’t simply what the epidemiology is saying, it’s how it’s impacting society. “So, for example, we have very high rates of individuals off sick - we know that particularly in London, around one in 35 have currently got Omicron. “Now that’s having an impact on the workforce. So these are not simply about hospitalisation rates.” She added that ministers are being kept updated on a daily basis and that will continue throughout the Christmas period. “I don’t think we do know yet that this is going to be a significantly less serious disease for the population – the older population – that we are normally most concerned about in relation to serious disease and death.” NHS staff are struggling with a “very, very depleted workforce”, the head of the Royal College of Nursing has warned, saying that staff want a course of action that allows them to care for patients safely. Pat Cullen told BBC Breakfast that nurses and other healthcare workers are “quite ill from the spin-off with Covid”. “[They] continue to be simply because their internal and personal resources are low going into this because of the number of hours that they’re working and the shifts they’ve been working on a very, very depleted workforce working in a fragile service leading up to this current wave,” she said. Cullen said staff want leaders to act to “support the health service” in order to allow them to “care for their patients safely … If that means tighter measures, that’s for political leaders to decide based on the scientific evidence.” People in South Africa will be offered a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its used for the general public. While both J&amp;J and Pfizer’s vaccines had been approved for use as boosters, they had previously only been offered to health workers. “From 24 December 2021 the National Vaccination Programme will provide J&amp;J booster vaccinations to anyone who received their last dose at least 2 months prior,” the health department’s statement said, adding ideally it would also be within six months of their initial shot. Meanwhile, people who had their second Pfizer dose at least six months ago will be able to get a booster dose of the vaccine from 28 December. According to figures from earlier this month, 44% of South African adults have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine – a figure well shy of the country’s target. While Mongolia’s vaccine take-up was excellent for the first two doses, the country’s booster drive has lagged behind. More than 90% of adults in the sparsely-populated nation of three million took up their initial vaccine doses, but only half of this figure have had the booster so far, due to a combination of online misinformation and the difficulties of reaching remote populations, according to AFP. About one-third of the country is nomadic. In order to bring up the country’s booster coverage, health workers are travelling to remote areas to offer herders a third vaccine dose. “During the first wave, people were queuing outside (for vaccines) and I was working until 9pm,” said nurse Sodkhuu Galbadrakh. “There were days I didn’t go home. Now, only five to six people come to get the booster shot per day.” He said he calls herders daily to try and arrange the third shot but often can’t get through, especially with poor phone reception in pastureland. However, Batbayar Ochirbat, the official leading the vaccination programme, told AFP that confidence in the booster is slowly growing after a fall in cases. After daily cases reached more than 3,000 in September, figures have fallen to an average of 200 daily cases, which he attributes partly to boosters. “People started to build trust after they saw vaccinated people have booster shots, develop no symptoms, and not get sick,” he said. The UK government’s chief scientific adviser has defended Sage against the charges that the group’s modelling was fearmongering, saying it was not their job to “spread gloom”. Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not the responsibility of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) “to take a particular policy stance or to either spread gloom or give Panglossian optimism”. The remarks followed criticism of epidemiological modellers’ response to the Omicron outbreak. In a piece for the Times, Vallance said those participating in the debate “need to consider all the data in the round, not only those parts that fit an argument while ignoring the rest”. “That is not science, even though it might sometimes make an entertaining read,” he said. Instead, he wrote, science must be “self-correcting”. It comes after a statement from the SPI-M-O, a group of scientists who report to Sage, warned last week that hospitalisations could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day and deaths at between 600 and 6,000 if no new restrictions were introduced. Two people have died in a fire in the the intensive care unit of a Russian Covid-19 hospital in the southern city of Astrakhan, according to the Tass news agency. Russia’s emergencies ministry said in a statement that there were casualties, but gave no further details. Investigators said they have launched an investigation into the case. A number of Russian hospitals have dealt with accidental fires since the onset of the pandemic, chiefly due to ageing infrastructure and low safety standards, AFP reports. In August, nine coronavirus patients died after an oxygen pipe ruptured at a hospital in Vladikavkaz.

Dozens of officials have reportedly been punished over a virus outbreak in the locked-down city of Xi’an, China’s disciplinary body said on Friday, Agence France-Presse reports. China is on high alert for new infections as it prepares to hold the Winter Olympics in February in the capital Beijing and is continuing to pursue a strict zero-Covid approach. Xi’an recently plunged into a strict lockdown where its 13 million residents have been told to stay home from Thursday, shuttering businesses and launching several rounds of mass testing. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on Friday that 26 Communist party officials had been punished for “insufficient rigour in preventing and controlling the outbreak”. Chinese officials who are deemed to have failed at controlling the virus in their region are regularly sacked or reprimanded. The statement said inspections had revealed there had been a lax approach to testing and an uncoordinated response that hindered contact tracing in Xi’an. Authorities would clamp down on “bureaucratic issues in disease control work such as shirking responsibility, not taking action, passing the buck and dealing with things in a negative way”, a party discipline official said. Thailand has reported its first domestic cluster of coronavirus infections from the Omicron variant in Kalasin province in northeastern Thailand, officials said on Friday, Reuters news agency reports. “From the Kalasin cluster, there are 21 new infections,” said the country’s Covid-19 taskforce spokeswoman, Apisamai Srirangsan. The infections stem from a couple who travelled from Belgium through the country’s Test &amp; Go scheme that waived quarantine for vaccinated arrivals, she said. Both had tested negative for infections before travelling and after arrival in Thailand in early December. By 15 December, they started having symptoms and tested positive and were later confirmed to have the Omicron variant, she said. The announcement comes as Thailand’s capital city Bangkok cancelled government-sponsored New Year activity, including midnight prayers. Fireworks and countdown events organised by malls were still going forward and would require proof of vaccination and antigen test results. If you’ve just joined us welcome to our live Covid blog covering all the latest coronavirus developments. Here’s a brief snapshot of how Covid is unfolding around the world ahead of the holiday season. Boris Johnson has invoked the teaching of Jesus Christ to urge the public to get a Covid booster jab. In a recent video, he celebrated members of the public for “getting jabbed not just for themselves, for ourselves, but for friends and family and everyone we meet … That, after all, is the teaching of Jesus Christ, whose birth is at the heart of this enormous festival – that we should love our neighbours as we love ourselves.” NHS England has said there are 200,000 vaccination appointments available on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day and urged anybody due a booster to consider coming forward “to get the gift of a jab”. In England around 1.2 million people were infected with Covid last week, or one in 45 of the population – a pandemic record. London estimated one in 30 people were infected last week. Airlines in the US and Australia have announced cancellations to hundreds of flights ahead of Christmas. Australia cuts the Covid booster interval to four months after their second dose, then the wait will be shortened again. Ecuador has declared Covid vaccination will be mandatory after a marked rise of infections. New York City will scale back New Year’s Eve celebrations after mayor Bill de Blasio announced new restrictions for the city’s planned event in Times Square. An Oxford University lab study on AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the Delta variant after two doses. Italy is planning to tighten restrictions including making mask wearing mandatory outdoors. The country has also banned public New Year’s Eve celebrations. The Spanish region of Catalonia will introduce a night curfew on Thursday. Nightclubs in Scotland are to close from 27 December for three weeks. Denmark will require foreigners entering the country to provide a negative Covid-19 test from 27 December, regardless of vaccination status NHS England has said there are 200,000 vaccination appointments available on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day and urged anybody due a booster to consider coming forward “to get the gift of a jab”. Staff and volunteers will continue to deliver jabs in some locations on 25 and 26 December, as the NHS tries to meet Boris Johnson’s target of giving everybody eligible a booster by the end of the year amid a surge in the number of Covid cases. Vaccination centres that were open “over the festive period” included Redbridge town hall in north-east London from 10am to 5.50pm and Grim’s Dyke golf club in Pinner, Middlesex, the NHS said. Walk-in appointments can be obtained in Eastbourne, Dewsbury and Hartlepool. Dr Emily Lawson, the head of the NHS Covid vaccination programme, praised those willing to work over the Christmas weekend and argued that people should consider getting a booster as a last-minute present to family members. Hello, it’s Samantha Lock with you on the blog this Christmas Eve. I hope everyone is well. I’ll be bringing you all the latest Covid developments from across the world. In some disappointing news for those wanting to visit family and friends over the holidays, airlines in the US and Australia have announced cancellations to hundreds of flights ahead of Christmas. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines say they have been forced to cancel dozens of Christmas Eve flights due to Covid’s toll on its flight crews and other workers. United cancelled 120 flights for Friday, while Atlanta-based Delta said it has cancelled about 90 flights, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, thousands of Australians have also had their domestic flights cancelled in the hours leading up to Christmas, as frontline staff were ordered to test and isolate amid a rise in Covid cases. There were 117 domestic services cancelled on Friday between Sydney and Melbourne. An Oxford University lab study on AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the Delta variant after two doses. “As we better understand Omicron, we believe we will find that T-cell response provides durable protection against severe disease and hospitalisations,” Mene Pangalos, the head of AstraZeneca’s biopharmaceuticals R&amp;D said, referring to a critical component of the immune system that respond to fight infection. Here’s a story that echoes the cancellation of flights happening over the US. Thousands of Australians have had their domestic flights cancelled in the hours leading up to Christmas, as frontline staff were ordered to test and isolate amid a rise in Covid cases. There were 117 domestic services cancelled on Friday between Sydney and Melbourne. A Sydney airport spokesperson told Guardian Australia that 80 of the 500 domestic services scheduled to arrive and depart Sydney on Friday had been cancelled. Many flights cancelled on Friday are Jetstar services, with the airline unable to staff all of its planned services because employees were sidelined due to Covid testing and isolation requirements.

The south-east Asian country has seen a surge in daily infections since it lifted most of its movement restrictions in October, but has not reported any cases of the Omicron variant. “The Covid-19 situation has been evolving in a complicated manner recently, with a rising trend in new infections,” the ministry said in a statement. The country reported 16,377 infections on Thursday, raising its overall caseload to 1.6 million, with 30,500 deaths. More than 62% of its population of 98 million have received at least two vaccine shots. Australians will soon be able to access Covid-19 vaccine booster shots four months after their second dose, then the wait will be shortened again. The government has said the minimum interval will be cut from five to four months on 4 January, and reduced to three months on 31 January. The move, announced on Friday, follows calls from state premiers to speed up the shots to better protect against the more infectious Omicron variant. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation said maximising booster coverage – if combined with “enhanced public health and social measures” – may prevent a large surge in case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths. Read the full story here. South Korea has just released its daily Covid report. The east Asian nation reported another 6,233 confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, according to data released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The figure is a slight drop on the 6,919 cases reported the day before. A further 56 deaths were also recorded – a significant drop on yesterdays record high of 109 deaths. A record number of 1,084 people have been admitted to hospital with serious symptoms and in critical condition. A controversial New Zealand scheme that offers visas to wealthy foreign investors has resumed operating after a year’s hiatus due to the pandemic, prompting concern from overseas New Zealanders who fear it will place additional strain on the country’s overburdened managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system. Martin Newell, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Grounded Kiwis, said the scheme’s resumption would prompt “disbelief” among New Zealanders overseas, who may lose out on MIQ spots to the investors. “The government is abandoning the needs of its citizens in favour of those who have enough money to be able to buy their way into the country.” Read the full story from our reporter Pete McKenzie in Wellington here. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines say they have been forced to cancel dozens of Christmas Eve flights due to Covid’s toll on its flight crews and other workers. United cancelled 120 flights for Friday, while Atlanta-based Delta said it has cancelled about 90 flights, Reuters reports. Both said they were working to contact passengers so they would not be stranded at airports. United said: The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation. As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport.” Delta said it has “exhausted all options and resources - including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying - before cancelling around 90 flights for Friday. Delta cited potential inclement weather and the impact of the Omicron variant for the cancellations. On Tuesday, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian asked the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to shrink quarantine guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals who experience breakthrough Covid-19 infections, citing the impact on the carrier’s workforce. Bastian asked that the isolation period be cut to five days from the current 10. That request was echoed both by Airlines for America, a trade group representing major cargo and passenger carriers, which wrote to the CDC on Thursday, and by JetBlue on Wednesday. China is reporting 87 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Thursday, 23 December. The figure is a slight decrease from 100 reported a day earlier, its health authority said on Friday. Of the new infections, 55 were locally transmitted, including 49 in the northern city of Xi’an currently under lockdown, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 71 from a day earlier. China reported 26 new asymptomatic cases, which it classifies separately from confirmed cases, up from 19 a day earlier. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 100,731 confirmed cases as of 23 December. Ecuador has declared Covid vaccination will be mandatory after a marked rise of infections and the arrival of new variants of the disease. The government said Thursday that only Ecuadorians with a medical condition that could be complicated by vaccination will be exempt. Those people must provide documentation. Officials say the order comes because of an increase in coronavirus infections and the circulation of new variants such as omicron. Ecuador says it has enough vaccines to immunise the entire population. As of Tuesday, about 77% of Ecuador’s 17.3 million people had been vaccinated. About 33,600 people in Ecuador have died from Covid. Earlier this week, the body overseeing health policies to combat the pandemic decreed that vaccination certificates must be shown to enter restaurants, cinemas and other public areas. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has announced new restrictions for the city’s planned New Year’s Eve event in Times Square. Viewing areas that normally accommodate about 58,000 people will be limited to about 15,000 to allow for more distancing, and everyone in attendance must show proof of vaccination and wear a mask. “There is a lot to celebrate and these additional safety measures will keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year,” de Blasio said. On Wednesday, the city set another record with 22,808 new Covid cases, though a true comparison is difficult due to discrepancies in tests available. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog this Christmas Eve. I’ll be bringing you all the latest Covid developments from across the world. Let’s start with the news that New Year’s Eve plans in New York will be scaled back amid fears of a surge in Covid cases. The annual celebration will still go ahead as planned although the number of attendees has been slashed. Several countries including Greece, Italy and Malta have also scrapped planned New Year’s Eve events. An Oxford University lab study on AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the Delta variant after two doses. “As we better understand Omicron, we believe we will find that T-cell response provides durable protection against severe disease and hospitalisations,” Mene Pangalos, the head of AstraZeneca’s biopharmaceuticals R&amp;D said, referring to a critical component of the immune system that respond to fight infection. Here’s a run-down of all the Covid news you may have missed: Europe In England around 1.2 million people were infected with Covid last week, or 1 in 45 of the population - a pandemic record. London estimated 1 in 30 people were infected last week. UK health secretary Sajid Javid says there will be no further announcements on Covid restrictions in England before Christmas. Germany’s health minister said he expects a surge in coronavirus cases around new year and people will probably need a fourth vaccine shot. Germany also confirmed the country’s first death due to the Omicron variant. Greece banned public Christmas and New Year’s Eve festivities and mandated mask-wearing in open spaces. The measures will come into effect on Friday morning. Italy is planning to tighten restrictions including making mask wearing mandatory outdoors. The country has also banned public New Year’s Eve celebrations. Malta will ban all events where attendees are standing not seated, except weddings and funerals, from 27 December. Nightclubs in Scotland are to close from 27 December for three weeks. Denmark will require foreigners entering the country to provide a negative Covid-19 test from 27 December, regardless of vaccination status. Montenegro’s president, Milo Djukanović, tested positive for Covid-19 after being in contact with an infected person. The Spanish region of Catalonia will introduce a night curfew on Thursday. United States Emergency Covid testing sites are being set up in hard-hit areas across the US. The US Supreme court will hold a special session on Biden’s nationwide vaccine-or-testing Covid mandate for large businesses and a separate vaccine requirement for healthcare workers. The US Food and Drug Administration authorised Merck’s antiviral pill, molnupiravir, for Covid-19, after giving the go-ahead to a similar treatment from Pfizer a day earlier. Asia China locks down 13 million people in Xi’an after detecting 127 Covid cases. All residents are barred from leaving their houses except to buy living necessities every other day or for emergencies. Organisers of the Beijing Winter Olympics said they expect a “certain number” of Covid-19 cases in China due to foreigners arriving for the Games. South Korea set a new record for Covid deaths on Thursday. Australia reintroduced Covid curbs such as mandated mask wearing indoors, capacity limits and QR code check-ins to cover most of the population on Thursday as daily infections hit a fresh record. Australia will also shorten the interval for people to receive their booster shots to four months from five from 4 January. South America: Ecuador is making vaccination against the coronavirus mandatory. Middle East Covid infections are rising again across the six Gulf Arab states after months of low or falling figures."

          "headline": "My winter of love: I was not expecting a hot first date. Then I found love in a terrible pub",
          "bodyText": "For most of the winter of 2011-12, I was a slightly reluctant member of the Guardian’s spin-off dating site, Guardian Soulmates. I was still in my 20s, just about, and pouring the energy and naivety of youth into a busy social life, a career as a writer of newsprint ephemera and a room in a shared flat. I think I was also a bit lonely and rudderless – a manchild still making sense of life 10 years after the sudden death of my dad. Whatever it was, something was missing. By late February, I had been on half a dozen first dates – and no second dates. I was getting tired of the whole thing. It was all so procedural. But I’d agreed to meet a girl called Jess, whose profile handle – “good_grammar_is_hot” – had somehow not entirely put me off. Temperatures in London that night were due to hit freezing, so I wore two unattractive jumpers under an unattractive coat. I was not anticipating a hot date. Jess and I both had house parties to go on to. We planned to meet for a quick drink at a sub-Wetherspoons pub by Victoria station. It would be handy for a prompt underground getaway. It turned out Jess had low expectations too. She’d been on Soulmates for a bit longer. In the early days of the site, an algorithm ranked matches for compatibility. Jess’s top match, with a rating of 99.7%, turned out to be her own brother. It was downhill from there. I cannot picture now the moment our eyes first met, but I do remember feeling a warming spark and an immediate sense of ease. We drank bad lager and sweet white wine. As shoppers and theatregoers swirled about the tables around us, waiting briefly for trains home, we held fast like rocks in an eddy. Later, when Jess popped to the loo, we furtively texted our respective flatmates. “Like her a lot,” my message said. It helped that we had basically zero degrees of separation – Jess was a journalist too and we had mutual friends – but it was more than that. Death is not always good chat fodder for a first date – even for oversharers like Jess and me. But at some point we learned that we had both lost fathers way too soon. We had both been on the brink of adulthood when that earthquake hit, and the crockery was somehow still rattling. It was the first time I’d met someone who had gone through something similar, and it strengthened our bond. I don’t know what else we talked about – the usual cringey first-date stuff – but it quickly became clear that neither of us would make our next engagement. We braved the cold to go on instead to a sub-Wagamama noodle place round the corner, and kept chatting. We lived at opposite ends of the Victoria line. We waited between platforms for the first train to arrive, squeezing every last second out of the evening. As a rumble approached from the north, we agreed, before a chaste hug and a dash, that we should meet again. Inbox archaeology can be an embarrassing pursuit, and I can see now that I waited until 10.17 the next morning before emailing: “Is this too soon for post-date correspondence?” A year later, I moved into Jess’s flat in Brixton. It was in a development that had been advertised as a converted Victorian school. Jess later discovered that this had been an estate agent’s fudge. When she found an old photo of the building in the council archives, she gasped when she saw the huge white letters that had once stretched under the roofline: “BRIXTON ORPHANAGE FOR FATHERLESS GIRLS”. The word “fatherless” had been painted directly above Jess’s windows like a label. It was a spooky slice of history, but then felt like serendipity as the flat became a happy refuge for a fatherless couple. We would not be schooled in Bible stories or domestic service, as the residents 150 years earlier had been (Jess would have appalled an orphanage matron), but we would learn how to be settled adults. Ten years ago, we found each other – and love – on a cold and unpromising winter’s night in a terrible pub. Then we found ourselves. In 2015, we got married and later moved into a house with space for Jake and Betty, now four and one. The photo of the orphanage, which Jess had framed, hangs on the wall just inside our front door."

          "headline": "Omicron surge hits former ‘Covid-zero’ states, as NSW sees hopeful trends in serious infections",
          "bodyText": "The spike in cases caused by Omicron is forcing states that had previously adopted Covid-zero approaches to confront their first major outbreaks since the beginning of the pandemic, with South Australia recording more infections per capita on Friday than Victoria. On Friday, SA recorded 688 new Covid-19 infections, with the state’s premier, Steven Marshall, revealing about 70% of them were from the Omicron variant. “What we are very concerned about is the very significant increase in transmissibility. We do have to take action,” Marshall said on Friday. The SA government has responded by overturning a ban on rapid antigen testing, as well as continuing with a number of restrictions that had been due to end on 28 December. In Queensland, where 589 new cases were recorded on Friday, the health minister, Yvette D’Ath, warned residents to “get ready for Covid”. In Western Australia, the last Australian state to cling to a Covid-zero approach before a planned border reopening in February, there were five new cases on Friday after a French backpacker returned a positive test. One of the new cases is a close contact of the man, while the others were casual contacts from an event in Perth. The state’s premier, Mark McGowan, initially reported that there were four new cases but said a fifth had been confirmed during his press conference. Two of the five cases were unvaccinated, while one was unconfirmed. McGowan, who has staked his political reputation on keeping WA Covid-free and has employed tough and controversial border measures throughout the pandemic, announced a number of changes, including upgrading Queensland and South Australia to high-risk locations. But even McGowan hinted the possibility of changes to that approach on Friday, saying the 5 February border change may be “redundant” if the state saw significant spread of the virus. “It may well come forward because if we have community spread of the virus … it may well be that February 5 becomes redundant,” he said. But in New South Wales, where case numbers began to dramatically spike as a result of the Omicron variant earlier in December, early reports from some frontline doctors have provided reason for optimism. On Thursday, the state’s premier, Dominic Perrottet, said emerging data from NSW suggested the Omicron variant was “five times less severe” than the Delta variant. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said evidence from both here and overseas indicated “infection with Omicron is likely to be milder than infection with Delta, with the risk of hospitalisation being about 60% to 80% less than for Delta”. That was supported by a UK government study released on Friday, which suggested the risk of being admitted to hospital was up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta. General practitioner Ziad Basyouny helped to establish out-of-hospital care for Covid-19 patients in western Sydney during the Delta wave and has continued to work in that team during the Omicron outbreak. Basyouny was unequivocal about the difference in presentations between the Delta and Omicron strains, saying the latter had so far seen most patients develop “very, very minor symptoms”. “It’s so apparent. Tomorrow I will have about 20 patients who are at high risk. Of those 19 will have no symptoms. It’s so different to Delta. During Delta, I’d call maybe 60 people a day and out of those all 60 would have symptoms,” he said. “People say it’s too early to call it milder and I know it’s too early for epidemiologists, but clinically I can’t say anything else. I can’t change the fact that these patients are presenting as less severe.” Despite that, the pace of the outbreak in NSW has seen increasing pressure on the health system. About 1,500 healthcare workers have been forced to isolate either because they have contracted the virus or are deemed a close contact. At the same time, the number of people receiving care outside hospital has fallen. On 14 December there were 3,300 people receiving some form of care out of hospital, about 65% of active cases. By the 22 December that figure had dropped to only 38% of active cases. According to Basyouny that was both a result of the variant’s milder outcomes, but also the ballooning case numbers. “The system would not cope if we continued to monitor all people who were infected even if they did not have symptoms, so we have to risk stratify people,” he said, adding that he had “no doubt” case numbers in NSW would reach 25,000 a day in the coming weeks. On Friday New South Wales recorded another 5,612 cases of the virus, as indoor mask mandates were reintroduced following a surge in cases of the Omicron variant – it now accounts for about 80% of the state’s cases. Despite reports of the strain’s mildness, the rapid increase in Omicron cases has still seen hospitalisation rates rise as many more people catch the virus. In the past 10 days the number of people in hospital with Covid has increased from 168 to 382. The state’s paramedics have also sounded the alarm about record numbers of triple-zero calls, leading to significant delays in response to emergency calls. The outbreak has also led to increased pressure on the state’s testing system, prompting a shift in the government’s messaging to urge people not to get tested unless they had symptoms or had been in close contact with a Covid positive person. “NSW Health reminds people that when you receive that notification from the QR check-in, that just lets you know someone was in that vicinity or premise who subsequently tested Covid positive,” Chant said on Friday. “What we’re stressing is that’s a prompt, a reminder for you to monitor for symptoms, so please get tested if you’re unwell but don’t get tested unless you are feeling unwell. “It is important we keep those testing resources focused on people that have symptoms or people that we’ve directed from public health to get tested or where you know you’ve had close contact with a case.” Victoria reported 2,095 new Covid-19 cases and eight deaths on Friday. A total of 397 patients are in hospital, including 75 in intensive care, with 40 on ventilation. The seven-day hospitalisation average is steady at 392. An indoor mask mandate for people eight years and older came into effect in Victoria on Friday. Masks will also be required at all major events with more than 30,000 patrons, including the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, but can be removed while seated outdoors. Masks are already required in retail settings, for hospitality workers and on public transport. The government is also recommending Victorians work from home over the festive season and hospitality venues are being asked to consider providing seated-only service.

          "bodyText": "A controversial New Zealand scheme that offers visas to wealthy foreign investors has resumed operating after a year’s hiatus due to the pandemic, prompting concern from overseas New Zealanders who fear it will place additional strain on the country’s overburdened managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system. Martin Newell, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Grounded Kiwis, said the scheme’s resumption would prompt “disbelief” among New Zealanders overseas, who may lose out on MIQ spots to the investors. “The government is abandoning the needs of its citizens in favour of those who have enough money to be able to buy their way into the country.” Immigration New Zealand (INZ) recently granted 32 visas to people who pledged to invest at least $10m locally over three years and another 76 visas to individuals pledging to invest at least $3m, according to the news website Stuff. INZ is yet to decide on a further 816 applications across both categories. The visas add up to a financial commitment of at least $548m. According to an INZ spokesperson, the agency has begun processing applications for multiple visa categories – including the humanitarian and family categories – not just for investors. With their visas in hand, investors may apply to compete for spots in New Zealand’s congested MIQ system. A stay in MIQ is a prerequisite for entry to the country, which has been largely closed to non-quarantined international travel since March 2020 to protect against Covid-19. Due to a shortage of MIQ spots, thousands of New Zealanders have not been able to return home. Seerwan Ali Jafar, an Auckland resident whose mother has been unable to travel and visit her grandchildren due to MIQ difficulties, said the investor scheme’s resumption was “outrageous and offensive. Kiwis can’t enter to see family but the wealthy can buy their way in. It’s intolerable.” The scheme’s restart comes after a delay in the resumption of quarantine-free travel for New Zealanders. The Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, said the reopening day would be pushed from 17 January to the end of February due to uncertainty over Covid-19’s Omicron variant. The turnaround ensures that difficulties surrounding access to MIQ will continue into 2022. According to information released under the Official Information Act, New Zealand’s policy of granting visas to wealthy investors reached its height in 2016-2017 when 446 wealthy investors were granted visas. There has been speculation that at least some of these investors, like the American billionaire Peter Thiel, may have applied because they saw New Zealand as a safe haven for a potential doomsday scenario. Justin Pemberton, a documentary film-maker focused on economic inequality, said the scheme created a two-tier immigration system. “If you’ve got money, you can come through. If you don’t you can’t … It’s a very crude and reductive way to operate”. Due to the emergence of Covid-19 and the closing of New Zealand’s borders, just 51 investor visas were granted in 2020-2021. Some were controversial. The Google co-founder Larry Page applied for an investor visa in November 2020 and was accepted in February 2021. The rapid approval sparked frustration given the long delays many migrant workers have experienced getting visas for themselves or their families. Even as INZ resumes granting investor visas, that visa backlog for migrant workers continues: the government recently introduced a fast-tracked residency visa for such workers, with as many as 15,000 workers stuck in New Zealand eligible to apply."

          "headline": "Finally the UK has noticed its rampant sexism in healthcare. What now?",
          "bodyText": "Ministers are concerned about women’s health, they have declared today. Many women who have been shouting about glaring health inequalities for far too long may be forgiven for saying under their breaths: about bloody time. In many countries men face greater health risks, but not in the UK. Research published by the House of Lords earlier this year pointed out that study after study showed poorer outcomes for women. In 2016, researchers at University College London found that women with dementia received worse medical treatment than men with the condition, made fewer visits to the GP, received less health monitoring and took more potentially harmful medication. Women, in particular young women, are also more likely to experience common mental health conditions than men, despite the fact that men account for about three-quarters of deaths registered as suicide. The inequalities start well before women make it to their doctor’s surgery. Women are routinely underrepresented in clinical trials, and medical research proposed by women, for women, is not allotted the same funding as medical research proposed by men, for, you guessed it, men. Tireless work by the campaigner and writer Caroline Criado Perez demonstrates that, as she states in her book Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men, healthcare is “systematically discriminating against women, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated and misdiagnosed”. Sexism is still rampant in healthcare, not least among staff. Despite the fact the NHS workforce is dominated by women, men working in NHS trusts are still paid more than their female peers. It permeates the system, from women’s pain being dismissed by their GPs, to women struggling to get the menopause drugs they need on the NHS. The consequences can be catastrophic. In June 2020 a government inquiry found that an arrogant culture in which serious medical complications were dismissed as “women’s problems” contributed to a string of healthcare scandals over several decades. A recognition today by the women’s health minister Maria Caufield that there were “shocking” cases among the 100,000 women who answered a government consultation is welcome, as is the announcement that there will be a women’s health ambassador. The creation of a menopause taskforce rides a wave of greater understanding of a condition that affects half the population but was, until very recently, taboo. And it is good to see that campaigners’ calls to ban hymen restoration surgery have finally been heeded after the government earlier promised to ban virginity testing. But gender inequality in healthcare runs deep. Recognising, as the government has today, that system-wide changes are needed to tackle “decades of gender health inequality” is a vital first step yet, as Criado-Perez has said, women have been considered less important in healthcare as far back as Ancient Greece. This spring’s Women’s Health Strategy will need to have a lot more meat, in particular a commitment to sex-disaggregated data within a healthcare system still providing PPE designed for men to many of its staff – and years of sustained funding if that is to be reversed. • This article was amended on 9 May 2025 to remove reference to a gender health gap study by the wellbeing platform Manual, which has been withdrawn from that website and was previously redacted from the House of Lords briefing paper in which it had been cited. Manual told us that, “While our research was intended to prompt discussion around this important issue, it was not (and was not represented as being) undertaken to the standard of professional academic clinical or public health research.”"

          "bodyText": "‘National consistency would be helpful’ With the advent of Omicron, we have a little more national accord in aspects of our public health strategy; we need to slow Omicron down as it moves through the population, and we should aim to do so while avoiding lockdown. The national vaccine program – especially boosters – is central to containing Omicron, and will be boosted itself with better funding incentives from the commonwealth to GPs, and pharmacies and the states ramping up hubs once again. But the other two areas of control focus may continue to be inconsistent across jurisdictions – partly due to different infection pressures, but also down to differences in risk tolerance that Omicron has not nudged aside. The package of proven strategies that help contain spread, whether the virus is already circulating in the community or to reduce impact if it is reintroduced, are one and the same; masks, physical distancing, hygiene and managing gatherings safely. These were recognised today as a critical pillar in disease control, but the management of these resides with our states and territories, and there wasn’t agreement on how these should be implemented. What is critical is how well the advice is adhered to, and whether measures already in place need to be tightened. National consistency would be helpful to convey a clear message on the importance of these measures. If there is high compliance in New South Wales already with reportedly 85% mask wearing in retail settings, then introducing a mask rule is not really an impost. Conversely, if rules in other jurisdictions are not achieving high compliance, then that needs to be looked at too. We are moving to greater consistency in case and contact follow-up, but priorities change as resources are spread more thinly when case infection rates grow, and states with low case numbers want to continue more aggressive case follow-up while they can. QR codes still have a role, whether as an outbreak investigation tool in low infection settings or allowing automatic notification of contact with an exposure site or as a memory prompt of your movements in high transmission areas. Small steps on Wednesday, but at least this may be a platform for greater national consistency as the coronavirus progressively moves through our community and both our goals and our case load become more uniform. • Catherine Bennett is chair in epidemiology at Deakin University ‘Australians are relying on our leaders to act responsibly’ It seems it is still not a race. There is a clear need to mandate minimally intrusive but highly protective measures such as masks and QR codes anywhere that Omicron is spreading in the community. The lack of action after the national cabinet meeting held on Wednesday is difficult to understand. We need leadership in making mask-wearing indoors mandatory – leaving this to “personal responsibility” is frankly irresponsible. Wearing a mask to prevent Covid is not analogous to putting on sunscreen to prevent skin cancer. No amount of sunscreen I slap on will protect you from skin cancer. In contrast, Covid is an airborne transmissible virus so if you wear a mask it protects me and vice versa. And all of us wearing masks consistently will protect the health system. We need to ensure high testing and tracing capacity – for the latter, QR codes are the only way to keep up when case numbers are high. We have invested in the infrastructure for digital tracing so it makes no sense to throw it all away. The 3,763 cases in New South Wales on Wednesday will have up to 80,000 contacts, and the contacts are the most likely to become the next cases. If we don’t alert the contacts, the epidemic will explode, health systems will collapse and we may be forced into the lockdown that we never wanted after all. Magical thinking will not stop this – only a smart, layered strategy will do that. For NSW to abandon everything as cases surge during the time of maximal gatherings, will result in avoidable illness and death. But it seems that any national strategy for TTQI can wait another two weeks for the next cabinet meeting. We learned on Wednesday there are 20m doses of mRNA vaccine in Australia. It is fantastic that we have the supply but vaccine in the fridge won’t help manage the Omicron surge. Maintaining the delivery of boosters over the Christmas holidays will save lives but that won’t happen without a plan. Other countries have called in the army. We are giving a $10 a dose incentive. With surging cases, NSW Health is already preparing us to turn our homes into hospitals – they advise if you are under 50, manage your Covid at home, and call your GP if you need help. Most GP practices are operating on skeleton staff over the holidays, so good luck with that. There will be preventable deaths of people at home who were unable to access care. We all need to take responsibility for avoiding the worst-case scenario of the Omicron wave. Our leaders are relying on Australians to act responsibly. Australians are relying on our leaders to act responsibly as well. • Nancy Baxter is head of the school of population and global health at the University of Melbourne.

          "headline": "‘Cancel culture’ risks wiping out comedy, claims Maureen Lipman",
          "bodyText": "“Cancel culture” risks wiping out comedy altogether, the actor Dame Maureen Lipman has claimed. The Coronation Street star warned that some comedians were being prevented from ever working again for having offended people, though she offered no example. A new YouGov poll suggests more than half of people would avoid expressing a political or social view in case they encounter criticism, with those holding the most regressive views – such as opposition to people coming from abroad to live in the UK – more likely to do so. However, the same survey suggested two-thirds of people do not know what “cancel culture” is, with half of respondents having never heard of it. “I think it’s a revolution, I think it’s in the balance whether we’re ever going to be funny again,” Lipman told the BBC. “It’s a bit like laughter in church, something has to be forbidden to make you really laugh, to make you really belly laugh. It’s when you shouldn’t be laughing. And so, therefore, all the things that are being cancelled out are, I’m afraid, the things that have always made people laugh. “This cancel culture, this punishment, it’s everywhere. You know, an eye for an eye. ‘You said that, therefore, you must never work again.’ We’re on the cusp of wiping out comedy.” During the interview, broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Lipman offered no examples of this happening. She has been approached for comment. However, the comedian Russell Kane told the BBC it was “complete nonsense” to suggest comedians were self-censoring. “I don’t think anyone is saying you can’t be offended, nobody is saying that. What we’re saying is you can’t use hate speech that would prompt a gender-related crime, a sex-related crime or a race-related crime,” he said. “There’s been a massive, much needed shift in the conversation around gender, around men’s attitudes to women, around consent. Society has moved on.” Nevertheless, he said he did regularly delete his tweets in case anything came back to haunt him in future. Cancel culture has become a key issue for conservatives in recent years, including government ministers, who have sought to push the concept as part of what some perceive as a culture war. They have portrayed it as a coordinated campaign against them and as a more insidious chilling effect on freedom of expression. They have often cited opposition to speaking appearances or performers encountering a lack of success in their careers as examples. Their opponents have dismissed this, saying the response is more commonly just legitimate criticism by people who are calling for views they see as divisive not to be amplified. For example, critics have pointed out that many of those claiming to have been silenced have done so via major broadcast, online and print platforms that have granted them privileged access to huge audiences."

That is all for today from the UK blog but do join me as I continue our Covid coverage on our global live blog below: With no further Covid restrictions expected before Christmas, the focus is now turning to whether the prime minister will instead impose restrictions in the run-up to new year. The Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar reports ministers are considering bringing in a “circuit breaker” lockdown lasting between two weeks and a month from 27 December. From the Financial Times’ Jim Pickard: Rishi Sunak has been accused of failing to do enough to help embattled hospitality businesses through the Omicron wave after refusing to bring back furlough for the hardest-hit firms. Succumbing to intense pressure to offer financial support amid a collapse in pre-Christmas trade for pubs, restaurants and hotels, the chancellor announced a £1bn bailout package on Tuesday consisting of business grants and help with sick pay. However, it drew an angry response from bosses who told Sunak he was failing to grasp the severity of the Omicron shock to the economy and that a lack of clarity from the government over the need for further pandemic restrictions was making matters worse. Comparing the plan to a “dud cracker on Christmas Day”, Tim Rumney, the chief executive of the Best Western hotel chain, which employs 10,000 staff in the UK, said a return to furlough was vital if the current Covid wave continues. “It’s just so disappointing and underwhelming in every sense. It doesn’t go far enough in our opinion, it doesn’t go deep enough and it’s too little too late,” he said. Read the full article here: Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner has criticised Boris Johnson’s “dither and delay” approach to Christmas plans. Sky News’ Tamara Cohen reports that during yesterday’s two-hour cabinet meeting, chancellor Rishi Sunak was among those ministers most opposed to bringing in new measures. Here’s a roundup of the key events from today: The prime minister has confirmed no further Covid restrictions will be put in place in England before Christmas.

Thanks so much for joining me today and for all your comments and tweets. The prime minister has confirmed no further Covid restrictions will be put in place in England before Christmas. He said there was currently not enough evidence on the severity of Omicron, the hospitalisation rate and the impact of the booster programme to justify tougher measures before Christmas. However, No 10 say the prime minister is clear the situation is “finely balanced and remains difficult across the country”, with the Omicron variant continuing to surge and cases at an all-time high. The government has said it will continue to monitor the data closely and will not hesitate to act after Christmas if necessary. In a video message released on Tuesday afternoon, the prime minister urged people to exercise caution and to continue to follow the guidance, including by wearing a mask indoors when required, keeping fresh air circulating and taking a test when visiting vulnerable and elderly relatives. He also urged everyone yet to do so to get a booster of the Covid vaccine. People will be asking “why should we bloody well listen now” if the government tries to implement new Covid restrictions, a Conservative MP has said. But while Sir Roger Gale warned of a potential public “backlash”, he also stressed it would be “dangerous” to ignore the scientific advice, and raised concerns that the government may be “missing the boat” on implementing further public health measures in response to rising Covid rates. Meanwhile the chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, said she believed people would accept more public health measures, but that it was “outrageous” the government did not hold a press conference and lay out the latest data on Monday because people needed the information to make decisions. I’m not averse to further measures based upon sound science. My worry is that we may be once again missing the boat because of the pressure the prime minister has been put under by his own backbench and as a result in part of course of his own folly, and that he may be reluctant to take action that is actually necessary. The Conservative MP for North Thanet stressed the need for adequate support for business and said without formal restrictions the hospitality industry is “between a rock and a hard place”. Gale told the PA news agency: I have been highly critical of many things that the government and the prime minister have done, but I wouldn’t wish to stop them doing the right things now. I think – there’s no doubt about this – there is a public reaction against being told what to do simply because, and I’m afraid this is true, people feel the government didn’t do themselves what they told us to do last time so why should we bloody well listen now. And I think there will be, if they were to try to do much before Christmas, I think there would be one hell of a backlash, and people would just say get stuffed I’m afraid – dangerous though that certainly would be. There’s no doubt the infection rates are rising alarmingly and there’s no doubt in my mind that fairly soon the health service is going to have even more real problems than it’s got now. Responding to rumours of some kind of circuit-breaker akin to a brief lockdown after Christmas, Moran said it would be “absolutely devastating for the country” and a sign of “government failure” to take the appropriate measures earlier, but she said she would back measures suggested by the scientific advisers to save lives. The only thing that could ease the threat to the NHS is a short circuit breaker to limit indoor social interaction, Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit has said in an opinion piece for the Guardian. She writes: The risks to the NHS come from three sides. First, Omicron has grown faster than any variant seen to date – including the original spread of Covid-19 in March 2020. The UK Health Security Agency reports that cases of Omicron have been doubling every two days in most regions of the UK. A certain percentage of newly infected people will need hospital treatment – even if Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta. Let’s say that the risk of hospitalisation with Omicron is half that of Delta, although the analysis from Imperial College London suggests this may be optimistic. With a variant that is doubling every two days that gives us only a two-day advantage. Whatever the eventual percentage of people with Omicron who will need NHS care, the absolute number seeking care will also double every two days. Because it takes seven to 14 days from infection to needing hospital, this rapid increase in demand for NHS services will not be seen immediately – probably not until after Christmas – but it will happen. Modelling by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group – which reports to the Sage committee – suggests that by the time we see this impact, four doublings may have passed. This means much higher levels of pressure on the NHS which we can’t do anything about if we wait for hospitalisations to rise before we act. Last Thursday, Sage estimated that without reducing transmission further (over and above plan B), there will be at least 3,000 daily admissions to hospital in England (equivalent to the first wave in 2020), and it could be much worse even than last January. So the question is not whether it will be bad for the NHS, but whether it will be just dreadful or catastrophic.

This brings the total confirmed cases of the variant in the UK to 60,508. A further 90,629 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the UK as of 9am on Tuesday, the government said. The government said a further 172 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 173,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. A total of 51,537,827 first doses of Covid-19 vaccine had been delivered in the UK by December 20. This is a rise of 39,793 on the previous day. Some 47,102,814 second doses have been delivered, an increase of 50,938. A combined total of 29,876,223 booster and third doses have also been given, a day-on-day rise of 897,979. Separate totals for booster and third doses are not available. Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs on Tuesday afternoon that, while her core advice remained to limit socialising, additional protections were necessary including all outdoor events limited to just 500 people, and indoor events including concerts limited to 200 people seated, or 100 standing, with one-metre physical distancing required for any events still going ahead. The new rules will hit the Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and large-scale Hogmanay street parties: Edinburgh’s was planned to proceed at a reduced capacity of 30,000. A total of 897,979 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Monday, new figures show. The is the second highest figure on record, behind 940,606 doses on Saturday 18 December. More than 29.8m booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 5.8m in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK’s four health agencies. The coming weeks “paint a very bleak picture” for exhausted nursing staff as coronavirus infections increase, a union has said. The Royal College of Nursing said nurses are “already physically and emotionally exhausted” by the pandemic but staff shortages due to Covid-19 mean they are now wondering “What is coming?” London’s biggest health trust, Barts Health NHS trust also warned that some of its operations may need to be cancelled in the new year due to rising coronavirus cases and staff absences. A spokesman for the trust said services are running as normal, but a contingency plan has been put in place in case staff need to be redeployed. Alistair Chesser, group chief medical officer, said: “Our hospitals are currently running as usual, but we have plans in place to redeploy staff in the coming weeks, should we need to. “We are only able to respond to this next challenge because of our dedicated staff who are prepared to do all they can to care for our patients, with many taking on extra shifts.” Horace Trubridge, general secretary of the Musicians’ Union, called for further support for performers. He said: “This is a particularly busy time for our members and many musicians will have been relying on the festive period and the new year to provide much-needed funds following the devastating effects of lockdown and the well-publicised difficulties. “It is absolutely crucial to their survival that the government recognises the economic abyss that our world-class players, performers, writers and teachers are facing. They need support and they need it now.” Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Julian Knight welcomed further support for the arts but called for clarity on the likelihood of a lockdown, given its impact on the events sector. He said: “While we await the detail, the announcement of additional financial support for the entertainment and hospitality sectors is welcome. It will be important for this funding to help all those whose livelihoods depend on thriving theatres and live venues, whether they be on the stage, behind the scenes or front of house.” The acting artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company echoed the call for support across the sector, following news that 30 million will be made available through the Culture Recovery Fund. Erica Whyman said in a statement: “The theatre industry has once again been hit hard by Covid-19. All RSC current productions are impacted, as are so many across the country. We welcome the additional support through the Culture Recovery Fund and wait to hear further news about the 30 million boost. “Thanks to existing government support in the form of repayable finance, the RSC can weather some losses for a short period, although those losses will have a substantial impact on our future plans. “Not all theatres can survive this fresh wave, even in the short term, and the significant financial impact of ongoing cancellations means that additional support is urgently needed to sustain the brilliant recovery the sector has made. “Many of our most important cultural organisations are again in peril, and our freelance workforce are at particular risk, and remain essential to the success of our industry.” The chancellor’s announcement of £1bn for UK businesses losing trade because of the Omicron surge gives “welcome breathing space” to the industries struggling this winter, the CBI has said. Rain Newton-Smith, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) chief economist, said: “The chancellor has provided welcome breathing space to boost confidence and provide support for hospitality and leisure businesses to keep their doors open through tough disruption to their crucial winter trading. “The latest targeted package offers a fair variety of support to help keep businesses open, with new central grants, flexibility on time to pay and sick pay support for SMEs. All this and more will help keep the economy open as we learn to live with the virus. However, Newton-Smith was critical that the travel sector was still “disappointingly out of scope” of the funding. She added: “If infection and hospitalisation rates continue to grow across the country, the potential of further measures will weigh on firms. The government must monitor the situation closely and ensure that any new restrictions go in lock-step with further targeted cashflow support to those firms most in distress across sectors impacted.” Scotland’s Hogmanay street parties are cancelled, while sporting events will be spectator-free for the next three weeks, as the Scottish government moves to reduce the risk of super-spreader events in the face of the far more transmissible Omicron variant, which now accounts for 62.9% of all cases. Nicola Sturgeon reassured the Scottish public they will not have to change their Christmas Day plans as she appealed to everyone to reduce contact and to stay at home as much as possible in advance of 25 December and after Christmas weekend The new rules will hit events such as Edinburgh’s annual Hogmanay street party, which was going ahead at a reduced capacity of 30,000. Sturgeon told MSPs that Omicron cases had increased by more than 50% in the past week – from more than 3,500 a day to almost 5,500 a day. While there were increases across all age groups the biggest – of 161% – was in 20- to 24-year-olds Sturgeon’s statement included some other changes: Non-professional indoor contact sports for adults should not take place during the three-week period from 26 December A requirement for table service only will be reintroduced for venues serving alcohol for consumption on the premises Indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be asked to ensure 1 metre distance, not within but between groups of people who are attending together People meeting indoors at home or in hospitality or leisure venues should be in groups of no more than three households Large-scale Hogmanay celebrations in Scotland are to be cancelled and live sports will be “effectively spectator-free” for three weeks from Boxing Day as the country introduces new restrictions on public events, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Omicron is now firmly established as the dominant strain of coronavirus in Scotland, the first Minister said. Updating MSPs, she said 62.9% of cases showed the S-gene dropout. She said: It is currently spreading rapidly across Scotland, and so the steep increase in infections that was predicted last week has now started to materialise. She said more restrictions were needed to slow the spread of the virus. Bereaved families have accused Boris Johnson of showing “flagrant disregard” for the public as ministers struggled to explain the justification for a wine and cheese event in Downing Street at the height of lockdown. A Cabinet Office inquiry into other alleged government parties in breach of Covid rules could be expanded after the Guardian published an image showing the prime minister alongside his wife and up to 17 staff in the Downing Street garden in May 2020. Amid growing fury over the photograph, Johnson said on Monday: “Those were meetings of people at work, talking about work.” Labour dismissed Downing Street’s explanation and said it amounted to evidence of law-breaking. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said the lack of any signs of work, with red wine and a cheeseboard visible rather than laptops or pens, showed Johnson “presided over a culture of believing that the rules applied only to other people”. Read more from my colleagues Peter Walker and Jamie Grierson here: The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who has taken on David Frost’s responsibilities as Brexit minister, has issued a statement following a first call with EU commissioner Maroš Šefčovič, with whom she will negotiate the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. She writes that UK government policy has not changed despite France and other EU member states calling for a reset in their relations following a rancorous period. Truss said: We want a constructive relationship with the EU, underpinned by trade and our shared belief in freedom and democracy. Resolving the current issues is critical to unleashing that potential. The UK position has not changed. We need goods to flow freely between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, end the role of the ECJ as the final arbiter of disputes between us, and resolve other issues. We must pick up the pace on talks in the New Year. Our preference remains to reach an agreed solution.“If this does not happen, we remain prepared to trigger Article 16 safeguards to deal with the very real problems faced in Northern Ireland and to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions. Responding to the chancellor’s funding announcement, bodies representing the travel industry have reacted with dismay to the news that the support package will not help travel businesses. Luke Petherbridge, the director of public affairs for travel trade organisation Abta, said: The chancellor’s statement today once again ignores the direct impact of Government policy decisions on businesses reliant on international travel. Travel agents, tour operators and travel management companies will rightly be asking why they haven’t been given the same treatment as other businesses that are suffering at this time. Average annual revenue across the travel industry is down by nearly 80% on pre-crisis levels even before Omicron emerged and the re-introduction of enhanced testing - both pre and post arrival - have added significant costs and notably dampened consumer demand. As the sector approaches what should be the peak sales period for booking holidays for summer 2022, businesses are instead facing another round of heart-breaking and demoralising cancellations, with no indication that the Government is listening to the challenges they are facing. Clive Wratten, the chief executive of the Business Travel Association, warned that travel companies had been left out of the government’s new financial support package. He said: It is devastating to see that once again business travel and its supply chain have been left out of government financial support. It’s imperative that the arts, hospitality and leisure are given help through the latest wave of the pandemic. However, a vital part of the UK economy and the driver behind global Britain is being left in the cold. We urgently need the Treasury to correct this oversight and support our industry into 2022. This is the only way for there to be a safe return to international travel when conditions allow. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has said Labour “will be going through the details” of the new measures for businesses, adding the government had been “dragged kicking and screaming” to announce them. “Support is welcome but we will be going through the details of this announcement to see which business and workers are included and excluded,” she tweeted, adding that Boris Johnson is too distracted by the revolt in his own party to act in the public interest. The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, tweeted: As (Rachel Reeves) says support is welcome, but I hope (Government) appreciate the problems they have caused by the gap between this announcement and the press conference last week. As we await further announcements from the (Government), reassurance is needed this won’t happen again. Representatives of businesses that run nightclubs, music venues and events have responded to Rishi Sunak’s support package calling it “inadequate”. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said newly-announced support for the culture sector was “far too little” and “borders on the insulting”. He said: Businesses are failing, people are losing their livelihoods and the industry is crippled. Mixed messaging, coupled with additional restrictions, have had a catastrophic impact on our sector over the last two weeks. At this critical point, we need strong leadership and a clear pathway from Government with a long-term strategy for new Covid variants. The open/close strategy is crucifying businesses. Every pound of help is much needed. But this package is far too little and borders on the insulting. Mark Davyd, founder and chief executive of Music Venue Trust, described the announcement of a further £30m for the government’s culture recovery fund this winter as “inadequate” to deal with the impact of rising cases on the sector. He said: We will need to see further details on the £30m package announced to support the cultural sector. Our initial response is that this funding seems detached from the reality. If correct, it would be inadequate to deal with the scale of the problem - we note that grassroots music venues are not even mentioned in the statement despite DCMS having all the evidence they need that losses in this sector alone will run to £22m by end of January. Not everyone is impressed by the £1bn bailout for businesses. The government needs to provide certainty, not just handouts for Covid, a business owner has said. Nathan Godley, of restaurant supplier Premier Seafoods, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: This time of year I need to know what I need for the restaurants and they are unsure what to tell me, and I am unsure what to tell my supplier. Fish doesn’t just go from the boat to the restaurant. There’s quite a few of us in this supply chain in between and we all need to know what is happening. Godley said he wanted an idea of how he could plan a week in advance, adding: “I don’t need any handouts. I am not asking for that. I am just asking for certainty.” Here’s some reaction to the news of the government’s support package for businesses hit by Covid restrictions. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said: This is a generous package building on existing hospitality support measures to provide an immediate emergency cash injection for those businesses who, through no fault of their own, have seen their most valuable trading period annihilated. It will help to secure jobs and business viability in the short term, particularly among small businesses in the sector, and we particularly welcome the boost to funds for the supply chain and event and business catering companies so badly affected by the reintroduction of work from home guidelines. Nicholls added there is a “real urgency” to get the funding to businesses. British Chambers of Commerce director general Shevaun Haviland said: These measures will provide some welcome respite to many of those businesses who have been hit hardest by the latest Covid measures. The chancellor and his team have engaged with us in talks over the past week, considered the experiences of chamber business communities and the proposals we put to them. We are pleased that the chancellor heard our call for additional grant funding for hospitality and leisure businesses, which will provide some much-needed support in the face of this increasingly difficult trading period. Clarity and speed will be needed to ensure that these grants are paid out swiftly to help these hard-pressed firms weather the next few weeks. Whilst these measures are a positive starting point, if restrictions persist or are tightened further, then we would need to see a wider support package, equal to the scale of any new measures, put in place. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chairman Mike Cherry said he hoped the measures would help small businesses facing hardship as a result of a decline in custom over Christmas. He said: These positive measures will help alleviate the intense pressures that small firms are currently under and hopefully arrest a significant decline in confidence over this year. With the prospect of one million people sick or self-isolating by January, we encouraged the Chancellor to bring back the Covid statutory sick pay rebate - we’re pleased to see our recommendation taken forward today. This move will reduce stress for small employers up and down the country, helping those who are struggling most with depleted cashflow. It’s vital that small firms - once again up against a massively disrupted festive season - can reclaim the costs of supporting staff. The government has also rightly taken forward other aspects of our 10-point plan, with £1bn worth of grant support for the hardest-hit sectors, alongside accelerated delivery of the business rates relief fund for supply chains launched months ago. The encouragement of HMRC to give as much breathing space as possible to small firms as we head towards tax return season will also come as a relief to many. We’ve always said that support needs to move in lockstep with restrictions and this intervention will help give small businesses confidence that this is the approach government will be taking. A bailout package worth about £1bn for businesses losing trade because of the Omicron surge was announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Tuesday. The funding will primarily help firms in the leisure and hospitality sector, and follows concerns that they have faced cancelled bookings and plummeting custom since the government implemented its Covid plan B. According to UKHospitality, many businesses have lost up to 60% of their trade in December, which is usually their most profitable month. Sunak said the government was intervening because “the spread of the Omicron variant means businesses in the hospitality and leisure sectors are facing huge uncertainty, at a crucial time”. The bailout package consists of four elements: Grants for hospitality and leisure businesses in England, worth up to £6,000 per premise. The Treasury has set aside £683m for these payments, which will be administered through local authorities and will be available in the coming weeks. Further grants for businesses in England, worth £102m, intended to help businesss most in need, and again administered through local authorities. The resumption of the statutory sick pay rebate scheme, which will reimburse employers in the UK with fewer than 250 workers for the cost of paying statutory sick pay for Covid-related absences for up to two weeks. An extra £30m for arts organisations in the UK, paid through the culture recovery fund. In addition, the Scottish government will receive £150m, the Welsh government £50m and the Northern Ireland executive £25m to offset the England-only spending. Read more from my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Richard Partington here: As the Omicron variant continues to spread throughout the country, most Britons seem to be taking matters into their own hands and self-policing in order to avoid catching Covid before the festive weekend, according to a survey conducted by Ipsos MORI. Here are some of the results of the survey: Nine in 10 (89%) say they have already or plan to wear their face mask more while the same proportion are already or will start sanitising/washing their hands more regularly. Eight in 10 (81%) are keeping or plan to keep their distance while socialising (such as not hugging or shaking hands with people), and a similar proportion have already or plan to have their booster jab (80%). Two-thirds say they have/will test themselves with lateral flow tests more regularly (67%) while the same proportion are shopping online rather than in store in order to avoid catching the virus. A majority of Britons are also taking matters into their own hands by avoiding public transport (58% have done so or plan to), not attending social gatherings in friends or family’s houses and not going to pubs or restaurants (both 57%). Just under half, 45% of workers say they are or are going to work from home instead of the office, while 47% that they have not/plan not to attend their work Christmas party. When asked to consider the restrictions currently in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus, just over four in ten say they are not strict enough (44%) while 36% say they are about right and another 16% that they are too strict. Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said of the findings: As the debate continues on the best approach to deal with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, Britons themselves say they are taking steps to avoid a Covid Christmas, such as wearing masks, washing hands and keeping their distance when socialising – and many are planning to get a booster jab if they haven’t already got one. Around four in ten say they have avoided social gatherings at others’ houses or going to pubs and restaurants, and another one in six say they plan to do so. Few expect there to be a quick return to normality, and on the restrictions themselves as throughout the pandemic most people think they are about right or not strict enough – only a small minority (although a slightly increasing one) think they are too strict. But views are split – not quite half think the restrictions are not strict enough, and there is a clear age divide, with older people more in favour of tighter restrictions than the young. The cabinet office minister, Stephen Barclay, has said imposing plan B Covid measures in England has caused ‘significant behaviour change’ to consumers’ habits, adding that the Treasury will respond to the concerns of businesses later on Tuesday. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Barclay said implementing more restrictions would come at a ‘very significant economic cost’. David Deans of BBC Wales has shared a letter written by Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies. Davies is calling for a recall of the Senedd and has complained that MSs should have the chance to debate and vote on new restrictions during recess. Although Nicola Sturgeon has assured the Scottish public they will not have to change their Christmas Day plans, the country’s Hogmanay celebrations hang in the balance today. The cabinet is considering this morning whether to cancel largescale events including Hogmanay street parties, concerts and sporting fixtures, before the first minister’s regular Covid statement to Holyrood just after 2pm. Wales has already announced plans to close nightclubs and to hold sporting events without crowds from Boxing Day. One major concern is Edinburgh’s annual Hogmanay street party, which is currently going ahead at a reduced capacity of 30,000, who must show evidence of a negative lateral flow test to attend the ticketed event. Yesterday London mayor Sadiq Khan cancelled a New Year event for 6,500 key workers and members of the public in Trafalgar Square. The announcement comes as the row between devolved government and the UK Treasury over Covid funding continues. Sturgeon was described as “utterly incredulous” to discover that neither the Prime Minister nor the Chancellor were on Sunday’s Cobra call with the devolved nations to discuss a further funding package. She has made it clear that she favour more significant and immediate restrictions but points out that her government, with no borrowing powers, cannot offer the necessary compensation for such closures. The Treasury announced further funding to devolved governments at the start of the week, but it remains unclear whether this is “new” cash or an advance of money already budgeted for. All sporting events in Wales will be held behind closed doors from Boxing Day due to the surge in coronavirus cases, the Welsh government has announced. The economy minister, Vaughan Gething, announced the new measures for both indoor and outdoor sporting events in a bid to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. The measures mean that a number of events, including the Welsh Grand National, football and rugby union fixtures, will be closed to spectators. Sporting events over the Christmas period are one of the big highlights of the year. Unfortunately, the new Omicron variant is a significant development in the pandemic and could cause a large number of infections,. We need to do everything we can to protect people’s health and control the spread of this awful virus. Throughout the pandemic we have followed scientific and public health advice to keep people safe. The advice is clear – we need to act now in response to the threat of Omicron. We are giving people as much notice of these decisions as we can. Crowds will come back as soon as possible. We want everyone to be here to enjoy their favourite sports. Read the full story here: What new measures are thought to be under consideration in England? The prime minister is understood to be considering three options to curb the spread of Omicron. The least restrictive would be asking the public to limit social mixing, without legal enforcement. This would bring England into line with measures in place in Scotland, where people have been advised to reduce their socialising and limit gatherings to three households. A step up from this would be mandatory restrictions on household mixing, the return of social distancing, and forcing pubs and restaurants to close at 8pm. The third option is a return to full lockdown, or something like it, with a two-week “circuit breaker” rumoured to be on the cards. Boris Johnson said on Friday he was not “closing things down”, but increasing pressures on the NHS may prompt a rethink. Given Omicron’s transmissibility, would 2-metre social distancing make a difference? Although Omicron appears to be more transmissible than previous variants, the fundamental mechanisms for transmission probably remain the same – the virus is emitted in aerosols and droplets from breathing, talking, singing, coughing and sneezing. Cath Noakes, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and a professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, said: “We don’t yet know whether people with Omicron emit more virus or whether the balance of transmission at close proximity versus through the air at a longer distance has changed. But regardless, the concentration of aerosols and droplets is always greater at closer distance and hence physical distancing remains an important measure. “However, we know from experience throughout the pandemic – not just Omicron – that in many environments, 2-metre distancing on its own is not enough, and people can be infected when they share a poorly ventilated room with each other.” Another advantage of 2-metre distancing is that it restricts the number of people in indoor settings, reducing the chances of an infectious person being present – and the number of people they could transmit the virus to. For the same reason, the return of social distancing would be extremely bad news for hospitality businesses. Read the answers to more frequently asked questions here: There have been questions about whether parliament could be recalled from their break in time before Christmas day, but my colleague Andrew Sparrow points out that actually in theory, they could be called back to make a decision about Covid restrictions on the day itself: More museums have been forced to close due to the surge in cases of Covid-19. On Monday it emerged that at least five national museums, including the Natural History Museum and Edinburgh Castle were shutting their doors because of Covid-related staff absences. Several other attractions have also announced they have closed, or will close, early. They include London’s Museum of the Home, the Bexhill Museum, the Richmond Museum, and the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum (Sofo) in Woodstock. In a tweet Sofo said: “We’ve had to move to a #PlanB of our own - we now close from 5pm Sunday 19th December 2021.” The museum of the Home has announced it will close on Wednesday and will not reopen until 4 January. The museum of Richmond said it had decided to close for the festive season “earlier than planned”. Bexhill Museum, meanwhile, has closed until Boxing Day when it plans to reopen at 11am. A total of 764 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending December 10 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is down 4% on the previous week and is the lowest number of deaths since the week to October 15, when the total was 713. Around one in 16 (6.4%) of all deaths registered in England and Wales in the week to December 10 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. Some 65 care home resident deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales were registered in the week to December 10, down slightly from 67 in the previous week. In total, 44,406 care home residents in England and Wales have had Covid-19 recorded on their death certificate since the pandemic began. The ONS figures cover deaths of care home residents in all settings, not just in care homes. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has tested positive for Covid, he has announced on Twitter. He said he fell ill after returning from London last week. The UK government borrowed £17.4bn in November, outstripping economists’ predictions and suggesting debt could far overshoot officials’ forecasts if the Omicron coronavirus variant slows the economy as expected. It was the highest November borrowing since comparable records began 30 years ago, barring last year. During the furlough scheme last year, the Treasury under Rishi Sunak set successive peacetime records for monthly borrowing as it covered the costs of 80% of salaries for millions of people as well as support schemes for businesses. Significant borrowing has continued in 2021, with £136bn borrowed between April and November, according to data published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics. That was the second highest since records began in 1993. It’s Rishi Sunak, not the Bank of England, who needs to act to get the UK’s economy firing againCarys RobertsRead more The November borrowing was higher than the £16bn a poll of economists by Reuters predicted. Higher debt interest costs of £4.6bn and increased spending on the vaccine programme and test and trace contributed to the higher figure. Government borrowing is likely to come under further scrutiny in the coming months from within the Conservative party. Public sector net debt – the amount borrowed over the years – was £2.3tn at the end of November, or 96.1% of GDP. That was the highest debt-to-GDP ratio since March 1963, when it was 98.3%. Read more here: The Treasury is set to respond today to concerns of businesses suffering financially from the latest Covid wave, a minister has said, while a leading scientist has added that the country is facing the most uncertain period of the pandemic since March 2020. The cabinet office minister Steve Barclay said that, even though at cabinet on Monday ministers held back from a decision to press ahead with further restrictions, the plan B measures already implemented were having an impact. Barclay told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We’re acutely aware that, as a consequence of plan B, we have seen significant behaviour change. You see that for example, in restaurant bookings. That is why the chancellor [Rishi Sunak] has been engaging with industry leaders. Barclay said Sunak was talking to industry figures about their financial predicament and the government would be saying more about this issue later on Tuesday. Barclay also said, in a separate interview, that the government was “keen to keep businesses open” and and that hospitality firms “should continue to plan for the bookings they have”. Read the full story here: “Infighting” and “jockeying” for the Conservative leadership has taken over from Covid decision-making, Labour has said. Asked by Times Radio whether the government has provided clarity by saying that decisions on new restrictions will be taken at a later date, Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said this is not the case. She said: Most of the read-outs from those meetings and the rumours that have spread since suggest that really this is about disagreement within a group of senior conservatives, jockeying for position to be the next leader of the Conservative Party rather than actually soberly looking at the evidence both health and economic evidence and taking a decision. We do need a Government right now that is now focused on the national interest, not infighting within the Conservative Party. Dodds also said Labour would “follow the evidence” if it was in power, pointing to decision-making by the Welsh Labour government based on the latest scientific advice. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a former member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, has told the Today programme “each of us can do things today that will make the chance of further restrictions lighter”. He added: Omicron is spreading unbelievably fast. It is a phenomenal variant transmission. There is great uncertainty about what is it going to lead to in terms of pressure on the health system, people going to hospital, particularly people dying, but also what impact is it going to have on the broader society, staff absences, the ability to have functioning other services, so there is great uncertainty. My personal view is that I think we can wait at the moment until there are more restrictions formally placed. A top scientist has said we “cannot afford to cross our fingers and hope this crisis blows over” as the Omicron variant of Covid-19 spreads across the world. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome, said in a statement: “As we have learned from the very beginning of this pandemic, it’s better to act sooner than later.” He said it was essential that governments act “swiftly and accordingly, paying close attention to the data”. To bring Omicron under any form of control, he said, it’s critical that transmission is slowed. If not, we could see profound impacts on health systems but also across sectors such as education, hospitality, public transport, police and essential national infrastructure as infections prevent people from working. No country can afford to think they are an exception. It is staggering and deeply frustrating that two years into this pandemic – when we have gathered so much evidence and made huge scientific progress – that governments are still not anticipating events and acting early or working together anywhere near the scale that is required. He also warned that the government shouldn’t just focus on domestic issues but think about the bigger picture in order to get Covid under control. He said: Without a truly global response, where we urgently increase access to tests, treatments and vaccines in all countries – not just those with buying power – we cannot expect to achieve lasting recovery. Global leaders had indicated through pledges they understand the problem, but all too often these remain just that – pledges. We are far beyond the time for warm words. Countries around the world cannot afford to wait for high-income nations to act on their promises. We can do better. We must do better. At the same time, we must invest far more now in next generation therapeutics and vaccines, ones that not only stop sickness and death, but also prevent transmission and work against potential new variants. Next year, we must do what we have so far failed to do – we must get ahead of this pandemic and break this vicious reactive cycle. There would be “economic consequences” to further Covid restrictions, a minister has stated as he said Parliament is not yet due to be recalled to discuss new measures. Steve Barclay told BBC Breakfast: The prime minister has given a commitment that where there are additional regulations bought forward that parliament would be recalled in order that members of parliament can scrutinise and debate those issues, but we are not at that stage. We are looking closely at the data and we need to recognise there are economic consequences to further restrictions. There is much that we still don’t know but we are still looking at that data on what are very finely-balanced decisions. Barclay said people should have a “cautious” Christmas, according to a government minister who has changed his own plans. He told LBC he had downsized the number of family members at his Christmas celebrations this year, with only his in-laws attending. The cabinet office minister said: We are saying to people that they should continue with Christmas but do so in a cautious way. That is what I will be doing with my own family. We can all protect our families and friends by having the booster. When asked what a cautious Christmas is, he added: “I think it is thinking about how many people we need to see. Some of my family won’t be coming over at Christmas. My wife’s parents will be joining us but others will not.” New Covid restrictions are unlikely to be imposed before Christmas amid deep cabinet divisions but Boris Johnson warned further measures remain on the table, with data on the threat of Omicron monitored “hour by hour”. The prime minister was accused of failing to follow scientists’ advice on the need for immediate restrictions while leaving millions of people and businesses in limbo after a two-hour cabinet meeting ended with no decision on Monday. During the meeting, scientific advisers briefed ministers on the latest data including a steep rise in hospitalisations in London, with the UK’s highest number of Omicron cases, while 91,743 people tested positive for Covid on Monday across the UK. Afterwards, the prime minister said the arguments for and against stricter measures were “finely balanced” and the situation was “extremely difficult”. Read the full story by my colleagues Aubrey Allegretti, Peter Walker and Sarah Butler from last night here: The effect that lockdowns have on people’s lives is as bad as going to hospital, Sir Iain Duncan Smith has warned amid the rise of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and uncertainty over whether or not new restrictions will be brought in. The former leader of the conservative party told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We need to understand the effect of lockdown is dramatic across so many areas of people’s lives, which equates to the same as people going into hospital. He said the government to make a decision about further restrictions only when there is a “wider range of information on the effect of lockdown”. Duncan Smith said: We do not want to end up where we were last Christmas and we do have a significantly vaccinated population and that has a huge effect on hospitalisation, so we are under different circumstances than we were last January. Scientists have said waiting to implement further restrictions until the new year would “almost certainly be too late to have a material impact on the epidemic”. The prime minister announced after a cabinet meeting that he would not be introducing any further Covid restrictions for now, adding: “The situation is extremely difficult and the arguments either way are very, very finely balanced.” Yet, with Omicron infections currently doubling within 48 hours in most regions of the UK, the country may already have reached a ceiling where the rate of growth begins to fall and case numbers plateau. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. believes that point could come within days, with or without interventions. “If we implement control measures now, they are unlikely to be sufficient to reverse the growth, only slow it,” he said. “But there may still be benefits in slowing the peak, in terms of flattening the curve.” One solution that appears to be on the table is a return to the “step 2” measures introduced as part of the roadmap out of lockdown earlier this year – chiefly, people only being allowed to socialise indoors with members of their household or a support bubble, and outdoor socialising being limited to groups of six people or two households, including at pubs and restaurants. Prof Christina Pagel, the director of UCL’s clinical operational research unit, said: Waiting for definitive evidence that it could cause the NHS to be overwhelmed will be too late to avert the crisis. Instead, the government should follow Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] advice and return to step 2 of the roadmap immediately to prevent thousands of infections over the coming days and then monitor the situation hour by hour so that measures can be lifted as quickly as possible, hopefully even in time to enable limited household mixing over Christmas weekend. Read the full story here: The government will “say more” about its discussions with business leaders calling for more Covid financial support later today, a minister has said. When asked about measures to help businesses struggling this Christmas due to Covid restrictions, cabinet office minister Steve Barclay told BBC Breakfast: The chancellor was talking to industry leaders about this very issue last night. We will say more about this later today. We recognise obviously we are keen to keep businesses open and businesses should continue to plan for the bookings they have. We absolutely recognise that through Plan B and the behaviour change there has been an impact on those bookings. The government will “look closely at the data” about whether or not to have a circuit-breaker lockdown after Christmas, a minister has said. When asked if the measure was being considered, cabinet office minister Steve Barclay told LBC Radio: We are looking closely at the data, there is much we still don’t know about the severity of Omicron, how it leads to hospital admissions. We are looking particularly at the London data, there is a higher prevalence of Omicron particularly in London. Asked if he had been among members of the cabinet calling for more data before new restrictions were introduced, Barclay said: I think it is right that the cabinet has a full and robust discussion. That is what people would expect. It is right that we look at the balance between protecting lives and livelihoods. Steve Barclay told BBC Breakfast that the prime minister has given a commitment that where there are additional regulations bought forward that parliament would be recalled in order that MPs can scrutinise and debate those issues, but he added: “We are not at that stage”. He said: We are looking closely at the data and we need to recognise there are economic consequences to further restrictions. There is much that we still don’t know but we are still looking at that data on what are very finely-balanced decisions. Meanwhile, scientists have reacted with dismay to Boris Johnson’s decision not to impose fresh restrictions to curb the spread of Omicron, emphasising that waiting until the new year would “almost certainly be too late to have a material impact on the epidemic”."

          "headline": "UK government borrowing surges again as Covid cases soar",
          "bodyText": "The UK government borrowed £17.4bn in November, outstripping economists’ predictions and suggesting debt could far overshoot officials’ forecasts if the Omicron coronavirus variant slows the economy as expected. It was the highest November borrowing since comparable records began 30 years ago, barring last year. During the furlough scheme in 2020, the Treasury under Rishi Sunak set successive peacetime records for monthly borrowing as it covered the costs of 80% of salaries for millions of people as well as support schemes for businesses. Significant borrowing has continued in 2021, with £136bn borrowed between April and November, with the vaccine and test-and-trace programmes adding to costs, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That was the second highest since records began in 1993. The November borrowing was higher than the £16bn a poll of economists by Reuters predicted. The government spent £32bn during November, £2bn more than it did a year before, thanks in part to spending on the vaccine programme and test and trace. Those costs are likely to rise in the coming months after the government raced to accelerate the uptake of booster jabs to try to reduce the number of hospitalisations in the Omicron wave. Rising inflation also drove higher debt interest costs of £4.6bn. Higher inflation raises borrowing costs because the government issues some of its debt via inflation-linked bonds, the returns of which follow the retail price index (RPI) measure. Annual RPI inflation – acknowledged by authorities to be a flawed measure – hit 7.1% in November, far above the 5.1% rate of consumer price index inflation. Government borrowing is likely to come under further scrutiny in the coming months from within the Conservative party. Public sector net debt – the amount borrowed over the years – was £2.3tn at the end of November, or 96.1% of GDP. That was the highest debt-to-GDP ratio since March 1963, when it was 98.3%. Sunak and the Treasury are thought to have pushed back against proposals for more coronavirus restrictions partly because of the cost to the government of reintroducing financial support for businesses that would be forced to close, and officials have previously briefed about the costs of regular booster jabs. Yet businesses have argued that they are suffering from a quasi-lockdown anyway, with customers deserting crowded spaces in order to avoid catching coronavirus before Christmas. Sunak on Wednesday revealed an extra £1bn in spending to help affected businesses. In his budget in October, Sunak said he wanted to cut borrowing from 7.9% of GDP in the current financial year, which ends in April, to 3.3% next year. However, the arrival of the Omicron variant is likely to slow GDP growth and to lower tax receipts, as people spend much less in pubs and restaurants. That will mean that official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility are likely to have underestimated the amount the government will need to borrow to cover spending in the coming year. Bethany Beckett, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: “These data predate the recent surge in coronavirus infections caused by the Omicron variant, with a near-term tightening of virus restrictions once again a possibility. Although the economy has got better at coping with restrictions with each new wave, we still suspect it would prompt a deterioration in the public finances via lower tax revenues and the potential reintroduction of government support schemes.” The ONS has revised down borrowing over the financial year so far by £9bn, but Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said it was “likely to overshoot the OBR’s forecast” of £183bn. The drop in borrowing between November 2020 and November 2021 was the smallest so far this fiscal year, despite the absence of the furlough scheme, Tombs said. He also pointed out that tax receipts rose more slowly than anticipated by the forecaster, and that “the trend in public borrowing is about to deteriorate markedly” with slower economic growth likely."

          "bodyText": "Democrats will keep working on Joe Biden’s Build Back Better spending plan “until we get something done”, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer told colleagues on Monday – a day after a stunning move by Joe Manchin of West Virginia drew accusations of betrayal from the White House and seemed to leave the president’s agenda dead in the water. In a letter to colleagues, Schumer wrote: “We are going to vote on a revised version of the House-passed Build Back Better Act – and we will keep voting on it until we get something done.” He also put senators on notice that they will “consider voting rights legislation as early as the first week back” next month, a timeline for another part of Biden’s agenda and an olive branch to disillusioned progressives. Build Back Better had been delayed as the White House and Democrats in Congress sought accommodation with Manchin and fellow centrist Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, key votes in a Senate split 50-50 and controlled by Vice-President Kamala Harris. In his letter, Schumer spoke of “moments of deep discontent and frustration” before Manchin’s decision to use Fox News Sunday to say he was a “no” on the spending plan, which is valued at about $1.75tn and would expand health and social care and seek to combat the climate crisis, among other priorities. Manchin cited the cost of the plan and worries including inflation, the debt and the Omicron coronavirus variant, and said: “I’ve always said this ... if I can’t go home and explain it to the people of West Virginia, I can’t vote for it. “I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can’t. I’ve tried everything humanly possible. I can’t get there … This is a no on this piece of legislation. I have tried everything I know to do.” Manchin also put out a statement. The White House responded with a fierce rebuke, accusing the senator of going back on his word – an accusation reportedly included at Biden’s insistence. In a local radio interview on Monday, Manchin said he had reached “wit’s end” over the negotiations but refused to blame Biden either for the talks breaking down or for the angry statement. “This is not the president, this is staff … they drove some things that are absolutely inexcusable,” he told West Virginia Radio, without further explanation. “I just got to the wit’s end of what happened.” Manchin also claimed to have been “far apart, philosophically” with Democratic leaders for months. “We’re in a 50-50 Senate, you all are approaching legislation [like] there is 55 or 60 Democrats,” he said. On Monday, Schumer said Manchin’s move would not “deter us from continuing to try to find a way forward”. Listing provisions including a child tax credit, he said: “We were elected to address these many needs and we will not stop fighting until we do.” Also on Monday, the progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, attacked Manchin’s “betrayal of working class families” but said she did “not believe the situation is beyond repair”. Speaking to MSNBC, she said the White House and Democratic leaders had the tools to move legislation. “It’s really about time we take the kid gloves off and we start using them to govern for working families in this country,” she said. “Our leadership needs to step up. It takes the president of the United States, who I believe needs to be more forceful on the filibuster, he also needs to lean on his executive authority and say, ‘If you’re going to get in the way, we’re going to find other ways to do it. You’re either with us or not, but this train is moving.’” Ocasio-Cortez said it was a “farce” that Manchin held so much sway. “This idea that we can just go on Fox News and legislate through television … and threaten to vote no is unacceptable.” Goldman Sachs lowered its US GDP growth forecast, as did Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, following Manchin’s move. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said on Monday afternoon that she would not “relitigate” Manchin’s announcement of opposition on Sunday and her subsequent statement that was sharply critical of him. Manchin holds one card which would change the rules of the game. Should he decide to switch parties – thereby ceasing to be the only Democrat in high office in a state that voted solidly for Donald Trump – Republicans would regain control of the Senate. Some analysts doubt Manchin would take such a drastic step but concede that his stance makes it harder for Democrats to know the best way forward. On Monday, the website Axios cited “people close to” Manchin as saying if he did leave the party, he would probably become an independent but still caucus with the Democrats. In his radio interview, Manchin was asked if there was still a place for him inside the Democratic party. He said he “would like to hope there was still Democrats that feel like I do”, but added that could change, CNN’s Manu Raju, tweeted. Schumer’s pronouncement that the Senate would consider voting rights legislation next month is also significant because it indicates a stronger line on reforming the filibuster, which requires 60-vote majorities for most legislation. Manchin and Sinema are both opposed to changes. Schumer said continued Republican opposition to voting rights efforts – guaranteed given it is being pushed in answer to Republican moves to restrict voting and make it easier to overturn elections – would prompt consideration of filibuster reform. “Members will be given the chance to debate on the Senate floor and cast a vote so that their choice…is clear and available for everyone to see.” Reuters contributed reporting"

          "bodyText": "Last week’s £264m penalty and criminal conviction for NatWest for money-laundering failures still takes the prize for the most spectacular collapse we’ve seen in years in a bank’s controls department. The saga, almost unbelievably, involved black bin bags, stuffed with as much as £700,000, getting through the system. But more mundane control failures also count, and Standard Chartered, the Asian-focused but London-listed bank, limped into view on Monday with a £46.5m fine from the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority. It’s a thumping penalty in its own right – the biggest imposed by the PRA acting in a solo capacity – and, beyond the dry technicalities of US dollar liquidity reporting requirements, one can understand why the regulator is annoyed. The problem wasn’t just the size of Standard Chartered’s spreadsheet errors, which in one case amounted to $10bn, according to the PRA. It was also the fact that the bank seems to have taken a relaxed view of its obligation to report material mistakes promptly. The delay was four months in one instance. A regulator charged with keeping the system safe understandably takes a dim view of a failure to be “open and cooperative”; it needs accurate and timely data. Standard Chartered’s shareholders also have a right to grumble. It’s now six years since Bill Winters arrived as a hot-shot chief executive, declaring he would invigorate the bank by sweeping away complexities and put previous regulatory entanglements in the past. On his watch, the share price has gone nowhere and growth is perpetually promised around the next corner. Collecting a large fine from the PRA rather sums up an underwhelming run. More broadly, one can applaud what may be a new regulatory zeal to be tougher with banks on controls and reporting processes. HBSC was hit with a £64m penalty from the Financial Conduct Authority for “serious weaknesses” in anti-money laundering processes last year. If the intent is to force superbly paid boardrooms to pay attention to detail, so much the better. Some of the failures sound shockingly basic. Ex-Tesco boss looks a good fit for GSK consumer division Even Elliott Management, trying to stir things up in the wings, surely can’t find much to grumble about in the appointment of Sir Dave Lewis to chair GlaxoSmithKline’s soon-to-be-demerged consumer division, which owns brands such as Advil, Centrum vitamins, Panadol and Sensodyne. Lewis is ex-Unilever, a company with which GSK’s consumer division will be compared, and, while his six years as chief executive of Tesco didn’t do much for the share price, he restored stability after the supermarket chain’s wild years. He hasn’t chaired a public company, but never mind. The high-profile appointment is also a reminder that the business, which will get a name by the time it is launched in independent form in the middle of next year, is a big operation. If the City analysts’ estimates of £45bn-plus are correct, it’ll be a top-15 FTSE 100 company with a market capitalisation more than twice that of Tesco. Size is perhaps the reason why Elliott’s call for GSK to consider offers for the business has failed to drum up interest. From the point of view of the renewal of the UK stock market, however, that’s a good thing. A demerger isn’t quite a new arrival, but a large new listing adds variety. And do not be surprised if the predicted rate of sales growth, a critical metric for global consumer companies, eclipses Unilever’s. WEF moving from Davos to Zoom could raise its credibility The last gathering of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos took place in January 2020 and is mostly recalled for then-president Trump’s declaration that the new coronavirus was nothing to worry about. “It’s one person coming in from China,” he said, soon after the first case had been detected in the US. “We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” Now next month’s Davos meeting has been postponed in the face of the inevitable, just as last January’s was. There’ll be a “digital convening” of business leaders, politicians and the usual crew of billionaires instead. Actually, the new set-up sounds like an excellent permanent arrangement. Pre-Covid, it was impossible to take seriously a discussion about global inequality (to take one regular Davos theme) when it was happening in an elite Swiss ski resort with key speakers flown in by private jet. After Covid, a Zoom-only affair would be a small step towards restoring credibility."

          "headline": "Approval of new Covid jab raises hopes of persuading Germany’s unvaccinated",
          "bodyText": "The approval of a new protein-based Covid-19 vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has led to hopes that it could play an important role in persuading millions of Germans who have refused jabs from existing vaccines to get protection against the disease this winter. The EMA approved the two-dose Novavax vaccine on Monday afternoon. The German government’s vaccination advisory board is expected to follow suit and allow for its use soon, a move that would be welcomed by health experts who are bracing for a huge and imminent wave of infections caused by the new Omicron variant. The first doses of Novavax are expected to be administered in Germany in the new year. The rollout of the vaccine – called Nuvaxovid – by the US-based drugmaker Novavax has been repeatedly hampered by a series of lengthy delays including production issues. It is making its appearance in the battle against the virus about a year after the novel mRNA vaccines produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and the viral vector vaccines made by Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. While those four simulate a virus in the body, Nuvaxovid uses a more traditional type of technology. It has been found to have an efficacy of over 90% in preventing symptomatic infection with the Alpha variant, and is currently undergoing further tests to check its ability to protect against the Omicron variant. Reluctance in Germany and other German-speaking countries to take the novel mRNA vaccines is put down to mistrust in the new technology, with people mainly citing safety concerns about side-effects or long-term health impacts, largely because of the apparent speed with which they were introduced. In fact, the number of side-effects suffered has been very low despite the billions who have already taken the vaccines worldwide, as the head of the Robert Koch Institute, the German government’s disease control agency, has repeatedly said. The new Covid jabs made by Novavax and the French-Austrian manufacturer Valneva, whose VLA2001 is also based on the more conventional method, are typically characterised as a Totimpfstoff, or “dead vaccine”, even though experts say the term is not scientifically accurate. In November, Karl Lauterbach, the then health spokesperson for the Social Democratic party, who has since become the health minister, said that because of the popular use of the term “dead vaccine” among vaccine-hesitant Germans, the term would also generally be applied by health experts. The Nuvaxovid vaccine is more accurately described as a protein vaccine, which in contrast to classical vaccines is genetically produced and contains minuscule particles from a version of the virus’s spike protein grown in moth cells in the laboratory that prompt the formation of antibodies in an individual. Valneva, which is still waiting for approval, is made up of Covid-19 virus that has been deactivated and cannot reproduce. Both vaccines require the addition of a so-called proprietary adjuvant to boost the recipient’s immune response to them. The EU has secured 100m doses of Novavax and 60m doses of Valneva, with 4m Novavax doses immediately destined for Germany. Across Europe, but in particular in Germany, experts are hoping that both vaccines will have the effect of persuading those who have so far turned down the offer of a vaccine to change their minds, at a time when raising immunity levels by vaccination is one of the key weapons against halting the virus’s spread. So far, just over 70% of Germans are fully vaccinated. Unless this figure climbs to between 80 to 90%, the nation’s immunity will not be high enough to dampen the virus. In a survey by the German pollster Forsa this autumn, 56% of participants said their vaccine willingness would rise if vaccines based on so-called “classical methods”, such as Novavax and Valneva, were approved. Only 5% said they would be lured to have a vaccination by monetary reward or the threat of being excluded from activities as a result of their unvaccinated status. About 14 million German adults are yet to have the first two doses of a Covid vaccine. However, in a survey of unvaccinated people, 40% said they were merely hesitant and could indeed be persuaded if “dead vaccines” were available to them. Nevertheless, experts have warned against expecting a significant rise in those willing to receive Novavax or Valneva jabs. Dr Thomas Aßmann, a GP and vaccinator in Lindlar, about 30km (19 miles) east of Cologne, said: “I am a bit sceptical. If we take into account that the new mRNA vaccines they are fearful of have now been successfully administered around 7 to 8 billion times, I am concerned that those who say they’re holding out for the ‘classic’ vaccines will now look at the figures and say Novavax can’t be trusted yet,” he told the broadcaster NTV. “We must just hope that the new vaccine is good and stable and have a long efficacy, particularly against Omicron.” Even Lauterbach, whose first two weeks in office have been dominated by his attempts to accelerate a vaccine drive, particularly booster shots, ahead of the expected emergence of Omicron as the main variant in Germany from around the end of the year, is sceptical. “We should desist from assuming that Novavax will be a gamechanger,” he told the Bild newspaper in an hour-long interview broadcast live on Sunday night. He said based on studies and the fact that the mRNA vaccines had been administered between 7bn and 8bn times worldwide, they were “a whole lot safer”. Confronted in the interview by a woman whose gynaecologist had urged her she should not get vaccinated because of a risk of thrombosis, Lauterbach shot back: “I would advise her to get a second opinion.” Lauterbach has said he backs a proposal that is expected to be put before the Bundestag in January to bring in a nationwide vaccine mandate. He acknowledged the importance of enabling those who wanted a traditional vaccine to be able to access it before the introduction of any such measure."

          "headline": "What Covid rules are being considered to tackle Omicron in England?",
          "bodyText": "What new measures are thought to be under consideration in England? The prime minister is understood to be considering three options to curb the spread of Omicron. The least restrictive would be asking the public to limit social mixing, without legal enforcement. This would bring England into line with measures in place in Scotland, where people have been advised to reduce their socialising and limit gatherings to three households. A step up from this would be mandatory restrictions on household mixing, the return of social distancing, and forcing pubs and restaurants to close at 8pm. The third option is a return to full lockdown, or something like it, with a two-week “circuit breaker” rumoured to be on the cards. Boris Johnson said on Friday he was not “closing things down”, but increasing pressures on the NHS may prompt a rethink. Given Omicron’s transmissibility, would 2-metre social distancing make a difference? Although Omicron appears to be more transmissible than previous variants, the fundamental mechanisms for transmission probably remain the same – the virus is emitted in aerosols and droplets from breathing, talking, singing, coughing and sneezing. Cath Noakes, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and a professor of environmental engineering for buildings at the University of Leeds, said: “We don’t yet know whether people with Omicron emit more virus or whether the balance of transmission at close proximity versus through the air at a longer distance has changed. But regardless, the concentration of aerosols and droplets is always greater at closer distance and hence physical distancing remains an important measure. “However, we know from experience throughout the pandemic – not just Omicron – that in many environments, 2-metre distancing on its own is not enough, and people can be infected when they share a poorly ventilated room with each other.” Another advantage of 2-metre distancing is that it restricts the number of people in indoor settings, reducing the chances of an infectious person being present – and the number of people they could transmit the virus to. For the same reason, the return of social distancing would be extremely bad news for hospitality businesses. How much impact would indoor mixing and hospitality rules have? Mrinank Sharma at the University of Oxford and colleagues recently modelled the effectiveness of 17 Covid-19 measures implemented during Europe’s second wave, and found that restaurant, pub and cafe closures had a large effect, with an estimated reduction in the reproduction (R) number of 12%. Closing nightclubs, or non-essential retail and services such as hairdressers and beauty salons, similarly reduced the R number by roughly 12% each, highlighting the potential risks of brief but very numerous indoor contacts. Closing leisure and entertainment venues such as zoos, museums and theatres had only a small effect – approximately 3%. Sharma said: “We’d expect measures on indoor mixing and hospitality to have strong effect sizes, especially since there are few restrictions at present and transmission is much more likely indoors than outdoors. The stronger the measure, the stronger the reduction in transmission.” Together, the Oxford team estimated a ban on all gatherings and the closure of all non-essential businesses would reduce the R number by approximately 52%. What difference to cases, hospitalisations and deaths would it make to enforce measures before Christmas Day rather than 27 December? With Omicron cases doubling every one-and-a-half to two days, each day counts. Yet whereas the Netherlands has reacted to the new wave of infections by imposing a nationwide lockdown effective from Monday, England has adopted a wait-and-see approach until now. Although this policy is understandable from a societal point of view, it may result in measures being introduced too late to avoid huge pressures on health services, should hospital admissions rise consistently, said Hans Heesterbeek, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. “I think we have now learned that we should not wait until we know for certain either way, and that half-hearted measures are not sufficient,” Heesterbeek said. “Acting now decisively, however painful to society, is therefore probably the best approach.” Sharma said: “Five days’ difference of interventions could make a large difference to the numbers of cases in the coming weeks. In general, there is little room for manoeuvre.” However, he added that since the severity of Omicron remained unknown, the effect on deaths and hospitalisations was even more unclear. “It is also unclear whether interventions would reduce R below one, or delay the spread,” he said. Prof Rowland Kao of the University of Edinburgh said: “Broadly speaking, Omicron is doubling in terms of the numbers of cases, roughly every two to three days. This pattern has been consistent since the first rise in cases was seen in November. “Voluntary changes in behaviour and the recent recommendations and requirements from government may slow this down, but there is as yet no evidence to quantify it. If the doubling pattern holds, a four-day delay may mean two to four times worse of a problem.” Are mandatory curbs more effective than strongly worded advice? Public compliance tends to be strong when measures are mandated by law. Not only is there the fear of judgment, or being reported to the authorities, there is also less room for interpretation by individuals. Dr Nilu Ahmed, a psychologist at the University of Bristol, said: “When you have suggestions and very strong recommendations, it means that it’s up to the public to interpret that, and it can put a huge amount of pressure on individuals, because not everyone will interpret it in the same way. “Right now, there are people who don’t want to go and meet family for Christmas, and there are family members who are saying, ‘Well, the law allows it and we might go into another lockdown post-Christmas, so if we’re going to do it, we have to do it now’. That amount of pressure can be really exhausting and cause high levels of anxiety and mental health issues.” Whether mandatory restrictions would be as effective as they were earlier in the pandemic remains to be seen. Images of Downing Street parties and senior politicians or advisers not following their own regulations and laws could result in a backlash if rules were introduced, Ahmed said. “We behave in the ways that our social group behaves, and so if we see if there’s a law prohibiting us from getting together, then we can’t really be the one to break the law – unless everyone else is doing it.”"

          "bodyText": "The first death of a child with Covid-19 in New Zealand has prompted calls for Māori children to be prioritised in the next stage of the vaccine rollout, as the country grapples with racial inequalities compounded by the pandemic. A Māori boy, under the age of 10 and who had tested positive for the virus, died last week, becoming the youngest New Zealander to die with Covid, the Ministry of Health confirmed. It is unclear whether Covid-19 was the cause of the boy’s death, as New Zealand records all deaths of people considered active Covid cases in its official count. It is the country’s 49th death of a Covid-positive person since the start of the pandemic. Māori make up an estimated 17.1% of the population but they have accounted for 32% of all Covid-19 related deaths. New Zealand has hit its 90% double vaccination milestone for the eligible population (those 12 years and older), making it one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, but the rates for Māori and Pasifika are yet to catch up. According to the Ministry of Health, 77% of Māori are double vaccinated, and 88% of Pasifika. Combined, these groups have made up 75% of Covid cases. The government has faced criticism for not prioritising Māori and Pasifika in its vaccine rollout, and for failing to adequately consult Māori over accessing hard-to-reach groups. But with provisional approval granted for children aged 5-11 years to be vaccinated, now is the opportunity to do right by those communities, health experts say. “We must not repeat the failures that led to the existing vaccination inequities for Māori, inequities that are not a matter of chance but the result of structural racism and inequity by design,” six health experts – Dr Owen Sinclair, Dr Jin Russell, Dr Danny de Lore, Dr Erik Anderson, Dr Teuila Percival and Dr Siouxsie Wiles – wrote in an editorial. The group said the government’s rollout for the adult population focused too heavily on age and pre-existing conditions, failing to take into account the younger age structure of the Māori population, the greater burden of Māori disease, the significant barriers for Māori accessing healthcare and their justified distrust of the health system. According to the 2018 census, 32% of Māori are under 15 years of age, compared with 19.6% of the total population. Because of this younger age structure, fewer Māori are currently eligible for vaccination. Russell, a developmental paediatrician, said Māori health and community leaders had advocated for strategies to prevent inequities since the start of the pandemic and now it was critical to listen to them. “These are the people who understand the communities best. They’re on the ground, they know how to reach families.” Māori children carry a higher burden of pre-existing conditions including diabetes, respiratory conditions, and obesity, she said. “If you design a vaccine rollout that doesn’t specifically reach those families who are hardest to reach, you will inevitably end up with an inequitable vaccine rollout.” In the week leading up to Friday, there were over 280 Covid cases in children nine years and under. Russell said the vast majority of children do not become unwell but there is some evidence that the Omicron variant is reproducing more efficiently in younger age groups, which poses an ongoing risk to the health of Māori communities. Significant resourcing must to go towards Māori community and health organisations before the rollout begins, Russell said, adding that one of the best approaches would to enable vaccinations at schools. “It’s really important for families to know that their child won’t be vaccinated without their explicit consent, but by making vaccines available at schools this enables everyone to reach the vaccine easily,” Russell said. New Zealand has so far reported 13,125 Covid cases since the start of the pandemic, with 10,289 of those from the current outbreak. Weekly case numbers are beginning to trend downwards as the country’s vaccination rates continue to climb and public health measures prevent unvaccinated people from attended some venues, or gathering in large groups. On Monday, the country reported its second probable death related to an extremely rare reaction to the vaccine. The Covid-19 vaccine independent safety monitoring board said a 26-year-old man died within two weeks of his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and a post-mortem has identified myocarditis as the probable cause of death. The man developed symptoms in the days following his vaccine but did not seek treatment. The board noted that Covid-19 infection can itself be a cause of myocarditis, as well as other serious illnesses, and it remains safer to be vaccinated."

          "bodyText": "In the days after the Taliban took Kabul, more than one correspondent shared clips from its streets, marvelling at how fast the city had returned to “surprisingly normal”, with shoppers back out and a sudden sense of quiet in a place that had been constantly braced for the next suicide bombing. The correspondents were men, who apparently didn’t register one stark difference; it was also largely men in their videos. Most of the city’s women had vanished into their homes, terrified of what Taliban rule would mean for them. It could have been a momentary slip of attention, at a time of intense pressure. But in the weeks that followed, this kind of blindness to the particular tragedy unfolding for Afghan women would play out again and again, first in male journalists’ coverage of the Taliban’s victory, and then in international organisations’ response to Afghanistan’s crisis. Afghanistan was already the world’s worst country to live in as a woman before the Taliban took control. But with the group curtailing employment, and even trying to banish women’s faces from TV screens, it plunged to new depths, restrictions rarely seen in recent decades beyond the pages of dystopian novels, the short-lived borders of the IS caliphate, or the last time the Taliban controlled Afghanistan. This past week marked 90 days since the Taliban effectively barred girls from higher education, with no date for a return to high school. Yet, particularly in the first weeks of Taliban control, that horror, and the unique shadow descending on women’s lives, seemed not to register fully with many male journalists in Afghanistan, or their editors back home in English-speaking countries, from the UK to the US, Australia to Canada (I haven’t followed other languages). It took one of the US’s leading papers four days to cover the Taliban announcement of a defacto ban on secondary school education for girls. On the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America, one prominent male correspondent in Kabul wondered on Twitter if “perhaps we can start today... to heal and move forward”. Afghan women were simply wondering if they would study or work again or even leave their house safely. The specific restraints on women’s lives and public roles do not seem to be a priority either for many of the diplomats, UN officials and aid agencies that have begun flying into Kabul again, too often as part of all-male delegations. The UK sent two British men to discuss “the rights of women and girls” with two Taliban men, apparently oblivious or unconcerned about the message that decision sent Afghanistan’s new rulers, as they energetically exclude women from government and public spaces. The United Nations appointed a man to lead the UN Women office in Kabul. When the Taliban brought in its bar on girls’ secondary education, Unicef – the UN agency that looks after children – put out a statement that first welcomed the return of boys-only high school classes, before raising “worries” about the future of girls’ schooling. There have also been frequent calls from men in the international community to “give the Taliban time” on rights, as if women’s ability to feed and educate themselves are mere bargaining chips. This dovetailed with too much reporting that seemed to imply by omission that women’s rights are a niche concern, of interest to and best covered by other women, not an urgent human rights crisis. Around three weeks after the fall of Kabul, I scanned the bylines of prominent male correspondents working in Afghanistan for papers on both sides of the Atlantic. It was an admittedly unscientific survey, but I couldn’t find a single standalone story by any of them about the systemic assault on women’s rights, beyond news coverage of protests by women. Their papers did produce stories about the abrupt truncation of women’s lives, but they were written by women, mostly outside the country. Perhaps the men were oblivious, perhaps they were uninterested. Either way, it was lazy journalism, and a reminder of how much those who write the news determine what makes headlines, and therefore what becomes a focus of international debate. It’s hard not to think this kind of approach makes it easier for the international organisations and diplomats to look at their delegate lists for trips to Kabul, and shrug off the fact that they are all or mostly men, or put out press releases that minimise abuses of women’s rights. The selective blindness seemed to be illustrated, in social media feeds, by a glut of images of, and with, Taliban fighters, presented through a lens of uncritical fascination and sometimes almost giddy excitement. “Half come hither, half I’ll kill you,” read one caption, mulling whether the young Talib was trying to look “sexy or scary”. Another colleague recently shared pictures of himself essentially dressed as a Talib, wearing the black turban embraced by the group. A third, employed by a major international TV network, posted an image of his camera next to a Taliban RPG, with the quip, “I need to upgrade my kit”. It is a strange approach to the footsoldiers of a government whose war crimes include the slaughter of media colleagues – and recent well-documented rights abuses go far beyond controls on women, including reprisal killings and forced displacements and massacres of minorities. Would selfies with the troops of other oppressive governments, from Chinese security forces in Xinjiang, or Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, be seen the same way? There is an urgent need to understand the Taliban. The worldview and ambitions of those who fought for the new government, and implement its rule, will influence how we engage with them. But the visually striking selfies with the Taliban and curated Instagram feeds of young militants at play do more to boost likes and followers (the pictures tend to be popular in the west) than offer any significant insight. For many Afghans at home and in exile, they prompt anger and despair; my phone regularly fills with incredulous screenshots and messages. “Are they suffering from Stockholm syndrome?” asked an Afghan female friend, sharing one of these images. In the financial catastrophe that has followed the Taliban takeover, it is likely to be women who suffer most. Men may be reduced to manual labour or to selling their children, but many women cannot work at all, and it is always girls who are sold. For years, the international community and the media have claimed women’s rights were at the heart of the western commitment to Afghanistan. Never have those concerns been more urgent. If the particular crisis facing Afghan women is not put at the heart of coverage of Afghanistan, and women are not at the centre of negotiations on aid donations and access, the price they and all of Afghanistan pay will be even greater. • Emma Graham-Harrison has reported from Afghanistan since 2009"

          "bodyText": "Keanu Reeves covers his face with both hands. Long bands of the actor’s straggly, jet-black hair flit from side to side as he shakes his cradled head. Reeves, who is 57, has a new Matrix movie out soon. It will be the first instalment in that famous sci-fi series since the turn of the century, when a visually splendid trilogy – The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions – shook blockbuster cinema to its foundations. I have just been telling him what an unforgettable outing that first Matrix movie was for me, back in 1999, when I saw it in a packed, noisy cinema full of people who couldn’t sit still for excitement. I’ve also just admitted to Reeves that, when The Matrix Resurrections is made available later this month, via various platforms, I’ll probably stream it at home, probably on a laptop. I only intend this as a light prompt to get him talking about Hollywood in 2021, a curious time for showbusiness, with Covid precautions and advances in streaming tech combining to make so many movies available for home viewing at the same time as they appear in cinemas. But perhaps Reeves is someone who feels things more deeply than most, because suddenly he begins to plead with me, through muffling fingers: “Dude? Don’t stream that movie… Don’t you fucking stream that movie.” This conversation is taking place on Zoom, across a few time zones – it’s evening in my London and morning in his Los Angeles. By his own admission, he is not a morning person. As a young actor he’d tell his agents that if they wanted him to get a part, they must not send him to auditions before 11am. I note, today, that we’re talking at 10am Pacific. Adding to his slightly frayed-seeming vibe, Reeves has only just flown back to LA after a film shoot in Paris. Jet lag woke him at 6am this morning. He drank a coffee, ate a banana, smoked an American Spirit Blue and got dressed in his habitual black T-shirt, black denim and black boots. Now he’s on a Zoom call with me, staring out from between his hands and asking: “What are you, crazy? You’re going to stream the new Matrix on a laptop? His harangue continues, getting louder (“My GOD, man”)and more eccentric (“I’m about to book a cinema for you, Thomas”) until some subtle, delicious shimmer behind his eyes lets me know that Reeves is teasing and has been all along. His hair sticks out at funny angles after all he’s pulled at it. He pats his knees, smiles, and says mildly: “I mean, sure, stream it if you have to.” I lay this out in detail to illustrate Reeves’s mode of expressing himself, which is eccentric, blasts of silliness mixed with seriousness, and not at all similar to any other famous person I’ve spoken to. He has a facility for poker-faced Canadian irony (he grew up in Toronto) and a mannerly reserve that he assumes is a part of his inheritance from his mum (she grew up in Hampshire). “I think there’s an English formality my mom carries, and that’s become a part of me, too,” he says. Friends of Reeves have said in the past that he is a listener first, a talker second, and I recognise in him some of the tricks of the passive conversationalist. He is unsqueamish about letting a silence linger. After statements, he sometimes repeats them to himself in an undertone, as though revisiting the words for possible flaws. Whenever he is asked a question he hasn’t heard before he tends to look into the distance and think for a while before giving a short, firm, well-formed answer. When I ask him what qualities define a good listener, Reeves stays motionless for so long I assume our Zoom connection has failed. Then he answers: “I think it’s interest and care. I’m interested in whoever I’m speaking to. I care.” His parents met on a beach in Beirut. This was in the 1960s. They were both freewheeling young travellers. Reeves’s mother, Patricia, had fled England. His father, Samuel, was a Chinese-Hawaiian who hadn’t settled anywhere either. After Reeves was born in 1964 the family moved to Australia. When his parents separated, Patricia took Reeves and his younger siblings to New York and, eventually, Toronto. She worked as a costume designer. “My mom had her atelier,” Reeves recalls, “where I would pick up pins and clean on the weekend for allowance money.” He has said many times that he never had a substantiative relationship with his biological father, but there was a stepfather, Patricia’s second husband Paul Aaron, who played an important role in his introduction to movie-making. “I believe I was 15? It was my summer holiday from school. And for a parent it’s, like, what do you do with this kid over the summer? I know, we’ll make him a production assistant on a movie!” Aaron was a director who was about to start shooting a schlocky action flick called A Force of One, starring Chuck Norris. (On its German release, the movie was brilliantly renamed Der Bulldozer.) Reeves was taken on as crew. He fetched things. He managed crowds during outdoor shoots. He recalls, with pride, ferrying a Sprite to the Hollywood legend Claudette Colbert. Meanwhile, he tells me, “I was watching the grips, I was watching actors, I was seeing how a film set really works, the call-sheets, the generator, the lights, the lunchtimes.” His main task was to lug buckets of ice to keep all the on-set drinks and snacks cold. When I ask if this role ever felt demeaning, Reeves screws up his face and protests. “Naw, man, I could start lugging ice right now. A movie is all-hands-on-deck. I love all-hands-on-deck.” Indeed, there are many accounts of Reeves’s good-guy attitude on film sets (pictures recently appeared online of him rolling heavy equipment up a hill during the Paris film shoot) and also credible testimonies of his everyday generosity. Secret charitable donations. Rides for stranded strangers. Of Reeves, Sandra Bullock said recently, “I don’t think there’s anyone who has something horrible to say about him.” After his experience on The Force of One, he says, continuing the story of his youth, he enrolled at a performing arts school in Toronto. “For one year,” he hastens to add. “They didn’t let me back in after the year.” Bad behaviour? I ask. “My line has always been that I had artistic differences with the principal,” he says. And what’s the truth behind that line? Reeves frowns. “I was a bit of a handful I guess. I was a ‘Why?’ guy. I was a ‘How come?’ guy.” By then, Reeves was already booking acting work, both paid (Cornflakes ads) and not (community theatre). “I was living in a friend’s house. I had enough money. I left Toronto when I was 20 and I drove to Hollywood.” He went to auditions in town (doing better in the ones post-11am) and landed a few good supporting roles, notably opposite Dennis Hopper in River’s Edge in 1986. From 1988 he went on a hot streak, accumulating memorable cameos in Dangerous Liaisons and Parenthood and starring alongside his friend Alex Winter in the first of three Bill &amp; Ted comedies. I ask Reeves about being a “Why?” guy – a “How come?” guy – when you’re also an actor-for-hire. If the need to question authority is in his bones, what has it been like to submit to the will of all-powerful directors? “As I see it,” he says, “the job is about investigating ‘Why?’, investigating ‘How come?’ You enter into a collaboration with a director to get those answers. When you don’t have an agreement, when you have conflict – and, yeah, there have been situations where my relationship with the director has been at odds, I might have been emotionally immature sometimes, I might have shouted a few ‘Fucks!’ – then it becomes a battle in the editing room. Luckily I’ve only had a couple of those instances. I’m not gonna say the names of those films, by the way.” Impossible to guess which films he means; he’s made so many. Point Break with Patrick Swayze. My Own Private Idaho with River Phoenix. He was the baddie in Much Ado About Nothing and the studly saviour of Winona Ryder in a Dracula remake. All of the above were crammed into a heady 24-month period between 1991 and 1993. Reeves works a lot. This has often meant his projects overlap, blending at the edges. A few years later, he began his work on the Matrix trilogy, a production that lasted till 2001. The first Matrix was an unqualified hit. It earned £300m in cinemas worldwide, sold record numbers of DVDs, and prompted a story in the New York Times headlined “How The Matrix Changed The Rules for Action Movies.” After that, Reeves went to work on two sequels without much clue what his directors had in mind in terms of the continuing story. Those directors, Lana and Lilly Wachowski, have since suggested the story they told across the trilogy (about finding one’s true identity, resisting suppression and convention) was an allegory of trans experience. Reeves never twigged that at the time. Not many people did. Either way, he’s clearly proud of the work he achieved with the Wachowskis. His feeling is: art belongs to its creators first and foremost. You must do your best to honour their intentions. I wish he’d been there, two decades ago, to say something wise like this to me after I sat through those two Matrix sequels. My experience of watching them went through phases, first excitement, which turned by increments into panic and boredom, finally becoming a thick and soupy disappointment. In 1999, when I was 17, the first Matrix seemed to me the least boring film ever made. Over and over I guessed what might come next in the story. In 2001, when I was 19, the sequels gave me my first taste of artistic disappointment: how impossible it is for a much-imagined thing to live up to one’s own limitless expectations. When I tell Reeves this he is sympathetic. The third Star Wars movie was his own big let-down, he says. He was 19 when Return of the Jedi came out. “I went in, like, ‘Wow, I wonder, are they gonna do this, and will they do that…? And then I was, like, ‘Oh no. Oh no.’” Reeves clears his throat. “Um, so I totally get it. I know that experience as a filmgoer. But I just try to let films be, y’know? I try to think about what the creators were going for. It’s their work of art, man. I try to come to their art and meet it wherever it is.” This is well expressed, as is Reeves’s lovely description of the passage of time, when he describes the decades of his professional life that came after The Matrix. Each year, he says, seems to slip away that little bit faster than the last, something that always puts him in mind of the turning wheel of an audio tape. “When you’re young,” he says, “you have a big old reel of that tape left, right? And so it appears to revolve slowly. Then, time passes, and there’s less and less tape left on the reel. It spins faster. It spins faster.” Economic and elegant with his words, Reeves has occasionally put this ability to use by publishing poetry. In 2011 and again in 2016, he collaborated on coffee-table books with the artist Alexandra Grant, lines of his mournful verse appearing alongside Grant’s eerie drawings and photographs. A Hollywood star who takes a risk like this and commits his name to poetry must expect a degree of fascination and even scepticism from the public. Adding to the intrigue of these books, it has since emerged Reeves is in a romantic relationship with Grant. But the way he talks to me about his writing – without shyness but also without bravado –makes it all seem a natural expression of some challenging things he has been through in his life. Years ago, when Reeves was in his mid-30s, he and his then-girlfriend lost a child in late pregnancy. That girlfriend later died herself in a traffic accident. He has known other bereavements, including the loss of his friend River Phoenix in 1993. (“He was a special person,” he said recently of Phoenix. “So original, unique, smart, talented, fiercely creative. Thoughtful. Brave. And funny. And dark. And light.”) Reeves talks to me in general about grief, explaining that his 2016 book of poems, Shadows, was an effort to externalise it, “contextualise the grief, even be inspired by it, even find a certain pleasure in it… Let [the grief] move, and not be trapped inside it… It just put things in a new shape that I could carry or have with me.” Was it cathartic, I ask, to revisit those difficult feelings and write them into verse? “Absolutely,” he says. I ask if there was any emotional cost as well. He thinks for a long, long time before answering, “Yeah. But, hopefully, I have enough in the bank to pay that cost.” We talk about his work again. In the past decade or so, Reeves says, “I’ve wanted to get as much done as I can before that turning tape runs out… How old am I now,” he asks, rhetorically, “57? Around the time I hit 40, there was this idea of creating more from my artistic loins.” This has meant two or three movies per year, everything from apocalypse blockbusters (2008’s The Day the Earth Stood Still to samurai thrillers (2013’s 47 Ronin) to a comedy in which he voiced an animated cat. In the middle of all this, when he was in his late 40s, Reeves made his directorial debut, a 2013 kung-fu movie, Man of Tai Chi. Busy, busy, busy. Probably the most significant movie from this part of his career was 2014’s John Wick. An unapologetic fight movie, it was made in collaboration with two of Reeves’s former stunt colleagues from The Matrix, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch. They had a basic concept that proved effective. What if the fights they staged in their film were all limited by what Reeves himself could physically perform? The resulting action sequences had a visceral, haggard, can’t-look-away quality (probably born of a 50-something man absolutely exhausting himself for our viewing pleasure) and John Wick won over an unexpectedly big audience. Reeves says, “I remember thinking, ‘I wonder if the Wachowskis have seen it. I wonder if they liked it.’ I never reached out to ask.” Certainly the public liked what they saw and John Wick has since spawned two sequels, with more to come in 2022 and 2025. Meanwhile Reeves has circled back to work with at least one of the Wachowski siblings, the coming new Matrix movie directed by Lana. There’s a story that on the first John Wick, when budgets were tightest, the stunt men and women Reeves fought during those long action sequences would play dead, lie still for a minute, then stand up and scuttle around behind the camera to be killed all over again. It occurs to me, as my conversation with Reeves comes to an end, that his long, strange and meandering career has been a bit like this. Shoot. Shoot. Lie still for a bit. Shoot again. Before we say goodbye, I remind him of that lovely analogy of his, about the unspooling tape that seems to turn ever quicker. By working so regularly, so relentlessly, has he been trying to slow the turning of time? Reeves listens to the question gravely, stares to one side while he considers how best to reply, and finally gives the same answer three times. “It doesn’t slow down time. It doesn’t slow down time. It doesn’t slow down time.” The repetition prompts some final thought, and Reeves sighs. “If anything, it speeds everything up.” The Matrix Resurrections is in cinemas from 22 December This article was amended on 20 December 2021 because an earlier version misnamed the film A Force of One as The Force of One; and also to remove some personal information."

          "bodyText": "This live blog is now closing. For updates on the global coronavirus situation, please follow the global Covid live blog. The FT’s Sebastian Payne has also been told that Simon Case will no longer lead the Christmas party investigation. A statement on Case’s replacement is expected this evening. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has called on Johnson to mount a clear-up at No 10. He told the BBC: The prime minister needs to show really strongly that he doesn’t just disapprove but is prepared to get rid of people who are breaking those rules. I want my colleagues to stop playing games.... the party has to get behind him. More on Partygate from ITV’s Paul Brand and the prospect now of an external probe: London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for the Metropolitan police to investigate allegations of Covid rule-breaking at Whitehall parties. Speaking to ITV Khan said: I think it’s really important that where allegations of criminality are made, the police investigate. I’d expect the police to do what they normally do which is to look at the evidence, find the evidence and see whether any crimes have been committed. Politico’s Alex Wickham hears further Covid restrictions will be on the agenda at this weekend’s Cobra meeting. Labour’s Angela Rayner has this: Henry Dyer from the Insider is told a senior QC could now lead the investigation. A Conservative MP has said Simon Case should no longer lead the investigation into Whitehall parties. Richard Holden, MP for North West Durham, told Times Radio: I don’t think it can be the case that he’s investigating something when obviously, there are now questions about that now. So yeah, absolutely, (it) needs to be changed. He said he had been “as angered as many” by the party allegations as he “was in the place of coming to my grandmother’s funeral with a very small number of people” last year. So I was as angered as many of my constituents are by the idea that anything untoward has been going on in that area. And I just literally heard about this latest situation today, which, you know, just sounds unbelievable. So that just needs to get sorted out as soon as. Yet more difficult news for the prime minister. The Times has this: The new head of the charity watchdog quit today before officially taking up his post after The Times uncovered how “inappropriate behaviour” led to his resignation from an aid agency. Martin Thomas, 58, a friend of Boris Johnson, was confirmed as chairman of the Charity Commission last week by the culture secretary Nadine Dorries. He was due to begin work on December 27 but stepped down after The Times raised questions about his appointment in the wake of his role in a bullying investigation this year when he was chairman of Women For Women International UK. Johnson faces an intensely challenging period. The Omicron wave is breaking over Britain, but his MPs are in open revolt against Covid restrictions; the economic backdrop is deteriorating just as taxes are about to rise, and Simon Case’s inquiry into the rule-breaking parties is yet to report. As one frontbencher put it: “We’re starting to enter a perfect storm of shitness.” Read the full report here: A Cabinet Office source told PA that a quiz was held on 17 December, but insisted it was mostly virtual. The source said it was “absolutely not a drinks gathering or a party” and that six people who had been working in the department that day took part from their desks. On whether Simon Case took part, the source said he was not involved in the organisation and did not ask any questions but he was aware it was taking place as he had walked past. No 10 is expected to issue a statement on the investigation into parties across Whitehall that he was asked to lead by the prime minister. ITV’s Paul Brand, who secured the video of Downing Street staff laughing about Christmas parties, has this: The report about Case has prompted yet more ridicule aimed at No 10 over Christmas parties. The Sun’s political editor Harry Cole hears this: The Mirror’s Pippa Crerar reminds us that Number 10 said about Case when he was appointed. Here’s the i’s Paul Waugh on North Shropshire: Boris Johnson is famously unembarrassable, but after that shattering defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats he does now look seriously isolated, as several of his own MPs are speeding off away from him. The reasons for the Lib Dem victory are multiple, with voters citing everything from anger over the way the PM tried to bail out Owen Paterson’s misconduct to that video of Allegra Stratton laughing about a No.10 Christmas party. Add in discontent over poor rural bus and train services, local NHS and ambulance services on their knees and a cost of living squeeze, and it’s easy to see why the electorate felt this was a crisis made in Downing Street. But while those unforced errors point to the old adage that Johnson is his own worst enemy, what’s different now is that his own backbenchers and Labour and the Lib Dems are rapidly becoming more credible enemies too. Some MPs gleefully point out that having spent years making life difficult for David Cameron and Theresa May, Johnson is the one on the receiving end of a mutinous mood among backbenchers. “As you sow, so shall you reap,” one former minister put it to me this week. The hunter is now the quarry and he’s finding it is nowhere near as much fun. Here’s a summary of today’s events: Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, tasked with investigating claims of a Christmas party at Downing Street last year, held his own office party the day before, according to multiple reports. The Cabinet Office has dismissed the allegations as untrue. The SNP has called for Case to be removed from the inquiry. The BBC has reported that Case’s role in the investigation is “under consideration.” Boris Johnson is to convene a Cobra meeting about the rise in Omicron cases with the leaders of the devolved administrations . Johnson spoke to Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon about this weekend’s meeting in a call on Friday. The former Scottish Conservatives leader, Ruth Davidson, has warned Johnson that he is “drinking in the last chance saloon” after the Conservatives lost the safe seat of North Shropshire in Thursday’s byelection. She said MPs were “looking for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted.” Johnson said he accepts responsibility for the byelection defeat but defiantly blamed the media for focusing on “politics and politicians” following a string of allegations about Tory sleaze and breaches of lockdown rules. Asked about the Tory MPs who are warning him that he could be removed as leader if he does not get a grip in No 10, Johnson refused to answer on the grounds that it was a question about politics and politicians. The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden has conceded that voters in North Shropshire have given the government “a kicking” by backing the Liberal Democrats. He said: “Voters were fed up and they gave us a kicking. They were fed up with a byelection that was called because of sleaze allegations; they were fed up with all the sort of stories that are going on at the moment.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, hailed the byelection result as a “watershed moment” that “offers hope to people around the country that a brighter future is possible”. He added: “Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic, and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them.” Here’s PA’s take on the Case allegations: Boris Johnson is facing calls to remove cabinet secretary Simon Case from an inquiry into gatherings in government departments during lockdown, after it was alleged parties were held in his own department. The prime minister asked Case to look into allegations of gatherings held in Downing Street while the public faced challenging measures to stop them from mixing. The inquiry was then expanded and it was confirmed Case could look at any alleged party if he felt it was relevant. But the Guido Fawkes website reported on Friday that two Christmas parties were held in Case’s department – the Cabinet Office – in December 2020, when restrictions were in place. The Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has called for Mr Case to be removed from the investigation and to resign. Both Johnson and Tory chair Oliver Dowden have said they were sure Case’s investigation would find no wrongdoing. And Johnson insisted the public was more interested in other matters such as coronavirus, and suggested the media reporting on lockdown-busting parties had caused the Tories to lose the North Shropshire by-election. The Times reported that one of the parties was held on 17 December – the day before the alleged Christmas party at Downing Street at the centre of the saga. The newspaper reported that the event was listed in digital calendars as “Christmas party!” and was organised by a private secretary in Case’s team. A joint investigation by Politico and the Independent claimed Case shared drinks with between 15 and 20 staff at his office and in the waiting room outside the Cabinet Office. In a statement, the Cabinet Office told Politico and the Independent: “These allegations are categorically untrue.” Boris Johnson has spoken to Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and confirmed he will convene a Cobra meeting over the weekend with leaders of the devolved administrations about the rise in Omicron cases. A readout of the call said: The prime minister confirmed the UK government will be convening a Cobra meeting over the weekend with counterparts from the devolved administrations to continue discussions. Yet more reaction to the revelation that Simon Case, the man investigating Christmas parties in Whitehall last year, attended a gathering of his own. Fraser Nelson, one of Boris Johnson’s successors as editor of the Spectator, has delivered a scathing verdict on the PM’s reaction to the byelection. Nelson writes: I think it would be fair to say that we have heard some self-serving twaddle from him of late and yet this ‘I blame the media’ line was not only hypocritical and sinister: it was downright insulting to the intelligence of the British public. Politicians can sometimes be so consumed with vanity that their very existence – their self-definition, their self-esteem – depends on how they think they are portrayed in the media ... The moment he decided to criminalise women meeting up for coffee was the moment he lost the right to complain if the press take an interest in No 10’s own rule-breaking. And yes, such stories may distract attention from his skills agenda, his vaccine booster data or tractor production figures. But in our place, what would he be writing about? Would he have led the Spectator on drugs policy, as we did last week – or gone all-out on the hypocrisy in partying No 10? Since he defended the press in 2007, newspapers sales have probably halved – haemorrhaging power and influence. If voters give him a bloody nose, can he really blame us? As Enoch Powell said: for a politician to blame the press is like a ship’s captain complaining about the sea. Ultimately, as prime minister, he makes the weather. His bungling triggered this byelection. And he should not blame us if he does not like the result. The byelection win was down to a “toxic cocktail of local and national issues” according to a Lib Dem campaigner. Nine days before polls opened, the party was handed extra ammunition through repeated reports about parties at Downing Street in December last year, prompting nationwide anger. “It was like Barnard Castle on steroids,” one Lib Dem campaigner said. The party went full throttle, promoting a photograph of a Conservative HQ Christmas party, complete with buffet, to North Shropshire voters on Facebook within an hour and a half of it emerging. “Tell them the party is over,” quickly became their tagline. After his defeat, the Conservative candidate, Neil Shastri-Hurst, said the party would need to “reflect upon the result” and some Tory campaigners have been quick to blame “partygate” for the loss. Read the full story here: The BBC’s Ione Wells has been told that Case’s role as head of the inquiry into Christmas parties is now “under consideration”. She told BBC News: “I understand that as a result of these fresh allegations that have emerged today, hs position as chair of the investigation into parties at Downing Street last year, is now under consideration.” Meanwhile, Covid cases have reached a new daily record for a third day in a row. There were 93,045 new infections reported in the last 24 hours with another 111 deaths recorded. There’s more on the Covid blog. More reaction to the Christmas gathering allegations against Simon Case. The cabinet secretary, Simon Case, who is investigating Christmas parties last year in Downing Street, attended an “impromptus Christmas drinks gathering” in his office last year, according to Politico and the Independent. Citing two officials who were present, Politico says Case “shared drinks with a group of 15 to 20 staff at his office and in the waiting room outside at 70 Whitehall in mid-December 2020”. Guido hears similar. He quotes Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, as saying: Boris Johnson as prime minister has set the tone for the civil service and the rest of government. With each new revelation there is growing evidence of a culture of turning a blind eye to the rules. Labour made it clear when the investigation was launched that the person in charge should be uncompromised and able to make a fair and independent judgment. These fresh revelations put that into question. The SNP has called for the Case investigation to be scrapped. The Mirror’s Pippa Crerar, who has led the way on Christmas party scoops, reckons Case’s position seems “untenable”. Even Ryanair are trolling the government. Hat tip @SomersetChris. PA’s Ian Jones puts the swing to the Lib Dems in historical context: Those backing a “progressive alliance” against the Conservative government have been buoyed by the North Shropshire result. Last week the Guardian urged Labour supporters to back the Lib Dems in the seat. “Progressives ought to embrace strategic voting with a vengeance next week to weaken Mr Johnson’s position,” it said. The Labour MP Clive Lewis is encouraged that such voters appear to have heeded this advice. There are similar sentiments from Best for Britain and Compass thinktanks. And from the writer Paul Mason: The byelection result comes in the midst of the rapidly rising wave of Omicron infections. The latest figures show another 3,201 infections - almost twice the number of new infections (1,698) announced on Thursday. This is Matthew Weaver taking over from Lucy. As preparation for blogging duties I listened to Radio 4’s World at One. On it, the BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said the North Shropshire result had left Johnson in a “very precarious position”. Kuenssberg explained: Not just because of this monster defeat in a byelection, but also remember this week huge numbers of backbenchers didn’t back him on a key part of his plans to deal with the Covid pandemic. [And] there was the report from the Electoral Commission around the saga over how he paid for the lavish redecoration of the flat above Downing Street. There is a difference of opinion inside the Conservative party over whether or not this is a situation that can be recovered. Some MPs believe that it is past saving, and are focusing on when and how making a change at the top would be best conducted. There are however also MPs who believe this is not necessarily a terminal situation. He basically has been in the past a hugely successful campaigner. And if you restore order, you restore structure, you get a tighter grip on the government machine, the regime behind No 10, then there is a possibility of getting things back on track. In [Boris Johnson’s] interview we heard what is actually one of his stock lines. He said, ‘I take responsibility for everything that happens in the government.’ That’s not the same as the kind of self-reflection that some of his colleagues would like him to do right now. The question for the next few weeks and months for Downing Street is what is Boris Johnson’s capacity for that kind of self-reflection? And there are many powerful figures in the Conservative party who privately think that he has to change, he has to sharpen up or ship out. He has had an extraordinary capacity to campaign to deliver a message to sell a notion of a vision to members of the public. To make voters feel good. What we haven’t seen during his time in government is when things go wrong, a permanent decision to really shake things up. I don’t think you find many people around who are really confident that Boris Johnson is going to dig deep and actually turn this back to something that looks like a normally functioning government that’s capable of getting things done, keeping the promises they made in the election in 2019. That’s the key thing for loads of MPs - there is not much faith about. These are from my colleague Peter Walker That’s all from me, Lucy Campbell, for today. I’ll now be handing over to my colleague Matthew Weaver. Take care and have a lovely weekend! Humiliation upon humiliation is being piled on the prime minister right now. Could a leadership contest be next, asks Marina Hyde in this week’s column. An extract reads: On 2 November, bubbly British premier Boris Johnson was flying back from Cop26 on a private plane, laughing off world-beatingly high Covid transmission rates at a time when light interventions would have reduced them, and nicely set for dinner with mid-Mesozoic influencer Charles Moore at the all-male Garrick Club. At this fateful repast with his former boss, the newspaper columnist who runs Britain cemented a plot to stop Owen Paterson – rule-breaking MP for ultra-safe North Shropshire – from having to serve a mere 30-day suspension from parliament, apparently on the basis that Johnson’s people can do whatever they like. This morning, North Shropshire has fallen to the Liberal Democrats with the third-biggest swing against the Tories since 1945, with the many, many rule-breaking Christmas parties held last year by Johnson’s people turning out to be a nuclear issue on the doorstep. What can you say? I strongly recommend laughing over spilt milk. The full column is here: No party could be worth the hangover Boris Johnson is now suffering From the BBC’s Andrew Marr, who will present his BBC show for the last time on Sunday Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee, said this morning it was not the time for a “big blame game” but that Boris Johnson needed to stop the “self-inflicted own goals”. He told Sky News: I want him to succeed, I am giving him the benefit of the doubt. But in doing that, as one of his seasoned backbenchers, I am asking him to think carefully how he governs the country and avoid these self-inflicted measures. Following the large Tory rebellion against Covid passports on Tuesday, Clifton-Brown had warned Johnson that a leadership challenge was “on the cards” if he failed to “change his approach”. Here is the full clip with Boris Johnson’s reaction to the byelection hammering from Sky News’s Sam Coates The former Scottish Conservatives leader, Ruth Davidson, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One that the prime minister was “drinking in the last chance saloon” after being “put on warning by his MPs”. MPs “are looking for him after Christmas to come back with a programme for government to sharpen up the operation at No 10, to stop having all of these own goals and burning political capital”, she said. MPs were “looking for a bit of bloody grip to be exerted,” Baroness Davidson said, adding that “ if they see that they might hold off, but I mean, I think the prime minister has been put on warning by his MPs”. When asked if there was a successor to Boris Johnson, she acknowledged “there’s not a natural successor”, but added: Events that have happened over the last month, month and a half, have allowed this to now be openly talked about at all levels within the party… I would say Rishi Sunak’s doing very well, I’d say Sajid Javid’s doing very well. I would say, having recently been promoted from vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has done brilliantly and deserves the promotion into cabinet. You have to have a prime minister that has got a programme for government and has got the grip then has got the staff to be able to execute it and has got the plan for it. She said MPs she had spoken to were saying “they’re tired of the constant drama coming out of No 10. And actually the No 11 flat as well. And they’re getting it in the neck every time they go back to their constituencies every week.” So I think what they’re looking for is a more sober prime minister, [who] will cut out the self-inflicted mistakes. Boris Johnson has said he accepts responsibility for his party’s crushing defeat in the North Shropshire byelection but also defiantly blamed the media for focusing on “politics and politicians” following a string of allegations about Tory sleaze and breaches of lockdown rules. He claimed that the biggest problem of the last few weeks was that what “people have been hearing is a litany of stuff about politics and politicians and stuff that isn’t about them and things we can do to make life better”. He brushed off questions about his personal responsibility for the scandals over how a Tory donor funded his wallpaper in Downing Street and the allegations of parties in Downing Street during lockdown, appearing to blame the media for focusing too much on these issues. Asked about the Tory MPs who are warning him that he could be removed as leader if he does not get a grip in No 10, Johnson refused to answer on the grounds that it was a question about politics and politicians. He said: Can I remind you of everything I’ve been saying in this interview? That is exactly the kind of question that breaks the golden rule. Read more here: Boris Johnson accepts responsibility for North Shropshire byelection mauling More from polling expert Prof John Curtice, who writes for the Times (paywall) that leave voters in the true blue seat lost faith in Boris Johnson’s ethics and competence. An extract reads: In short, this result suggests that the coalition of leave-inclined voters who provided the prime minister with his 80-seat majority in 2019 is now at risk of falling apart. Indeed, polls undertaken since the “partygate” allegations encircled the prime minister last week suggest that support for the Conservatives is now down by 20 points since 2019 among those who voted leave. Many of these voters were first-time Conservative supporters whose willingness to stick with the party is perhaps all too easily eroded if their confidence in its ethics and competence are shaken. Of course, a crucial element in the Liberal Democrats’ success was a 12-point drop in the Labour vote, which had previously been second-placed. It looks as though, in a constituency their party had never won, many Labour supporters were all too ready to take the opportunity to give Boris Johnson a bloody nose. However, the result is also a reminder to Labour that whatever the Conservatives’ current woes, at 39% their own standing in the polls is still no higher than 12 months ago. North Shropshire suggests that the Liberal Democrats have regained their mantle as the party of byelection protest. But that does not necessarily mean that Labour are, as yet, seen as ready for government. It’s been two years since Boris Johnson shattered Labour’s “red wall” of northern seats to secure the Conservative party’s biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher’s 1987 victory. But while the prime minister was lauded by the Tory faithful in the months after that result, and was helped by a successful vaccine programme to weather questions about the government’s handling of the Covid pandemic, a succession of sometimes self-inflicted reversals has put his position in peril. Read the roundup of the missteps that have undermined the prime minister’s hold on power here: North Shropshire, piggate and partygate put Boris Johnson’s position in peril During a visit to a vaccination centre in Hillingdon, Boris Johnson told reporters it was a “very disappointing” night for his party. The prime minister said he accepted that the row over Christmas parties in Downing Street during lockdowns last year had “obstructed” the task of informing voters about the government’s agenda, and that over the last few weeks, people had been hearing about a “constant litany of stuff about politicians”, and not enough about their priorities. He said: Clearly the vote in North Shropshire is a very disappointing result. I totally understand people’s frustrations, I hear what the voters are saying in North Shropshire. In all humility, I’ve got to accept that verdict. I understand that what voters want us as the government to be doing at all times is to focus on them and their priorities. Asked whether he took personal responsibility for the defeat, he replied: I do. I think my job is to get over what we’re doing more effectively. He wouldn’t be drawn on the question of whether he should resign if it was in the interest of the Conservative party, and said he was focusing on the government’s vaccination programme. What we’re focusing on is getting the job done. I think that is what people would want me to be focused on right now. Is the North Shropshire byelection another sign that Brand Boris has passed its sell-by date, asks Patrick Maguire in this morning’s Times Rex Box. An extract reads: There is, on some parallel timeline, a universe in which Owen Paterson has just finished his 30-day suspension from the Commons for second jobbing – sorry, selflessly alerting the authorities to the danger of defective ham for the bargain price of £100,000 a year – and the good people of Wem, Whitchurch and Market Drayton spent the last three weeks unbothered by gawping lobby journalists repeating the word “sleaze”. That you are instead reading about another Liberal Democrat byelection victory, a 34% swing, the seventh biggest in history; a 22,949 Conservative majority turned into a 5,925 majority for the Lib Dems; an 8.5 on Prof Sir John Curtice’s Richter scale; and letters to the 1922 Committee is entirely the fault of Boris Johnson. All of it. Everything. It is a verdict on his leadership and judgment. For this byelection would not have happened were it not for the unforced, inadvisable and avoidable decision to try – and quite spectacularly fail – to get Paterson off the hook with a series of parliamentary manoeuvres so shameless as to make Richard Nixon look like Nelson Mandela. It would not have been lost, by the crushed Conservative candidate’s own admission, had No 10 not allowed one Daily Mirror front page on the Christmas party they insisted never was to become a fortnight-long saga of denials, leaks and inquiries. That, of course, was not the only reason the Lib Dems romped home. Each seat has its own idiosyncrasies, particularly in rural England, and slow ambulance response times, poor transport connections and the impact of Brexit on local farmers were factors here. But to borrow Jeremy Thorpe’s deadpan response to the question of whether his trial for conspiracy to murder cost him his seat in 1979: “Put it this way ... I don’t think it helped.” Divining the future from byelection results is always a bit of a fool’s errand. Recent history is pockmarked with famous Liberal and Liberal Democrat victories – Ripon, Eastbourne, Ribble Valley, Christchurch, Richmond Park, Brecon and Radnorshire – overturned with little fanfare at the following general election. There is an argument – a convincing argument, at that – that all this morning’s result really proves is that the Liberal Democrats know how to run a byelection campaign. Note, too, the fact they pulled this off in a true blue shire seat with few remainers to speak of. Electoral politics appears to have moved on from 2016. That need not worry Boris Johnson too much yet. What should, though, is how Tory MPs will take it. You can read the full analysis here (paywall). This is from historian Robert Saunders He is quoting this from Steven Fielding, also a historian, who is wondering whether today’s result could signal better times are ahead for Labour The default setting of ‘vote Tory’ has been broken, the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, writes for the Guardian. You can read his column here: Speaking in Oswestry outside The Bailey Head pub after a 25-minute walkabout through the market town in her constituency, Helen Morgan said of her win: Well, I’m absolutely thrilled, humbled and honoured - and obviously a little bit tired. She added that voters had been “moving towards” the Liberal Democrats - and away from the Conservatives - “even before the issue with the party, last week”. We found that people really felt as if they were taken for granted. Our ambulance services are under pressure, our farming community feels taken for granted. And when we went out and told them that they could have an MP who would listen to them and fight their corner, that message really resonated. You can’t deny the impact of the party and the news that broke last week, but I think it was moving in our direction before then. Here is an insightful thread examining the limitations of what byelections can tell us in terms of wider public opinion from Anthony Wells, a byelection specialist and head of European political and social research at YouGov The polling expert Sir John Curtice has described the North Shropshire byelection result as a political earthquake. If the Richter scale is up to 10, it would register an 8.5, the election expert told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning. He said that while the result was not quite unprecedented, the precedents are not comfortable for the Tories. A 34-point swing from the Tories to Lib Dems since 2019 in the seat is comparable only to the Christchurch byelection in 1993 at the end of a parliament that saw the Conservative government fall to the landslide of Tony Blair’s New Labour, he said. In a sense, two weeks ago, nobody would have seen this coming. Two weeks ago, yes the Conservatives were in trouble - their position in the polls was down to neck-and-neck and they lost 13 points in the Old Bexley by-election. But [North Shropshire] was not a constituency first of all that at all looked like promising territory for the Liberal Democrats - it voted 60% to Leave - very, very different from Chesham and Amersham... and secondly while the Conservative position had weakened it hadn’t weakened that much. The Liberal Democrats do look like they have reclaimed their mantle as the by-election party of choice. Meanwhile, we’re seeing Conservative voters and Leave voters in a true blue constituency taking the opportunity to protest pretty spectacularly about what they think of this current government. The newly elected North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan has appeared at a victory rally alongside former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron in Oswestry, this morning. PA reports that after Morgan used a yellow pin to pop a large blue balloon which had “Boris’ Bubble” emblazoned on the side, Farron said: I don’t know if you realise how many millions of people have woken up this morning feeling a bit of light has broken into the darkness. But it turns out, if you are incompetent, it turns out if you tell lies, it turns out if you take the people for granted, there is a price to pay. Democracy and justice is alive and well in Britain and the people of North Shropshire have spoken for the whole of Britain last night. Frustrated MPs across the Conservative party have little reason to support the prime minister unless he can quickly repair his rift with voters, writes Katy Balls in this week’s column. Here is an extract: After a tricky few weeks for Boris Johnson, it is impossible to separate the prime minister from the result. Tory MPs believe he was a key factor on the doorstep. The result points to issues in a general election. While byelections are more vulnerable to protest votes, the North Shropshire vote shows how tactical voting has the potential to wound the Tories at the next election. There is a particular concern among those MPs in Lib Dem-facing seats, of which there are around 50. But the problem goes further. “If we can’t keep a majority in a true blue seat that voted heavily to leave, where can we?” asks one frustrated Tory MP. Most immediately, the North Shropshire byelection is a problem for Johnson’s own authority. His MPs have been willing to begrudgingly put up with things they don’t agree with – such as tax rises and Covid restrictions – when they believed Johnson had the support of the public. If they start to see him as the central problem, the calculation will change. Johnson will find it even harder to get his agenda through. Already Tory MPs from across the party are openly discussing whether he can really lead them into the next election. As the prime minister takes a break over Christmas, he will need to use that time to work out how to regain the support of his party. Otherwise, 2022 will be his most turbulent year yet. And here is the full column: Tories know Johnson lost them North Shropshire. They may now dispense with him More from academic Matt Goodwin with (what he calls) a short thread looking at how, almost two years to the day since his emphatic election victory, Boris Johnson’s electorate is beginning to unravel From the FT’s Jim Pickard Jonathan Reynolds said the effort Labour put in to campaigning for the North Shropshire seat was proportionate to its chances of winning. The shadow business secretary told BBC Breakfast: I think we’re proud of the candidate we ran, I think Ben Wood will be a Labour MP at some stage in future, great talent. We put the effort into it that was proportionate to our chances of winning, but clearly people have wanted to send a message to the government - they’re fed up with the incompetence, the sleaze, the kind of revelations we’ve seen over the last few weeks. Oliver Dowden said he was in touch with Boris Johnson this morning. The Tory party chairman told LBC the government had to prove it was “focused on people’s priorities”. I have been in touch with the prime minister this morning. I’m seeing the prime minister immediately after I’ve done this very extensive news round this morning. What we must do as a government is demonstrate that we are focused on the people’s priorities and I think what you’ve heard over the past couple of months is a lot of noises off. That is why, for example, we are focusing, in the middle of this terrible surging Omicron virus, we’re focusing on getting the booster into people’s arms in order to make sure that we can keep some element of normality going on in our lives. That’s why we’re engaged with the hospitality industry who are facing tremendous challenges right now. We have to be laser-like focused on the people’s priorities, and that is the message I take from this - that people don’t want all these noises off. They want us focused on their priorities. These are from James Johnson, a pollster who worked in Downing Street when Theresa May was prime minister Your hourly reminder, this one’s from the Daily Mail’s John Stevens This is from Matt Goodwin, an academic specialising in why voters support rightwing populists The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the result was a “terrible” outcome for the Conservative party. He told BBC Breakfast: It’s clearly a terrible result for Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party, but I think one that they thoroughly deserve. He added: Clearly people have wanted to send a message to the government they’re fed up with the incompetence, the sleaze, the kind of revelations we’ve seen over the last few weeks. And I think the government has to take heed of that. [At] the minute it feels, to be frank, that this government is not in control of itself, let alone the country. And I think the result last night reflects that. Oliver Dowden said he is “confident” that an inquiry into alleged Covid rule-busting parties will “vindicate” Boris Johnson’s assertion that no restrictions were breached. The Tory party chairman told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I understand and I appreciate that there was a perception, particularly from the media coverage surrounding those alleged events, that we were not abiding by the rules. I have to say to you that there is an ongoing inquiry by the cabinet secretary and I’m confident that that inquiry will vindicate the prime minister’s assertion that everything that happened was within the rules. But I do appreciate the noise and the sound around that was something that was of concern to voters. These are from former politics professor and elections expert, Ivor Crewe. Crewe explains that the result in North Shropshire is unique as far as the loss of “true blue” seats go in that it was clearly a verdict on Boris Johnson’s character and the integrity of his government, as opposed to dissatisfaction with policies. This, from politics professor Philip Cowley, is noteworthy for context on just how astonishing the size of this Lib Dem victory is Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said he does not think the North Shropshire by-election result amounts to a “sea change” in British politics. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I would... note that this was a unique byelection caused by the resignation of an incumbent MP over sleaze. I would also note that if there was some massive sea change in the way that you describe in British politics, you would have expected the Labour Party, who were in a strong second place, to be surging ahead and winning. In fact, their vote sank. So, whilst I do very much hear voters’ frustrations, I don’t think it amounts to a sea change. This analysis is from The Spectator’s Katy Balls So, why did the Tories fail here? There has been much expectation management in recent days from Tory sources – with some Johnson allies arguing that it is more unusual for the governing party to win a by-election than to lose one. There had also been problems on the ground, the Tory candidate Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst was criticised for not being a local given he was based in Birmingham as well as anger over the ambulance services in the area. Yet this result clearly will be tied to Boris Johnson’s leadership and the difficult time the prime minister has had over the past month. While campaigners both for the Tories and the Lib Dems say sleaze only came up rarely on the doorstep, the Paterson row kicked off a chain of events that have seen Johnson’s personal ratings fall. Since that initial row – and failed attempt by Johnson to change the rules on MPs’s standards – Johnson has faced increased scrutiny over his Downing Street operation. His rambling speech to business leaders at the CBI in which he spoke about Peppa Pig regularly came up on the doorstep. What’s more, in the past week those canvassing say the ‘partygate’ row – over alleged Covid breaches last year in No 10 - had become a potent issue. While a by-election is more open to becoming a protest vote than a general election, the result will give Tory MPs pause for thought. North Shropshire is an area that voted heavily to leave and which ought to count as a Tory safe seat. What’s more, the main reason MPs back Johnson is not ideology but the fact they see him as a winner. If a majority of over 20,000 can be overturned in a seat like this, MPs with smaller majorities (particularly Lib Dem/Tory marginals) are going to grow much more concerned about the current direction of travel. Read the full piece here (paywall). Tory MP Sir Charles Walker, the former chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said he was not surprised the governing party lost in North Shropshire. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: People are tired, angry, exhausted, 20 months of a pandemic. It’s put government under the microscope, mistakes have been made. The prime minister will be the first to admit mistakes have been made. It’s a very, very difficult time for the country, for governments, and I would be surprised if we didn’t lose it. Of course, I’m sad we lost it but we sort of have defied political gravity for 11 years and we are now returning to business as usual I’m afraid. But he said he did not believe the Tories would have a leadership challenge in the midst of the Covid pandemic. It doesn’t meant the end, and it certainly doesn’t mean leadership challenges. I mean, the Conservative Party is not going to have a leadership challenge as we are heading into potential further restrictions around Covid, and difficulties around Covid. That would be completely self-indulgent. Senior Tory MP, John Redwood, has asked whether - in the wake of this defeat - the government will now reflect on its policy choices and said it’s time for them to “listen to Conservatives”. This is from The Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith And this is from the BBC’s Lewis Goodall (the whole thread is worth your time) More from Sir Roger Gale, who has represented North Thanet since 1983. The veteran Tory MP said Boris Johnson has to “prove” he is a capable leader, after the party removed Theresa May from office to promote him. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The Conservative Party has a reputation for not taking prisoners. If the prime minister fails, the prime minister goes. We got rid of a good prime minister to install Mr Johnson. Mr Johnson has to prove that he’s capable of being a good prime minister and at the moment it’s quite clear that the public don’t think that that’s the case. Gale, who previously said he reluctantly voted Remain in the Brexit referendum, added: This is nothing to do with Brexit at all, this is to do with the performance since Brexit. It goes back to Barnard Castle in my case. I was dissatisfied then because it was not firm government. And a lot of what has happened since then I think has made it clear that the prime minister and the people surrounding the prime minister are not the right people. If it is something of a cliche that the Conservatives can be brutal in how they treat leaders who no longer feel like electoral assets, this is arguably all the more so for Boris Johnson, whose primary attraction for many of his MPs was his appeal to voters. If that has gone, he should be worried. They key word is “if”. The Tories’ loss to the Liberal Democrats of North Shropshire – a seat they had held for all but two of the last 189 years – is an undeniable earthquake, but byelections have particular qualities, not least the greater ability for opposition support to coalesce around one party. They often do hold wider lessons for governments, though, even midterm ones that could expect to receive something of a kicking from the voters at the best of times. What will alarm Johnson’s aides are the many reports from North Shropshire of not just annoyance with the government but some fairly significant and personal distaste for the prime minister. This was a recurring theme of the last major byelection story, the Lib Dems’ overturning of a 16,000-strong Tory majority in Chesham and Amersham in June, but here at least some of this could be explained by a strain of liberal, internationalist Conservatism in the affluent commuter belt seat. North Shropshire is very different: largely rural and strongly pro-Brexit. But here, too, voters complained about a sense of being taken for granted by the Tories, and also a feeling that Johnson was slippery, and not sufficiently serious. Some Conservative MPs will thus awake on Friday with two calculations in mind. Firstly, if their party can lose a seat which had a near-23,000 majority, what would such a swing mean for them? Also, if voters dislike the prime minister in both Chesham and Amersham, and North Shropshire, where exactly is he still popular? One consolation for Downing Street is that such mutinous thoughts will largely not be discussed with fellow MPs, as the political firebreak of the Commons Christmas recess has begun, closing what has been perhaps the most politically damaging week of Johnson’s career. It included a buildup of damning publicity over two rolling stories: a series of reports of allegedly lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, Conservative HQ, and government departments; and the prospect of more revelations about how Johnson had the costly renovation of his official flat paid for. Amid all this, Johnson was leading the response to a huge wave of the Omicron variant, which required the rushing-in of his plan B suite of restrictions, including a return to home working, further mask use, and the introduction of mandatory Covid certificates to enter venues like nightclubs and football grounds. The latter plan was hugely unpopular among many Tory MPs, 99 of whom rebelled in a Commons vote on Tuesday, calling into question both Johnson’s authority and his ability to further tighten Covid rules if, as many public health experts predict, the Omicron wave worsens. Some Tories will note that the North Shropshire campaign was always going to be tricky for the government, given it was prompted by the resignation of the former environment secretary Owen Paterson, who had broken rules on paid lobbying. But even this, many will feel, was a situation mishandled by Johnson and his advisers. Paterson only stepped down after Downing Street U-turned on an attempt to save him from punishment by trying to unilaterally rewrite the entire disciplinary system for MPs, sparking a mass of stories about lobbying and second jobs. If, in contrast, Johnson had urged Paterson to quietly serve the 30-day suspension imposed as a punishment, that would all have ended this week, and the prime minister might have been going into Christmas in a happier position. Here is the full analysis: North Shropshire byelection earthquake delivers unhappy Christmas for Boris Johnson Here is Helen Morgan’s victory speech in full Oliver Dowden told Sky News this morning the circumstances of a “meeting” that took place in Downing Street during the first national lockdown were “appropriate and reasonable”. It has been alleged that Boris Johnson attended a party with staff at No 10 on 15 May last year. But Dowden referred to the event as a “meeting” and said that he did not think it would be necessary for the cabinet secretary Simon Case to investigate. I understand that this was a meeting that took place in the garden. Actually it was the case at the time if you are going to have a meeting you’re better off having it outside because of the fresh air and ventilation. Asked if there would be an investigation, he said: I have seen the account given by Downing Street that there was a meeting that took place, and it took place outside. I think that that was perfectly appropriate and reasonable. There had been a press conference previously, and it was perfectly reasonable to have the meeting afterwards outside. He added: I don’t think there’s a need for the cabinet secretary to look into this one because the circumstances appear to be pretty clear. This analysis of what the defeat could mean for the prime minister is from the BBC’s Ben Wright: The collapse of the Conservative vote in a once true blue, pro-Brexit seat is disastrous for Boris Johnson. The endless headlines about sleaze and parties, held in apparent breach of the government’s own rules, drove voters away from the Tories in remarkable numbers. Now, the question is whether Conservative MPs lose confidence in their leader. Many of them have been in despair about recent events. The readiness of Boris Johnson’s parliamentary party to defy his authority was shown this week when half of Conservative backbenchers voted against the government’s Covid measures. No 10 may try to brush off this by-election as mid-term malaise, a protest vote that should be kept in perspective. But just two years after winning an 80-seat majority for the Conservatives, some of Mr Johnson’s MPs may look at this result and ask if their leader is becoming a liability. The full BBC story is here. From the FT’s Jim Pickard Veteran Tory MP Sir Roger Gale said the Tories’ North Shropshire by-election defeat should be seen as a “referendum” on Boris Johnson’s premiership, adding “one more strike and he’s out”. Asked why the Tories lost, the North Thanet MP told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme said Johnson must take personal blame: Because the electorate wanted to send a very clear message to Downing Street that they were dissatisfied with the management of this government. I think this has to be seen as a referendum on the prime minister’s performance and I think that the prime minister is now in ‘last orders’ time. Two strikes already, one earlier this week in the vote in the Commons and now this. One more strike and he’s out. The Tory party chairman, Oliver Dowden, has told Sky News: Voters in North Shropshire were fed up and they gave us a kicking. I think they wanted to send us a message - and I want to say as chairman of the Conservative Party, we hear that loud and clear. But he also claimed the circumstances were “unique” and Boris Johnson “has the vision to get us through this period. He added: Voters are clearly fed up and they want us to get on with the job and focus on the job. Dowden also insisted Johnson was still an “electoral asset” for the Tories. Yes, I think the prime minister is an electoral asset for the Conservative Party, and I’ll tell you why. Just take the three really big calls we’ve faced. Get Brexit done: he’s delivered on it. We’ve delivered the fastest booster programme in the world twice over and we’ve seen the economy through this terrible period, with unemployment lower than when we entered. So I think actually on the big calls the prime minister has the vision and the direction to get us through this difficult period. These are from ITV’s Paul Brand, who points out that this result is another unforced error for the PM - if Owen Paterson had taken his original punishment his suspension would have been over by now. The Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, who was unable to attend the count in person after testing positive for Covid, said: This result is a watershed moment in our politics and offers hope to people around the country that a brighter future is possible. Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them. From Buckinghamshire to Shropshire, lifelong Conservatives have turned to the Liberal Democrats in their droves and sent a clear message to the prime minister that the party is over. He also tweeted: The calamitous collapse in Conservative support – a 34% swing in a seat where they had a near-23,000 majority in 2019 – will prompt significant jitters among many Tory MPs, and is likely to raise questions about Boris Johnson’s future. It was a swing even greater than the 25% seen last June when the Lib Dems won the Chesham and Amersham byelection. North Shropshire was seen as a notably greater challenge for the party, given it is a largely rural and strongly pro-Brexit constituency, one which has been Tory for all but two of the past 189 years, from 1904 to 1906. Morgan fought the seat in 2019 and came third, with 10% support. The byelection was called after the former environment secretary Owen Paterson resigned in the wake of a botched attempt by Downing Street to save him from punishment for a serious breach of lobbying rules by rewriting the disciplinary system for MPs, which set off a string of damaging stories about other Tory MPs’ second jobs. It was fought amid a wider atmosphere of damaging claims for Johnson and his government over allegations of lockdown-breaking Downing Street parties and a major Tory rebellion over Covid rules. In her victory speech, Helen Morgan, a 46-year-old accountant and parish councillor, repeatedly targeted the prime minister, saying Conservative voters had been “dismayed by Boris Johnson’s lack of decency and fed up with being taken for granted”. “Tonight, the people of North Shropshire have spoken on behalf of the British people,” she told the count in Shrewsbury. They have said loudly and clearly: Boris Johnson, the party is over. While earlier prime ministers “believed in a sense of national service”, Morgan said, with Johnson it was “all about you and never about us”. She added: Our country is crying out for leadership. Mr Johnson, you are no leader. The full story is here: North Shropshire byelection: Liberal Democrats win former safe Tory seat in blow to Johnson Good morning and welcome to the morning after the North Shropshire byelection. The Lib Dems have not only taken the previously safe Tory seat, they have done it with a majority of close to 6,000 - bookending a turbulent and damaging few weeks for Boris Johnson. Helen Morgan, the Lib Dem candidate, won 17,957 votes, ahead of the Conservatives’ Neil Shastri-Hurst, on 12,032, a majority of 5,925. Labour’s Ben Wood was third, with 3,686 votes. Turnout was 46.3%. That represents an astonishing 34-point swing away from the Conservatives - their majority in 2019 was almost 23,000.

          "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrats have won a stunning victory in the North Shropshire byelection, taking what had previously been a safe Conservative seat by a margin of nearly 6,000 votes, and capping a disastrous few weeks for Boris Johnson. Helen Morgan, the Lib Dem candidate, won 17,957 votes, ahead of the Conservatives’ Neil Shastri-Hurst, on 12,032, a majority of 5,925. Labour’s Ben Wood was third, with 3,686 votes.

In a statement he called the win “a watershed moment in our politics”. He said: “Millions of people are fed up with Boris Johnson and his failure to provide leadership throughout the pandemic and last night the voters of North Shropshire spoke for all of them. This is the second stunning byelection victory this year for the Liberal Democrats - both in formerly safe Conservative seats.” Leaving the count, Shastri-Hurst – who on Wednesday had declined four times during an interview to say that he believed Johnson was “a man of honesty and integrity” – gave no criticism of the prime minister. Asked if Johnson was to blame, he said only that it had been “a disappointing result for us”, adding: “We’re 11 years into a Conservative government, byelections are never an easy thing to do.” North Shropshire has been a safe Tory seat since its creation The result will also raise questions about the Tories’ choice of an outsider to be their candidate. Shastri-Hurst is a barrister from Birmingham, something which prompted annoyance among some voters. As soon as the byelection was called, the Lib Dems sought to present themselves as the only party capable of beating the Conservatives, and poured enormous resources into the area. Labour’s Wood campaigned hard but received notably less support from his party HQ. The byelection was seen as notably difficult to predict given both the short timetable and the number of candidates, totalling 14."

          "headline": "Sampdoria’s Morten Thorsby: ‘They call me football’s Greta Thunberg’",
          "bodyText": "“I was living on my own for the first time and had a lot of time to read,” says the Sampdoria and Norway midfielder Morten Thorsby, explaining how he went from caring about the environment to becoming a climate emergency activist during his time at Heerenveen. One campaign in particular made him sit up and take notice, the Guardian’s Keep it in the ground forcing him to have a serious discussion with himself and what he was doing. “It is such a big issue and no one else was talking about it,” he says. “That made me sad, depressed even.” He considered quitting football. “I thought: ‘We have a mega problem here and what am I doing? Playing football.’ That didn’t make sense to me.” Having talked about it with family and friends he found a novel approach: trying to open the eyes of those around him. “The football industry is lagging behind when it should be leading,” he says. “It can make a huge difference, it could be our salvation even. Three and a half billion people around the world watch football. There is no social phenomenon that touches so many people. There are no bigger influencers than football stars.” Thorsby started We Play Green, an “independent collaboration platform for professional football players who want to help the planet out of the climate crisis”. His first small steps took place in Heerenveen, where he played between 2014 and 2019. He started cycling from the training complex to the stadium but was laughed at. He then said why he did it and challenged his colleagues to start doing the same. “At first you are frowned upon,” he says. “But they gradually came around and the club provided the bikes.” Laughing, he adds: “But if the weather was suddenly really bad they were less happy with me.” Thorsby joined a working group with people from the club and sponsors to make Heerenveen more sustainable. Solar panels were installed at the stadium and less meat was on the menu. Heerenveen were given the award for most sustainable stadium in 2016. “They are small steps but if they are publicised they become bigger,” Thorsby says. “That is the power of football.” He found an ally in the Dutch goalkeeper Maarten de Fockert, who joined Heerenveen at the same time as Thorsby. De Fockert describes Thorsby as “a mountain man”, saying: “He is not super-fast on the pitch but when we went hiking through the Norwegian mountains it seemed like I was standing still; that’s how fast he was. After five hours he would say: we are lost. He liked that. I panicked. We suddenly shot down a slope. I thought I was dying, he enjoyed it. He is really at one with nature.” De Fockert calls Thorsby “very solution-oriented”. He tells how the Norwegian put tape on his plastic bottle at Heerenveen and wrote his name on it so he could reuse it. “He then doesn’t immediately start shouting that everyone should do that. Morten is kind, authentic and a go-getter. As a result, he gets a lot done.” Thorsby says it is important to make it personal and not use complicated language. “Clean water and clean air for our children – that’s the message. Who wouldn’t want that?” Is it difficult to get footballers to think about it? “Yes, it is,” he says. “In the dressing room I am still the ‘green boy’ who is laughed at when he does something less sustainable himself. In Italy, they call me the Greta Thunberg of football. It’s fine – I have enormous admiration for her. “The mistake the environmental movement has made in the last 20 years is to force it down people’s throats. It’s better to create an atmosphere where it becomes a joint project. Inspire and motivate people to show there are so many things we can do. You can already eat super-tasty things without meat and with lots of vegetables. It’s healthier, you feel better and you do something good for nature. “Greta Thunberg appeals to the 20% who are already doing something. But the rest must also move in that direction. I want a 100% who take small steps, because many small steps lead to big steps. Government leaders at environmental conferences must feel supported by their people to make changes.” The task now is to raise funding and build an organisation that will prompt more players to support his initiative. A handful have joined, including Norway’s Mats Møller Dæhli, CSKA Moscow’s Emil Bohinen, the Odd goalkeeper Sondre Rossbach, the Juventus Women midfielder Sofie Junge Pedersen, De Fockert, who has retired, and the former Newcastle player Siem de Jong. Does he sometimes feel like a lone voice? “I know there are many players interested,” says Thorsby, who last month won the 2021 Fifpro Player Activism award. “They are waiting until we are ready, until we have funded the entire campaign. I can completely understand if players don’t speak out. Everyone is allowed to make their own choices. I just try to encourage them, because we need young people to influence others. Footballers have a responsibility.” The Black Lives Matter movement has been hugely supported by football, the climate crisis campaign less so. Why? “Racism is a question of yes or no and everyone says no. For a long time there was a lot of misinformation about climate change that made people wonder if it’s really that bad. Now that there are floods and forest fires in Europe, things are already changing. To be honest, professional footballers do a lot of things that are not good for the environment. And everyone feels attacked when they don’t do something right. “I try to make it clear to them that if you just, for example, use the dryer a little less or don’t eat meat at lunch any more, you’re already making a difference. Take a commercial flight instead of a private jet. Drive an electric car. And then it would be great if players share that with their followers on social media.” Twice Thorsby has participated in plastic collections in Genoa. He has also met local authorities to get more trees planted and made the case for separate waste recycling. At the beginning of this season he swapped to wearing No 2 to draw attention to the United Nations’ goal of keeping global warming well below two degrees celsius. “I wanted No 15 and then a dot between the one and the five but that wasn’t possible. No 2 was fortunately still free.” The Sampdoria captain, Fabio Quagliarella, was bemused as to why the midfielder had picked that number but as soon as Thorsby explained the striker was on board and asked him to tell the rest of his teammates. He received a huge applause after he told them. Thorsby has met the Italian environment minister, the Norwegian prime minister and spoken to Frans Timmermans, who is leading the European Commission’s work on the European Green Deal and its first European climate law. He was energised by an online meeting with Timmermans, which also included De Fockert and De Jong. “Frans is a big football fan and heard about the reasons behind my change of number,” Thorsby says. “He supports us and wants to work together. That’s fantastic and thanks to football.” A version of this article was published in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant in November"

          "headline": "Data shows majority of choice super funds in Australia perform poorly",
          "bodyText": "More than 60% of super fund investment options where members can choose how to invest their money fail to deliver good returns, statistics released by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) show. Poorly performing funds in the “choice” sector also tend to have higher fees that eat into their returns, the data reveals. It is the first time Apra has examined the performance of choice funds, which allow members to choose from a menu of investment options. The funds contained in the data manage $394bn of retirement savings, which is about 40% of the choice market. Apra plans to expand its coverage of the choice market in future reports, but has started with products where retirement savers put their money into a basket of different types of assets. This is because data is available on these funds and they are comparable to MySuper products, which are supposed to be simpler low-fee investments. Apra said there were eight choice products with consistently bad returns over seven years: EISS, Aware Super – Tailored, BT Super For Life, Australian Catholic Super – Personal, Christian Super, OnePath OneAnswer Frontier, Zurich and Perpetual WealthFocus. BT is owned by Westpac, which is trying to sell the business; OnePath is owned by insurer Zurich, which is also on the list in its own right; and Perpetual is a stand-alone investment advice company. The remainder are profit-to-member funds. Along with the choice fund data, Apra updated its heatmap of the performance of MySuper products. Christian Super, EISS and Australian Catholic Super, which is not to be confused with the similarly named Catholic Super, also offer MySuper products that failed Apra’s performance test. Among the choice products Apra looked at, 61% had consistently poor performance, delivering returns to members that were below a benchmark set by the regulator for seven years. A quarter delivered what Apra described as “significantly poor performance” of 0.5% or worse below the benchmark over the seven year period. This is worse than the situation among MySuper funds, where 45% of products underperformed and 16% delivered returns 0.5% a year worse than the benchmark. Fees are also higher in choice funds. The median administration fee for a choice fund with a $50,000 balance is $218 a year, compared to $168 for a Mysuper product. Apra has slapped a “crimson” fee warning on 30 choice products that charge more than $300 a year on a $50,000 balance. Eight products combined high fees with poor performance. The regulator said that although choice funds often offered extra services to members, their trustees still needed to be able to justify what they charged as being in the best financial interests of members. If they could not do this they should cut fees, it said. It also called on fund trustees in charge of underperforming products to take action to improve returns to members. Apra executive board member Margaret Cole said super fund members “deserve confidence that their retirement savings are being well-looked after, regardless of what type of fund or product their money is invested in”. “Although there have been benefits generated for members from industry consolidation and reductions in fees in recent years, these heatmaps show there remains considerable room for improvement in member outcomes. “In particular, a sizeable proportion of the choice sector has been exposed for delivering poor outcomes, especially considering these products generally charge higher fees than their MySuper equivalents.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said trustees had a legal duty to act in the best financial interests of members and those in charge of underperforming funds should “prompt action to address areas of concern”. “If they are unable or unwilling to do so, they need seriously to reconsider whether their members would be better served with their money elsewhere.”"

          "headline": "Byelection loss would be ‘absolute disaster’ for PM, say Tory MPs",
          "bodyText": "A Conservative loss in the North Shropshire byelection would be “an absolute disaster” for Boris Johnson and would prompt calls for a complete shake-up of the Downing Street operation, Tory MPs have said ahead of the crucial vote on Thursday. Such are the low expectations following a bruising series of weeks for the prime minister that even a narrow win in the usually ultra-safe Tory seat would be viewed as a relief, they added. The vote in the constituency won by Owen Paterson in 2019 with a majority of nearly 23,000 is still seen as too close to call with any confidence. The odds still favour Neil Shastri-Hurst becoming the latest in an almost unbroken line of local Conservative MPs. However, the scale of the Liberal Democrat challenge in a seat where they came third in the last election is causing significant jitters among Tories. A Lib Dem victory would be a political earthquake even greater than their Chesham and Amersham victory in June, and would cap a disastrous week for Johnson after Tuesday’s rebellion by 99 Conservative backbenchers over new Covid rules. This in turn followed weeks of damaging headlines about outside earnings by Tory MPs – the byelection was called when Paterson resigned after a botched No 10 attempt to save him from punishment for illicit lobbying – and details of lockdown-breaking No 10 parties. Tory hopes rest mainly on local supporters in North Shropshire being less willing to switch sides than their counterparts in the London commuter belt in June, with enough people deciding to stay at home so Shastri-Hurst squeaks to a narrow win. “If we lose, it would be an absolute disaster for the prime minister,” one Conservative MP said. “But if it’s just a case of Tory voters sitting on our hands, and the majority going down, that’s largely priced in. We’re at our lowest point, and we’ve all accepted it will be a disappointment. “But it does show how bad things have got, that even hanging on to such a safe seat would be seen as a good result. We wouldn’t have thought that a few weeks ago.” Another MP said the 2019 intake of Conservatives were particularly spooked: “They’ve not been through many byelections before and feel like their majorities are getting smaller every week. I’m concerned they might act like headless chickens if we lose North Shropshire.” Such a loss should prompt “radical changes” to the Downing Street and whipping operations, they said. “People have been loyal so far but have been showing their teeth in recent months and a loss will make things worse for the PM. There’s no authority, there’s no control.” With the mood inside Downing Street described as simply trying to make it to Christmas, the hope in No 10 is that a win in North Shropshire will send Conservative MPs into recess in a slightly less mutinous mood. The scale of unrest was highlighted on Tuesday when the Covid rebels included Louie French, who was elected less than two weeks before in the byelection in Old Bexley and Sidcup. In another notable vignette, in an interview on Wednesday, Shastri-Hurst declined four times to say he believed Johnson was “a man of honesty and integrity”. Quizzed by the journalist Michael Crick, Shastri-Hurst deflected the questions by saying Johnson had ordered an inquiry into claims of lockdown-defying parties, eventually saying: “I have no reason to question the prime minister’s integrity.” Some Tories have questioned the decision to select a barrister from Birmingham to fight the largely rural seat. “He seems perfectly nice and capable, but it was clearly someone in CCHQ going, ‘Birmingham doesn’t look that far from Shropshire on a map, it’ll be fine,’” one MP said. The Lib Dems, meanwhile, have been pinning their hopes on enough Labour and Green supporters voting tactically. “You get the feeling some might only decide in the voting booth,” one campaigner said. “So much could depend on what happens on the day.”"

          "headline": "Increase in UK state pension age to 68 could come eight years early",
          "bodyText": "Millions of people born in the 1970s may have to wait longer to collect their UK state pensions if a government review, which was announced this week, recommends bringing forward plans for a retirement age of 68. The state pension age rose to 66 last year, with two further rises planned, meaning that by 2046 those born on or after April 1977 would need to wait until 68 before they can draw the benefit. However, the review will look at bringing forward that change by eight years, so that the increase is phased in between 2037 and 2039. The state payment is paid to anyone who has made at least 10 years’ worth of national insurance contributions during their working lifetime. The maximum payment is £179.60 a week, but how much you get depends on how many years you contributed for. The government is obliged to regularly re-evaluate the state retirement age, and it must publish the results of the latest review by 7 May 2023. It said Britain’s ageing population meant it needed to make sure decisions on how to manage the cost of the state pension system were “robust, fair and transparent for taxpayers now and in the future”. The review will also look at the way the pension age is set, and what data could be taken into account when deciding on a fair retirement age. Becky O’Connor, the head of pensions and savings at the website interactive investor, said: “The idea of a long, enjoyable retirement seems set to be consigned to the history books. “It’s no wonder today’s younger workers have little faith in the state pension being there for them at all when they stop work, with many thinking they’ll end up working forever.” She added: “For those who find they can no longer work before they reach 68 because of age-related ill health, the inability to claim state pension presents huge issues. The age at which people can expect to start to experience health problems that might prevent them working is around 63, which could leave many people facing several years where they either have to rely on private pension provision, which may be inadequate anyway, or other benefits.” Helen Morrissey, a senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “While it had been proposed that the increase in state pension age to age 68 should be moved forward to 2037-39 – from 2044-46 – an analysis of the latest life expectancy data as part of this review could stop this in its tracks.” Morrissey said the review it could also prompt a closer look at the pensions triple lock – the government promise to link pension rises to earnings, inflation or 2.5%, which ever it higher. That policy has been partly suspended this year as a result of high wage rises. One issue that has been raised by some critics of the current system is the impact of different life expectancy rates around the country. A recent report found that while a man living in the London borough of Westminster could be expected to live until the age of 84.7 years, in Blackpool it would be 74.1 years."

          "headline": "MPs back all ‘plan B’ measures amid large Tory rebellion on Covid passes and mandatory vaccines – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against plans for Covid vaccine certificates for some large venues in England – marking the largest rebellion of Boris Johnson’s premiership. The number of rebels far exceeds Johnson’s parliamentary majority of 79 – and the 56 MPs needed to trigger a vote of no confidence in his leadership. In a separate vote, 63 Tories voted against mandatory vaccinations for NHS and social care staff in England. Labour supported the measure but Keir Starmer suffered his own rebellion, with 22 Labour MPs voting against. MPs also backed compulsory face coverings in more indoor public places including museums and galleries, as well as allowing fully vaccinated people who come into contact with a Covid case to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days, rather than self-isolating Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a senior member of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said a leadership challenge in the New Year is “on the cards” unless the PM unites the party by delivering a “major change in the way he does things”. Labour leader Keir Starmer said the rebellions were “a very significant blow to the already damaged authority of the prime minister” but stopped short of explicitly calling for him to resign Here is the moment Keir Starmer said the prime minister “needs to take a long, hard look at himself” and “ask himself whether he has the authority” to lead the country. The Daily Mirror has published a photo showing a “raucous” Christmas party thrown by Conservative aides on December 14 last year, when London was in Tier 2. The image shows 24 people crowded together in a medium-sized room in the party’s Westminster HQ, with guests including billionaire Tory donor Nick Candy and a senior figure on Boris Johnson’s leadership election campaign. From the Mirror’s Pippa Crerar: Just hours before the biggest rebellion of his premiership, one of Boris Johnson’s key allies was asked about the possibility of a challenge to the prime minister’s position. “It is a very difficult thing to do, as you may remember with the previous incumbent,” said Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaking on his Moggcast podcast on ConservativeHome. It is indeed a tough hurdle to get more than 50 sitting Conservative MPs to submit no confidence letters in their leader and prime minister. But as in the case of Theresa May, ousted by Rees-Mogg and his allies, it is not insurmountable. Anti-Johnson feeling on the backbenches is running high partly because of his botched handling of sleaze scandals and the furore over lockdown parties in Downing Street. However, an equally sizeable reason for discontent is rightwing, libertarian MPs unhappy with the ideological basis for Covid restrictions. Rees-Mogg remains very loyal to the prime minister but at the same time made no attempt in his podcast to deny the existence of a mutinous mood within the Tory ranks in parliament. The prime minister personally pleaded with the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers to back his plan B measures before the vote on Tuesday evening. But nearly 100 Tory MPs directly challenged his authority by voting against Covid passports for entry to nightclubs and other large venues. That means almost a third of all Tory MPs and most backbenchers have now put the prime minister on notice that they are extremely unhappy with the idea of further restrictions. Since Brexit, the Tory party has thrown out its more centre-right, moderate voices. As a direct consequence, the main strain of opinion in the Conservatives is now inherently more lockdown-sceptic, freedom-loving, anti-mask than the party of David Cameron might have been. If Johnson does need to opt for stricter, plan C measures in the face of a rising tide of Omicron, he will now find himself in the same position as May did over Brexit – attempting to rely on Labour votes in the face of a revolt on the right. Read the full story here: Keir Starmer has stopped short of explicitly calling for Boris Johnson to resign. Asked whether he thought Conservative MPs should be writing to the 1922 Committee to prompt a leadership election, he told broadcasters: He has an 80-seat majority and he’s just had, you know, 90 or 100 of his own MPs voting against him on a three-line whip, that’s a significant blow to the authority of the Prime Minister. Just when we need decisive decisions in this pandemic, it’s the worst possible leader at the worst possible time. Asked again if Tory rebels should try and get rid of the prime minister, the Labour leader replied: Well, the Prime Minister needs to ask himself the question whether he has the authority to lead this country through this pandemic. It looks like the number of Conservative MPs who voted against Covid passes tonight could be more than previously reported. From Sky’s Sam Coates: Several people have pointed out that the vote over Covid passes marks one of the biggest rebellions any Conservative leader has ever suffered. From Times Radio’s Tom Newton Dunn: And Prospect magazine’s Tom Clark: And as policy expert Sam Freedman reminds us, the Brexit deal defeat was a huge blow for Theresa May and led to Jeremy Corbyn tabling a dramatic no-confidence motion in the Commons. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has responded to tonight’s vote, saying the Tory rebellion “makes all UK nations less safe”. Among those who voted against mandatory vaccination for NHS workers and against Covid passes was independent Jeremy Corbyn. The former Labour leader had earlier tweeted: Here is the moment Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the Conservative 1922 Committee, said a leadership challenge is “on the cards” for Boris Johnson is he fails to “change his approach”. Building on that, pundits have pointed out that both Tory MPs who won their seats in byelections this year – Jill Mortimer in Hartlepool and Louie French (the party’s newest MP) in Old Bexley and Sidcup – rebelled against the government on Covid passes. This analysis is from Sky’s Kate McCann From the BBC’s Nick Eardley on what tonight’s hefty rebellion signifies for Boris Johnson and his government An observation from the Times’s Patrick Maguire on the vote on Covid passes In fact there were 96 Tory MPs voting against the government on Covid passes, plus two Tory MPs acting as tellers, according to the division list on the Commons website. There were also 10 Liberal Democrats, eight Labour MPs, six DUP MPs, two independent MPs and one Green MP voting against. The list is here. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Lucy Campbell is now taking over. In the final vote MPs have voted for mandatory vaccination for frontline NHS workers by 385 votes to 100 – a majority of 285. Asked if he is saying next year there could be a leadership challenge, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown replies: “That’s got to be on the cards.” Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the Conservative 1922 Committee, is asked about the latest claim that there were 103 rebels in the second vote. (That might be 101 Tories voting against, plus two tellers.) He says this means Boris Johnson has to change the way he operates, and consult the party more. If he doesn’t, the party is in trouble, he says. From ITV’s political editor Robert Peston The Times’ Henry Zeffman points out that seven former ministers were among the Tory rebels on the first vote. According to Labour sources, there were 101 Tory rebels, Sky is reporting. Boris Johnson has endured what looks like a much larger rebellion. The Covid pass regulations passed by 369 votes to 126 – a majority of 243. There will be more opposition MPs voting against this time but, judging by what was said during the debate, a majority of those 126 no votes are likely to be Tory. There were also 46 Tory MPs who did not vote in the first division. But they were almost matched by the 45 Labour MPs who did not vote. The list of MPs who did not vote is here. Thirty eight Tory MPs voted against the government in the first division. They are listed here. And there were two Tory tellers, meaning 40 Tories in total rebelled in this division. Three DUP MPs also voted against the government. According to Jason Groves, government sources are now saying that parliament definitely will be recalled if new Covid regulations are needed over Christmas. Given that this is an assurance many Tory MPs have been demanding, it is surprising that ministers did not announce it in the debate, or that Boris Johnson did not make this more explicit when he spoke to the 1922 Committee. (See 6.45pm.) The second statutory instrument, changing the self-isolation rules, went through on the nod. It is here (pdf) in the unlikely event that anyone wants to read the legal text. That means the vote likely to cause Boris Johnson the most trouble, the vote on Covid passports (or vaccine passports, as the critics call them - even though a negative lateral flow test will count for people who are not fully vaccinated) is happening now. Here is the text (pdf) of the SI implementing this. The face mask regulations passed by 441 votes to 41 – a majority of 400. Most of the 41 MPs will have been Tories – we will get the full division list later – and these are the hardcore rebels, willing to vote against something seen as acceptable by Tory MPs rebelling over Covid passed. This is from the Times’s Steven Swinford on what Boris Johnson told the Conservative 1922 Committee this evening. Committing to give MPs a say on future regulations is little more than saying he will obey the law. Ministers can use secondary legislation to pass public health regulations before MPs have voted to approve those measures, and this happened frequently during lockdown last year. But normally secondary legislation implemented in this way has to be approved retrospectively by MPs, otherwise it lapses. As the i’s Paul Waugh reports, voting could take a bit longer than usual tonight because a bit more time has been allowed to enable MPs to observe some social distancing. The tellers for the noes are the Tory MPs Philip Hollobone and Jackie Doyle-Price. They are veteran rebels on Covid issues, as this chart shows. MPs are now voting on the first statutory instrument – the one requiring face masks to be worn in England in most public indoor venues. The SI is here (pdf). Barclay turns to what happens to people currently in hotel quarantine. He says the government will release people from quarantine, and let them follow the rules as if they had arrived from a non-red-list country. If people have tested positive, they will have to stay in quarantine. But he says this will require changes to legislation. He says the government will try to do this as quickly as possible. Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, is winding up for the government. He says South Africa has still not reached the peak of cases, and we don’t know how high the peak will be. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, will appear in an advert shown on ITV tonight urging people to get a booster jab. It will be part of what the Department for Health and Social Care says will be a “multimedia marketing blitz”. Commenting on the latest booster jab figures, the DHSC says: The NHS in England experienced its busiest Monday ever for vaccinations yesterdaysince the rollout began in December last year and 418,000 boosters were delivered yesterday alone, with 185,000 of these delivered by community pharmacies. In the Commons Andrew Gwynne, a shadow health minister, is now winding up for Labour. The votes are due to start at 6.30pm. Bob Seely (Con) says he is fed up with “dubious forecasts and ridiculous extrapolations”. He says even academics have criticised modelling like the recent paper from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine that says Omicron could kill 75,000 people. It could, but it might not. Like other Tory MPs opposed to Covid passports, he cites the Scottish governmnent’s paper, saying it shows the evidence does not back the plans. Richard Drax (Con) told MPs that he would be voting against the government measures because they were wrong. He said it was time to “put fear to one side” and let people get on with their lives. The Telegraph’s Christopher Hope and the Mail’s John Stevens have a bit more on the PM’s appearance before the 1922 Committee. In the Commons Anthony Mangnall (Con) says vaccine passports do not work. He claims the 70-page report on Covid passports produced by the Scottish government showed this. He also criticise the government for spreading fear. There are almost no opposition MPs left in the Commons chamber, and it is now just Conservative backbenchers speaking. They have been far more vocal in their opposition to these measures than opposition MPs have. Greg Smith (Con) is speaking now. He says he won’t be supporting the measures. Like Andrea Leadsom, he says (see 5.29pm), he sees these as slippery slope. He thinks they are leading to a fundamental change in the relationship between citizen and state. He says he is worried about the mental health impact of restrictions. And he is worried about the impact on hospitality. In his constituency he has heard of firms losing up to 50% of Christmas bookings. Boris Johnson has released an open letter to NHS staff thanking them for their work during the pandemic and asking them to help deliver the booster rollout. Boris Johnson has just arrived for a meeting with the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope reports. Back in the Commons Andrea Leadsom, the former Conservative cabinet minister, says Covid regulations are causing harm. She cites the example a person with dementia terrified of face masks, or an eight-year-old constituent who got stuck in South Africa. She says the government should be focusing on positive measures - promoting booster jabs, and educating people about health - not criminalising people. I cannot see where this will end. Covid will be with us for many years to come. And it’s unthinkable that every autumn we will be limiting the quality of life for all citizens just to be on the safe side. Justifying our new illiberal rules on the basis that they’re less authoritarian than those of other countries is truly appalling. That is not our culture, that is not our history. This is a slippery slope down which I do not want to slip.So I’m afraid I’m not going to be supporting these measures. And Labour’s Jess Phillips seems to be isolating too. At this rate, there won’t be many MPs left for the vote tonight. The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, will miss the vote because he is isolating. Jane Stevenson (Con) says she would like to see the government getting back to the Conservative principle of trusting the public. She says she will support some, but not all, of the measures tonight. But she does want to move on from passing “never-ending regulations”. Fleur Anderson (Lab) asks why the Tories MPs opposed to the “papers please” aspect of Covid passes are not opposing the elections bill, which is requiring people to produce photo ID when they vote. She also says Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, gave a “chilling” briefing to MPs earlier. He said, with Omicron, the breaks were off, in terms of how it is spreading. Sara Britcliffe (Con) indicates she is supporting the government on these measurs but she says, if it wants to move to plan C, it needs to bring those measures to the Commons. Rachael Maskell (Lab) says, as a former healthcare worker, she cannot support mandatory vaccination for NHS staff. She says it is unnecessary; healthcare workers already pay great attention to patient safety, she says. And she says this will discriminate against black members of staff, who are less likely to be vaccinated. The NHS should be winning over their confidence, not penalising them. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, intervenes. He says attempting to force people to get vaccinated is “totally wrong”. Andrew Bridgen (Con) told MPs that parliament should only pass evidence-based legislation that works. It is essential that it [legislation] is effective, evidence-based, logical and it needs to have broad public support and what I see in front of us today in regard to plan B, delivers on virtually none of these items. It’s clear that these measures before us today are being treated with strong suspicion of a wider agenda, partly because they simply will not deliver on their supposed intentions. But he said vaccine passports and mandatory vaccination for NHS staff would not pass this test. Vaccinated people could still pass on the virus, he said. All the evidence suggests Omicron is milder than over variants, he said. He said the most dangerous epidemic facing the world today was the epidemic of fear. Back in the debate Mark Harper (Con), chair of the Covid Recovery Group, which represents lockdown-sceptic Tories, told MPs that when the government orginally published its plan B, the Covid pass plan would have been vaccination only. He said ministers only included negative lateral flow tests to win over the opposition. He is right. The autumn and winter plan for Covid published earlier this year said plan B would include “introducing mandatory vaccine-only Covid-status certification in certain settings”. UPDATE: Harper said: They are very limited at the moment about what is proposed [in terms of Covid passes], but that was true everywhere they were introduced around the world. Everywhere they have been introduced, they have extended it, in terms of the venues they apply to. Anyone who thinks that they are going to stick to what is currently on the order paper, I am afraid are kidding themselves. In the government’s own plan B it is very clear ministers’ preference is for vaccine-only passports. It is very clear to me that the only reason why tests have been incorporated is to buy or secure the support of the opposition. That is the only reason. So we know what ministers would like to do if they could get away with it. The UK has recorded 59,610 more Covid cases, according to the government’s dashboard. That is the highest daily total since early January, when 59,937 cases were recorded on 9 January. The total number of cases over the past week is 12.1% up on the previous week. There have also been 150 further deaths, but deaths are down 6.5% week on week. Back in the Commons debate Andrew Murrison (Con) says members of the public would not expect MPs to be on recess when important decisions should be taken. He says he would urge ministers to cancel recess so that MPs sit next week, and the week after. Murrison, a doctor, also says he hopes ministers will rethink the plan for mandatory vaccines for NHS workers. He says it is argued that, because surgeons need to be vaccinated against hepatitis B, there is precedent. But with hepatitis there is no alternative to the vaccine, he says. With Covid, there is; daily lateral flow tests could offer the same protection. Speaking at a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus (APPG) earlier to discuss the Omicron variant, Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the Sage sub-committee advising on behavioural science and professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews, warned that it would take several weeks to roll out booster jabs and another couple of weeks before the take effect. He said: If we were to do nothing now, by then the cases would be catastrophically high. So we need to bring cases down in order to give us time to vaccinate. Reicher added that a simple metric from the pandemic is that the rate of infection depends upon the rate of contacts, adding that while the contact rates remain below pre-pandemic levels they have risen as restrictions have been eased. “There are two ways you can bring them down,” said Reicher. “You can bring them down by giving very clear advice, which is don’t socialise. If you do socialise now you won’t be able to socialise at Christmas.” The alternative, he said, is that socialisation can be limited by legislation. “Now, that’s a very real debate. But it seems to me that’s the only debate that should be being had right now, not whether but how we bring down the level of contact,” said Reicher. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, says 650,000 booster jab appointments were booked in England yesterday. Back in the Commons Steve Brine (Con) says many of his constituents have objected to the “frightening nature” of the PM’s TV broadcast on Sunday night (when he warned “a tidal wave of Omicron is coming). He says, instead of “panic stations”, we need a plan to live with Covid. And he says he will not support the Covid passports plan. Scots should limit their indoor social mixing to no more than three households over the festive season, but family Christmas celebrations can go ahead, Nicola Sturgeon has said. My colleague Libby Brooks has the full story here. More than 3m booster and third doses of Covid vaccine have been delivered across the UK in the past week - the highest number for any seven-day period since the rollout of extra doses began, PA Media reports. PA says: A total of 3,165,642 booster and third doses were given in the week to 13 December, including 513,722 on Monday. This is the most extra doses reported for a Monday so far. It is also close to the highest number of extra doses of vaccine reported for a single day, which is 550,253 for Saturday 11 December. The figures, from the four UK health agencies, show that more than 24m extra doses have now been delivered in the UK. Around 45% of all people aged 18 and over in the UK are now likely to have received either a booster or third dose of Covid vaccine, according to analysis by the PA news agency. The chief medical officers for the four nations of the UK have issued a joint statement saying the 15-minute waiting period after Covid-19 booster vaccines - to allow staff to check the patient does not have an adverse reaction - should be temporarily suspended to allow for more people to get vaccinated. They said suspending this rule temporarily would speed up the process. The statement went on: The 15-minute wait should therefore be suspended for first, second and homologous or heterologous boost vaccinations with mRNA vaccine given the current situation, with this operationalised in line with the needs in each of the four nations. The long-term decisions on the 15-minute wait, when the current need for extreme speed of vaccination and boosting is over, should rest with the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). This is the statement Sajid Javid referred to in the debate earlier. (See 2.19pm.) Back in the Commons Caroline Lucas (Green) says the government has not made the case for vaccination passports. She says she wants more people to get vaccinated, but passports can entrench opposition, she says. In the Commons Labour’s Graham Stringer is speaking, and Steve Baker (Con), who has been strongly critical of Covid restrictions, intervenes. He says he has read the impact assessment for the mandatory vaccination for NHS frontline workers regulatoins. He says it says that it says that 88,000 people will leave the health sector because of these measures - 73,000 from the NHS, 15,000 from the independent health sector - and 35,000 from domiciliary care. He says that is reason enough to vote against. Back in the debate, asked if he agrees that parliament should be recalled over Christmas if new measures re needed, Streeting says it would be strange for MPs to have talked so much about parliamentary sovereignty in the Brexit debates for it to be ignored now. This is from Stephen Morgan, the shadow schools minister, on the latest school absence figures for England. (See 2.52pm.) Hundreds of thousands of children are facing continued disruption to their education because of the Conservatives’ failure to prioritise schoolchildren ... Labour is calling on ministers to deliver a Christmas vaccine guarantee to ensure all 12- to 15-year-olds can get a jab during the holidays to keep kids learning next term. This must be delivered alongside practical ventilation measures in all schools, so teachers are not forced to open windows this winter. Bob Seely (Con) asks Streeting to acknowledge that, while vaccination might protect the vaccinated person from Covid, it won’t stop them spreading the infection. Streeting says Seely does not realise that the main advantage from mandatory vaccination is that it would protect the NHS because it would stop staff falling ill. Back in the Commons Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is taking some criticism from Labour MPs unhappy about the party backing mandatory vaccination for NHS staff. Streeting says the party is backing mandatory vaccination partly because of what happened when this was introduced for social care staff. He says we did not see the “collapse in the social care workforce numbers that we were warned of”. And he says there is lots of evidence it had a positive impact on vaccine take-up. But he also stresses his admiration for how the Welsh government has focused on encouraging the workforce to do the same. He says the UK government should also be cooperating with the workforce in the same way. Rishi Sunak has issued a stark warning to Department of Health officials over the multibillion-pound cost of regular booster rollouts, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Turning to the plan for mandatory vaccintion for NHS staff, Streeting says staff who are unwilling to be vaccinated could be redeployed. Having NHS staff fully vaccinated will protect patients, he says. He asks why NHS staff should have to work alongside people who will not get vaccinated. And he asks how MPs would feel if a loved one contracted Covid from an unvaccinated member of the NHS staff. Streeting says he does not accept that Covid passes are a threat to business. He says they will give customers the confidence to keep attending events. One of the reasons Labour is in favour is because it supports business, he says. And he says they are not vaccine passports. Rather, they are about having a deeper requirment to show a negative test, he says. He also claims that countries like France and Denmark, with stricter Covid passport rules, have all seen their retail and recreation sectors prosper more than those in the UK. Back in the Commons Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is responding to Sajid Javid. He says he hopes the tone of the debate will be reasonable. And, in a swipe at the Tory Marcus Fysh, he says it should not be up to the opposition to say that these measures do not bear comparison with 1930s Germany. (See 9.55am.) Labour is supporting the measures, he says. But he says the NHS is in a weaker state to deal with Omicron because of what has happened under the Tories, including record waiting lists, 100,000 staff vacancies and more than 100,000 vacancies in social care. He goes on: It wasn’t just that they didn’t fix the roof while the sun was shining, it’s that they dismantled the roof and removed the floorboards, and now the NHS is locked in a race against time, a race against the fastest variant of Covid-19 we have seen to date. One in every 30 primary school pupils in England was absent from the classroom last week for Covid-related reasons, according to government statistics that reveal how younger children had become the most affected even before the spread of the Omicron variant. The figures released by the Department for Education showed that a record 146,000 primary school pupils were absent from on 9 December, or 3.3%, with the total including a record 65,900 off with confirmed cases of Covid. A further 56,700 were off with suspected cases. The figures suggest that while vaccinations and measures such as mask-wearing may be keeping infections down in secondary schools, primary school-aged children are now the most vulnerable cohort. While 1.3% of secondary school pupils were off with a confirmed case of Covid, the rate was 1.5% for primary school pupils. But before the October half-term break, confirmed cases in secondary schools were more than double those in primaries. The data also revealed that increasing numbers of teachers are absent for Covid-related reasons, with 2.4% off across all state schools in England, compared with 2% two weeks previously. The greatest share of those off were from primary schools. Overall Covid-related pupil absence rose to 2.9% on 9 December, up from 2.6% on 25 November. The DfE’s absence statistics understate the number of pupils and students missing with Covid cases – under the DfE’s accounting, those with Covid confirmed by PCR tests are counted as absent with illness rather than as Covid-related. The numbers for confirmed cases issued by the DfE are those cases with positive lateral flow test results only. Javid ends by saying the government will not extend mandatory vaccination to any professions other than care workers and frontline NHS staff. And he says he would never support the sort of “mandatory vaccination” policies implemented in some EU countries. Back in the Commons Javid is defending the plans for mandatory vaccination for frontline NHS staff. Asked if staff who refuse a jab will get redundancy payments, he says they would not, because it would not count as redundancy. He says, when mandatory vaccination was introduced for care home staff, it led to an increase in vaccine take-up. He says there has been a net increase of more than 55,000 in the number of NHS staff vaccinated since the government opened the proposal on this in the autumn. Hospitals in England are bracing themselves for a “significant” surge in Covid patients from next week because the Omicron variant is spreading so fast, a senior NHS leader said today. Omicron’s greater transmissibility means hospitals will again have to treat large numbers of patients despite it apparently inducing milder symptoms than the previously dominant Delta strain, said Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers. He told the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus. All the evidence we have in front of us suggests that there will be a considerable impact [from Omicron] in terms of degree of hospitalisations. And the key point to grasp is irrespective in a sense of the severity of the symptoms, if you have a very large number of people who are infected with Omicron, and we know that this variant is significantly more infectious and more transmissible than Delta, it doesn’t take a particularly large percentage of people to be hospitalised before you get a large raw number of hospitalisations and that I think is the concern. We [the NHS] were already beyond full stretch before we got to winter. We’re now facing the prospect of significant numbers of hospitalisations probably starting I would think in the next week to two weeks. That is a concern because the NHS is already “beyond full stretch” even before winter has arrived properly, Hopson added. Three members of the shadow cabinet have tested positive today: Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, Bridget Phillipson, the new education secretary, and Jim McMahon, the new shadow environment secretary. Karl McCartney (Con) says people in red list hotels should not just be released early. (See 2.33pm.) He says they should be reimbursed for the “astronomical” fees they have had to pay. Javid says he is “very persuaded” by this argument. He says the government is looking at it, and he says he hopes to be able to say more on this. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw asks if the government will release people who are being “incarcenated” in hotel quarantine, given that all countries are being taken off the red list from tomorrow. He says people are being kept in “inhumane conditions”. Javid says in the past people already in quarantine have been required to finish their planned quarantine. But he says he has asked for a review of this. He hopes to be able to say something more. Back in the Commons Sajid Javid insists that the government is not introducing vaccine passports. He says it is important that people can show they are safe in different ways - either by showing their vaccine status, or by showing they have had a negative lateral flow test. Asked if he can rule out a vaccine passport system (a system that only accepts evidence of being fully vaccinated as proof of eligiblity to a venue), Javid effectively does rule it out. “I would not support a vaccine only option,” he says. Boris Johnson will address the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee in person this evening, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports. Javid says the regulations will not be kept in place “for a moment longer” than necessary. He says the travel red list is less effective than it was because Omicron is spreading so much in the UK. He says the testing rules for new arrivals will remain. But from 4am tomorrow all 11 countries on the red list will be removed from it. That means arrivals from those countries will no longer have to go into hotel quarantine. Luke Evans (Con) asks when the government will get get rid of the rule requiring people to wait in a clinic for 15 minutes after getting a Pfizer or Moderna jab. It was reported yesterday that this rule is going to be abandoned. Javid does not confirm that, but he says that this is being looked at urgently, and he says he expects to hear an update later, when he leaves the chamber. Layla Moran (Lib Dem) asks Javid about reports that Omicron is more serious for children than Delta. Javid says he has not seen any evidence for that. Javid says, if the NHS is overwhelmed because of Omicron, hospitals might not be able to treat all patients in need. For example, they might have to take difficult decisions, affecting perhaps a child who has been in a car crash. Would they get treatment? He says some MPs might think this is just a “hypothetical” risk, “but it’s not”. Chris Grayling (Con) asks how many patients are in hospital because of their Covid, and how many are in hospital with something else, but happen to have Covid. The official figures list both as Covid hospital cases. Javid says he looked into this when he first became health secretary. He says of around 6,000 Covid hospital patients, 80% are there because of their Covid symptoms. The other fifth are in hospital for something else, but were found on testing to have Covid. Aaron Bell (Con), another member of the science committee, says Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told the committee this morning that the measures being introduced by the government were proportionate. He says that is not what her article in the Daily Mail today implied. Greg Clark (Con), chair of the Commons science committee, raises a point heard in evidence by his committee this morning. (See 10.22am and 12.04pm.) He says in South Africa Omicron hospital stays tend to be shorter than Delta ones. Javid says we cannot assume that will be the same in the UK. The health systems are very different, he says. And he says even if this is true, the risk to the NHS remains. Javid says the Omicron doubling time means the NHS is still at risk of being overwhelmed. He says, even if Omicron turned out to be only half as severe as Delta, the increased doubling times means that an Omicron wave would only be two days behind in terms of impact on hospitals. Even if the hospital stay [of Omicron patients] is half of what it [other Covid variants] is at the moment, at the rate that this thing is growing, and if it continues to grow at that rate, that benefit could be cancelled out in two days. Javid says Omicron is more transmissible than Delta. The growth in the UK is mirroring what happened in South Africa. He says the observed doubling time for Omicron is two days. (Until recently ministers have been saying between two to three days.) And he says, although there are just 4,713 confirmed cases, the scientists estimate that the real number of people getting infected every day is 42 times higher, at around 200,000. He says scientists have never seen a Covid variant that can spread so quickly. Andrew Murrison (Con) says Javid’s answer on recall was not satisfactory. He says the situation is changing all the time. MPs need to be able to have a debate on the basis of the latest information. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is opening the debate. He says he wants to explain why Omicron is such a risk. Mark Harper (Con), chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, says he asked before for a commitment that the government would recall the Commons if new measures are needed over the Christmas recess. Javid said he would discuss it with the PM. Has he done so? Javid says he cannot give that commitment. It would not be a matter for his department. But the government could seriously consider it, he says. The Spectator, which is keeping a tally, has a list of 85 Conservative MPs who are certain or likely to vote against the government on the Covid measures tonight. The largest rebellion is likely to be on the Covid pass proposals. The face mask and isolation measures are far less contentious. Nikki da Costa, who worked in No 10 for both Boris Johnson and Theresa May as the parliamentary affairs specialist, says that around a quarter of the MPs on this list would be first-time Covid rebels. And more than a third of them have voted against the government on this frequently. Labour MPs are being told to vote in favour of the regulations introducing mandatory vaccination for frontline staff this evening. But, as my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, the Unite union is asking Labour MPs not to back this measure. According to the Sun’s Harry Cole and Natasha Clark, ministers were told at cabinet this morning that there is a risk that some hopsitals might have to close by mid-January because the spread of Omicron could lead to so many staff being off sick. The Welsh government is likely to announce additional restrictions on Friday to try to combat Omicron, the health minister, Eluned Morgan, has said. Asked if a full lockdown was on the way, Morgan said: The Welsh government will do what we need to do to keep the people of Wales safe and to protect the NHS. It will be more difficult to instigate a full lockdown without the support of the UK government and conversations are always ongoing with the UK government in terms of what is possible. We are still assessing the situation but there is a likelihood we will see some additional restrictions being introduced at the next review. [Friday]. We will need multiple layers of protection to keep Wales safe from a large Omicron wave that is heading our way. Morgan admitted she could not say what Christmas might look like, adding: “The last thing we want to do is cancel Christmas. But we are not currently taking anything off the table.” She took a swipe at the UK government. She said: What you need to do in Wales is look at the example set by our first minister rather than the example set in the UK government by Boris Johnson. I think that the public have understood the leadership of Mark Drakeford. It has been secure, sure, cautious. She said medical staff were being asked to cancel leave and work through Christmas to give booster jabs. The government is also asking for military personnel to help. She said she hoped there would be a “three-week burst of activity” before, hopefully, a return to “some sort of normality”. MPs are now about to start the debate on Covid passes, other regulations announced last week (on face masks and isolation rules), and mandatory vaccination for frontline NHS workers. The Commons order paper, with links to all four statutory instruments being put to a vote, is here (pdf). Responding to Raab in the Commons, Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, dismissed the proposed Human Rights Act reforms as a distraction tactic. He said: Every time the government is in trouble politically they wheel out reforming the Human Rights Act. It’s a dead cat destruction tactic by a government that doesn’t know how to fix the criminal justice system that they have broken and is desperate to divert attention away from corruption scandals that they started. This is little more than an attempt to wage culture wars because they’ve surrendered from waging war on crime and corruption. In the Commons Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, is delivering his statement on the government’s plans to reform the Human Rights Act. There is a summary of the government’s plans here, on the Ministry of Justice’s website. Here are extracts from the news release. The proposals achieve this by restricting the rights available to those subject to deportation orders, strengthening the existing legal framework, or limiting the grounds on which a deportation decision can be overturned. This – alongside wider Home Office in its New Plan for Immigration - will reduce pull factors to the UK being exploited by people smugglers facilitating dangerous small boat crossings ... The plans will give the supreme court more ability to interpret human rights law in a UK context, meaning the government can enforce rules designed to tackle forced marriages without fear of intervention from Strasbourg ... The UK will remain party to the ECHR and continue to meet its obligations under the convention and all other international human rights treaties. However, ministers will ensure the UK supreme court has the final say on UK rights by making clear that they should not blindly follow the Strasbourg court. It will mean that rights are interpreted in a UK context, with respect for the country’s case law, traditions, and the intention of its elected law makers. Proposals also include measures to introduce a permission stage which will intercept frivolous claims that sap the energy and resource of courts. Meanwhile, greater prominence will be given to the rights to jury trial and freedom of expression - meaning the space for rigorous debate will reflect the UK’s traditions and secure its values. The government has also published today its independent Human Rights Act review, and a consultation document on its reform plans. Raab claimed his plans would “strengthen typically British rights like freedom of speech and trial by jury, while preventing abuses of the system and adding a healthy dose of common sense”. Cabinet ministers held their meeting virtually this morning, not in person, No 10 said today at the lobby briefing. But the government is still saying Christmas parties should go ahead, and in the Commons this evening there will not be any opportunity for MPs to participate or vote remotely. These are from the Mail’s Jack Maidment and Byline Times’ Adam Bienkov. Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, also addressed cabinet. This is how No 10 summarises what he said. The chief medical officer updated cabinet on the latest evidence on the Omicron variant, confirming that the doubling time still appeared to be around two to three days. He said it was too early to say if cases were reducing or plateauing in South Africa but that there was no reliable evidence from South African scientists of a peak in case rates. He added that it remained too early to say how severe the Omicron variant was but that we can expect a significant increase in hospitalisations as cases increase. Boris Johnson told cabinet this morning that a “huge spike” in Omicron cases is coming. This is from the Downing Street read-out of what he said. Following Sunday’s address to the nation on the national booster mission, the prime minister said we must be clear in our message to the country to get boosted now and that the full weight of government would support the NHS to boost everyone over 18. The prime minister said a huge spike of Omicron was coming and the measures we aimed to introduce as part of plan B were balanced and proportionate, helping to reduce transmission while we ramp-up the booster programme. The prime minister finished by encouraging everyone eligible to get boosted and do everything possible in support of doctors, nurses and vaccinators as they do their vital work. According to the Sun’s Harry Cole, there has been speculation about the government shelving the vote on Covid passports later. No 10 has denied this. At the Commons science committee Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, was asked if the person who has died with the Omicron variant had any underyling health conditions. She said they did not release infomation like that about individuals for privacy reasons. At one point this morning there were no PCR test slots available to the general public at walk-in and drive-in test sites across England, PA Media reports. PA says: The government website said said there are “none available” at every region in England while slots are still available at sites in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. PCR test kits which are posted to people’s homes, usually arriving the following day, are available, the website says. The public are being advised to try again later if they cannot get a test. Tests will not be available through helplines, the website added. Now the government website is saying tests are available. Asked how long people are staying in hospital with Omicron, Riley says there is some evidence from South African that hospital stays are shorter. But he says comparing what happens in one health system with another is not easy. At the science committee Prof Steven Riley, the UK Health Security Agency’s director general for data, analytics and surveillance, is speaking now. Asked how many people could end up in hospital because of Omicron, he refuses to put a figure on it. He says the estimate today that Omicron is 29% less severe than previous variants (see 10.09am) is useful. But he says if there are a very large number of infections, then even if only a small proportion of them are leading to serious illness, that will put pressure on the NHS. Hopkins says, with Omicron, people are more likely to get reinfected with coronavirus than with Delta. She says the reinfection rate for Omicron is three to eight times higher. But she says they do not yet have data on how much more severe it is. Hopkins tells the science committee that, given the large numbers of people being infected with Omicron every day, the next few weeks are set to be “very difficult”. UPDATE: Hopkins also said the plan B restrictions might have to remain in place for two months. She said: I think that if the modelling that the London School [of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine] has done, I would expect that there’s going to be needing some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeks. These are from the FT’s Sebastian Payne on the mixed motives for Tory MPs planning to rebel tonight. At the science committee Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, is now giving evidence. She is here instead of Dr Jenny Harries, the agency’s chief executive, who was originally scheduled to appear. She says vaccine protection wanes after 12 weeks, which is why the booster jabs have been brought forward Q: Is the Covid pass plan, which MPs are voting on today, designed to encourage more people to get boosters? Hopkins says she does not think that is the case because under the Covid pass plan people can enter venues by showing a negative lateral flow test instead of by showing they have been vaccinated. Danny Kruger, a parliamentary private secretary to Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, was one of the Tories threatening to vote against the government tonight. But, following a conversation with Boris Johnson this morning, he has decided to support the government. In a post on his website, he explains why. This is what he says about why he changed his mind. I spoke to the health secretary last night and the prime minister this morning. Both stressed that these deliberately limited measures are intended to prevent another mandatory lockdown; that there will never be compulsory vaccination for any citizen, or vaccination as a condition of employment for anyone except health and care workers; and that there will never be vaccine passports, as opposed to the ‘Covid passports’ that include a lateral flow test. On this basis - thus far and no further - I am happy to support the measures this evening. But most of what he says in the statement is critical of what the government is planning. Here is another excerpt. The paradox is that the measures are mild in terms of the fight against Covid-19, but significant in terms of the signal they send about the society we are becoming. They are mild because we are not closing anything or restricting ordinary socialising; we are not introducing compulsory vaccination; and we are not introducing ‘vaccine passes’, but simply a requirement to show a negative test or proof of vaccination to enter large venues. Limited as these measures are, however, they could well be harbingers of something much worse, as we see in other places (such as New York, where vaccination is compulsory if you want a job or any social activities; or Austria, where it is compulsory full stop, with fines and internment if you disobey). As Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, meets her cabinet this morning to make the final decisions on new Covid restrictions, we have some hints already about what will and won’t be in this afternoon’s statement to the Holyrood parliament. On Monday evening Sturgeon definitively ruled out shutting schools early for the festive break in order to curb the spread of the new Omicron variant. Sturgeon, who is also expected to make a televised address later this evening, rejected calls from Scotland’s largest teaching union the EIS to close schools immediately, stating that her priority was to keep them open safely. But with the health secretary, Humza Yousaf, describing new restrictions as “inevitable”, early briefing suggests the Scottish government will bring in lighter touch limits around social mixing, perhaps with limits on the number of households that can meet up each day, while urging the public to be stricter about social distancing and mask wearing. It does not sound like there will be further extension of the vaccine passport scheme, which applies to nightclubs and large scale events like football matches, at this stage. Greg Clark, chair of the science committee, also asked Prof Wei Shen Lim, chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s Covid panel, when the JCVI would authorise vaccines for children aged five to 11, as allowed in the US. Lim said the JCVI were waiting for the vaccines to be approved for this age group by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA). He said the regulators liked to move in step. Asked when that decision might come, Lim indicated that it could come before Christmas, saying that this was a matter that was being considered now. UPDATE: Here is the exchange between Clark and Lim on when an announcement might be made. Lim said: “We are discussing that at the moment. We’re also waiting for the vaccines to be approved by MHRA.” Clark asked: “So would you expect to make a decision before Christmas on that?” Lim replied: “I would expect so, we try and keep in step with the approval process.” At the science committee Prof Wei Shen Lim, chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s Covid panel, is giving evidence now and Jeremy Hunt, the health committee chair, has been giving him the third degree. Hunt said that the JCVI was acclaimed as a nimble regulator at the start of the pandemic. But Israel went ahead with boosters for all adults in September, when the UK was holding off from doing that. He put it to Lim that the Israeli approach was right and the UK’s wrong. Lim said he did not agree. He said people at risk of death from the Delta variant were almost all over 40, and that giving booster vaccines too soon could make them less effective. But Hunt rejected this argument, saying it was now “totally obvious” that all adults should have been given boosters earlier. Hunt also criticised the decision not to authorise vaccines for teenagers earlier, as France did. Lim said the JCVI did not have the data to justify that. Hunt also criticised the decision not to authorise vaccines for children above the age of five, as US regulators have permitted. UPDATE: Hunt said: America has already made a decision that it’s safe to vaccinate the over-fives with Pfizer, we haven’t made a decision yet. I suppose the question I’m really asking, having been the most nimble in the world and received plaudits everywhere for being fleet to foot, can you understand why people are worried that not just yourself but with the MHRA, our regulators have been dragging their feet and therefore putting the NHS at greater risk this winter, and it might otherwise have been? Lim replied: I’ve been asked that question before and if you look at the different decisions that have been made, there is a time, I believe, to be extra fast, there’s a time to move extra cautiously. We’ve moved very quickly at the start when there was a need to, we moved very quickly when Alpha emerged and we needed to change the advice, and we moved very quickly when Omicron emerged and we’ve changed our advice. So, where we need to move very quickly, we will do so, where we feel that we do not want to outpace the data for safety reasons, we feel will do so. Both of these obviously are judgments as to how quickly one moves and we have made out those judgments based on the best available information. A total of 792 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending 3 December mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, PA Media reports. PA says: According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), this is down 3% on the previous week and is the lowest number of deaths since the week to 22 October, when the total was also 792. Around one in 15 (6.8%) of all deaths registered in England and Wales in the week to 3 December mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. There long queues all over the country today outside vaccine centres where people are waiting for a booster vaccine. This is from my colleague Oliver Holmes, who has filmed a queue on the Holloway Road in London. Here is the queue outside the walk-in vaccination centre at St Thomas’s Hospital in Westminster, London. This is from the BBC’s Clodagh Rice in Belfast. And here is the queue outside a vaccine centre at the Hartford Methodist Church in Northwich. At the science committee Aaron Bell (Con) asked Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, what she thought of the estimate out today from South Africa suggesting Omicron is 29% less severe than previous variants. (See 10.09am.) She said that sounded right. At the Commons science committee Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, has just started giving evidence about the impact of Omicron in South Africa. She said Omicron was at least as transmissible as the Delta variant. She said it generally produced a mild disease. It was different for people in hospital, she said. Most people in hospital were unvaccinated, she said. She told the MPs that they did not do genomic sequencing for most patients, so the hospital statistics did not differentiate between Delta patients and Omicron patients. But she said intensive care units were “not overwhelmed” with Covid cases. In an article published in the Daily Mail today Coetzee argues that the UK government is over-reacting. She says: Yesterday there were only 11 Covid-related deaths in South Africa, far fewer than the 578 weekly average reported at Delta’s peak. If Omicron really were such a deadly variant, we would expect the numbers to have shot up, yet that simply isn’t happening here. This makes it all the more peculiar to see what’s happening in the UK. This huge over-reaction is scaring people unnecessarily, and if your government does decide go to for a hard lockdown in the New Year, that could end up doing far more harm than good. Many of the Conservative MPs opposed to the Covid measures being debated this afternoon argue that the Omicron variant does not pose as much of a threat as the government maintains. They claim evidence from South Africa backs this up. For that reason it is worth reading this Twitter thread from Natasha Loder, the Economist’s health policy editor, who has been listening to a presentation this morning from a private health insurer in South Africa about Omicron. It starts here. And here are the conclusions. In an interview with the Today programme Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy first minister, criticised the Conservative MP Marcus Fysh for yesterday likening Covid passes to something out of Nazi Germany. Raab was initially reluctant to criticise Fysh, saying that he wanted to “play the issue not the individuals” and that he knew how much Fysh cared about liberty. But he added: Actually, I don’t think comparing what we are trying to achieve to an authoritarian or Nazi regime is quite right. I think a lot of people find that crass. At the Commons science comittee Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the Commons health committee but who attends some science committee hearings on Covid, asked Dame Kate Bingham what the government should have been doing to anticipate the Omicron variant. Bingham said scientists should have been anticipating potential mutations, and starting work in advance on vaccines that would tackle them. She said that was not straightforward, but she said it was how “you get ahead of all the mutations”. Pointing out that she no longer heads the vaccine taskforce, she admitted that she did not know to what extent that has been happening. In his morning interviews Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy first minister, confirmed that further Covid restrictions between Christmas and New Year are being discussed in government. My colleague Jessica Elgot has the story here. Dame Kate Binghham, former chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, has started giving evidence to the Commons science committee (ahead of the time scheduled). As LBC’s Theo Usherwood reports, she told them that coronavirus would be around in some form or other for ever. Good morning. After the government announced yesterday that an estimated 200,000 people a day are getting infected with the Omicron variant of coronavirus, many people will be wanting to stock up with lateral flow tests. But for the second day in a row, the government website where you can normally order them is saying that none are available by post. It shows this message. Yesterday when this happened Downing Street said there was no shortage of kits, and that tests were just unavailable because the government did not have the capacity to send them out. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy PM, was doing interviews this morning, and he delivered the same line. He told BBC Breakfast. The problem isn’t supply and volume, the problem is the allocation and distribution, or the delivery, of it. We know that in relation to the online system there were some challenges yesterday and that’s partly because of the proportion they’ve got each day. We’re making sure that however people may wish to order them and procure them, we’re ramping up not just the capacity ... but the ability to distribute and to deliver. Raab did not have a particularly good morning. In one interview he said that 250 were in hospsital with the Omicron variant, when in fact there were 10. These are from Sky’s Sophie Morris. And this is only the start of the day. In a vote at about 7pm, on Covid passes, Boris Johnson is facing the biggest Tory revolt this parliament. Here is our preview. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, gives evidence to the Commons science committee. She will be followed by: Dame Kate Binghham, former chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, at 10am; Prof Wei Shen Lim, chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation’s Covid panel at 10.30am: Paul Burton, chief medical officer from Moderna, at 11am: and Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, and Prof Steven Riley, its director general for data, analytics and surveillance, at 11.30am. 11.30am: Downing Street holds its lobby briefing. Morning: Eluned Morgan, the Welsh government’s health minister, is due to hold a press confernce on Covid. After 12.45pm: Dominic Raab, the justice secrtary and deputy prime minister, is expected to make a statement to MPs about government plans to amend the Human Rights Act. After 1.45pm: MPs begin the debate on the new Covid rules for England announced last week. At 6.30pm they will vote on three statutory instruments relating to last week’s measures (face masks, self-isolation rules, and Covid passes), and another requiring NHS staff to be fully vaccinated. 2.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, gives a statement to MSPs on Covid. I will be largely focusing on UK Covid-related issues today, and particularly the Commons debate, but there is much more coverage on our global Covid live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"

          "bodyText": "When Savid Javid revealed on Monday that an estimated 200,000 people a day are getting infected with Omicron, it brought understandable concern – especially as just 4,713 cases of the variant had been confirmed in the UK so far – . So where does this figure come from – and what does it tell us about the trajectory of the surge? Confirming a Covid case is caused by the Omicron variant requires a full genetic analysis of that person’s swab. According to Prof Paul Hunter at the University of East Anglia, it can take up to two weeks to return a viral sequence, meaning the figure of 4,713 Omicron cases reported by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was already out of date. Another way of estimating the number of Omicron cases is by looking at “S gene target failure”. Some of Omicron’s genetic mutations affect the readout of certain routine PCR tests, providing a quick – although not conclusive – indication of whether Omicron is present in a sample. Not every UK testing lab has the technology to do this, but between a third and half do. This provides another way to estimate what proportion of UK cases are Omicron, and how quickly it is overtaking the Delta variant. According to the latest figures, there were 54,661 new positive Covid-19 cases reported across the UK on Monday – though really this reflects the number who became infected a week ago, as it takes time to develop symptoms and seek a test. Meanwhile, the latest S gene dropout figures suggest 20% of UK cases are now Omicron, translating into approximately 11,000 Omicron cases daily. However, this only represents confirmed cases – people who have tested positive via PCR. Not everyone with Covid gets tested, so the true number of daily infections is unknown. This is why the Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey data is so revealing: by regularly swabbing a random sample of the population, it provides an estimate of the true proportion that has Covid at any given time. The UKHSA says Javid’s 200,000-a-day figure stems from projected ONS infection survey data, which estimated there were about 78,000 Delta infections on 7 December, equating to approximately 23,000 daily Omicron infections on the same day. Assuming Omicron numbers are doubling every two days, as current data suggests, the UKHSA estimated that approximately 207,000 people were infected with Omicron on 13 December. As in the tale of the wheat and chessboard, regular doubling rates quickly add up to very large numbers. The UKHSA has also estimated that if Omicron continues to grow at the present rate, there could be 1m daily Omicron infections by the end of December – and maybe sooner. A staggering figure but one that makes sense when you consider the doubling rate – though the revelation of such a figure may itself prompt the public to take precautions, flattening the curve. As well as the health impact, growing numbers of people could have to isolate – including hospital staff, teachers, supermarket workers and lorry drivers. Whether these predictions come to pass remains to be seen. Huge uncertainties remain regarding the extent to which T-cell immunity from previous infections or vaccination will protect against severe disease and hospitalisations, for example. And of course, at some point so many people may have been exposed to the new variant and/or received a booster jab in the UK that infections will begin to slow – although immunity takes several weeks to develop. A peak in January has been suggested. Prof Matt Keeling, of the University of Warwick, said if cases keep doubling we will effectively hit herd immunity. “Infection cannot keep doubling forever,” he said. “There are only a finite number of people to infect, and eventually the outbreak of Omicron would ‘burn itself out’ – but this isn’t going to happen until a lot of people have been infected, which we clearly want to avoid. “Getting to herd immunity by infecting lots of people is not a good public health strategy. This wasn’t a viable option back in March 2020 – the last time we saw such a rapid invasion – and it’s not a viable option now.” The UKHSA also cautions that the doubling rate is changing all the time and will continue to do so. The data in the days to come should clarify the situation, because if Omicron cases really are doubling every two days, we should expect a rapid increase in cases confirmed by positive PCR tests very soon. What does this mean for acting on the surge? Given these worst-case predictions, experts advocate a cautious approach. If additional measures are brought in, these would take a week or so to prompt any fall in daily cases because of the delay between being exposed to the virus and getting tested for it. The impact on hospitalisations and deaths would take even longer to be realised."

          "headline": "What makes boosters more effective than the first two Covid jabs?",
          "bodyText": "Covid-19, we should know by now, is a moving target. In autumn the rollout of boosters to older age groups was contentious. Now they’re the single biggest focus. So why do boosters help so significantly compared with first and second jabs, and are we on a conveyor belt towards needing an ever-increasing number of top-ups? Even before Omicron, it was clear boosters would be required to maintain the levels of protection against infection, although protection against severe illness appeared to be holding up well. Vaccines prompt the body to make neutralising antibodies that intercept Covid before the virus infects our cells, but circulating antibodies can wane over time. Data from Israel, one of the first countries to vaccinate its population, showed a drop-off in protection against infection after only three months. It revealed that were people about 15 times more likely to be infected six months after their second dose compared with a few weeks after it. Even if most people remain protected against serious illness, this waning immunity presents a significant public health issue when a proportion of adults remain unvaccinated or have immune conditions that leave them vulnerable. Omicron has made the need for boosters more urgent. Mutations in the virus mean its spike protein now looks quite different from that of the original Wuhan strain that all current vaccines were designed to target. That in turn means antibodies from previous infection and vaccination will be less efficient at intercepting Omicron. Because they stick to the virus less vigorously, a higher quantity of antibodies is also required to compensate for them being less well matched. Studies show that a booster dose increases the levels of antibodies significantly above the level seen after two doses, which some hope means waning immunity will occur more slowly after a third dose, though insufficient time has passed to determine if this is the case. Early studies also suggest that the quality of antibodies is higher following a booster. The immune system continues to refine exactly which antibodies are selected and amplified based on subsequent encounters with the virus or vaccine, and studies suggest there is a broader, more potent immune response following a third dose. There is also reason for some optimism that vaccines may hold up better against severe disease than against infection. The immune system has a second line of defence in T cells, which attack cells already infected. These tend to stick around longer and they recognise parts of the virus that are more highly conserved, meaning Omicron’s mutations are less likely to throw them off the scent. So if antibodies are not good enough to stave off infection, T-cells can swoop in to bring the disease under control before it makes a person seriously unwell. Laboratory data looks encouraging, but real-world outcomes are being followed closely in South Africa, the UK and elsewhere to answer this question, which remains one of the biggest uncertainties about how this wave will play out. For now, vaccine makers are working on variant jabs that could be ready to deploy as soon as March, but tweaking current vaccines will leave the same vulnerabilities should Omicron in the future be overshadowed by another even more fast-spreading variant. The next generation of vaccines, scientists hope, will not only be a good match to circulating strains but provide far broader immune protection so that they are effective against mutations. One possibility is a vaccine specifically designed to trigger a T-cell response to the viral replication machinery as opposed to the spike protein, which scientists have suggested could result in immunity lasting years rather than months."

          "bodyText": "After a Gold Coast man who bludgeoned his teenage girlfriend to death escaped a murder charge by arguing he had been provoked by her tales of infidelity, the Queensland government decided to step in. “Other than in exceptional or extreme cases you can’t rely on words, or conduct that consists substantially of words,” the state’s then attorney general, Cameron Dick, said in 2011. “We need a change to the law … just because you say something it doesn’t mean that you should be killed.” A decade later, another Queensland man, Arona Peniamina, also convinced a jury his spouse’s suspected infidelity had provoked him into ending her life in a jealous rage. The government’s reforms had not prevented him from successfully arguing he was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, because he had been provoked. As had occurred more than a decade earlier, convincing a jury he had been provoked meant Peniamina would therefore be subjected to a lesser sentence. As the Queensland supreme court judge Peter Davis noted, Peniamina had spent the days leading up to his wife’s death investigating her contact with another man. Peniamina’s case led to more questions about how the Queensland justice system was failing women, and another review of the law as it relates to the use of provocation as a defence in murder cases. Peniamina successfully argued that the suspicion of infidelity provoked him to start assaulting his wife, Sandra Peniamina, and that he was further provoked when she picked up a knife to defend herself. “There are instances where this would help those who were provoked and were protecting themselves,” Sandra’s sister, Carnetra Potter, who is now looking after the couple’s four young sons, told the Courier Mail. “But it in this case did not work in our favour. I believe the [law] should be looked at as a whole.” The attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, agreed, saying the wide-ranging work being done by the state’s women’s safety and justice taskforce would include an examination of the defence of provocation in domestic, family and sexual violence cases. The taskforce did not respond to a request for comment about when the review could be completed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Queensland remains one of the few Australian jurisdictions which allows a partial defence of provocation, allowing the crime of murder to be reduced to manslaughter. As the New South Wales court of criminal appeal justice Anthony Johnson said in April, the partial defence “has attracted criticism”, leading to review and reform during the past two decades. It had been abolished in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and most recently in South Australia, Johnson said. The ACT and Northern Territory have restricted the use of provocation as a defence but not abolished it entirely. Johnson’s comments were made as he denied the leave to appeal application of Warren Francis Rogers, who attempted to argue “extreme provocation” was a factor when he used a pillow to smother his wife of 40 years, Anne Rogers, to death. As he later explained to his son-in-law, Rogers killed her after a fight started because of he was upset by a non-sexual relationship she had with another man. “I’m not a bad person, I just snapped, you know?” Rogers said. “I just snapped … she pushed me too far.” While Rogers’ application was rejected, and NSW does not allow the partial defence of provocation, its unique model is considered problematic by some experts. The NSW laws, enacted in 2014, include a partial defence of “extreme provocation”. The laws were designed to significantly reduce the number of cases under which provocation could be argued, but leave it open as a defence for cases that met a four-staged test, to ensure that victims of prolonged family violence, for example, could use it as a defence should they kill their abusive spouse. Provocation can be considered in sentencing if a person is found guilty of murder. “The government is satisfied that the bill strikes a careful and appropriate balance between restricting the defence and leaving it available for victims of extreme provocation, including victims of long-term abuse who kill their abuser,” the then NSW attorney general, Brad Hazzard, said in introducing the bill. A select committee was established in parliament to examine the laws after the case of Chamanjot Singh, who stood trial for murder after cutting his wife’s throat. Singh claimed during his trial that his wife, Manpreet Kaur, provoked him by telling him she had never loved him and was in love with someone else, and threatening him with deportation. He said he lost self-control and should not be found guilty of murder but of manslaughter, and the jury agreed. Abolish the defence completely In her 2017 research, Dr Kate Fitz-Gibbon, an associate professor at Monash University, found that in the decade before the reforms were introduced, there were 20 convictions finalised in the NSW supreme court for manslaughter by reason of provocation. The majority of these cases involved intimate partner homicide motivated by relationship separation or infidelity, she found. Fitz-Gibbon found that the NSW reforms would eliminate many of these scenarios of what she called “jealous man provocation”. She told Guardian Australia that the Peniamina case was a clear reminder of why the partial defence should be scrapped, as, by its nature, it operated “to facilitate victim blaming narratives”. “We have seen time and time again throughout Australian criminal law history that the partial defence has been successfully utilised by men who have killed their female intimate partners to avoid full accountability for their lethal actions. “It would be naive to think that the abolition of the partial defence of provocation is the entire solution. “We must continue to challenge cultures within our legal system that allow for the proliferation of gendered narratives whereby women are ultimately blamed for their own deaths.” She said that some Australian jurisdictions were currently progressing reforms that would better ensure men who committed fatal intimate partner violence they are held to account. But that did not mean that such offences should be subject to mandatory sentences, as these measures meant men who often raise provocation to mitigate their sentences. “The partial defence of provocation must be abolished in every Australian state and territory, it has no place in our legal system.”"

          "headline": "James Maddison leads way as Leicester demolish Newcastle United",
          "bodyText": "How Leicester City, mired in sluggish Premier League form, reeling from the disappointment of their Europa League exit at Napoli on Thursday and with their squad buffeted by Covid positives and general illness, needed something to lift them. James Maddison provided it. The playmaker had already won the 37th-minute penalty from which Youri Tielemans gave them the lead – a little dubiously, it should be said – when he made a pre-assist of such quality that it not only shredded Newcastle’s backline but broke their collective spirit. Addressing a short pass from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in the inside-left channel, midway up the Newcastle half, Maddison had seen the run of Harvey Barnes and made the calculations. With the outside of his right boot he sculpted a first-time ball that set his teammate racing clear. Barnes squared to Patson Daka, who was in for the rested Jamie Vardy, and he did the rest. Maddison was not finished, not by a long shot. He took a low cross from Daka after Luke Thomas had won the ball high up before ushering in Tielemans for 3-0 and there was still time to get himself on the scoresheet. The Newcastle support refused to be cowed into silence but their team was broken and it was too easy for Leicester. The substitute Marc Albrighton won the ball off Joelinton and found Maddison, who swapped passes with Daka, ran around Fabian Schär and shot into the far corner. For Brendan Rodgers there was the bonus of a first clean sheet in the league since the opening weekend of the season and for him and his team, it felt like a trick of the mind that they had laboured for much of the first half. Maddison would depart to a standing ovation when he was substituted on 88 minutes, plus a bear hug from Rodgers. Newcastle won their first game of the league season last weekend – at home against Burnley – and this had felt like an opportunity for them, before matches against Liverpool and the Manchester clubs. They failed to take it, flattering to deceive up front despite the best efforts of Allan Saint-Maximin – their final decisions repeatedly poor – before capitulating in alarming fashion. The scoreline was harsh on Newcastle, given their efforts in the first half and, if the turning point was easy to locate, it was a source of bitter frustration for their manager, Eddie Howe. The penalty followed a clumsy attempt by Newcastle to play out from the back. Jonjo Shelvey – put into trouble by Jamaal Lascelles – took a heavy touch, with Tielemans pressing and nicking the ball towards Maddison, who was too quick for Lascelles. It felt soft in real time, Lascelles lunging in but quickly checking out of the challenge; Maddison looking for the contact, feeling it and going down. The impression was only confirmed by the replays. If the referee, Peter Bankes, had not made the decision, it seemed unlikely that VAR would have intervened. On the other hand, it was one of those that was never going to be overruled by the technology, even though Howe argued Bankes ought to have consulted the pitchside monitor. Tielemans’ conversion was high and unstoppable. “When you see the penalty in detail [on replays], you see the player is going over before contact is made,” Howe said. “It’s not a penalty.” Before kick-off, only three clubs had conceded more league goals than Leicester this season, one of them being Newcastle, and it had felt like being a battle of the dodgy defences. Initially, it was Newcastle who asked the questions and it was certainly not a part of Rodgers’ script to lose Jonny Evans to a hamstring injury in the sixth minute. The manager was forced to drop the defensive midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, back as a makeshift centre-half. The prognosis on Evans was “not good,” according to Rodgers. Leicester had been nervous at the outset, giving the ball away cheaply and inviting Newcastle to settle. There were flickers from the visitors in the opening quarter although nothing clear-cut, and it was possible to wonder whether they would show the needed cutting edge. Leicester measured their first-half threat in set pieces. Maddison curled a free-kick just over while Ndidi’s header from another Maddison free-kick extended Martin Dubravka. The effort did look to be going just past the far post. Newcastle’s best bet was Saint-Maximin, who has that priceless ability to make things happen in tight spaces. But it was Maddison who made the difference, his pass that sparked the clinching second goal a thing of wonder. Daka’s somersaulting celebration was as extravagant as the tap-in was simple. Newcastle’s only second-half moment came when Timothy Castagne erred with a back pass, failing to spot that Kasper Schmeichel was away from his goal. Schmeichel tore back to scrape off his line and it was the prompt for Leicester to turn the screw."

          "bodyText": "Exo One transposes the humble, tactile pleasures of rolling a marble along a gulley or skimming a pebble across a clear lake into a planet-straddling adventure told with all the humming sci-fi style of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001. You pilot a spherical spacecraft, powered solely by kinetic energy, across barren alien vistas, using the rise and fall of the land and your ability to increase or diminish gravity’s effect on your craft to fling your ship into the air. While soaring, you may momentarily flatten your ship into a discus shape, using air currents to provide further lift until your store of glowing power is exhausted, when you must return to the land below to recharge. On each planet your goal is simple: reach the ramp-like monolith somewhere on the horizon that is firing a beam of incandescent guiding light into the stratosphere. When touched, the monolith will shoot you into a vortex of rippling lights and flickering images on to the next planetary body. Each planet varies widely in terrain. One is covered in blustery deserts, another in rolling, milky seas. Your ship is impervious to lava, Plutonian colds and the kind of gravitational forces that would suck the rivets from the hull of an aeroplane. Much of the game’s tactile pleasure comes from gaining momentum to soar high above the land and take in these exquisite, desolate vistas. There are none of the dials and tickers that usually clutter the screen in sci-fi games and films: your HUD is empty save for the occasional text prompt to inform you of your distance to the monolith, or the raindrops that smear across the screen. The uninterrupted views and undulating rhythms invite a near meditative state, the thrill of which deepens as your skill at manoeuvring the craft increases. A joyous, otherworldly ride."

          "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the week. Here are today’s main stories: Goodnight, and best wishes for the weekend. GW European stock markets have ended the day lower, with Omicron, inflation, and the UK’s faltering growth all occupying traders’ minds. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares in London ended nearly 30 points lower at 7,291, down 0.4% today. Cyber-security firm Darktrace was the top faller, down 4.2% (it’s already being ejected from the FTSE 100 in this month’s reshuffle, due to its value dropping this autumn). Online grocer Ocado (-2.9%), DIY retailer Kingfisher (-2.5%), and high street group JD Sports (2.2%) were also in the fallers. France’s CAC lost 0.25%, while Germany’s DAX inched down by 0.1%. Oliver Males of SpreadEx says: The UK GDP figures were released this morning, which disappointed many, as it showed minimal growth of 0.1%. Economists had forecast 0.4% growth, but the ongoing supply chain issues, and staff shortages have obviously negatively impacted this figure. Adding to the pessimism was Heathrow’s warning of further restrictions badly affecting the travel industry once more, as demand for November has already dropped 60%. The UK market in particular fell lower after a leading economist, Sanjay Raja, from Deutsche Bank, announced that Plan B will see GDP growth dip into negative territory for at least December and January. US consumer confidence is likely to come another pressure if America’s inflationary pressures don’t fade soon, points out Edward Moya of OANDA: Despite today’s rebound, consumer sentiment still looks vulnerable and will likely struggle if these widespread price increases continue. November’s headline month-over-month CPI reading increased 0.8% was higher than the 0.7% estimate but lower than the prior month’s reading of 0.9%. Some of the inflation is moderating but the year over year reading came in at 6.8%, the hottest since 1982. Broad based price increases had groceries (meat, poultry, fish, and eggs) skyrocket 12.8%, airline prices were up 4.7%, energy costs were 3.5% higher (gasoline delivered another 6.1% increase), new vehicles rose 1.1%, while used cars increased 2.5% and apparel climbed 1.3%. US consumer confidence has risen unexpectedly, with less-well-off families anticipating a jump in their pay that would cushion the impact of rising inflation. The University of Michigan’s closely watched Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 70.4 this month, up from the decade low of 67.4 in November. Readings of both current conditions and future expectations also improved unexpectedly. The increase in headline sentiment was driven by a 23.6% improvement among households in the lower one-third of the survey’s income distribution, the biggest monthly increase for that group since 1980, says Reuters. This was driven by expectations of improving incomes in the year ahead. Middle income and wealthier households became less optimistic, though. It’s been an expensive day for Spanish bank Santander. A Madrid court ordered Santander to pay Italian banker Andrea Orcel €67.8m after it withdrew its offer to make him CEO, the latest move in a long-running employment dispute that has gripped high finance. Santander originally announced Andrea Orcel’s appointment in September 2018, but dramatically changed its mind in January 2019 after concluding that compensating him for deferred pay awards built up at UBS would be too expensive. Orcel, who had already quit his post as head of UBS’s investment bank when Santander dropped its offer, sued Santander for €100m. Santander has said it would appeal against today’s decision. Orcel had been a star dealmaker before Santander’s approach and u-turn, a move which broke a close professional bond between Orcel and Santander’s chairman Ana Botin. The FT says: The ruling is a significant blow for Ana Botín, executive chair of the Spanish lender, whose tenure since succeeding her father Emilio Botín has been marked by the decision first to hire Orcel, long a confidant of her family, and then to drop him, with the resulting legal fight. LV= says it will swiftly reassess its strategic options, after seeing its Bain takeover sunk by its members today. The mutual insists it has an “appropriate capital position”, but that continuing as things stand isn’t in the best interest of members, due to the level of investment it needs, and its declining base of ‘with-profits’ members. Royal London, the UK’s largest mutual, has moved swiftly, revealing it is proposing a merger will let LV= customers have their life savings protected and invested by a mutual. An earlier approach from Royal London had been rejected by LV=. LV=’s chairman, Alan Cook, says he plans to step down as soon as a way forward is agreed. Back in the UK, members of the 178-year-old mutual insurer LV= have rejected a controversial takeover by US private equity firm Bain Capital. Just 69% of LV= members who voted today approved the £530m deal, which would have end the firm’s member-owned status and put it in the hands of Bain. The deal needed 75% approval, so this vote scuppers a year-long campaign by the LV=’s board to secure backing for its preferred bidder The rejection follows concerns that the former Liverpool Victoria was being sold too cheaply, and that the deal would lead to worse payouts for customers and poorer customer service. LV= says this result will have no impact on trading, as the business will continue to serve its customers as usual and member policies remain secure and protected by the same safeguards. LV= had argued that the deal would mean significant financial benefits for members. But the proposed demutualisation of one of Britain’s oldest and largest customer-owned businesses has attracted criticism, with policyholders set to receive just £100 and give up their ownership rights. Alan Cook, chairman of LV=, said the mutual was disappointed with today’s result: “We are deeply appreciative of the members who took the time to vote. Our priority has always been to put the interests of LV=’s members first, and, in particular With-profits policyholders, who share in the Group’s risks. Although 69% of voting members supported the Board’s recommendation and voted in favour of the transaction with Bain Capital, the Board is disappointed not to have achieved the outcome that we believed was in the best interests of LV= and its members.” Higher-then-expected inflation is the biggest risk to the markets in 2022, according to a survey of over 750 financial professionals conducted by Deutsche Bank. The poll found that: The biggest risk remains higher than expected inflation. Commensurate with that, an aggressive Fed tightening cycle came in at number two. Vaccine-escaping variants were close behind in the top three, after dropping out last month. Most respondents expect growth to decrease below consensus economists’ expectation in 2022 but still above trend, and for ten-year Treasury and Bund yields to increase but with Bund yields increasing more. The next US recession is expected by 2024 by most, but with only 4% thinking 2022. The average expected return for the S&amp;P 500 next year was just 4.2%, well below average annual returns over the last decade. US CPI is expected to remain above target at the end of next year (3.8%), and average expectations for the next five years continue to drift higher (2.7%). The poll also found that the US Federal Reserve is overwhelmingly expected to finish its asset-purchase stimulus programme in the first half of 2022. And bitcoin is seen as more likely to halve than double, although those under 35 had the opposite view, and there was broad agreement that the French presidential election won’t rock the markets. US inflation might be close to its peak, which would bring some relief to squeezed families. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, explains: Consumer prices rose by 0.8% m/m in November, taking the annual CPI inflation rate up to a near 40-year high of 6.8% but, with energy prices falling sharply in recent weeks, last month probably marked the peak. The same is not true for core consumer price inflation, however, which accelerated to 4.9% last month and will peak at around 5.5% sometime in the first quarter of next year. US crude oil fell from over $85/barrel in late October to below $65 last week, when the Omicron variant threatened to hurt global growth. But crude price have risen this week, back to around $71/barrel today. Stocks have opened higher on Wall Street, perhaps on relief that the CPI report was broadly in line with forecasts. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 183 points, or 0.5%, to 35,938 points, led by enterprise software firm Salesforce (+1.9%), chemicals group Dow Inc (+1.5%) and Microsoft (+1.5%). Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, says investors may have feared an even sharper jump in inflation. That could have led to an earlier rise in US interest rates to cool price pressures, slowing the economy. Cincotta says: The inline year on year reading plus the slight move lower in the monthly read appears to have eased bets of a sooner rate rise by the Fed. That or the market had built itself up for a much higher reading The initial reaction has seen the US Dollar fall and stocks rise with high growth tech stocks leading the charge; moves consistent with easing hawkish Fed expectations. However, the initial knee jerk reaction isn’t always the one that stays.... American inflation is now its highest since Ronald Reagan’s first term in the White House. And that puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to wrap up its asset-purchase scheme more quickly, experts says. Dan Boardman-Weston, CIO at BRI Wealth Management, says strong demand and supply chain disruption pushed up inflation (plus, there’s a ‘base effect’ as some prices were dampened by the pandemic last year): “US inflation came in at 6.8%, up from 6.2% in October and in line with forecasts. The reading which is the highest level in nearly 40 years comes as little surprise to the market due to the ongoing supply chain issues, robust consumer demand and base effects from last year kicking in. This is likely to add further pressure to the Fed to quicken the withdrawal of quantitative easing and raise interest rates sooner than expected. There could be hesitancy from the Fed due to the potential impact that Omicron may have on the economy in the coming months but it’s unlikely this will significantly alter the growth trajectory of the economy. The US economy is in rude health and doesn’t require crisis levels of quantitative easing or interest rates and so it remains our view that policy will become tighter. It is important to note that whilst inflation is high and getting higher, the supply chain issues, the high levels of demand and base effects are likely to prove transitory and we continue to believe inflation will move lower over the coming year.” Greg Daco of Oxford Economics warns that inflation will get worse early next year, before cooling: The Fed meets next week to set monetary policy, and could well speed up the ‘tapering’ of its asset purchase program. Last month, it began cutting $15bn/month off its bond purchases (which had been running at $120bn/month). Robert Alster, CIO of Close Brothers Asset Management, thinks the Fed could accelerate the taper... but might also be concerned about the impact of the Omicron variant on the global economy. “Inflation has broadened out across the CPI basket, putting greater pressure on the Fed to address the so-called ‘transitory’ factors that are keeping prices high. While the cost of living is going up and up, all support measures have expired and no new ones have been introduced, which will likely dent consumer confidence. And rising rental equivalent costs continue to spiral in the background, indicating longer-term inflationary problems. “In this pressure cooker, the Fed isn’t afraid to be more hawkish. Powell has already made it clear that there’s a strong chance of accelerating tightening measures, which could mean quickly tapering purchases to facilitate an interest rate hike down the line. But the global economy is at a serious juncture thanks to the emergence of the Omicron variant this month. Only time will tell what the impact will be, and how far it will upset the Fed’s plans in the new year.” Core inflation, which strips out food and energy price changes, has hit its highest level in 30 years. The index for all items less food and energy rose 4.9% over the past 12 months, its largest 12-month increase since June 1991. That rise included the 31% jump in used US car and truck prices, a 3.8% increase in shelter (the cost of housing), and a 1.7% increase in medical care costs. Over the last 12 months, US energy prices have jumped by 33.3%, driving up the wider inflation rate. The price of food has jumped 6.4% annually, while food prices away from home (eg at restaurants and bars) are 5.8% higher. New vehicle prices are up 11.1%, while used cars and trucks are over 31% pricier than a year ago (partly because shortages of semiconductors have hit new car production). Here’s a breakdown of some of the key price moves: Some snap reaction: Inflation in the US has hit its highest level since June 1982, as rising energy prices, gasoline at the pumps and pricier food all hit American families. The consumer prices index jumped by 6.8% over the 12 months to November, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, meaning inflation is running at its hottest in almost 40 years. In November alone, prices jumped by 0.8%, having risen by 0.9% in October. Prices rose broadly, the BLS reports, with gasoline, shelter, food, used cars and trucks, and new vehicles all among the larger contributors. The energy index rose 3.5% in November, while the gasoline index jumped 6.1% as motorists paid more to fill up their tanks. Food became more expensive too - the food index increased 0.7%, with ‘food at home; rising by 0.8% during the month. Economists predict that US inflation could hit its highest level in almost 40 years in today’s report. Experts polled by Reuters predicted that US consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.8% in November, almost a four-decade high, up from 6.2% in October. Yesterday, President Joe Biden told Americans that rises in energy costs and other key goods were starting to ease, which wouldn’t show up in today’s CPI report, saying: The information being released tomorrow on energy in November does not reflect today’s reality, and it does not reflect the expected price decreases in the weeks and months ahead, such as in the auto market. That was taken as a sign that the White House was bracing for a high inflation reading for November.... European stock markets are quite becalmed today, as investors await November’s US inflation report in around 40 minutes, which is likely to show another jump in the cost of living in America. The pan-European Stoxx 600 is down slightly, while the FTSE 100 is flat following this morning’s weak GDP report. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, says the reality of the new Omicron restrictions in various places soured the mood yesterday (which seems to have carried through to today) He writes: Even as the news on Omicron’s severity has remained positive, concern is still elevated that this good news on severity could be outweighed by a rise in transmissibility, which ultimately would lead to a higher absolute number of both infections and hospitalisations. Even if it doesn’t, it seems restrictions are mounting while we wait and see. Here’s Bloomberg’s take on the UK public’s rising worries about inflation (see details here). The U.K. public’s expectations for inflation over the next year jumped by the most since 2016 last month, with Britons saying they were the least satisfied about how the Bank of England was doing its job in almost a decade. A survey commissioned by the central bank found the median estimate for price gains in the next 12 months was 3.2%, the most since 2019 and a jump from 2.7% in August. Looking over the next five years, the figure was 3.1%. Both those estimates are well above the central bank’s 2% target. When asked to assess the way the BOE is “doing its job to set interest rates to control inflation,” the net satisfaction balance – the proportion satisfied minus the proportion dissatisfied – was 14%, the lowest since 2012. More here. More details on the rise in inflation expectations.... ....and the drop in public satisfaction with the Bank of England: October’s GDP report shows that Britain’s economy was showing “worrying signs of weakness” even before the emergence of the coronavirus Omicron variant, our economics correspondent Richard Partington writes. And with worse likely yet to come, the government should offer more help to support the economy now, he explains: On the positive side, the latest figures show the economy is within a hair’s breadth of its pre-Covid position, at only 0.5% below February 2020 levels. The new restrictions announced so far remain relatively light-touch, while there are hopes that tougher measures may not be required, thanks to steady progress with the vaccine booster programme. However, pressure is clearly building on an economy that was already struggling for momentum before the new variant emerged, while there is heightened uncertainty over the next stage in a pandemic that is far from over. Faced with these risks, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he had always acknowledged there would be “bumps on the road” to recovery but the government already had in place an “ongoing £400bn economic support package” to keep the country on track. That’s an odd way to describe a programme that has been largely dismantled over recent months, ostensibly because Sunak believed a return to economic normality was on the cards. The furlough scheme has gone, universal credit has been slashed and several tax breaks have been reversed. Business leaders are stepping up their warnings that failure to provide renewed support measures could squander the progress made in the economy since the easing of lockdown earlier this year; especially in the sectors most exposed to the Omicron wave, such as hospitality, travel and leisure.

It found that the market for secondhand Lego rises in value by 11% annually, which it says is a faster and better rate of return than gold, stocks, bonds, stamps and wine. Researchers at the Higher School of Economics in Russia said that there could be lucrative gains to be made from investing in “more unusual goods whose purchase might seem less serious”, such as Lego sets, Barbie dolls, superhero mini figures, or model cars and trains. “We are used to thinking that people buy such items as jewellery, antiques or artworks as an investment,” said Victoria Dobrynskaya, an associate professor at the Faculty of Economic Sciences at HSE. “However, there are other options, such as collectible toys. Tens of thousands of deals are made on the secondary Lego market. Even taking into account the small prices of most sets, this is a huge market that is not well known by traditional investors.” The most expensive sets include the Millennium Falcon, Death Star II and Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars, as well as the Taj Mahal. Britons partial to a festive glass of port or sherry should nurse it carefully this Christmas as a shake-up of alcohol taxes threatens to add at least £1 to bottle prices next year. The chancellor announced a sweeping overhaul of alcohol duties in the budget, reducing the tax take on lower-strength drinks, such as draught beer, but increasing them on products, such as fortified wine, with an alcohol content above 11%. Andrew Hawes, the managing director of the wine importer Mentzendorff, said port and sherry fans were about to be hit with the “largest single alcohol tax rise in UK history”. UK shoppers buy 10m bottles of sherry and close to 9m bottles of port each year. More here: Sterling is wallowing around its lowest levels in a year today, after the UK’s disappointing GDP figures. The pound has dropped below $1.32, down 0.15% today, as investors digest October’s slowdown. That takes sterling towards the 12-month lows on Wednesday when news of new Covid-19 restrictions broke. With growth weak in October, Omicron hitting the travel sector, and ‘Plan B’ likely to hurt hospitality, there’s little cheer in the City today. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, says: Britain’s economy barely grew in October as supply chain issues capped industrial output. The data has further dashed expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next week. The UK public’s inflation expectations have jumped, as the cost of living squeeze drives home the impact of rising prices on households. Inflation expectations for the year ahead have jumped to 3.2%, up from 2.7% in August, research conducted by the Bank of England shows. That’s significantly above the BoE’s target of 2%, and follows the surge in energy costs, petrol and food bills which pushed the consumer price index to a 10-year high of 4.2% in October. Long-term inflation expectations (say, in five years time) inched up too, to 3.1% from 3% in August. The survey also shows that the public are increasingly unhappy with the Bank of England’s control of prices. The balance between people satisfied, or dissatisfied, with the way the BoE is ‘doing its job to set interest rates to control inflation’ fell to +14%, down from +18% in August 2021 and +24% in May 2021. Just 33% were satisfied, the same as three months ago, which was the joint lowest level since the survey started in 1999. The proportion dissatisfied rose to 19%, from 15%. Discount fashion chain Primark says it hasn’t seen much impact from the Omicron variant. John Bason, finance director of Primark’s owner Associated British Foods told Reuters that: “In terms of the Omicron variant we haven’t really seen much of an effect on footfall. We’re trading well over Christmas.” Trading at Primark this financial year, since 19th September, has been ahead of expectations, ABF says, with like-for-like sales above the previous quarter despite supply chain disruption. Its grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture operations are being hit by delays at the ports and the shortage of lorry drivers, plus rising costs - some of which will be passed onto customers. ABF’s chairman, Michael McLintock, will tell its AGM today that: Trading to date in our new financial year across Grocery, Sugar, Ingredients and Agriculture has been in line with expectations. We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these difficulties. We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases. The Omicron variant has hit Heathrow airport, with some business travellers cancelling flights as governments around the world impose travel restrictions. Heathrow reported that new government-imposed travel restrictions had further dampened passenger confidence. Demand last month was 60% lower than pre-pandemic levels, despite the US reopening its borders to fully vaccinated passengers. My colleague Mark Sweney explains: Heathrow has said passenger numbers were 60% lower in November than before the coronavirus pandemic and there were “high cancellations” among business travellers concerned about being trapped overseas for Christmas as Omicron spreads. The UK’s largest airport said the government’s travel restrictions had dealt a fresh blow to travel confidence and predicted it was likely to take several years for passenger numbers to return to pre-pandemic levels. This week ministers said passengers arriving in the UK would have to take a pre-departure Covid test, as well as a post-flight test, because of fears about the spread of the new variant. Britain’s economic recovery had almost come to a halt even before the onset of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19, official figures have shown. The Office for National Statistics said in that October, the first month after the end of the government’s furlough scheme, output grew by only 0.1%. The slight monthly rise in gross domestic product was weaker than had been anticipated, with a poll of economists having expected growth of 0.4%. In September the economy grew by 0.6%. A breakdown of the data showed signs of a sharp drop in people going to restaurants, pubs and bars even before tougher curbs were brought in this month. Gross domestic product was still 0.5% below its pre-crisis peak in February 2020 at the end of October. Of the three main sectors of the economy, only services expanded in October, with higher spending in the shops and an increase in face-to-face GP appointments contributing to a 0.4% rise. However, production, which includes manufacturing, energy and North Sea oil and gas, was down 0.6%, while a shortage of materials because of supply chain problems resulted in a 1.8% drop in construction output, the steepest since the start of the pandemic in April 2020. Here’s the full story: Many experts are warning that the UK’s sharp slowdown in October shows the economic outlook has deteriorated. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, says the government may need to provide more economic support, as the pandemic crisis clearly won’t be over by Christmas: “Today’s GDP data shows a worrying slowing in growth in October, meaning that monthly output is still 0.5% below its pre-pandemic level as on-going supply-chain disruptions continue to hold back production in some sectors. “Weak growth in October and the more recent emergence of Omicron mean hopes that either the health or economic pain of this crisis would be all over by Christmas have been dashed. The possibility that restrictions will need to be tightened, combined with high inflation and rising energy bills, means Government should prepare for fresh targeted economic support that may be necessary in the months ahead.” Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics points out that many UK firms were struggling this autumn, even before the Omicron variant emerged. Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, agrees that the economic prospects for 2022 look weaker: Paul Craig, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, also says the pace of growth is slowing, as the economy took another small step closer to pre-Covid levels. Unsurprisingly, some sectors continue to struggle, he says: October saw production output decrease by 0.6%, with electricity and gas lowering by 2.9% and mining and quarrying by 5.0%. Construction also struggled, as output dipped by 1.8% - the largest fall since April 2020. “Overall, the pace of growth appears to be slowing, and some downside surprises are emerging – partly as a result of the ‘catch-up’ already seen in the data, as well as the effects of labour shortages spurred on by Brexit, supply bottlenecks, and Covid more generally. October’s slowdown will further complicate the dilemma facing the Bank of England when it sets UK interest rates next week, says Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to Allianz: Debapratim De, senior economist at Deloitte, says the slowdown will encourage the Monetary Policy Committee to leave Bank Rate at 0.1%, “Economic activity grew at a slower pace than expected in October. The contraction in hospitality and accommodation services suggests that demand was already slowing, well before the emergence of the Omicron variant. “This, in addition to labour and supply shortages, makes for a weak start to the fourth quarter. Today’s data significantly increases the chances of the Bank of England holding off from a rate rise next week.” The TUC has repeated its call for the government to reboot the furlough job protection scheme to safeguard jobs, before new Omicron restrictions slow the recovery. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: The UK’s recovery was already in the slow lane. This week’s new restrictions will slow it further without financial support for the sectors that will be hit. Ministers should reboot furlough right now to protect jobs and livelihoods.” After peaking above pre-Covid levels in April 2021, output in the UK construction sector has fallen back in recent months. The sector is now 2.8% below its pre-pandemic level, due to delays obtaining building materials, and sharply higher prices: This reflects recent challenges faced by the construction industry from rising input prices and delays to the availability of some construction products (notably steel, concrete, timber and glass) over recent months. These charts from today’s GDP report show how the UK’s recovery has stumbled, after strong growth this spring when lockdown measures were eased: The UK’s supply chain issues, worker shortages and surging inflation all hurt economic growth in October, says Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International. Currie warns that “the steam has well and truly been taken out of economic recovery”. The months ahead look challenging, with rising prices and Covid-19 worries hitting consumer spending, and firms facing ‘ongoing headwinds’, she explains. At 0.5% below its pre-pandemic level, October might be the closest the economy gets to reaching ‘normal levels’ until deep into 2022. “With the government moving to implement its ‘Plan B’ over concerns on the Omicron variant, there is a creeping sense of déjà vu. Workers are heading back to their kitchen tables and the big festive season that retailers and the hospitality sector had their hopes pinned on - while starting on a high during Black Friday - might not have as much sparkle as hoped. “As we edge towards 2022, growth forecasts have been downgraded for the year ahead with GDP expected to reach just 4.2%. High levels of inflation and Omicron concerns are likely to limit consumer spending as businesses battle ongoing headwinds. With uncertainty in the air, the path ahead is becoming increasing difficult to navigate. The Bank of England will be acutely aware that it’s harder to dig an economy out of recession, than to cool rising inflation, which makes an interest rate rise next week increasingly unlikely.” Labour’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, says today’s UK GDP figures are “extremely worrying for an already fragile economic recovery”. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says the UK economy would have shrunk in October, without the healthcare sector. Manufacturing stagnated, she points out, as supply chain problems left factories struggling to obtain parts. “Economic growth would have fallen in October if it were not for the return of face-to-face appointments in the NHS and the ramping up of vaccination activity, both of which had a noticeable positive impact on the service sector. “Underneath this, manufacturing output was flat, with evidence coming through that while demand remains strong, production is being hampered by difficulties sourcing supplies. “Meanwhile consumers, who had enjoyed the opening of hospitality venues in the late summer, in October switched back to shopping – and booking holidays. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, has compared October’s slowdown to a bump on the road, saying: “We’ve always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery, but the early actions we have taken, our ongoing £400bn economic support package and our vaccine programme mean we are well placed to keep our economy on track. “We have still been recovering quicker than expected, with more employees on payrolls than ever before and redundancies remaining low.” However, business in the hospitality sector are warning that the new Plan B restrictions will hit growth and cost jobs, unless the Treasury provides more support fast, including restarting the furlough scheme to help hard-hit sectors. The disappointing 0.1% rise in GDP in October suggests that the economy had slowed to a crawl even before the Omicron COVID-19 variant was discovered in late November, says Paul Dales of Capital Economics. Dales is concerned that output at restaurants and hotels fell by 5.5% in October, even before Omicron worries hit the sector. The latest variant will probably mean fewer people visit their doctors in December, he adds, although Test and Trace services and vaccine centres may be busier. He says: Early evidence suggests growth in November might have been a bit better. Nonetheless, at such low rates of growth, the government’s “Plan B” COVID-19 restrictions could be the difference between the economy growing or contracting in December. Dales estimates that “Plan B” could reduce GDP by up to 0.5% in December, meaning it’s “touch-and-go” whether the economy will grow or contract this month. Here’s Keith Church, head of economic modelling at risk consultancy 4most, on the UK’s slowdown: Alpesh Paleja, CBI Lead Economist, says October’s slowdown is disappointing: “Growth disappointed in October, reinforcing concerns about the resilience of the UK’s economic recovery to the Omicron variant and the impact of further restrictions. We need to create consistency in our approach and build confidence by reducing the oscillation between normal life and restrictions as we learn to live with the virus and its variants. “Meanwhile, supply pressures remain acute and further rises in inflation are looming. We expect growth to build further momentum ahead, but more action is needed to address longer-term challenges, including “scarring” from COVID and poor productivity. More snap reaction, from James Smith of Resolution Foundation... Victoria Scholar of Interactive Investor says: Last month it looked as though the UK was on track to return to pre-pandemic levels of GDP by the first quarter of 2022. However, the dark cloud of Omicron now threatens the recovery as the government introduces tighter restrictions, weighing on the pound and Covid-sensitive stocks this week. The UK economy was hit by a drop in business at restaurants, shortages of raw materials for builders, and weaker extraction of crude petroleum and natural gas (after North Sea maintenance this summer). But a jump in visits to GP surgeries, strong demand for second hand cars, and a surge in business at employment agencies as companies struggled to hire workers pushed up growth. Here’s ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The UK economy came to a near-standstill in October, raising concerns that the recovery has faltered just as new restrictions are introduced to combat Omicron. Data just released shows that GDP grew by just 0.1% in October, much weaker than the 0.4% which economists had expected, as firms struggled with supply chain problems and staff shortages. It leaves the economy still 0.5% below its pre-pandemic levels in February 2020. The Office for National Statistics reports that services output grew by 0.4% in October 2021, partly driven by human health activities due to a rise in face-to-face appointments at GP surgeries in England. Services output overall has now reached its pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. But other parts of the economy shrank during the month. Production output decreased by 0.6% in October, with electricity and gas down by 2.9%, and mining and quarrying down by 5.0%. And construction contracted, with output down by 1.8% in the month. More details and reaction to follow.... Also coming up today Inflation in America is expected to hit a new 30-year high today, putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to end its stimulus programme faster. The cost of living is forecast to have surged by around 6.8% per year in November, beating the 6.2% seen in October, and the fastest pace since the early 1980s. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: With the Federal Reserve due to meet next week, there is some concern that a really hot number today could prompt the FOMC to go accelerate its tapering program more rapidly, from the current $10bn of US treasuries and $5bn of mortgage-backed securities that it started last month, in an attempt to give themselves more optionality in 2022 when it comes to raising rates. Currently markets are pricing the prospect of a doubling of the taper next week, and any number that hints at a bigger amount next week could prompt some choppiness.

          "headline": "Root and Malan’s unbroken 159 leads England fightback in first Ashes Test",
          "bodyText": "Two days of one-way traffic on Vulture Street had threatened to derail England’s Ashes campaign from the outset but, through a resumption of Joe Root’s remarkable form in 2021 and Dawid Malan’s penchant for Australian conditions, an impressive fightback was marshalled on the third. By stumps it felt as if their tour had finally begun in earnest. Root was unbeaten on 86 from 158 balls, fresh from overtaking Michael Vaughan’s record of 1,481 runs in a calendar year and smiling once more, while Malan was 80 not out from 177. England appeared to need snookers when 147 proved their maximum on day one but through the pair’s unbroken stand of 159, one that took the tourists to 220 for two, just 58 behind, the gloom had lifted. Both Englishmen batted beautifully. Root was back in the bubble that has returned six centuries since the start of January, removing all risk, sweeping Nathan Lyon confidently to continue the off-spinner’s hunt for a 400th wicket and repelling the seamers with authority. The captain had spoken of setting the record straight in Australia before this series and, having battled through cramp and worn blows to the body and knee along the way, a new highest score in these parts had put words into action. More important, however much Australia remained favourites to take a 1-0 lead, the pair had delivered an important reminder to others that life does get easier once the Kookaburra ball goes soft and the heat kicks in. If Lyon can be successfully milked, the pressure on the seamers increases. Root, at the crease for eight of England’s 10 century stands this year, was always likely to be one to issue this diktat. Back in the UK there is every chance that Ed Smith, the former England selector, was nodding away in his pyjamas about Malan. It was Smith who dropped him in 2018, with the parting comment that his game was perhaps better suited to overseas hanging over the left-hander for some time. Yet as ill-judged as that appraisal was, given Malan’s sensitive nature, it did acknowledge what is a clear strength. Now an experienced campaigner at 34, and with a century in Perth four years ago to his name, Malan clearly thrives on bouncier surfaces. There was one narrow escape here when a ball from Lyon missed his off-bail by less than two centimetres, plus a review for caught behind on 23 that showed nothing on HotSpot despite Australia’s belief to the contrary. But otherwise he held firm, his well-judged recall last summer summed up by one imperious driven four off Pat Cummins that was arguably the shot of the day. Needless to say that on a day when one brave England supporter successfully proposed to his Australian girlfriend in the stands, the alliance that formed out in the middle was desperately needed. When Mark Wood speared a yorker into the stumps of Travis Head on 152 in the morning to terminate Australia’s first innings for 425, the first-innings deficit of 278 runs looked as sheer as California’s El Capitan. Having ransacked a century the previous evening, Head helped plunder 83 more runs in the space of 20.3 overs, mowing Jack Leach square to bring up his 150 from just 148 balls and bringing up three figures in the left-armer’s runs column to boot; coming in 12.1 overs, Leach’s gallon is now the fastest in Ashes cricket. At least the return of Ollie Robinson and Ben Stokes with the ball allayed concerns over their fitness. Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed gambolled off the field to strap on their pads, the former having been the embodiment of his side’s misery up to this point after a diamond duck on the first morning and the inexcusable drop at slip that gave David Warner a reprieve halfway through his eventual 94. Moments such as this are when Test cricket offers unrivalled torture for the player but has the audience reaching for the popcorn. Australia’s fielders were handed plenty of material too when, for just the third time in 30 Tests (and the first without a nightwatchman at the other end), Burns declined to face the first ball of an innings. But despite this, the delayed rematch with Mitchell Starc delivered instant drama when Burns was given out lbw on the field third ball, only for his review to prove the ball was going over. Reaching lunch unbeaten on 13, with England 23 for no loss, Burns could soon breathe a bit easier. However, the bounce that saved Burns (and was yet to return a single lbw by the end of the eighth session) proved the undoing of both openers after the restart. Cummins almost immediately got one to rear off the surface and take the shoulder of Burns’s bat for a simple slip catch. Although Hameed lined up well for the second time, showing courage under fire and again ignoring the Queensland heat by batting in a cable-knit tank top, a strangle down leg off Starc made it scores of 25 and 27 for the match. This was smart captaincy from Cummins, who after the fall of Burns had then held himself and Josh Hazlewood back in the hope of hitting Root with fresh legs. But from 61 for two, still 217 in arrears, Root got himself off a pair fourth ball and, alongside Malan, set about constructing two sessions of determined yet positive resistance. With Hazlewood sending down only eight overs to prompt questions over a possible niggle and Warner off the field all day after being struck in the ribs by Ben Stokes 24 hours earlier, Australia finally had headaches of their own."

          "headline": "Court rules Trump cannot block release of documents to Capitol attack panel",
          "bodyText": "Donald Trump suffered a major defeat on Thursday when a federal appeals court ruled against his effort to block the release of documents related to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Trump is expected to appeal to the supreme court. A select committee in the House of Representatives is investigating the events on and surrounding 6 January, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s election win. Amid scenes of violence that shocked America and the world, five people eventually died and scores were injured. Trump and a clique of his close advisors have repeatedly engaged in legal action over the committee’s investigations, including refusing to cooperate with it. But in a 3-0 decision, the United States court of appeals for the District of Columbia said there was a “unique legislative need” for documents that the committee has requested but whose release Trump has sought to keep secret through executive privilege – a legal doctrine that protects the confidentiality of some White House communications. The appeals court ruled an injunction that has prevented the National Archives from turning over the documents will expire in two weeks, or when the supreme court rules on an expected appeal from Trump, whichever is later. Trump sued the committee and the National Archives to stop the White House from allowing the release of documents related to the insurrection. Biden had waived Trump’s executive privilege claims as the current officeholder. Arguing for the committee, the US House lawyer Douglas Letter said the determination of a current president should outweigh predecessors in almost all circumstances and noted that both Biden and Congress were in agreement that the 6 January records should be turned over. The court agreed. In a 68-page ruling, Judge Patricia Ann Millett wrote: “On the record before us, former President Trump has provided no basis for this court to override President Biden’s judgment and the agreement and accommodations worked out between the political branches over these documents.” The opinion continued: “Both branches agree that there is a unique legislative need for these documents, and that they are directly relevant to the committee’s inquiry into an attack on the legislative branch and its constitutional role in the peaceful transfer of power.” Executive privilege for presidential communications is “a qualified one”, Millett added. “The president and the legislative branch have shown a national interest in and pressing need for the prompt disclosure of these documents.” The National Archives has said the records Trump wants to block include presidential diaries, visitor logs, speech drafts, handwritten notes “concerning the events of January 6” from the files of his former chief of staff Mark Meadows, and “a draft executive order on the topic of election integrity”. Such evidence could provide the House committee with crucial details of Trump’s actions and communications in the west wing over the hours that the insurrection unfolded. The mob was acting on his “big lie” that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. Democrats welcomed the court’s ruling as a victory for democracy. Gerry Connolly of Virginia told the MSNBC network: “It’s in the finest judicial tradition, upholding the rule of law and asserting that nobody is above the law. “It harkens back to the Pentagon Papers decision and the handing over of the White House tapes during the Nixon years in Watergate. These are critical kinds of judicial rulings that buttress democracy and democratic institutions and the rule of law. So I was very pleased to see today’s new ruling.” All three of the appeals court judges who heard the arguments were nominated by Democrats. Millett and Judge Robert Wilkins were nominated by Barack Obama. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is a Biden appointee seen as a contender for a supreme court seat should one open during the current administration. Trump is almost certain to appeal to the supreme court, where three of the nine justices were appointed during his presidency. The court would be asked to weigh the views of a former president versus those of the incumbent on the scope of executive privilege. The House committee said on Thursday it is moving toward holding Meadows in contempt of Congress after he failed to cooperate. It said it would hold a business meeting on Monday to vote on a report recommending the full House cite Meadows for contempt of Congress and refer him for federal prosecution. Liz Cheney, a Republican congresswoman and Trump critic who is vice chair of the committee, tweeted on Thursday: “The investigation is firing on all cylinders.” Trump also faces legal peril in New York, where attorney general Letitia James is seeking a deposition from him early next year as part of her investigation into alleged fraud inside the Trump Organization."

          "headline": "Tottenham’s Conference League tale of disaster awaits its latest twist",
          "bodyText": "Even now, at this distance, the video retains all of its shock value; the dark comedy mixing seamlessly with the gloating. Tottenham had lost 1-0 at Paços de Ferreira on 19 August in the first leg of the Europa Conference League play-off and it was the prompt for the Portuguese club to get trolling. Again. After the draw was made, Paços had uploaded a clip of two of their fans discussing the meeting with a London giant. Which one was it? They ran through all of the possibles, deliberately ignoring Spurs, until they were informed that it was indeed them. “Oh, these guys … We can easily beat Tottenham,” they say, before clinking their beer bottles together. Now, with the victory theirs, came that TikTok video. It was not delivered by the club this time, rather endorsed by them with a follow-up comment. It showed the Paços mascot, a giant beaver, gyrating suggestively behind its Spurs counterpart, a giant cockerel, as a supporter did likewise to the right of them. Needless to say, Spurs’s haters in London and beyond loved that and it rather set the tone for the club’s participation in Uefa’s new third-tier competition. Spurs would beat Paços 3-0 in the return to qualify for the group stage but they have not truly been able to win so far, only to avoid humiliation at best and run headlong into its grip at worst. As they have done pretty much whenever they have travelled away from home. Since that famous game, Paços have won only once all season and, if Spurs’s 2-2 draw at Rennes was creditable enough, the occasion was memorable mainly for the sight of Harry Kane leading out the team – shortly after failing to get the transfer he wanted to Manchester City. It was a meme trigger. Wasn’t Kane supposed to be playing Champions League football? Then there have been the defeats at Vitesse and NS Mura, the former after the then manager, Nuno Espírito Santo, left his first XI in London to rest for the weekend Premier League fixture at West Ham; the latter at the hands of the Slovenian minnows – the lowest-ranked team in the group phase – was one of the most embarrassing nights in Spurs’s history. It sparked an angry reaction from Nuno’s successor, Antonio Conte, who said he now understood the extent of the challenge that faced him. Criticism from inside and outside the club has been a recurring theme. The midfielder Harry Winks suggested that Nuno’s selection at Vitesse had been divisive. “We’re meant to be a team … everybody should be fighting for weekend games and it’s difficult,” he said. “Motivation should be everybody fighting for the same cause.” And now Spurs find themselves under fire from Rennes and even Vitesse for their request that Thursday night’s final group tie at home to Rennes be postponed as they reel from the impact of a Covid outbreak, which has forced them to close the first-team area of the training ground. Rennes, who have already topped Group G, raged about being made to travel and then not play, muttering about the impression that Tottenham were still just about above the Uefa threshold of having 13 available, senior players (including one goalkeeper). Meanwhile Vitesse, who are fighting for second place and a spot in a two-legged play-off to reach the last 16, were unhappy that they had to play on Thursday night at home to Mura while their rivals waited. It was because goal difference stood to be a separating factor between the teams. Vitesse pointed out that Spurs sent a B team to play them. Why could they not do so against Rennes? To repeat, Spurs have been ravaged by a frightening illness, turfed out of their place of work, wracked by uncertainty and yet they continue to absorb pot-shots. The club’s Conference League campaign has been a disaster from the start and yet it is not over. But for a quirk of fate, it would have been after Vitesse won 3-1 at home to Mura. Spurs’s away result against the Dutch club was a 1-0 loss before they beat them 3-2 at home, meaning that they are tied on the initial head-to-head tiebreaker in terms of points, goal difference and goals scored. Previously, Vitesse’s greater number of away goals in the matches between the clubs would have given them the edge but Uefa scrapped that rule this season and it now moves on to goal difference in all of the group games. The upshot of Vitesse’s margin of victory over Mura was that Spurs need a win by any scoreline when they play the rearranged Rennes match. In other words, they remain in the driving seat to advance in the competition that they did not want to enter; to add anywhere up to nine extra games to the second-half of their season – at a time when Conte intends to push for a top-four league finish. Never mind the strangely discombobulating Thursday-Sunday cycle, how much value would there be in winning the Conference League? To many onlookers, it has been written in the stars that Spurs will reach the final and face Roma, who are managed by their former manager, José Mourinho. On all the available evidence, they ought to be careful what they wish for."

You can also read all the key coronavirus stories from our team of reporters here. A number of schools in Wales are extending their day by an hour to try to help youngsters catch up after Covid lockdowns. The Welsh government will invest up to £2m on the trial, allowing 14 primaries and secondaries across south Wales to open for groups of children for an extra five hours a week. Schools can choose what they do with the time and may put on sessions such as art, music and sport or academic lessons. If successful, the trial could lead to a longer school day being introduced permanently and school leaders, children and parents are also to be asked to think about whether the shape of the academic year should also be reformed with, for example, the summer holiday being made shorter. Read the full story here. Early data indicates the Omicron Covid variant may more easily reinfect people who have already had the virus or been vaccinated than previous variants, but could also cause milder disease, the WHO said Wednesday. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters: Emerging data from South Africa suggests increased risk of reinfection with Omicron ... there is also some evidence that Omicron causes milder disease than Delta”. But he stressed that more data was needed before drawing firm conclusions, and urged countries everywhere to boost their surveillance to help provide a clearer picture of how Omicron is behaving. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that so far the data indicates the variant is “efficiently transmitting, and probably more efficiently transmitting even than the Delta variant.” “But it means the virus is more efficient at transmitting between human beings. And therefore we have to redouble our efforts to break those chains of transmission to protect ourselves to protect others.” Even if the new variant turns out to be less dangerous than previous variants, if it transmits more rapidly, it could still sicken more people, overburden health systems, “and more people die,” he said. Hello I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be taking over the blog from my colleague Tom Ambrose. As I’m reporting to you from Sydney, Australia, here are some recently released numbers from Down Under. The state of NSW has recorded 420 new Covid-19 cases and one death. Victoria recorded 1,232 new Covid-19 cases and nine deaths. The states of Queensland and the Northern Territory just announced they hit the 80% fully vaccinated mark. Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce also announced this morning that he has tested positive for Covid-19 while in Washington. Reading their phone halfway down a wintry Whitehall early on Wednesday morning, a breathless cabinet minister was agog at the leaked news that the prime minister was about to introduce plan B measures. “It’s just one fucking thing after another, isn’t it?” By the time plans got to a virtual cabinet signoff on Wednesday afternoon, the response was muted and routine. During the Covid-O meeting that preceded it, Boris Johnson agreed to temper the measures slightly, including adding the option of a rapid negative test to Covid passports – the measure that had been the main focus of opposition. But though a tense agreement was finally reached, the private mood in SW1 among MPs and cabinet ministers in the run-up to the prime minister’s hastily arranged press conference was nothing short of mutinous. Many told the Guardian that Johnson’s personal character and authority were now on the line – with no excuses made for bad advice. Sajid Javid, once seen as the bright hope of anti-lockdown MPs, rose to give his evening statement in the Commons to a shout of “resign” by MP William Wragg. “What a load of old tripe,” another yelled as Javid said the decision was not taken lightly. Omicron cases could exceed 1 million by the end of this month on the current trajectory, Sajid Javid has told MPs, describing the new variant as “an even more formidable foe”. In a statement delivered to the House of Commons, the UK health secretary said that there were 568 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant but that the estimated current number is “probably closer to 10,000”. In a statement on Wednesday evening, he said: “The UK health security agency (UKHSA) estimates that the number of infections is approximately 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases, and so the current number of infections is probably closer to 10,000. “UKHSA also estimate that at the current observed doubling rate of between two and a half and three days, by the end of this month, infections could exceed 1 million.” Javid said there was now confidence that Omicron is “far more transmissible” than Delta, but he said there was still a lot to learn about the new variant. He said Delta cases had doubled in around seven days, and that Omicron was spreading at an even faster rate. “Based on the latest data from here and around the world, our latest analysis is that it’s been around, it’s between 2.5 and three days.” The statement followed scientific advice to ministers on Tuesday that provided a stark outline of the potential consequences of failing to take action to suppress the spread of the virus. Good evening. I’m Tom Ambrose and will be bringing you the latest Covid news over the next hour or so. We start with the news that US federal health officials have authorised a new Covid-19 antibody drug for people with serious health problems or allergies who cannot get adequate protection from vaccination. Antibody drugs have been a standard treatment for treating Covid infections for more than a year. But the AstraZeneca antibody drug cleared by the Food and Drug Administration is different. It is the first authorised for long-term prevention against Covid-19 infection, rather than a short-term treatment. People who could benefit from the antibody drug include cancer patients, organ transplant recipients and people taking immune-suppressing drugs for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Health experts estimate about 2% to 3% of the US population falls into that group. Below is a snapshot of the latest Coronavirus stories from around the world: In the UK, Boris Johnson has announced a move to further restrictions saying Omicron is spreading faster than Delta and that the known cases are almost certainly an underestimate. Johnson said: “It’s now the proportionate and the responsible thing to move to plan B.” From Monday, people are advised to work from home if they can. Denmark will again impose restrictions aimed at curbing the rapid spread of Covid including the new Omicron variant, the country’s prime minister said on Wednesday. France has reported 93,071 Coronavirus deaths in hospital, up by 129. It reported that 2,426 people were in intensive care units for Covid, up by 75 on the previous day’s figures. Governments should urgently reassess their national responses to Covid-19 and accelerate their vaccination programmes to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The World Health Organsation’s chief scientist said it was too soon to say whether a reduction in neutralising antibodies found in Pfizer’s vaccine against the Omicron variant meant the jab was less effective. Slovakia will on Friday reopen non-essential shops and some services for those vaccinated against Covid-19 while at the same time extending a lockdown for others and closing some schools, health minister Vladimir Lengvarsky said. South Africa has approved Pfizer’s coronavirus booster shots for over-18s, as the Omicron variant dominates rising new infections.The South African Health Products Authority said in a statement that it was authorising a third vaccine dose “in individuals aged 18 years and older, to be administered at least six months after the second dose”. Italy has reported 17,959 Coronavirus cases, up from 15,756 on Tuesday.Elsewhere, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia continue to see an increase in cases, while Ecuador, Chile and Argentina saw a drop. UK figures show 51,342 new people had a confirmed positive test result reported on 8 December 2021.Between 2 and 8 December, 339,861 people had a confirmed positive test result, an increase of 11.3% compared to the previous week. BioNTech and Pfizer said on Wednesday a three-shot course of their Covid-19 vaccine was able to neutralise the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test and they could deliver an Omicron-based vaccine in March 2022 if needed. • This post was amended on 9 December 2021 to clarify the guidance on working from home. In the UK, Boris Johnson has announced a move to further restrictions saying Omicron is spreading faster than Delta and that the known cases are almost certainly an underestimate. Johnson says: “It’s now the proportionate and the responsible thing to move to plan B.” From Monday, people are advised to work from home if they can. Additionally, from this Frida the legal requirement to wear face masks in public indoor venues will be extended to include theatres and cinemas. Johnson said: “[We] will also make the NHS COVID pass mandatory for entry into nightclubs and venues where large crowds gather, including unseated indoor venues with more than 500 people, and seated outdoor venues with more than 4000 people and any venue with more than 10,000 people.” • This post was amended on 9 December 2021 to clarify the guidance on working from home. France’s Ile-de-France region on Wednesday said that all hospitals are activating an emergency plan due to the strained Covid-19 situation. The plan includes stepping up the number of intensive care unit beds and, if necessary, reschedule treatments to free up capacities. With more than 12 million people, the Ile-de-France - with the capital Paris at its centre - is France’s biggest region. Denmark will again impose restrictions aimed at curbing the rapid spread of Covid including the new Omicron variant, the country’s prime minister said on Wednesday. France has reported 93,071 Coronavirus deaths in hospital, up by 129. It reported that 2,426 people were in intensive care units for Covid, up by 75 on the previous day’s figures. Elsewhere, South Africa reported nearly 20,000 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, a record since the Omicron variant emerged. Interesting explainer on the new Covid rules that could be imminent in England. The World Health Organsation’s chief scientist said it was too soon to say whether a reduction in neutralising antibodies found in Pfizer’s vaccine against the Omicron variant meant the jab was less effective. “I think it is premature to conclude that this reduction in neutralising activity would result in a significant reduction in vaccine effectiveness. We do not know that,” Soumya Swaminathan told a media briefing, adding a coordinated research effort was needed to avoid jumping to conclusions. Slovakia will on Friday reopen non-essential shops and some services for those vaccinated against Covid-19 while at the same time extending a lockdown for others and closing some schools, health minister Vladimir Lengvarsky said. The central European country of 5.5 million people has struggled with one of the world’s worst coronavirus waves in the past few weeks, and shut shops and services for all people for two weeks ending 9 December. Lengvarsky had sought to extend the general lockdown until 26 December, and to ease it for the vaccinated from 17 December. But the government, seeking to raise the appeal of vaccinations in one of Europe’s least inoculated countries, opted to ease rules now for those who received the shots while extending them until 9 January for the rest. South Africa’s economy has rebounded after Covid, the IMF said while predicting slower growth than the government’s forecast with a “lackluster” mid-term outlook. While the country’s finance ministry predicts the economy will grow by 5.1% this year, the International Monetary Fund said it expects growth to be 4.6%. “The recovery was also supported by external factors, such as favourable commodity prices and benign financial conditions, which are likely temporary,” the IMF said. South Africa’s economy contracted 6.4% last year, when a strict lockdown brought most economic activity to a standstill in the continent’s most industrialised country. Rolling power cuts forced by ageing and poorly designed power plants have added to the economic woes. Austria has cancelled its famous Vienna Opera Ball for the second year running over the coronavirus pandemic, the government said. Keeping the February 24, 2022 date would have sent “the wrong signal” as the country is only to start emerging from a partial lockdown this Sunday, state secretary for culture Andrea Mayer said. “The Opera Ball is typically the kind of event at which social distancing is impossible,” she told the Austrian news agency APA. The ball, a major event in Austria’s cultural calendar attended by the country’s political and economic elites as well as foreign celebrities, was also cancelled last year over the Covid-19 pandemic. South Africa has approved Pfizer’s coronavirus booster shots for over-18s, as the Omicron variant dominates rising new infections. The South African Health Products Authority said in a statement that it was authorising a third vaccine dose “in individuals aged 18 years and older, to be administered at least six months after the second dose”. Severely immuno-compromised children aged between 12 and 17 years can be given a third shot at least 28 days after their second dose, it added. The statement came hours after BioNTech and Pfizer announced that two doses of their vaccine may not be enough to protect against the highly-mutating Omicron variant which is causing global concern that it can transmit faster than previous strains. In preliminary results released on Wednesday, the pharmaceutical companies stressed their jab “is still effective in preventing Covid-19, also against Omicron” after a third shot. Preliminary results from a small study in South Africa suggested there was up to a 40-fold drop in the ability of the antibodies from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to neutralise Omicron, compared to the earlier Beta variant of coronavirus. With a cumulative tally of 3,051,222 detected infections and 90,002 deaths, Covid has hit South Africa harder than any other country on the continent. The Omicron variant of Covid has been detected so far in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and the United States, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). It said Covid infections were increasing in Canada and Mexico’s Baja California. Italy has reported 17,959 Coronavirus cases, up from 15,756 on Tuesday. Elsewhere, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia contrinue to see an increase in cases, while Ecuador, Chile and Argentina saw a drop. UK figures show 51,342 new people had a confirmed positive test result reported on 8 December 2021. Between 2 and 8 December, 339,861 people had a confirmed positive test result, an increase of 11.3% compared to the previous week. There were 161 deaths within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus. Governments should urgently reassess their national responses to Covid-19 and accelerate their vaccination programmes to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The global spread of the variant suggests it could have a major impact on the pandemic, and the time to contain it is now, before more Omicron patients are hospitalised, he told a news briefing. “We call on all countries to increase surveillance, testing and sequencing,” he said. “... Any complacency now will cost lives.” A bereaved relative of two Covid victims has called into question the ability of the UK prime minister Boris Johnson to continue to lead his nation through the pandemic after the allegations his staff breached rules designed to stop the spread of Covid. Jane Roche, whose father Vince Pettitt and older sister Jocelyn Pettitt died within a week of each other in April last year, spoke after the prime minister responded to her case being raised in Parliament by urging her to get herself a booster jab. Her MP Jack Dromey had said she was “devastated and appalled” at the allegations a party had taken place in Downing Street while the rest of the country was following the prime minister’s instructions to lock down. Johnson apologised and replied: “I urge her and everybody else to get their booster jab and look after themselves.” Roche subsequently told the PA news agency: I’m not happy with the heartbreak he has already caused. Telling people to go and get their booster jabs is a kick in the teeth. I feel he is constantly letting us down ... I have looked after myself, and so have thousands of others. We don’t need him telling us what to do. It’s insensitive – very insensitive, but then I’m used to him making wrong decisions. We reported earlier that BioNTech and Pfizer said a three-shot course of their vaccine was able to neutralise the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test. Now the former company’s chief executive has told reporters the interval between the second and third doses can be reduced to at least three months to enable better protection in the crucial winter season. Ugur Sahin said new data would prompt a discussion about bringing the third shot of its currently available vaccine forward. We believe this is the right way to go. It is very clear that our vaccine for the Omicron variant should be a three-dose vaccine. There have also been four additional cases of the Omicron variant in Wales, the UKHSA said, and the first three cases reported in Northern Ireland. Across the UK in total, there have been 131 additional cases, bringing the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 568, the agency said. In the UK, a further 115 cases of the Omicron variant have been reported across England, the UK Health Security Agency said. It brings the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in England to 448, the agency said. US stock index futures edged higher after Pfizer and BioNTech said a three-shot course of their Covid-19 vaccine was shown to have a neutralising effect against the new Omicron coronavirus variant in a laboratory test. Shares of Pfizer rose 1.0% in premarket trading. The drugmakers added that, if needed, they can deliver an Omicron-based vaccine in March 2022. “This is really the first positive news in terms of the potential effectiveness of existing vaccines,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. “Anything that suggests we’re not headed for a period of a return to the problems we had earlier this year is a positive for most stocks.” Travel stocks recouped earlier declines, with Norwegian Cruise Line and Alaska Air Group rising 2.6% and 1.9%, respectively. Futures tracking US stock indexes had pared gains earlier in the day after reports said Britain could implement tougher Covid measures, including advice to work from home, as early as Thursday in a bid to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. In the UK, the prime minister’s office at Downing Street would not be drawn on whether plan B measures – stricter rules to deal with the Omicron variant – were due to be put in place. An official spokesman said Johnson had taken part in a “standard meeting” on Wednesday where he was presented with the latest data on coronavirus. He said: “We would set up any changes should they be required in the normal way.” Asked whether people should go into work on Thursday, he added: “The restrictions are as set out, there are no restrictions on that, and as we have throughout we will update should any changes be necessary.” Britain has urged private Covid test firms to stop exploiting travellers, after a former competitions chief said the market was a “rip-off jungle”. “We’ve been clear it is unacceptable for any private testing company to take advantage of holidaymakers,” the Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement. “The government has taken action to drive down the cost of tests for international travel.” The call came one day after Britain rolled out new travel curbs to try and prevent transmission of the Omicron variant. The price of private Covid testing has fallen considerably this year in the face of pressure from the government and the travel industry. However, Lord Andrew Tyrie, former chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority, labelled the market a “rip-off jungle”. Tyrie told the BBC on Wednesday that “misleading online advertisements, overpricing (and) unacceptably poor service … are still widespread” in the market. “To allow this to continue over the peak Christmas period would be scandalous,” he warned. The latest stories around Coronavirus from around the world: • BioNTech and Pfizer said on Wednesday a three-shot course of their Covid-19 vaccine was able to neutralise the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test and they could deliver an Omicron-based vaccine in March 2022 if needed. In the first official statement from vaccine manufacturers on the likely efficacy of their shot against Omicron, BioNTech and Pfizer said two vaccine doses resulted in significantly lower neutralising antibodies, but that a third dose of their vaccine increased the neutralising antibodies by a factor of 25. • The Omicron variant has been reported in 57 nations and the number of patients needing hospitalisation is likely to rise as it spreads, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. The WHO, in its weekly epidemiological report, said more data was needed to assess the severity of disease caused by the Omicron variant and whether its mutations might reduce protection from vaccine-derived immunity. • Germany records highest daily Covid deaths since February Germany recorded the highest number of deaths from Covid-19 since February on Wednesday as it battled to stop a fourth wave of the pandemic. • A total of 69,601 new infections were reported, 2,415 more than the same time a week ago, and another 527 people died – the highest number since 12 February – to bring the total to 104,047, the Robert Koch Institute for disease control said. • South Korea will consider expanding home treatment of coronavirus patients, a health official said, as both new daily infections and severe cases hit record highs, putting hospital capacity under strain. Infections in the country have skyrocketed after the government began to ease restrictions under a so-called “living with Covid-19” scheme in November. • The EU expects European plants to produce 3.6bn shots in 2022 Vaccine plants in the European Union are expected to produce 3.6bn Covid-19 shots next year, out of a global output of more than 20bn, two senior EU officials said. • Nigeria’s health minister said some Covid-19 doses donated by rich western countries had a shelf life that left only weeks to administer the shots. BioNTech and Pfizer said on Wednesday a three-shot course of their Covid-19 vaccine was able to neutralise the new Omicron variant in a laboratory test and they could deliver an Omicron-based vaccine in March 2022 if needed. In the first official statement from vaccine manufacturers on the likely efficacy of their shot against Omicron, BioNTech and Pfizer said that two vaccine doses resulted in significantly lower neutralising antibodies but that a third dose of their vaccine increased the neutralising antibodies by a factor of 25. Blood obtained from people that had their third booster shot a month ago neutralised the Omicron variant about as effectively as blood after two doses fought off the original virus first identified in China. “Ensuring as many people as possible are fully vaccinated with the first two dose series and a booster remains the best course of action to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” Pfizer boss Albert Bourla said in the statement. Though the necessity remains unclear, the companies said they would continue their effort to bring an Omicron-specific Covid-19 vaccine to market, which they kick-started when the new lineage first raised global concern among scientists on 15 November. In the UK, Boris Johnson said that the Omicron Covid-19 variant was spreading much faster than other mutations. During prime ministers questions, he was asked by the Labour leader, Kier Starmer, about reports of a Christmas party at No 10 during last year’s lockdown. He replied that the focus should be on the spread of the concerning new Covid variant, Omicron, which he said was infecting people at a “much faster” rate than previous iterations of the virus. Countries considering introducing vaccine mandates in the fight against Covid-19 must ensure they respect human rights, the UN rights chief said, stressing that forced vaccination was never acceptable. Speaking to a Human Rights Council seminar via video message, Michelle Bachelet warned there were significant rights considerations that needed to be taken into account before making vaccination compulsory. Any “vaccine mandates must comply with the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination”, she said, according to a transcript. “In no circumstances should people be forcibly administered a vaccine.” The first person in the world to be given a fully-tested Covid-19 vaccine, 91-year-old Briton Margaret Keenan, urged people on Wednesday to get vaccinated, one year on from her shot. Keenan described receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 8 December 2020 as the “best thing that has ever happened”. “It was wonderful. I cannot believe it now, what happened at the time... I’m so happy I got the jab,” Keenan, known to friends as Maggie, said in a broadcast clip to mark the anniversary. “I encourage everyone to have it.” Prime minister Boris Johnson has highlighted Britain’s early success in rolling out Covid vaccines and said it is why he was able to reopen England’s economy in July. He is now urging officials to scale up the country’s ongoing booster programme to a similar level as the initial rollout in light of concern over the new Omicron variant, which has also seen him reintroduce some mask mandates and travel restrictions. In the UK, a new set of coronavirus restrictions including orders to work from home and the introduction of vaccine passports is being considered to deal with rising cases and the spread of the Omicron variant. Downing Street sources insisted “no decisions have been made” but there is widespread speculation that further measures could be imminent. A prominent member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned that a full UK-wide lockdown to deal with the threat of the Omicron variant cannot be ruled out, although the current threat posed by the strain remains unclear. Any move to impose fresh restrictions would be viewed with suspicion in Westminster at a time when Johnson is under pressure over allegations No 10 staff breached lockdown rules by holding a Christmas party last December. The main political Covid story of the day in the UK continues to be the fallout from the allegations that Downing Street staff held a Christmas party last year, contrary to the Covid regulations at the time. A series of senior ministers spent a week strenuously denying it took place, and then last night a video emerged which appeared to show Downing Street staff a couple of days after the party laughing and joking about it. I should add that in the last few minutes there has been a lot of chatter from political journalists that an announcement on imposing further Covid restrictions in England in the run-up to this Christmas is being mooted for today or tomorrow. Andrew Sparrow has our live coverage of the politics side of that over on our UK blog. On this live blog, I’m just about to be replaced by my colleague Sarah Marsh. She will be bringing you the latest Covid developments around the world, plus any of the non-political Covid lines from the UK, around the Omicron variant and booster jab programme and so forth. Here’s what we’ve been reporting so far today: It is the first anniversary of the first vaccination against Covid, and it has been announced that the booster jab programme in England. Every adult aged 40 and over and all those in high-risk groups will be able to arrange their Covid booster jab to take place three months after their second dose. However, amid the Christmas party scandal, both health secretary Sajid Javid and vaccines minister Maggie Throup pulled all their media appearances. Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer has said he expects to see a “rapid increase” in cases of the Covid-19 Omicron variant before Christmas. The former chairman of the UK competition regulator has condemned the market for PCR tests for travellers, describing it as a “rip-off jungle”. Germany has recorded its highest number of deaths from Covid-19 since February. However, the country’s seven-day incidence rate of cases per 100,000 people continued to fall, declining to 427 from 432 on Tuesday. The Philippines will ban travellers coming from France to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. Japan has reported its fourth case of the Omicron coronavirus variant. South Korean authorities are urging people to get vaccinated as case rise in the east Asian nation generally regarded as having dealth with the pandemic well. Daily cases exceeded 7,000 for the first time on Tuesday, the government reported on Wednesday, heaping pressure on hospitals. Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, says it will halve the output of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot from next week as it had no fresh orders from the government. Leading scientists in the World Health Organization and the US have said the Omicron variant appears to be no worse than other coronavirus strains – but have warned that more research is needed to judge its severity. WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan said that while it is likely more transmissible than previous variants, Omicron is also “highly unlikely” to completely evade vaccine protections. Virologist Sandra Ciesek of the University hospital Frankfurt, on the other hand, has published data that appears to show a weakened immune response from vaccinated blood cells when faced with the Omicron variant. The study has not been peer-reviewed or formally published. In Australia, prime minister Scott Morrison has urged Gerard Rennick to listen to medical experts after the Liberal senator labelled the approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children aged five to 11 “completely irresponsible”. A quick snap from Reuters here, that the Philippines will ban travellers coming from France to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the presidential office said. The ban, which applies to everyone who has been in France in the past 14 days, runs from 10-15 December. This adds to an earlier ban on travellers from South Africa and 13 other countries to prevent Omicron, which has yet to be detected in the Philippines. I am going to caveat this as ever by saying that most experts agree that it is too early to tell what impact the Omicron variant will have on vaccination efforts. However, Reuters is carrying a somewhat bleak analysis that has emerged from virologist Sandra Ciesek of the University hospital Frankfurt. Stressing that she has posted only selected findings and a paper hasn’t been presented yet, she has said exposing the blood of vaccinated individuals to different virus variants, she found that the ability to mount an antibody response to Omicron in people who had three shots of BioNTech/Pfizer was up to 37 times lower than the response to Delta. An antibody response to Omicron half a year after a two-shot regimen of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or a mixed course of AstraZeneca/BioNTech was not even measurable, Ciesek added. “The set of data underscores that it makes sense to develop a vaccine that is adapted to Omicron,” Chiesek tweeted, adding that no conclusion could be drawn about protection against severe disease. Japan has reported its fourth case of the Omicron coronavirus variant, TV Asahi said on Wednesday. The fresh case was a man in his 50s who had stayed in Nigeria, the network reported. Reuters reminds us that the Japanese government has enforced tighter border controls against the Omicron variant. Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer has said he expects to see a “rapid increase” in cases of the Covid-19 Omicron variant before Christmas. Sir Michael McBride was speaking after the first three cases of the Omicron variant detected in Northern Ireland were confirmed on Tuesday evening. He said all three confirmed cases are linked to travel and there is not thought to be community transmission of the variant yet. However, PA Media reports Sir Michael said there are likely to be more cases than currently identified. He said measures are being taken to try to delay community transmission of the variant, but that is is “absolutely inevitable”. “I think it is absolutely the case that we have more cases in Northern Ireland at present than we have currently detected given the fact that we have community transmission in other parts of these islands, given the freedom of movement of people in these islands which is really important for so many reasons,” he told the BBC’s Stephen Nolan Show. “I think what we will see is a rapid increase in the number of cases identified in the coming days in the run-up to the Christmas period. “What appears to be happening is this virus is getting established very, very quickly in communities where the Delta variant has already been established and it may be the case that in the next period of time that we see this new Omicron variant replacing the Delta variant as the dominant variant in the United Kingdom, in these islands and indeed eventually globally.” Russia’s official Covid numbers have continued their glide down since the country had an enforced week’s holiday at the beginning of November. They recorded 30,752 cases in the last 24 hours, and 1,179 deaths. Cases peaked at just over 40,000 on 6 November. Here’s an updated map showing how caseloads vary across Europe. Andrew Sparrow has launched our UK politics live blog. I expect he is going to be very busy this morning – and then there is PMQs at noon to ratchet it up. You can find that here. I will be continuing with the latest coronavirus news worldwide here, and I’ll also bring you any top Covid-related lines from the UK. I’ll leave the politics to Andrew. The former chairman of the UK competition regulator has condemned the market for PCR tests for travellers, describing it as a “rip-off jungle”. After the return of the requirement to take the tests on return from abroad, Lord Tyrie accused the government of once again allowing the companies offering PCR tests to manipulate the system by making them available at unrealistic prices. “For this policy to get into a mess once might be seen as a misfortune but for it to resurface again after all the warnings over the summer would have to be described as carelessness,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It was a scandal waiting to happen and it’s now happened and it needs very urgent action.” Last week, the Guardian revealed that a slew of the cheapest deals on PCR tests had been removed from the government website amid concerns travellers were being misled by companies advertising the coronavirus testing service for less than £1. Read more of Mark Sweney’s report here: Covid PCR test market a ‘rip-off jungle’, says ex-chair of competition regulator If you are rushing to book your booster jab in England today, a note from my colleague Helen Pidd: The NHS put out a press release last night saying that “people aged 40 and over, along with those in high-risk groups, will be able to book in for their life-saving Covid booster jab three months after their second dose as the NHS vaccine programme is extended today”. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, was tweeting about the move this morning, encouraging people to go online today to book. Yet 40-somethings trying to book their booster have been frustrated this morning as it emerged the NHS vaccine booking service hasn’t yet got the memo. You can still only book in for an imminent third jab if your second dose was 152 days ago (five months), as per the old rules. A message on the site says: “The booking system is currently being updated.” In the UK, Robert Halfon, who is chairman of the Commons education committee, appears to be the most senior MP to have come out with a statement about the Downing Street Christmas party story. PA Media quotes him telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I certainly think that those who were doing the video should apologise for the insensitivity of it when people were suffering and struggling all through that time.” He stopped short of calling for the prime minister to apologise. Halfon also said the fact that the Department for Education held a social gathering of staff last December was “pretty grim”. “I feel seriously upset about what went on in the Department for Education in my own area,” he said. “They have admitted that there was a party. I think that’s pretty grim given that children were being sent home, schools were being shut down.” “And I think that the new secretary of state, who cares deeply about these issues, should call those in and hold whoever was responsible … hold them accountable.” UK health secretary Sajid Javid has just been tweeting about the increased rollout of booster jabs in England. Alan White, the editor-in-chief of Politics Home, had a suggestion for him: In Australia, prime minister Scott Morrison has urged Gerard Rennick to listen to medical experts after the Liberal senator labelled the approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children aged five to 11 “completely irresponsible”. Rennick has experienced a meteoric rise in reach on Facebook, adding 70,000 followers in a little over a month, as he shared stories of vaccine adverse events he admits he can’t be sure are “100% accurate” and videos of anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne. Since the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved Pfizer for kids on Sunday, Rennick has lashed out over “serious concerns” about the sample size of clinical trials and again refused to vote for government legislation, this time warning he will do so until the approval is revoked. At a Covid-19 committee hearing on Tuesday senior health officials rejected Rennick’s claims vaccinations amount to “experimenting” on children and pointed to the US experience of administering 5m doses of Pfizer to children aged five to 11 as evidence it is “worthwhile, safe and effective”. Read more of Paul Karp’s report here: Scott Morrison tries to rein in Gerard Rennick after senator says Pfizer for children is ‘completely irresponsible’ Here’s my colleague Archie Bland’s review of how the British press have been covering the Downing Street Christmas party storm this morning. Well, most of them anyway. It is an ill-wind that blows no good, and there are at least some members of the Conservative party today using the government’s discomfort over the Downing Street Christmas party allegations to take the opportunity to push their agenda. Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, has repeatedly railed against Covid restrictions. He told Times Radio this morning that these developments probably means the end of mandatory restrictions in England. He said: I think now that, going forward, any measures will be advisory. I think it would be very difficult to enshrine them in law and then once again ask our poor police forces to enforce them. To be very proscriptive about this now, particularly as we’ve had such a successful vaccine rollout … is much more difficult, and was always going to be much more difficult. And the events of the last 24 hours make it probably almost impossible now. Walker was the Tory MP who threatened to protest against lockdown restrictions earlier this year by carrying a pint of milk around with him at all times. Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine maker, will halve the output of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot from next week as it had no fresh orders from the government, its CEO Adar Poonawalla told CNBC-TV18, Reuters report “I am going to be reducing production by at least 50% to begin with, going forward on a monthly basis, until orders again pick up either in India or the world,” Poonawalla said. SII is producing 250m doses of the vaccine, which it brands Covishield. The shot accounts for nearly 90% of the 1.3bn total vaccine doses administered in India. Earlier this year, India prevented the export of vaccines in order to shore up the delivery of its own domestic vaccination programme. In the UK, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, has been doing the media round – unopposed since the government have declined to send anybody to be interviewed today. He told Sky News it was “Boris Johnson’s moment to come clean, to speak the truth. And probably to apologise to the British people.” He said: He [Johnson] is the public health lead for our country in chief. If there are people sitting opposite you on the tube, or on the train, not wearing a mask, you can understand why they might say why should I bother when Boris Johnson doesn’t bother? This is important because this cost lives, this recklessness. This casualness with the truth costs lives. We’re facing a very serious mutation of the virus. We may have to have more restriction. That is why this is so serious. This business of ‘we stayed within the rules, we followed’ the guidance, we all know it’s hogwash. We all know a lie when we see one. And that appears to be what we’re facing today. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, has been on the airwaves in the UK this morning saying the Omicron variant was concerning but it was still unknown what its impact will be on severe disease. PA Media quotes him telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Certainly case numbers of Omicron are doubling at least every three days, maybe even every two days at the moment, so it’s accelerating very fast and put that in context, it’s the same if not faster than we saw with the original strain of the virus in March of last year. So it is a concern. It’s likely to overtake Delta before Christmas at this rate, precisely when is hard to say. Prof Ferguson said the peak of this wave of infection will be in January if no measures are taken to slow it down. If you don’t do anything at the current time, it will most likely be sometime in January, But I think the key question is whether the country decides to adopt measures to either slow it down or try to stop it and that will critically depend on really the threat it poses in terms of hospitalisations. There is a rationale, just epidemiologically, to try and slow this down, to buy us more time principally to get boosters into people’s arms because we do think people who are boosted will have the best level of protection possible, but also to buy us more time to really better characterise the threat. So if you imagine a kind of plan B plus with working from home might slow it down – it wouldn’t stop it but it could slow it down, so it’s doubling rather than every two or three days, every five or six days. That doesn’t seem like a lot, but it actually is potentially a lot in terms of allowing us to characterise this virus better and boost population immunity. You can’t really do the equivalent on a live blog, but here’s my colleague Peter Walker describing how the BBC’s Today programme have handled not having a UK government minister to interview this morning. Sir Roger Gale is another Conservative MP who has been prepared to go on the airwaves today in the UK. He told Sky News that he had some details of what happened at the alleged Downing Street Christmas party from “a source”. He told them: The health service could be in trouble, and people’s lives could be at stake. This party, and I’m told by sources that food was taken in, drink was taken in, entertainment was had. And if that is so, that sounds to me pretty much like a party. This is a Barnard Castle moment potentially isn’t it? We cannot say one thing and do another. A cynic might point out that ultimately nobody was held responsible for their actions over Barnard Castle. In Scotland yesterday, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to work from home if possible until at least January over fears of the spread of the Omicron variant. Last night, news broke that a Scottish primary school is closing until next week after Covid cases thought to be Omicron variant were identified among teaching staff. St John’s Primary school in Hamilton is closing because of the impact of the variant on school staff numbers. There are some more quotes from Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts. He said there are signs hospital admissions for Covid-19 were increasing. On the pressure currently facing the NHS, Taylor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The overwhelming majority of NHS leaders say that the situation is extremely difficult. I think we’re facing the hardest winter the NHS has ever had to face, and the care system as well. What we’ve got here is a combination of factors: we’ve got the impact of a decade of austerity which left the health service with a depleted workforce and with capital stock in a poor condition; you then add in Covid, and although the numbers are much less now than they were a year ago, we have still got several thousand people in hospital and unfortunately, there are signs of hospitalisation rates increasing. You’ve then got the backlog of people who didn’t get care, and over the last two years. Not just those people waiting for treatment, but people turning up in emergency departments because they’ve been dealing with an illness for many months, even years, that hasn’t been addressed. He went on to urge people to celebrate Christmas “modestly”. Asked about the Omicron variant, PA Media quote him saying: “As for the new strain, what we know is that the numbers are growing and although the relationship between the number of people who have the condition and those who end up in hospital has become increasingly attenuated, the fact is if you get an enormous number of people getting the disease, some of those people will end up in hospital and will end up in intensive care unit.” He added: “I think if you can make changes to your life, which are not huge inconveniences and reduce the risk then you should do so. We all want to have a good Christmas, but it is better, I think, to plan for a modest Christmas and we can achieve it, than to hope that things are going to be better than they are and end up having to kind of abandon your plans a few days beforehand.” It is, of course, one year since the first vaccination against Covid was given in England, and also today it has been announced that the booster jab roll-out is being expanded with every adult aged 40 and over in England, and all those in high-risk groups, able to arrange their Covid booster jab to take place three months after their second dose. You would think that the government would be out crowing about these achievements, but as we have seen health secretary Sajid Javid has pulled out of all his planned media appearances this morning, in the wake of the emergence of video footage last night showing staff at Downing Street appearing to laugh at having held a Christmas party that broke the Covid restrictions. PA have just snapped that vaccines minister Maggie Throup is also understood to have pulled out of her planned round of regional television interviews. Throup has already been widely criticised for her lack of visibility compared to her predecessor Nadhim Zahawi. CEO of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust Prof Andy Hardy has been on Sky News. He described the situation facing the NHS in his area as “tight”. Beds are always challenge this time of year. I think to put it into context for Covid patients, my hospital has 1,200 beds, of which at the moment 35 are taken up with Covid patients. If we go back to the peak back in January, February of this year, that was in excess of 260. So there are a lot that’s available. It’s tight. It’s always tight this time of year and it’s always a matter of management on a day to day basis. But at the moment, we’re confident that we can deal with what’s coming our way. Asked about what types of patients they were seeing with Covid, Prof Hardy said: There’s a few older people, but very clearly we are starting to see an increased proportion of our Covid patients who need hospital treatment, and importantly, critical care intervention, are those who were unvaccinated. And there are a number of those who have been pregnant ladies. And of course we know that can affect both the mum and the baby. So again, it comes back to the influence of vaccination. It does make a difference. It stops people getting hospitalised. It stops people needing critical care. He was also asked what he made of information about the Omicron variant, and with the caveat that he said it was early days, he said “early signs are encouraging” about both the severity of illness and the effectiveness of vaccines. One Conservative MP who has been prepared to go on the TV has been Matt Hancock. Asked on ITV’s Good Morning Britain about whether there would be security records that might indicate who attended a Christmas party in Whitehall or Downing Street, he said: Lots of people work in the building. Lots of people come and go from the building. There isn’t a record of who comes and goes, I don’t think, but I don’t know. This isn’t what I was doing at the time. He was asked if his department – like Gavin Williamson did at the education department – had a Christmas gathering around this time. He said: Not that I’m aware of, we were working pretty hard. He was also asked if he was still health secretary, what he would be doing now. He said he would be putting all his efforts into finding out more about the Omicron variant: I’d want to make sure that we are getting a new vaccine ready for this variant, which the system can now do, we’re told, in 100 days in case the vaccine doesn’t work as effectively, and we need a fourth, which is a possibility. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts, said the news of the Downing Street Christmas party was a “blow to morale” among those working in the NHS. Asked whether the story matters to people running the NHS, Taylor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “In any difficult situation we all need to feel that we’re pulling together, that we’re a part of an effort and if it feels as though people have not been playing by the rules, if it feels as though powerful people are not playing by the rules, then there is a blow to morale, it does make it harder to get people to follow the advice. So no, it really isn’t what we need at the moment.” On what the message should be to the public at the moment, PA Media quote Taylor saying: “We are saying now that masks are mandatory, but we need a really strong message we need to say: ‘The healthcare system is in an emergency situation and is going to be in that situation for several months’. “And the public need the clearest possible message, and spending a lot of time dealing with what happened last year is not helping get that message across.” ITV’s Good Morning Britain have mocked the UK govermnet’s refusal to put anybody on the airwaves this morning to answer questions about Downing Street Christmas parties by showing the empty chair in their Westminster studio and saying “We’ll take anyone”, appealing for any Conservative MP to appear. Host Adil Ray said: It’s not just Good Morning Britain. Apparently most of the broadcasters this morning are still waiting for somebody from the government. But if any Conservative MP, anybody connected to the government is watching, and you would like to take your duty and answer to those people that lost family members … we’ll take anyone. we’ll take anyone anybody.” Germany has recorded its highest number of deaths from Covid-19 since February. A total of 69,601 new infections were reported, 2,415 more than the same time a week ago, and a further 527 people died – the highest number since 12 February. However, the country’s seven-day incidence rate of cases per 100,000 people continued to fall, declining to 427 from 432 on Tuesday. Experts have questioned whether the metric means Germany has passed the peak of this wave of the pandemic or whether the figures are unreliable because some health authorities are so overwhelmed, particularly in the hardest-hit areas. Reuters notes that the country agreed last week to bar the unvaccinated from access to all but the most essential businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies and bakeries and to ramp up its vaccination campaign. The latest Downing Street Christmas party development has been called a “bullet to the chest” of families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic. Dr Saleyha Ahsan, from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, told BBC Breakfast the saga was “an example of how the government have run this from the start: One rule for them and the rest of us have to adhere to different rules.” PA Media reports that Dr Ahsan, who said she had been working in north Wales at the time of the mock press conference, said: “Numerous people around the country couldn’t spend those precious last few days, hours, minutes with loved ones. It was heartbreaking. In 14 years in the NHS I’ve never seen anything like it. “And this latest revelation is just a bullet to the chest, it really is. It just demonstrates the lack of regard for the rest of us.” Dr Ahsan said the saga showed why an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic was needed “now”. BBC Radio 4’s Today programme have just confirmed that they were expecting the health secretary, Sajid Javid, to appear on the programme this morning, but that now no minister is available to speak to them. While we are waiting to see if any UK government minister is prepared to be interviewed this morning, here is a reminder of the current Covid situation in the UK. Over the last seven days there have been 336,893 new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK. Cases have increased by 12.1% week-on-week. There have been 857 deaths recorded in the last week. Deaths have increased by 3% week-on-week. Hospital admissions have decreased by 0.1% week-on-week. At the latest count on the UK government’s own dashboard, there were 7,317 people in hospital in total, of whom 901 are in ventilation beds. These are the countries affected by England’s travel red list. Hello, it is Martin Belam here taking over in London from Martin Farrer on what you imagine is going to be a torrid morning for the UK government on the airwaves. However, the latest information I have is that the government hasn’t put anybody up yet for the Sky News 7am interview slot. I’m sure if someone does appear, they will be pointing to the further roll-out of booster jabs. Every adult aged 40 and over in England, and all those in high-risk groups, will be able to arrange their Covid booster jab to take place three months after their second dose as the vaccine programme widens significantly today. However, you know a story has crossed out of the “Westminster bubble” when Ant and Dec are doing skits about it on I’m A Celebrity. Here’s our timeline, from 2 December 2020 when London was moved into tier two restrictions, to 10 December when Gavin Williamson was holding a Christmas party, to 16 December when Boris Johnson urged the public to severely limit Christmas gatherings, to 18 December, the date on which a staff party is allegedly held inside Downing Street, and beyond. I’ll be bringing you all the latest on that and Covid developments from around the world. Leading scientists in the World Health Organization and the US have said the Omicron variant appears to be no worse than other coronavirus strains – but have warned that more research is needed to judge its severity. In an interview with Agence France-Presse, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan said that while it is likely more transmissible than previous variants, Omicron is also “highly unlikely” to completely evade vaccine protections. “The preliminary data doesn’t indicate that this is more severe. In fact, if anything, the direction is towards less severity,” Ryan said. Ryan also said there was no sign that Omicron could fully sidestep protections provided by existing Covid vaccines. “We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation... There’s no reason to expect that it wouldn’t be so” for Omicron, he added, pointing to initial data from South Africa, where the strain was first reported. Meanwhile, US Covid expert Dr Anthony Fauci echoed the WHO’s view, saying Omicron did not appear worse than prior strains based on early indications – and was possibly milder. The new variant is “clearly highly transmissible,” very likely more so than Delta, the current dominant global strain, Fauci said. The biggest Covid story of the day in the UK seems set to be the fallout from the discovery of a video showing Downing Street officials joking about a party allegedly held in No 10 during the height of last year’s lockdown. In the video of a practice televised press briefing filmed on 22 December, an adviser to Johnson is seen joking with Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then press secretary, about “a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night”. Multiple sources have said there was a staff party inside Downing Street on that Friday, which would have contravened strict Covid regulations in place at the time. Quizzed in the leaked footage, Stratton laughingly says: “This is recorded … This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” Boris Johnson is facing accusations of lying about the issue because he and his aides have repeatedly denied that the event, reportedly held for staff at No 10 in December last year, broke Covid rules or took place at all. The full story is here: It is one year since the first person in Britain was vaccinated against Covid-19 outside clinical trials, launching the biggest NHS vaccination drive in history. Since 90-year-old Margaret Keenan received the Pfizer jab in Coventry, more than 51m first doses of vaccine have been given in the UK, along with more than 46m second doses and 20m extra doses. Almost 3,000 vaccine sites have been established across the country, staffed by more than 92,000 NHS staff and over 118,000 volunteers - who have given over 1.9m hours to help protect millions of people at speed. The NHS is recruiting more staff to help with the new booster scheme – as well as volunteers to help the rollout. And here is a brief history of the vaccination development: The financial markets are in the glass-half-full camp when it comes to Omicron with indices roaring ahead in Asia after a strong showing from Wall Street in Tuesday’s session. The Nikkei in Japan is up 1.4% and the ASX200 in Sydney has closed up 1.25%. The Hang Seng is still down a touch in Hong Kong. Futures trade points to decent gains in New York again later although the outlook for the FTSE100 has slipped to flat in the last few hours. Kyle Rodda of IG Markets in Melbourne puts it well when he says “traders seem to be taking it as given that Omicron is of about as much economic significance as a head cold”. Such ebullience seems a bit premature based upon what’s only some crude data right now, along with a vague assurance from Pfizer that it’s vaccine is partially effective against the new variant. But misguided or not, it’s risk on in markets, with the move higher in equities probably supported by a healthy short-squeeze. Concerns about Omicron have prompted authorities in England to widen the vaccination scheme so that millions of over-40s and all those in high-risk groups will be able to book their booster vaccine from Wednesday. People had to wait six months after their second shot before they could receive their booster, but the NHS has reduced that to three months in order to try to get ahead of the Omicron curve. The online booking system for vaccines will be updated in the morning and details will be updated throughout the day, officials revealed on Tuesday night. Here’s the full story: The plot thickens over the Omicron “like” variant announced by health officials in Queensland on Wednesday (see this earlier post). My colleague at Guardian Australia, Cait Kelly, reports that experts are casting doubt on the claim. The new Omicron Covid sub-lineage, dubbed Omicron “like”, was identified in an overseas arrival to Queensland from South Africa. But Prof Peter Collignon, infectious disease physician and microbiologist at the Australian National University, said the new sub-lineage was not a new variant. “It is mainly at the moment an issue about the technicalities on how they are picked up,” he said. “If the genes have been deleted, and there’s another lineage where the gene hasn’t been deleted, you may not think it is Omicron when in fact it is,” he said. Full story here: Reuters has an exclusive story that up to one million Covid vaccines are estimated to have expired in Nigeria last month without being used. Governments on the continent of over one billion people have been pushing for more vaccine deliveries as inoculation rates lag richer regions, increasing the risk of new variants such as the Omicron coronavirus now spreading across South Africa. But the story, confirmed by two sources, shows the difficulty of getting the jabs into arms before they expire. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation and home to more than 200 million people, fewer than 4% of adults have been fully vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Faced with the shifting sands of geopolitics since the pandemic began, China has changed its approach to Africa from one of debt diplomacy to vaccine diplomacy. Analysts say the shift in approach signifies Beijing’s rethink about its overall strategy on the continent at a time of Covid health emergency and great power competition. “In a way Xi’s reduced financial pledge is not surprising because we’ve already seen signs in the last couple of years,” says Lina Benabdallah of Wake Forest University in North Carolina. “China has entered a phase of greater caution with regard to Africa. After two decades of heavy state funding, it is beginning to pull the brakes.” You can read the whole story here: There were another 8,439 cases in India in the past 24 hours for a total of 34.66 millions, according to the health ministry. The famed Teatro alla Scala in Milan has opened its new season with Verdi’s Macbeth to a fully seated house, despite another wave of Covid-19 forcing other theatres across Europe to close again. Guests included Giorgio Armani and Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, but the the mood was more restrained than usual for the event that is considered a highlight of the European cultural calendar. Venues in Vienna, Dresden and Liepzig have been closed again because of the pandemic. “When you see so many great theaters closed, I have to say we are lucky to arrive at the premiere,” La Scala’s general manager Dominique Meyer said. Germany reported 69,601 cases of Covid-19 and 527 deaths in the past 24 hours, according to the Robert Koch Institute, taking the total cases in the country to 6,291,621. There have been 104,047 deaths. South Korean authorities are urging people to get vaccinated as case rise in the east Asian nation generally regarded as having dealth with the pandemic well. Daily cases exceeded 7,000 for the first time on Tuesday, the government reported on Wednesday, heaping pressure on hospitals. here’s the full report by our correspondent Justin McCurry. Financial markets appear to have shrugged off concerns about Omicron with stocks rallying all over the world in the past 24 hours. Shares in Asia have made a strong start to Wednesday’s session as with Japan’s Nikkei up 1.3%, the ASX200 in Sydney up 1.2%, the Korean Kospi up 0.8%, and Shanghai has risen 0.8%. The only laggard is Hong Kong, down slightly, thanks to concerns about US regulations on tech stocks. Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist for private bank LGT in Asia Pacific, said: “Markets are very sensitive to any slight new item relating to Omicron, and the absence of bad news is being taken very positively by equity markets, though - and I’m not a scientist - it seems too early to signal an all clear. “With each new variant, we go through a period of waiting for some signal from the scientific community, which is difficult for markets, but that’s what we got yesterday.” Officials in Queensland, Australia have detected what they described as an Omicron-like variant in a person who arrived from South Africa. The state also recorded a case of the original Omicron strain in a passenger from Nigeria. The state’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said on Wednesday that scientists in Australia had helped to reclassify Omicron “into two lineages”. Following on, there are also a couple of reports that there may be different “types” of Omicron. Our science editor, Ian Sample, reported earlier that scientists have identified a “stealth” version of Omicron that cannot be distinguished from other variants using the PCR tests typically used to get a snapshot of cases. The stealth variant has many mutations in common with standard Omicron, but it lacks a particular genetic change that allows lab-based PCR tests to be used as a rough and ready means of flagging up probable cases. The variant is still detected as coronavirus by all the usual tests, and can be identified as the Omicron variant through genomic testing, but probable cases are not flagged up by routine PCR tests that give quicker results. Read the full report here: A lot of new information has emerged about the new Omicron variant in the past 24 hours concerning such critical issues as whether it will evade vaccines, how transmissible it is and possible new types of the strain. While the WHO says the variant will not dodge the existing vaccines (see previous post), Reuters has reported that early data from South Africa shows some evidence that the Omicron variant can partially evade protection from the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Researchers found there was about a 40-fold reduction in vaccine-induced antibodies that could neutralise Omicron relative to an earlier strain. Alex Sigal, a professor at the Africa Health Research Institute, said on Twitter there was “a very large drop” in neutralization of the Omicron variant relative to an earlier strain of COVID-19. The lab tested blood from 12 people who had been vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, according to a manuscript posted on the website for his lab. The preliminary data in the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed. Blood from five out of six people who had been vaccinated as well as previously infected with COVID-19 still neutralized the Omicron variant, the manuscript said. “These results are better than I expected. The more antibodies you got, the more chance you’ll be protected from Omicron,” Sigal said on Twitter. He said the lab had not tested the variant against blood from people who had received a booster dose, because they are not available in South Africa yet. A leading World Health Organization official says that Omicron does not appear to cause more severe disease than previous Covid variants, and is “highly unlikely” to fully dodge vaccine protections. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that while a lot remained to be learned about the new, heavily mutated variant of Covid-19, preliminary data indicated it did not make people sicker than Delta and other strains. “The preliminary data doesn’t indicate that this is more severe. In fact, if anything, the direction is towards less severity,” Ryan said in an interview with Agence France-Presse, insisting though that more research was needed. “It’s very early days, we have to be very careful how we interpret that signal.” At the same time, he said there was no sign that Omicron could fully sidestep protections provided by existing Covid vaccines. “We have highly effective vaccines that have proved effective against all the variants so far, in terms of severe disease and hospitalisation,” the 56-year-old epidemiologist and former trauma surgeon said. “There’s no reason to expect that it wouldn’t be so” for Omicron, he said, pointing to early data from South Africa where the variant was first detected that “suggest the vaccine at least is holding up in protection terms”. The Romanian government will ease some Covid restrictions on Wednesday, including scrapping a night curfew and an obligation to wear face masks outdoors ahead of winter holidays. Romania reported 1,421 new daily cases and 107 deaths on Tuesday, far off record highs reported in October and early November during its deadliest wave of the pandemic. Shops and restaurants will be able close at 10pm from Wednesday night., one hour later than at present. Entry to most non-essential public venues will be allowed not only for those who have been vaccinated or who have recovered from the virus, but also for those who can present a negative COVID-19 test. Wearing facemasks will continue to be mandatory in public transport and indoor public spaces, but will no longer be required outside except in crowded areas such as markets. Romania has the second-lowest vaccination rate in the EU, with only 39% of the population having taken it up. South Korea’s government is scrambling to bolster the country’s health system amid a surge in Covid cases that has seen the daily tally rise past 7,000 for the time since the pandemic began almost two years ago. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 7,175 new coronavirus cases and 63 deaths for Tuesday, and hospitals are treating a record 840 critical and serious cases. The prime minister, Kim Boo-kyum, said on Wednesday that hospital capacity was under strain and that he was mobilising additional personnel to oversee coronavirus patients treating themselves at home, and to improve the emergency transfer system to hospitals for those who develop severe symptoms. Private clinics will also treat COVID-19 patients in addition to large hospitals. Infections in South Korea have skyrocketed this month after the government began to ease restrictions under a so-called “living with COVID-19 scheme in November. Kim urged the elderly to get booster shots as over 35% of infections were found in people aged 60 and above, who account for 84% of severe cases. He also urged adolescents to get vaccinated. South Korea has so far confirmed 38 cases of the Omicron variant. With 80% of cases in greater Seoul, authorities have struggled to secure enough beds for hospitalised patients in the area. Morning/afternoon/evening wherever you are, and welcome to the new blog covering the latest developments in the pandemic across the world: Here is a roundup of what’s been happening so far: Daily cases in South Korea have surpassed 7,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic, the prime minister Kim Boo-kyum said on Wednesday morning, putting hospital capacity under strain as deaths and severe cases rise. Scientists have identified a “stealth” version of Omicron variant which cannot be detected with the routine tests that public health officials are using to track its spread around the world. The stealth variant has many mutations in common with standard Omicron, but researchers say it is genetically distinct and so may well behave differently. A new Omicron variant, known as Omicron “like”, has been identified in an overseas arrival to Queensland from South Africa, the health minister of the Australian state said on Wednesday morning. UK prime minister Boris Johnson is facing accusations of lying after senior No 10 officials were filmed joking about a staff Christmas party last year that would have contravened strict Covid regulations in place at the time. Johnson and his aides have repeatedly denied that the event broke Covid rules or took place at all. The Omicron variant can partially evade protection from the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, according to early data from South Africa. Researchers found there was about a 40-fold reduction in vaccine-induced antibodies that could neutralise Omicron relative to an earlier strain. The African Union has called for an urgent end to travel restrictions imposed on some of its member states, arguing that the measures effectively penalise governments for timely data sharing in line with international health regulations. US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said preliminary evidence indicates that the Omicron variant likely has a higher degree of transmissibility but causes less severe illness, warning it will take a few weeks to reach any definitive conclusions. Millions of people in England will be able to book their Covid booster vaccine on Wednesday as the NHS cuts the qualifying time from six months after a second dose to three. No more than 10 visitors will be allowed in private homes in Norway, and people must keep a distance of at least one metre from anyone outside of their household in new restrictions introduced by the government today. Swedes will face new measures to curb rising Covid infections from Wednesday, including renewed social distancing, home-working and the use of face masks on public transport. EU health agencies say vaccines should be mixed and matched for both initial courses and booster doses. Evidence suggests that the combination of viral vector vaccines and mRNA vaccines produces good levels of antibodies against the coronavirus, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in a joint statement."

          "headline": "New Zealand faces growing challenge from Chinese nationalism, defence report warns",
          "bodyText": "New Zealand faces “a substantially more challenging and complex strategic environment”, in large part because of China’s rise and “increasingly strong nationalist narrative”, according to a stark report released by the country’s defence ministry. The remarkably explicit warning on Wednesday included a detailed discussion of China’s military modernisation and emphasised the importance of New Zealand’s deep security relationships with Anglosphere countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. “It paints a pretty sobering picture of changes in New Zealand’s strategic environment,” says Professor David Capie, director of Victoria University of Wellington’s Centre for Strategic Studies. “It argues the South Pacific is no longer a benign backwater, but rather that some of the challenges we’ve seen playing out in the wider Indo-Pacific are now coming closer to home.” The report comes as New Zealand plunges into a fraught debate over how to manage strategic competition between America and China in its Pacific backyard. Many officials and observers in Wellington have taken a more hawkish view of China in recent years and pushed for a closer security partnership with America. The ministry’s report seems designed to influence that discussion. Some will see it as pushback to the foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, who earlier this year expressed discomfort with expanding the remit of the Anglosphere’s Five Eyes partnership beyond intelligence-gathering. The report noted that “the defence aspect [of Five Eyes] is as long-standing and as fundamental as the intelligence aspect”. It strongly endorsed New Zealand’s continued involvement in the partnership, saying the country “derives enormous benefit from this partnership, including in terms of access to defence capabilities, information technologies and military developments that would otherwise be unachievable”. Strategic competition between America and China was singled out as a “major driver” of increased insecurity. The ministry characterised the Indo-Pacific as the “central global theatre for strategic competition”. It warned an external power – almost certainly China – could establish a military base or use paramilitary forces in the region, and implicitly cautioned American policymakers that delivery on President Joe Biden’s “renewed commitment” to the Indo-Pacific “will be important in determining the future for this region”. Another driver of the increased security threats which New Zealand now faces, per the ministry, is intensified climate change. It noted that climate change’s impacts are already present and include extreme fires, intense cyclones and prolonged droughts. These will drive greater social and political instability. “More frequent disasters means reduced recovery time between events, and more intense disasters means more damage from which to recover.” “After decades of deployments to Afghanistan and the Middle East, [the report] makes clear that the South Pacific is where New Zealand needs to focus its primary defence efforts in the future,” says Capie. It remains to be seen whether that will prompt a change in New Zealand foreign policy going forward. “The government has set out a very worrying picture of New Zealand’s strategic environment, but is it willing to spend any more or do anything different from what it has in the past?”"

          "bodyText": "A year of post-Brexit bickering has left the French and the British feeling significantly less well disposed towards each other, a poll shows. After ill-tempered exchanges over everything from fishing to submarines and Covid travel rules to the Northern Ireland protocol, the YouGov poll found that favourable opinions of the British had slid in France and other EU countries. Data from YouGov’s EuroTrack survey shows the proportion of French people saying they held an unfavourable view of Britain surged to 42% in November from 33% in August, while the number holding a positive view fell from 53% to 46%. And Britons are taking a correspondingly critical view of France, with the proportion holding a negative opinion of the UK’s nearest continental neighbour rising from 31% to 40%, and those with a favourable view falling from 56% to 47%. Recently it was reported that Emmanuel Macron had privately called Boris Johnson a clown in charge of a circus, after the prime minister tweeted a letter calling on France take back people who had crossed the Channel illegally. Tensions between London and Paris that built up over five years of Brexit talks have been exacerbated by a series of increasingly heated cross-Channel disagreements, some related to the fallout from the UK’s departure from the EU but others not. Johnson’s remarks that Paris should “prenez un grip and donnez-moi un break” ruffled French feathers at the end of the summer, while more recent rows over fishing licences and small boat crossings have strained Anglo-French ties further. Negative European views of Britain are not restricted to the French, however. The survey of 15 countries found that people in Spain and Germany were more hostile towards Britain in November than they were over the summer. Fully half of Spaniards said they had an unfavourable opinion of Britain, sharply up from 38% in August, while Germany showed a more modest increase of 41% to 45%, mirrored by a four-point drop in favourable opinions of the UK to 43%."

          "bodyText": "The unfolding government crisis over an alleged Christmas party at Downing Street during lockdown last year has gripped social media watchers, especially after the emergence of a video showing aides laughing and joking about it. But beyond the jokes, there have been searing messages comparing the idea of a No 10 staff party with the experiences people were having by following lockdown rules. Many were keen to point out that it was the first time the new No 10 briefing room, constructed with much fanfare and at a cost of £2.6m, had provided real value to the taxpayer. Once used by the prime minister to watch the latest James Bond movie, the media suite had been intended to host daily press briefings featuring Allegra Stratton, who will now mostly be remembered for starring in a pretend one. One review of her performance featured Kathryn Hahn as Agnes Harkness in the Marvel TV show WandaVision, which rapidly became internet shorthand for when someone isn’t telling the truth, and knows that you know they aren’t telling the truth. This image from Succession cropped up a lot too. No spoilers – but if you know, you know. There was speculation about what it would mean for Boris Johnson’s leadership, given the Conservative party’s history of removing leaders they fear have become a liability. And there were also plenty of suggestions on how the Labour party should capitalise on the row. It was already clear on Tuesday evening that the story had changed from a Westminster bubble” issue to one that had cut through as soon as it featured in a segment from Ant and Dec on ITV’s I’m a Celebrity … last night. The video has been watched about 5m times on social media, not including the audience of the ITV show. And it allowed people to point out what an unlikely turn of events it was. On Wednesday, ITV continued to pile on the social media pressure, with the Good Morning Britain presenter Adil Ray making an appeal for any Conservative MP to come and fill the vacant Westminster studio seat on the show after the health secretary, Sajid Javid, cancelled his media appearances on Wednesday morning. From Dictionary Corner, Countdown’s Susie Dent can always be relied on to provide her oblique commentary on the events of the day. On a more serious note there were photographic comparisons of Downing Street staff laughing at the mock press conference with medical staff in the PPE they were wearing at work that day. One image appeared again and again, with people comparing the Queen sitting alone at her husband’s funeral and observing social distancing rules, to the alleged behaviour of staff at Downing Street. In Scotland, there were comparisons with how the Scottish Tories had reacted to a breach of Covid regulations from the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, two days after the Downing Street party was apparently held last year. The stories are unverified, but they speak to grief and the disruption in people’s lives that the video and the party – not just at No 10 as alleged, but also a gathering at the education department – belittled. And there were many, many more."

          "headline": "Most rape victims in London drop complaints after speaking to police",
          "bodyText": "Nearly two-thirds of London rape victims who drop their complaint do so within a month of going to police, with the proportion tripling in two years, according to a report. Claire Waxman, London’s independent victims’ commissioner, revealed research warning that victims, predominately women, are being belittled and deterred from pursuing justice. Among those who allege rape or sexual assault to police, 65% dropped out, up 7% compared with the last survey covering the capital two years ago. Of those, there has been a huge rise in complainants dropping out quickly: 64% withdrew their support for an investigation within 30 days, up from 18% two years ago. Waxman said reasons could include their treatment by police and fears about “digital strip searching”, which required victims to divulge all their mobile phone data but has since been scrapped. The report says: “These early withdrawal numbers should prompt us to consider how police are handling victim/survivor interactions, as the victim/survivor may have only really dealt with police officers during this time.” Some victims were given the impression their phones were likely to have to be handed over and scoured while that was not the case, it was suggested. Waxman said officers outlining to victims what it took to pursue a rape conviction was putting them off. “They are painting such a bleak picture to the victims, they are deterring them, whether they meant to or not,” she said. One victim said their phone was taken and “is still waiting to be downloaded, after 14 months in the lab. My rapist is on [a diving] holiday.” Another said their phone was requested when they reported a historical child sexual abuse allegation from 33 years ago. Another female victim quoted in the study said: “Reporting to the police was the biggest mistake I have ever made. They didn’t believe me, they belittled me, questioned my lifestyle and minimised my experiences.” Waxman said myths about victims were causing the crisis and that rape had “effectively been decriminalised”. A 2019 previous report by Waxman found just 3% of rape cases in London reached trial. That fell further to just 1% in 2021. She said victims were having their character pulled apart, with their sexual history, social services records and mental health records examined, while suspects were becoming emboldened. Another big issue was police and prosecutors seeing any small inconsistency in a victim’s account as reason to stop an investigation and wrongly thinking victims were lying, Waxman said. This is despite academic research showing trauma can lead to inconsistencies. She said: “I have spoken to victims/survivors who have had police officers directly suggest that they probably did consent and now regretted it, hence their report of rape. If the underlying assumption of the system is that rape victims/survivors are likely lying, then we are not giving the victim/survivor a fair chance at justice and are setting them up to fail.” Commander Melanie Dales, the Metropolitan police lead on public protection, said the force was investing millions more in digital forensics. “We understand that rape and serious sexual assault are incredibly distressing and impact victims deeply and we also fully recognise that there is much more we must do to drive the improvements to the criminal justice outcomes they deserve to see,” she said."

          "headline": "Stephen Sondheim’s other job: crossword setter",
          "bodyText": "Michael Crawford is far from the only person from the world of musical theatre … … to have expressed this thought lately. The same goes, in a quieter way, for the world of crosswords. Crosswords, that is, of a particular kind. Stephen Sondheim – playful, intelligently demotic – was no fan of the American-style puzzle, despite its being playful and intelligently demotic at its best. This may or may not be because he had a puzzle rejected by the New York Times when he was “14 or 15”; the reply letter described him as “obviously precocious”, which is how he learned that adjective. In 1968, he urged readers of the New York magazine to instead seek the British-style cryptic: A good clue can give you all the pleasures of being duped that a mystery story can. It has surface innocence, surprise, the revelation of a concealed meaning, and the catharsis of solution. Let’s be a little more precise. During the pandemic, we have discussed in these pages a particular kind of cryptic crossword: the kind you notice at weekends that lacks black squares and repeatedly sends the solver to the dictionary, where the filled grid may be no more than the starting point for a startling endgame. We could euphemistically call these beasts “the engrossing puzzles” – it was to these that Sondheim was addicted in the 1950s. Is “addicted” too strong a word? No: Sondheim’s habit was to buy (or, as he otherwise told it, retrieve from an inbound steamship) a copy of the BBC’s Listener magazine on a Thursday on the way to meet up with a colleague to write a musical, and the Listener’s puzzle (now adopted by the Saturday Times) is perhaps the most engrossing of all. “I got Leonard Bernstein hooked,” he recalled in 2004. “Thursday afternoons, no work got done on West Side Story. We were doing the puzzle.” They may even have managed to rationalise this as not bunking off, given Sondheim’s description of composition: “You make a pattern out of a series of discrete bits of information and try to make it graceful so you won’t feel the effort behind it. In that sense, lyric writing is a puzzle.” Here he is explaining what he thinks is the “nice thing about doing a crossword puzzle”: Bernstein and Sondheim were among the lucky few to receive the privately circulated Apex (“a puzzle every Xmas”), also from the engrossing end of the crosswording spectrum. It was set by retired carpenter Eric Chalkley and is now the purview of another setter (“a Phi every Xmas”). Phi (who you can get to know here) has shared the 2010 Apex for those not in the distribution list. You can surely guess its theme, and you can read Sondheim’s letter in reply to Phi here. On the topic of puzzles about Sondheim, his 85th birthday in 2015 was well celebrated by Guardian setters. Arachne (who you can get to know here) set a wonderful prize puzzle (with annotated solutions) … 19a Two idiots stripped Mini’s bumpers off (9) [ definition: ones who bump off ] [ wordplay: synonym for ‘idiot’, repeated + MINI without first &amp; last letters (“stripped”) + S ] [ ASS &amp; ASS + IN + S ] … to which Sondheim replied: I look forward to avoiding work in order to solve it. Steve S Sondheim signed off as Steve! I did not see that coming. At the same time, the Sondheim Society commissioned Enigmatist (who you can get to know here) to create a custom puzzle. The society’s generous Craig Glenday has allowed us to share the extraordinary puzzle here. Craig also shared a titbit: he discussed with Sondheim a puzzle/musical/video game hybrid, but it did not come to be. Of Enigmatist’s tribute, Sondheim said: “I’m determined not to tackle the puzzle until I finish the opening number of the new show, but it will be hard to resist (particularly since it looks moderately easy.)” He will have found later that it is not easy. I’ll also mention an Enigmatic Variations puzzle from July by Sea-Kale titled The North American One, which I hope reached its subject, and an earlier entry in the same series: Resident Jokers by Owzat. I’ve enjoyed all these immensely and will be spending Christmas finally going through all of the puzzles that resulted when Sondheim put his money where his mouth was, and set puzzles for the rest of us to solve. This was, he said later, to help a new publication to which his friend, Gloria Steinem, was a contributor. As illustrated by the giddying grid accompanying this paragraph, they too are … engrossing. Forty-two of the beasts appeared in the New York magazine until his other job (specifically Company) diverted him from public setting, though I understand his party guests tended to be regaled with other kinds of puzzle. Here’s a sample, an example of New York content in a British kind of clue: 5. Mixtures of completely Yiddish sighs? (6) [ definition: mixtures ] [ wordplay: synonym of “completely” + Yiddish expressions of woe ] [ ALL + OYS ] The magazine celebrated its 40th birthday by reprinting the first three; the others have been digitised by Google Books. Animator Galen Fott has assiduously collated the relevant links in a blogpost and composer Colm Molloy has done likewise in a Twitter thread. I’m not alone in diving into Sondheim’s puzzles as this wretched year ends. We can hope that the swell of enthusiasm might prompt whomever owns the relevant rights to republish the hens’-teeth collection in book form. Let’s finish by making a mental note to watch the whodunnit Sondheim co-wrote with Anthony Perkins – and returning to Company with an addition to our collaborative playlist, Healing Music Recorded in 2020-21 to Accompany a Solve or Even Listen To: • Here’s a collection of all our explainers, interviews and other helpful bits and bobs. • The Shipping Forecast Puzzle Book by Alan Connor, which is partly but not predominantly cryptic, can be ordered from the Guardian Bookshop. • Crossword blog will resume on 13 December."

          "bodyText": "That concludes our live blogging of global coronavirus news for the moment. For Australian readers here is our continuing live coverage from Guardian Australia. Here is the full story on Australia’s regulator provisionally approving a Pfizer vaccine for children aged 5-11. Australia’s medicine regulator provisionally approved on Sunday the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the rollout could begin from 10 January. All international arrivals to the UK will again be required to take pre-departure Covid-19 tests, the health secretary Sajid Javid announced. The rule applies to all travellers visiting the UK or returning from a holiday, regardless of vaccination status, and will come into force from 4am on 7 December. Nigeria is also being added to the UK’s travel red list, joining several southern African nations which were added after the Omicron variant was detected. In Brazil, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro has announced the cancellation of the city’s world-famous New Year’s Eve celebrations amid fears over the impact the Omicron variant could have on a country that has already lost more than 615,000 lives to Covid. Chilean health authorities reported the first case of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in a person who had arrived in the country from Africa. The German government has announced a lockdown for the unvaccinated and is considering making Covid vaccines mandatory, after weeks of record infections in the country and much of German-speaking Europe. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Saturday urged Germans to get vaccinated against Covid-19, speaking days ahead of leaving office in the final episode of more than 600 weekly video podcasts. The Omicron variant has been detected in at least 38 countries but no deaths have yet been reported, the World Health Organization has said, amid warnings that it could damage the global economic recovery. Doctors’ leaders in England have welcomed a move to suspend some targets for GPs to enable them to concentrate on the vaccination programme, but warned the service remains under pressure. Romania’s health ministry said it has detected the first two cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in two Romanians who returned from South Africa on 30 November 30. The UK prime minister has been reported to the police by Labour MPs over allegations there were at least two parties in Downing Street during lockdown restrictions last year. South Korea again broke its daily records for coronavirus infections and deaths and confirmed three more cases of the new Omicron variant as officials scramble to tighten social distancing and border controls. The 5,352 new cases reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Saturday marked the third time this week the daily tally exceeded 5,000. The country’s death toll was at 3,809 after a record 70 virus patients died in the past 24 hours, while the 752 patients in serious or critical conditions were also an all-time high. Mexico’s health ministry on Saturday reported 251 more deaths from Covid-19. It brings the country’s death toll since the pandemic began to 295,154, Reuters reports. Australia’s medicine regulator provisionally approved on Sunday the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the rollout could begin from 10 January. “They (the Therapeutics Goods Administration) have made a careful, thorough assessment, determined that it is safe and effective and that it is in the interests of children and Australians for children 5 to 11 to be vaccinated,” Hunt said. New York announced three more cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus Saturday, bringing the number of state cases linked to the new variant to eight. “The omicron variant is here, and as anticipated we are seeing the beginning of community spread,” state health commissioner Mary Bassett said in a news release. The number of states finding the variant is growing as well, with Massachusetts announcing its first case Saturday, a day after New Jersey, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Maryland reported their first confirmed cases, Associated Press reports. You can follow the latest Covid developments in Australia in our dedicated blog here: Romania reported 1,490 new daily Covid-19 cases and 131 deaths on Saturday. The EU’s second-least vaccinated country experienced its deadliest wave of the pandemic so far in October and early November, Reuters reports. Brazil has reported 8,838 new cases of coronavirus and a further 170 deaths, according to the country’s health ministry. The former queen of the Netherlands, Princess Beatrix, 83, has tested positive for Covid-19, the royal information service RVD said in a statement. Princess Beatrix, as she has been known since her abdication in 2013, got tested after coming down with “mild cold symptoms”, the statement said. “The princess is at home in isolation and adheres to the rules of life for people who have tested positive,” it added, according to Reuters. The emergence of the Omicron variant shows that the world is “closer to the start of the pandemic than the end”, one of Britain’s most senior scientific figures has warned, as he lamented a lack of political leadership over Covid. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, who stepped down as a government scientific adviser last month, said the progress in combatting Covid-19 since its emergence was “being squandered”. Writing in the Observer, he said rich countries had been taking “a very blinkered domestic focus, lulled into thinking that the worst of the pandemic was behind us”. He said while he was cautiously hopeful that current vaccines would protect against severe illness from Omicron, that may not be true for future variants. France on Saturday said more than 50,000 people had tested positive for coronavirus in the past 24 hours, AFP reports. The country recorded 51,624 new daily cases of Covid, health authorities said. France has recorded an average of almost 41,000 new cases a day over the past week, compared to fewer than 28,000 a week ago. Some 694 people had been admitted to hospital in the past 24 hours, including 119 who were critically ill. Labour’s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has supported the pre-departure tests for UK arrivals but criticised the speed it took the government to introduce the measure. “Why on Earth is this still only being brought in nearly two weeks after Omicron was identified?” she asked on Twitter. “Wes Streeting and I called for this, SAGE recommended this, and I am relieved the government is finally acting. But waiting until Tuesday is too slow at the border yet again,” she wrote. Romania’s health ministry said it has detected the first two cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in two Romanians who returned from South Africa on 30 November 30. The two travellers, a 48-year-old woman from the central county of Brasov and a 59-year-old man from the eastern county of Vaslui, were isolated in their homes and had no symptoms, the ministry said. Authorities were sequencing a third test to identify virus variant, Reuters reports. Romania has introduced travel bans for non-European Union citizens arriving from several African states and has sent planes to recover Romanians stranded by cancelled flights. The returnees are expected to quarantine for two weeks. Chilean health authorities reported on Saturday that they detected the first case of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in a person who had arrived in the country from Africa. The foreign patient residing in Chile arrived in the country on 25 November from Ghana with a recently taken negative Covid-19 test, Reuters reports. But a subsequent test taken upon arrival in Chile was positive and then sequenced. “The passenger, who had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, is currently in good health and fulfilling his isolation,” the secretary of health of the Valparaiso region in Chile said. The UK’s health secretary Sajid Javid said there are now about 160 confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, up from 134 on Friday. Some 130 cases are in England, Javid added. People arriving in Scotland from abroad will need to take pre-departure Covid tests to help stem the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, the Scottish government has announced. International travellers will have to provide a negative pre-departure test taken two days before travelling, in addition to a negative PCR test on or before day two after arrival, under measures agreed on a four-nation basis. The requirement comes into effect at 4am on 7 December. Nigeria has also been added to the red list for international travel from 4am on 6 December, meaning all travellers returning to Scotland from Nigeria will be required to quarantine on their arrival in managed accommodation for 10 days. The introduction of pre-departure Covid tests for travellers entering the UK has been branded a “devastating blow” for travel by the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association. Karen Dee said that the policy, beginning on 7 December, will act as a “major deterrent” to travel. This is a devastating blow for aviation and tourism,” she said. “Pre-departure tests act as a major deterrent to travel and most of the limited remaining demand following the reintroduction of self-isolation will now fall away, just as airports were hoping for a small uplift over the Christmas holiday. “Travel and aviation are the only sectors hit with any operating restrictions in response to the Omicron variant. “The UK and devolved governments should have done the right thing and, alongside the restrictions, announced support for our businesses and our staff to get through another period of shutdown.” The UK’s transport secretary has given his reaction to the new measures for arrivals. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes, tweeted that he would follow the recommendations of Rio de Janeiro state to cancel the celebrations, despite the city’s own view to the contrary. “We respect science,” he wrote. “The city’s committee says it can go ahead and the state’s says no. So it can’t take place. Let’s cancel the official New Year’s Eve celebration in Rio,” the tweet said. “I am very sad as mayor and personally. The New Year’s Eve celebration in Rio is one of the most incredible and incomparable parties in the world,” Paes later told a press conference. In Brazil, the pandemic has claimed more than 615,000 lives, the second highest total in the world after the US, Reuters reports. France has reported 92,557 coronavirus deaths in hospital, an increase of 49. It also reported that 2,037 people are in intensive care units with the virus, down by 21, Reuters reports. Nigeria has become the 11th African country to be added to the UK’s travel red list. Health secretary Sajid Javid said: “Over recent days we have learned of a significant number of growing cases linked to travel with Nigeria. “There are 27 cases in England already and that’s growing.” Some more data from Italy. The number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 – not including those in intensive care – stood at 5,428 on Saturday, up from 5,385 a day earlier. There were 59 admissions to intensive care units, down from 60 on Friday, Reuters reports. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 732 from a previous 708. Some 636,592 tests for Covid-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 588,445, the health ministry said. All international arrivals to the UK will again be required to take pre-departure Covid-19 tests, the health secretary Sajid Javid announced. The rule applies to all travellers visiting the UK or returning from a holiday, regardless of vaccination status, and will come into force from 4am on 7 December. Nigeria is also being added to the travel red list, joining several southern African nations which were added after the Omicron variant was detected. Higher hospital admissions among children during a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections in South Africa that has been driven by the Omicron coronavirus variant should not prompt panic as infections have been mild, a health official said. A large number of infants admitted with coronavirus last month in Tshwane, the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria, raised concerns that the newly identified Omicron could pose greater risks for young children than other variants. Scientists have yet to confirm any link and have cautioned that other factors could be at play. Ntsakisi Maluleke, a public health specialist in the Gauteng province, told Reuters that out of the 1,511 Covid-positive patients in hospitals in the province 113 were under nine years old, a greater proportion than during previous waves of infection. Italy reported 75 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new infections was 16,632. Italy has registered 134,152 deaths linked to Covid-19 since February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain. It has reported more than five million cases to date. More than 40,000 people marched through Vienna on Saturday to protest against a lockdown and plans to make vaccinations compulsory to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Faced with a surge in infections, the government last month made Austria the first country in Western Europe to reimpose a lockdown and said it would make vaccinations mandatory from February. Around 1,200 police officers deployed to handle scattered protests that merged into a march on the central Ring boulevard. Police put the size of the protest at over 40,000, while around 1,500 staged counter-protests, Reuters reports. In the darkest days of the pandemic, with the industry she represented on its knees and no light at the end of the tunnel, the boss of UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, went to see a therapist. She had been acting as an “emotional sponge”, soaking up the anguish of tens of thousands of pubs, bars and restaurants fearing oblivion, while trying to shield her team, particularly the younger members, from the ravages of a uniquely stressful event. “There were times when it was really quite bleak,” she says. “Particularly when you got to October and November last year. We were in tears: there was that sense of frustration that businesses are open but not able to trade and you could see it all sliding away from you again.” The UK has recorded 127 deaths Covid-related deaths and 42,848 positive cases in the latest 24-hour period, government figures show. It brings the total number of cases to 10,421,104 and the death toll to 145,551. In Brazil, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro has announced the cancellation of the city’s world famous New Year’s Eve celebrations amid fears over the impact the Omicron variant could have on a country which has already lost more than 615,000 lives to Covid. The German government has announced a lockdown for the unvaccinated and is considering making Covid vaccines mandatory, after weeks of record infections in the country and much of German-speaking Europe. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Saturday urged Germans to get vaccinated against Covid-19, speaking days ahead of leaving office in the final episode of more than 600 weekly video podcasts. The Omicron variant has been detected in at least 38 countries but no deaths have yet been reported, the World Health Organization has said, amid warnings that it could damage the global economic recovery. UK government officials and scientific advisers believe that the danger posed by the Omicron variant may not be clear until January, potentially allowing weeks of intense mixing while the variant spreads. Doctors’ leaders in England have welcomed a move to suspend some targets for GPs to enable them to concentrate on the vaccination programme, but warned the service remains under pressure. The UK prime minister has been reported to the police by Labour MPs over allegations there were at least two parties in Downing Street during lockdown restrictions last year. South Korea again broke its daily records for coronavirus infections and deaths and confirmed three more cases of the new Omicron variant as officials scramble to tighten social distancing and border controls. The 5,352 new cases reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Saturday marked the third time this week the daily tally exceeded 5,000. The country’s death toll was at 3,809 after a record 70 virus patients died in the past 24 hours, while the 752 patients in serious or critical conditions were also an all-time high.

Thanks Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com In the UK, the Metropolitan Police have said they are considering complaints from Labour MPs that Boris Johnson and his No 10 staff held Christmas parties in breach of Covid regulations. Labour backbenchers Neil Coyle and Barry Gardiner have each written to Scotland Yard asking police to investigate reports that two parties were held in the run-up to last Christmas at a time when such gatherings were banned. Johnson has not denied the events took place but said no rules were broken - although he has repeatedly refused to explain how that could be the case. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said that while it did not routinely investigate “retrospective” breaches of the Covid regulations, it was considering the correspondence it had received. On Wednesday, the Daily Mirror reported the prime minister gave a speech at a packed leaving-do for a senior aide last November when the country was in the midst of the second lockdown. Scotland has recorded 14 coronavirus-linked deaths and 1,257 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to the latest data. One case of the new Omicron variant has been confirmed in that time, in NHS Grampian, taking the total people infected with the variant to 30. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has the most of the new variant cases at 11, followed by NHS Lanarkshire with nine, five in NHS Forth Valley, three in NHS Highland and two in NHS Grampian. The Scottish Government said Public Health Scotland is “aware of a processing issue with UK government lab tests contributing to lower than expected cases and tests” in the daily figures and investigations are ongoing to resolve the problem. The death toll under the daily measure, of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days, is 9,648. The daily test positivity rate was 5.9%, down from 7.6% the previous day. There were 605 people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 as of Friday night and, of these, 50 were in intensive care. So far, 4,351,214 people have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccination, 3,956,719 have had a second, and 1,823,515 have been given a third dose or booster. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro has announced the cancellation of the city’s world famous New Year’s Eve celebrations amid fears over the impact the Omicron variant could have on a country which has already lost more than 615,000 lives to Covid. “It’s a decision I take with sadness ... but the most important thing is to carry on vaccinating and saving lives,” mayor, Eduardo Paes, tweeted on Saturday morning, adding that vaccinated tourists were still welcome to visit his “magical” city. A few weeks ago Rio authorities had voiced optimism that, with the Covid situation finally improving, it would be possible to hold the annual beachside ‘Réveillon’ fireworks display, which attracts millions of revellers onto Copacabana beach. “Right now Covid is under control … We’ve been through moments of such sadness. This is a moment of hope,” Rio’s health secretary, Daniel Soranz, told the Guardian last month, hailing a vaccination campaign that has seen 90% of over-12s fully vaccinated. “We hope that our New Year’s Eve and Carnival will be the best we have ever had, to make up for all this lost time,” Soranz added. Omicron, six cases of which have been confirmed in Brazil, none of them in Rio, has wrecked those plans. “I hope to be able to be on Copacabana beach hugging everyone to see out 2022,” Paes tweeted on Saturday, adding that his government respected science. The German government has announced a lockdown for the unvaccinated and is considering making Covid vaccines mandatory, after weeks of record infections in the country and much of German-speaking Europe. In Austria, thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest against a string of measures: from February, the government will be introducing compulsory vaccines for all, with exemption for those unable to receive a jab on medical grounds. Vaccination rates in both Germany and Austria are lagging behind the rest of western Europe, with under 70% of the populations having had two jabs. Read what people from both countries have to say about the current situation, and what they think of vaccine mandates and restrictions for the unvaccinated: The Omicron variant has been detected in at least 38 countries but no deaths have yet been reported, the World Health Organization has said, amid warnings that it could damage the global economic recovery. The United States and Australia became the latest countries to confirm locally transmitted cases of the variant, as Omicron infections pushed South Africa’s total cases past 3 million. The WHO has warned it could take weeks to determine how infectious the variant is, whether it causes more severe illness and how effective treatments and vaccines are against it. The WHO emergencies director, Michael Ryan, said: We’re going to get the answers that everybody out there needs. The WHO said on Friday it had still not seen any reports of deaths related to Omicron, but the new variant’s spread has led to warnings that it could cause more than half of Europe’s Covid cases in the next few months. The new variant could also slow global economic recovery, just as the Delta strain did, the International Monetary Fund chief, Kristalina Georgieva, said on Friday. She said: Even before the arrival of this new variant, we were concerned that the recovery, while it continues, is losing somewhat momentum. A new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence. A preliminary study by researchers in South Africa, where the variant was first reported on 24 November, suggests it is three times more likely to cause reinfections compared with the Delta or Beta strains. Read the full story here: Several thousand people gathered in the central Dutch town of Utrecht on Saturday to protest against new coronavirus restrictions that came into force last weekend. Protesters walked through the streets of the town carrying banners saying “Medical Freedom Now!” and waving Dutch flags. A heavy police presence was visible along the route of the march. It is the first major demonstration in the Netherlands against the measures, which include a nighttime closure of bars, restaurants and most stores to stem a record-breaking wave of Covid-19 cases that is threatening to overwhelm the country’s healthcare system. The Netherlands saw violent protests two weeks ago after the government announced plans to ban most people who have not been vaccinated from public places. Those plans face widespread opposition in parliament, including from parties in the governing coalition and have not been put into place yet. Germany’s outgoing chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Saturday made what is likely her final appeal before leaving office next week for Germans to get vaccinated against Covid. Merkel gave what is expected to be her last weekly video message two days after federal and state leaders decided on a series of measures meant to break a wave of coronavirus infections. The measures include excluding unvaccinated people across the country from nonessential stores, restaurants and sports and cultural venues. In a longer-term move, parliament will consider a general vaccine mandate. At least 68.9% of Germans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, short of the government’s aim of a minimum 75% vaccination rate. The number of unvaccinated residents has been blamed as a key factor in a surge of new virus cases in recent weeks. Official figures suggest that the infection rate may now be stabilising, but at too high a level. The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, has met the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, describing the meeting as “productive”. He tweeted: “We continue to work with WHO on our global treaty to prepare for and respond to future pandemics, and on building a global surveillance network.” The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Saturday urged Germans to get vaccinated against Covid-19, speaking days ahead of leaving office in the final episode of more than 600 weekly video podcasts. “I once again emphatically ask you to take this tricky virus seriously,” Merkel said, calling the fourth coronavirus wave to hit Germany “very serious” and even “dramatic”, with intensive care units overloaded in some parts of the country. “The new Omicron variant in particular seems to be even more infectious than those that came before. Get yourself vaccinated, whether it’s your first shot or a booster,” she added. “Every vaccine helps.” After 16 years in power, Merkel is expected to pass the reins to Social Democrat, Olaf Scholz, following a vote in parliament on Wednesday to elect the new chancellor. In her podcast, she thanked “those who are reasonable and understanding in this difficult period” and “stick to the rules to protect themselves and take care of others”. “You are the vast majority in our country. You demonstrate the civic responsibility that’s so marvellous about our country, without which no chancellor or government can achieve anything.” One of Scholz’s first steps as head of government is expected to be passing a law to make vaccination compulsory from February or March next year. Most of the political spectrum has rallied behind the previously controversial move. Looking back at her first video podcast in 2006, Merkel recalled that “back then it was very unusual for a head of government to address the public online so directly”. “My hope at the time, that the World Cup should be a great party even beyond the stadiums, was more than fulfilled,” she added, using the “summer fairytale” moniker Germans still apply to the football tournament they hosted that year. While Merkel touched on a vast range of subjects in podcasts over her time in office, from digitalisation to antisemitism, in the past two years she has frequently spoken about the pandemic. UK government officials and scientific advisers believe that the danger posed by the Omicron variant may not be clear until January, potentially allowing weeks of intense mixing while the variant spreads. Across Westminster, invitations to Christmas drinks are landing in embossed envelopes or on WhatsApp groups. Departmental staff parties are set to take place, as well as a reception for journalists with Rishi Sunak at No 11. Even Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are hosting a joint bash. However, minutes for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggest there is deep concern about the threat from the new variant, particularly its transmissibility. Though there is a wariness about overreacting, one government scientific adviser said Downing Street was “putting all its eggs in one basket” by focusing its efforts on the booster vaccine drive. Russia has reported 32,974 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours. Additionally, 1,215 deaths were reported in the country. Doctors’ leaders in England have welcomed a move to suspend some targets for GPs to enable them to concentrate on the vaccination programme, but warned the service remains under pressure. NHS England has told GPs that routine health checks for the over-75s and for new patients may be deferred. Dr Farah Jameel, chair of the BMA’s England GP committee, said suspending some paperwork would create some additional capacity, but that individual practices would have to decide how much they could switch to delivering Covid jabs. “That will then allow us to support the national effort - the national priority being to one vaccinating the nation as quickly as possible,” she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. “We have been struggling with significant prevailing workforce pressures - backlog pressures, winter pressures, pandemic pressures. “Whilst these changes make a difference and start to create some time, I think every single practice will have to look at just how much time it does release. “What it will do is free up staff time who are busy filling some of these tick-box exercises, so some of our staff can be redeployed to the vaccination effort.” Welcome to the Guardian’s live blog, bringing you the latest information on coronavirus from around the world.

Thanks Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The UK prime minister has been reported to the police by Labour MPs over allegations there were at least two parties in Downing Street during lockdown restrictions last year. Neil Coyle, Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, wrote to the Met police commissioner, Cressida Dick, asking her to investigate reports that the prime minister spoke at a leaving do in November and also allowed a staff Christmas party to go ahead in December. At the time, there were lockdown restrictions in place preventing socialising. After sending the letter, Coyle said: “I believe they broke the law. Most of my constituents followed the rules; those that didn’t faced penalties. Johnson is not above the law, despite his bloated self-entitlement.” Normally, planes are in constant motion, pinballing between continents. But in March 2020 all that came to a halt. What did it mean for our jobs, our horizons – and the planet? In England, unvaccinated women who suffered with Covid-19 during their pregnancies have told “terrifying” stories of having the virus, from being rushed to hospital to having emergency C-sections. The women appear in a video sharing their experiences of severe Covid-19 during pregnancy as part of a new campaign encouraging expectant mothers to get the vaccine. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said 98% of pregnant women in hospital with symptomatic Covid-19 are unvaccinated. The video features three women who experienced serious complications after contracting Covid-19 before they had been vaccinated, as well as the doctors and frontline staff who treated them, to warn of the dangers of the virus for pregnant women and their babies. Christina, a mental health therapist from Guildford who was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 in her third trimester, said: “I had to give birth via emergency C-section because there was concern that I could have a stillbirth. It was terrifying. “I don’t know what the future holds for me and my baby; I’m still suffering with symptoms now along with the anxiety of not knowing how or when I’ll recover. “I would urge pregnant women to get vaccinated because I don’t want anyone to experience what I went through.” Tanviha, who works in anaesthesiology and research in Manchester, spent two months in hospital with Covid-19 following an emergency C-section, said she caught Covid-19 during her second pregnancy in February. An Italian man who wanted a coronavirus vaccine certificate without actually having the jab tried to play the system by presenting health workers with a fake arm. Despite the realistic skin colour, nobody was fooled by the silicone limb, and the man – in his 50s – was reported to local police following the incident on Thursday night in Biella, northwest Italy. “The case borders on the ridiculous, if it were not for the fact we are talking about a gesture of enormous gravity,” the head of the Piedmont regional government, Albert Cirio, said in a statement on Facebook. He said such an act was “unacceptable faced with the sacrifice that our entire community has paid during the pandemic, in terms of human lives, the social and economic cost.” The Cook Islands on Saturday recorded its first case of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, as the South Pacific country edges toward reopening its borders to tourists. The nation of around 17,000 people has one of the highest vaccination rates globally, with 96% of the eligible population double-dosed. The virus was detected in a 10-year-old boy quarantining after arriving on a repatriation flight with his family on Thursday, the prime minister, Mark Brown, said in a statement. The boy was believed to have flown in from New Zealand. South Korea again broke its daily records for coronavirus infections and deaths and confirmed three more cases of the new Omicron variant as officials scramble to tighten social distancing and border controls. The 5,352 new cases reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on Saturday marked the third time this week the daily tally exceeded 5,000. The country’s death toll was at 3,809 after a record 70 virus patients died in the past 24 hours, while the 752 patients in serious or critical conditions were also an all-time high. As the Delta-driven surge threatens to overwhelm hospital systems, there is also concern about the local spread of the Omicron variant, which is seen as potentially more infectious than previous strains of the virus. The country’s omicron caseload is now at nine after KDCA confirmed three more cases. The new cases include the wife, mother-in-law and a friend of a man who caught Omicron from a couple he drove home from the airport after they arrived from Nigeria on 24 November. The couple’s teenage child and two other women who also travelled to Nigeria have also been infected with Omicron. Officials say the number of Omicron cases could rise as some of the patients had attended a church gathering involving hundreds of people on 28 November. While the emergence of Omicron has triggered global alarm and pushed governments around the world to tighten their borders, scientists say it remains unclear whether the new variant is more contagious, more likely to evade the protection provided by vaccines or more likely to cause serious illnesses than previous versions of the virus."

          "headline": "Supreme court case prompts California lawmaker to share her abortion experience",
          "bodyText": "Early one morning this fall, the California state assemblywoman Buffy Wicks felt a type of pain she had never experienced before. Wicks, 44, found herself doubled over in pain, barely able to walk or get her daughter ready for school. At her doctor’s shortly after, she learned that she was pregnant and having a miscarriage and would need an emergency abortion. Twenty-four hours later she had the procedure. Wicks shared the deeply personal account of what happened that September morning on Twitter on Thursday, following oral arguments in the most significant abortion rights case heard by the US supreme court since Roe v Wade. Wicks decided to tell her story to illustrate the urgency of easily accessible reproductive care and warn of the risks this care faces if a Mississippi abortion law is upheld by the nation’s highest court, she told the Guardian. “We often debate these policy matters in theory, but in reality people like me experience the outcomes when lawmakers and policymakers make these decisions,” Wicks said. “I think this is a story that is not uncommon,” she said. “I have a platform that I want to use to help further the cause and say: ‘This is my body and I can make my own decisions.’” In her tweets, Wicks described how hard it had been to process what was going on – working through intense emotions while feeling intense pain. She described asking her doctor whether she would have had access to the procedure she was undergoing had she been in Texas, which this year banned abortions once cardiac activity is detected. The doctor told her that even though the procedure would have been legal, given access issues, it could have been very difficult to obtain. “Think about the cruelty involved in making it your aim to make life more difficult for someone in that situation: in great pain, bleeding profusely, barely able to walk, confused about what’s happening to them, unsure about where to go, and then forcing them to endure multi-state drives or frantic rushes to the airport for the next flight to a state where getting the medically necessary healthcare they need is still *legal* &amp; *available*,” she wrote. “And that’s assuming they have the privilege &amp; means to get those options.” Similar issues are at stake with the abortion case in front of the supreme court, Wicks said. On Wednesday, the court heard oral arguments in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which pits the leadership of the state of Mississippi against the state’s last abortion clinic. The state seeks to ban abortion after 15 weeks gestation and is asking the court to overturn Roe v Wade. “When I was coming of age as a young adult, I thought Roe v Wade was the law of the land and that we had overcome oppressive draconian measures. But here we are again,” Wicks said. In the hearings on Wednesday, the majority of the court appeared supportive of the Mississippi rules, with the newest supreme court justice, Amy Coney Barrett, asking whether women could simply “terminate their parental rights” at the end of pregnancy by giving a child up for adoption, instead of seeking an abortion. Under the Mississippi law, Wicks would still have been able to get an abortion, but similar to the situation in Texas, the impact of closing clinics due to restrictions would make it hard for women to access care in their own communities, even in emergency situations like hers. But if the Mississippi law is upheld, women across the nation may have to travel for hours to find a hospital or clinic, which can make abortions inaccessible for low-income women who are in need of care, she added. “I was doubled over in pain at 4am. I had never experienced that, there’s no way I could have gotten on an airplane or driven miles to get care,” she said."

          "headline": "Cristiano Ronaldo seals Manchester United’s fightback victory over Arsenal",
          "bodyText": "Welcome to the mad house, Ralf. If Manchester United’s incoming interim manager was not fully aware of the size of the challenge that faced him, or how erratic his new team have come to look, it was highlighted before him during a performance that batted between the ridiculous and the sublime. Ralf Rangnick had buckled up before kick-off in the directors’ box, his work permit having come through earlier in the day – although too late for him to have any involvement in the match – and he could be delighted at how United found a way to win. Inevitably, it was Cristiano Ronaldo who made the difference. Recalled to the starting lineup by the outgoing interim, Michael Carrick, he scored twice to move to 12 United goals in 16 appearances for the season, the second from the penalty spot proving to be the winner. But it only partially told the story of a team display that was racked by defensive insecurities and a lack of cohesion. When Ronaldo’s penalty went in, there were 20 minutes to go and it would have taken a brave or foolish United fan to predict an unfussy closing out of the result. There are no such certainties at present; the last two months or so have been a battle from one phase of play to the next and Arsenal had their chances. And yet they could not take them – reinforcing another theme of the occasion. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was hesitant with one on the break and he was fortunate that an offside flag was raised against him after he failed to beat David de Gea shortly afterwards. The Arsenal captain’s touch deserted him time and again. And, when the clock showed 87 minutes and the ball broke for the substitute, Bukayo Saka, there was Fred to hurl himself into a vital block. If anybody captured the helter-skelter nature of it all, it was Fred, who appeared intent on finding different ways to put his team in trouble for much of the first half, with the pièce de resistance being his role in the opening goal. The midfielder lost his bearings on an Arsenal corner and trod on De Gea’s foot as the goalkeeper came to punch. It caused De Gea to roll his ankle and go to ground in obvious distress. Arsenal, meanwhile, worked the ball across the edge of the area for Emile Smith Rowe to shoot home, with De Gea still lying stricken. United felt as though a whistle had to go. To them, it was almost surreal and Martin Atkinson did blow, with Fred – hilariously – having led the protests. And yet the referee only did so after the ball had gone in and for what? A foul by Fred on a teammate? It was quickly apparent that the goal would stand. Fred would show great courage to fight back. He had already won the ball off Thomas Partey on 11 minutes to create a chance for Ronaldo, which the centre-forward dragged wide with Marcus Rashford in space to the right. At the end of the first half, Fred would create the equaliser for Bruno Fernandes and it was him who was fouled by Martin Ødegaard for the decisive penalty. For Arsenal, the frustration was intense. They had arrived in form – with seven wins and two draws from 10 league games – and, with the present of the opening goal, they had the springboard to kick on. And yet they found a way to throw it away; their defending coloured by naivety, their final actions frequently lacking cutting edge. United had kicked off with five points from the previous eight games – their worst run over such a period in Premier League history – and it is difficult to overstate how bad they were in the first 15 minutes. They were nervous and error-strewn, offering spaces to Arsenal in between the lines and, although Smith Rowe’s goal was coloured by strangeness, it had been signposted. Rashford had sliced inches over his own crossbar in the second minute after a poorly defended corner and, before that, Jadon Sancho had missed an easy pass to present Aubameyang with his first shooting opportunity. It was blocked. United were there for the taking and Arsenal let them off the hook, allowing them to work their way on to the front foot – if a little unsteadily. Gabriel Martinelli fluffed a good chance on 39 minutes after he cut in from the right – Smith Rowe was in space for the pull-back – and United changed the game with the equaliser, which was defined by Fred’s ingenuity and vision. Ben White had erred with a clearance and, when Sancho worked the ball inside to Fred, he did well to make the angle for the cut back and execute it. Fernandes’s sure-footed side-foot was his first United goal in 16 appearances. United started the second half with greater tempo, although they still needed De Gea to beat away a Gabriel header following a corner. Ronaldo almost scored after drifting inside Partey and working Aaron Ramsdale from a tight angle and then he did. Nuno Tavares lost the ball to Diogo Dalot and left a yawning gap behind him, which Dalot exploited with a fine pass to Rashford, who crossed. When White and Partey lost Ronaldo, everybody knew what would happen next. It was the prompt for United to switch off and leave space at left-back for Partey to pick out Martinelli, with Ødegaard arriving unchallenged to direct the cross into the far corner. The Norwegian, though, would turn villain, his lunge through the back of Fred giving Ronaldo his chance from the spot. The mystery was that Atkinson needed a tap on the shoulder from VAR to award the kick. It was not the only one."

          "headline": "Son Heung-min steals in to secure Tottenham victory over Brentford",
          "bodyText": "What is this Tottenham side’s natural resting place? A comfortable defeat of Brentford offered no definitive clues but, given their claim to a top-four position has grown appreciably over the past fortnight, Antonio Conte’s concerns about their standard may yet be allayed. A propensity to drop their tempo for extended periods will not be lost on the head coach but there was plenty for him to enjoy here too, particularly an exhilarating second goal that speaks promisingly of their ability to scent blood. Brentford were a pale shadow of their freewheeling early season selves, only posing a genuine threat when their cause was beyond redemption. But they had begun to prompt nervous murmurs around the stands with a spell of pressure either side of the hour mark and the fear was that Spurs had not extended the lead a vigorous start to the game had brought. Then Son Heung-min took a pass from Davinson Sánchez eight yards inside his own half, deftly laid it into Harry Kane’s path and, seven seconds later, could celebrate the tap-in that sealed the points. Son had set off into Brentford territory while Kane, looking up and finding the perfect angle, released a marauding Sergio Reguilón. There was no catching the left wing-back, whose first touch sent him haring into the penalty area and allowed him to cross for Son’s simple finish. The goalscorer had not broken his stride since combining with Kane all that way further back. It was a blistering move and heightened the sense that Reguilón, perhaps more than most in this Tottenham squad, is going to enjoy himself hugely in Conte’s system. “When we have space I think this team is very good because we have players with quality but, at the same time, fast players, very good at exploiting the space,” Conte said. “On the other hand, we have to try to improve when we don’t find the space to move the ball better, to find the right solution.” The point was well made: Spurs have speed to burn when the grass opens up but, even during their long periods of control here, laboured familiarly when the brakes needed applying. They sprung out of the traps, though, and for the opening dozen minutes it was as if the shoddy defeat by Slovenian minnows Mura had never punctured the momentum built in their rousing second half against Leeds. Last week’s embarrassment caused Conte to lament that Tottenham’s level is “not so high”. His players emerged as if intent upon proving him wrong and Lucas Moura had already drawn a fine save from Álvaro Fernández when the breakthrough arrived. It was doubly unfortunate for Sergi Canós, who had defended smartly to concede a corner when Reguilón sought to reach a perceptive pass from Eric Dier. Son took it short and, receiving the ball back, delivered a cross that Pontus Jansson met first. Canós, challenging nearby, was in the way of his header and the speed of the point-blank ricochet gave Fernández no chance; a sheepish Ben Davies, who was closest to the inadvertent scorer, took plaudits from his teammates. Spurs celebrated scoring from a corner for the first time this season and Conte could begin considering a more positive appraisal than the one he had offered seven days previously. “I think you can learn more about a loss than a win,” he said, underlining that the ghosts of Mura still linger. “To get three points is not easy against Brentford but today we showed great desire. For sure we can improve, we have a lot of space for improvement in possession. Without the ball I think we did very well, we put pressure from the start until the end.” Brentford were largely smothered although they remained in the game when Fernández denied Son and then, after half-time, a clean-through Kane. The striker is yet to score in the league under Conte but elements of his game looked crisper here. Spurs let much of the opening period pass them by after Canós’s aberration but their opponents, who have lost five in seven, have mislaid the capacity to ask questions that rocked all-comers in the campaign’s early weeks. Ivan Toney shot at Hugo Lloris before Son’s goal and was denied again late on, but Brentford’s most sustained period of attacking gusto came too late. “In many ways I’m quite satisfied with the performance,” Thomas Frank said. “Overall, we lost fair and square to a better team on the day.” Spurs could plausibly be fourth if they beat Norwich on Sunday. For all Conte’s misgivings, he has put them straight back in the conversation."

          "bodyText": "That’s all for today - here’s the main stories: Alcoholic drinks companies have issued fresh warnings that the Christmas supply of wine, spirits and beer could be disrupted, after the government refused to provide an update on efforts to resolve the shortage of HGV drivers. In an exchange in the Commons, the trade minister Ranil Jayawardena said he was “not going to provide a running commentary on numbers”, after being asked how many of 5,000 temporary visas earmarked for non-UK drivers had been issued. The shadow trade minister Bill Esterson described Jayawardena’s refusal to provide an update as “extraordinary”. He said: “The reality is that the Wine and Spirit Trade Association warns of delivery chaos, of major delays on wine and spirit delivery times - up to five times longer than last year - and increases in freight costs; no doubt it won’t affect parties in Downing Street. “I have to ask the minister: does he want to be responsible for cancelling Christmas celebrations elsewhere, because if he doesn’t, he needs to give a much better answer than the one he’s just given.” The Labour MP cited a letter sent last week to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, by 48 firms including Pernod Ricard, Moët Hennessy and the Wine Society, which said rising costs and supply chain “chaos” had increased the risk that supermarkets run dry and festive deliveries arrive late. Drinks companies told the Guardian the situation was leading to extra costs and causing delays.... The Opec cartel and its allies have agreed to pump more barrels oil from January, but left the door open to putting the brakes on should the Omicron variant lead to further restrictions on travel and trade. The global price of crude fell briefly to $66 per barrel, its lowest level since mid-August, after ministers from some the world’s biggest oil producing countries agreed to go ahead with a plan to increase production by 400,000 barrels a day in the new year. However, prices swung back up after the Opec+ agreed the meeting would not formally close. The unusual move was so the cartel could “continue to monitor the market closely”, pending any new developments, and make “immediate adjustments” rather than wait for the next meeting on 4 January. Thedecision to leave its oil production policy unchanged for now may suggest that Opec+ is banking on new travel restrictions being short-lived if existing vaccines prove effective against the Omicron variant, or if its symptoms are milder than earlier variants of the virus. More here: After another day buffered by omicron worries, European stock markets have closed in the red. The UK’s FTSE 100 lost 39 points, or 0.55%, to 7,129 points, with oil companies cushioning the selloff. Shell gained 1.6% while BP finished 1.1% higher. Catering group Compass (+0.9%) and bank NatWest (+0.8%) were also in the risers. But cyber-security firm Darktrace was the top faller, tumbling 9%, a day after its relegation from the FTSE 100 in the next reshuffle was confirmed. European markets saw steeper losses, with France’s CAC down 1.2% and Germany’s DAX losing 1.3%. It’s been a choppy week, since the discovery of the Omicron variant led to travel restrictions being imposed. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, predicts more volatility as officials work out exactly what to do about the new variant. “There had been much speculation that fears Omicron would stall economies and cut demand for oil might prompt OPEC+ to think twice about its plans to up output in the new year. A volte-face would have pushed up the oil price at a time when consumers are already being sorely taxed by rising prices. The decision not to change tack at the moment will be something of a salve to markets which have endured days of volatility as investors try to get their heads around how big an impact this variant might actually have. Of course, the emergence of a new Covid strain has taken the pressure off the group to do more than they had planned, to up output beyond the agreed levels in a bid to curb rising inflation. Governments know squeezed living standards make for unhappy voters and President Biden in particular has waded into the argument, though the moves made by the US were rather limited in scale and therefore in impact. “In response the oil price slipped, but only slightly and after a momentary pause which saw big oil shudder in response, both BP and Royal Dutch Shell shot quickly back into green territory and big oil stocks on Wall Street seemed to follow a similar path. The White House has welcomed OPEC and its allies’ decision to increase oil output, but added that the U.S. has no plans to reconsider last month’s decision to release crude reserves. One of the biggest unions representing BT workers has urged the business secretary to ensure any potential takeover bid protects the telecoms company’s 100,000 staff, its hundreds of millions in research spending and the national interest. Prospect wrote to Kwasi Kwarteng days before BT’s largest shareholder is allowed to make a potential offer under UK takeover rules. Patrick Drahi, the French-Israeli telecoms billionaire known for cost-cutting at businesses he controls, is free to make his next move from 11 December with the expiry of a no-bid clause that was triggered when he took his £2.2bn stake in June. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of Prospect, said: “The business secretary must take personal charge of making sure that any proposed takeover supports growing that investment, not a flight of money or skills overseas. We need a clear focus on protecting both our national interests and jobs while boosting private sector research and development (R&amp;D), all of which could be at risk with a controversial takeover.” Grab, the Southeast Asian unicorn with a superapp offering food delivery, ride-hailing and financial services has made a volatile entry onto New York’s Nasdaq today. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: In a wildly volatile Nasdaq debut, shares in Grab have swung between gains and losses, now trading down nearly 10%, having initially opened up as much as 18%. The Southeast Asian unicorn, which listed after a SPAC merger with Altimeter Growth Corp, is the most valuable tech business in the region with a market cap of almost $40bn. The Singapore ride-hailing firm raised $4.5bn from a number of investors including BlackRock and T. Rowe Price. Although the company is yet to turn a profit, Grab is well-positioned to benefit from growth in South-East Asia and the accompanying demand for technology with its diversified business model covering deliveries, mobility and financial services. So far its food delivery business has had the most success, benefiting from the stay at home trend during the pandemic. Investors are hoping that Grab can build momentum as we emerge from covid, having reported a slowdown in revenue and a widening EBITDA loss in its latest quarterly results. ‘Tiz the season for festive forecasts, as analysts take a stab at what might happen to stock markets and the economy next year. And in that spirit, Saxo Bank has today released its 10 Outrageous Predictions for 2022. Not things that it believes will happen, but potential risks which investors aren’t pricing in. One is that US inflation soars above 15% in a wage-price spiral, a prospect that would keep Jerome Powell awake at night In this scenario, Saxo says: By the fourth quarter of 2022, the wages for the lower half of US incomes are rising at an annualised 15% clip as companies scramble to find willing and qualified workers who are increasingly selective due to a rising sense of entitlement as jobs are plentiful relative to the meagre availability of workers at all skill levels. This creates a wage-price spiral, with inflation over 15% by 2023, forcing the Federal Reserve into a “too-little, too-late move” to tighten monetary policy faster in a desperate effort to tame inflation. But the central bank has lost credibility; it will take time to regain it, says Saxo. The market impact would be severe : extreme volatility in US equity and credit markets. The JNK high-yield ETF falls as much as 20% and the VIXM mid-curve volatility ETF soars as much as 70%. Other ‘outrageous predictions’ are that the US mid-term election brings constitutional crisis; a stand-off over the certification of close Senate and/or House election results preventing the 118th Congress sitting on schedule in early 2023. Or, Facebook could be abandoned by younger users in protest at the mining of personal information for profit; the attempt by Facebook parent Meta to reel them back in with the Metaverse stumbles. Another possibility: a group of women traders launch a coordinated assault on companies with weak records on gender equality. This would lead to huge swings in equity prices for targeted companies, in a more sophisticated version of the meme stock Reddit Army. The other predictions are: The plan to end fossil fuels gets a rain check EU Superfund for climate, energy and defence announced, to be funded by private pensions India joins the Gulf Cooperation Council as a non-voting member Spotify disrupted due to NFT-based digital rights platform New hypersonic tech drives space race and new cold war Medical breakthrough extends average life expectancy 25 years Chief Investment Officer at Saxo Bank, Steen Jakobsen says this year’s theme is ‘revolution’ There is so much energy building up in our inequality-plagued society and economy. Add to that the inability of the current system to address the issue and we need to look into the future with a fundamental view that it’s not a question of whether we get a revolution but a more a question of when and how. With every revolution, some win and some lose, but that’s not the point—if the current system can’t change but must, a revolution is the only path forward. A culture war is raging across the globe and the divide is no longer simply between the rich and the poor. It’s also the young versus the old, the educated class versus the less educated working class, real markets with price discovery versus government intervention, stock market buy-backs versus R&amp;D spending, inflation versus deflation, women versus men, the progressive left versus the centrist left, virtual signalling on social media versus real changes to society, the rentier class versus labour, fossil fuels versus green energy, ESG initiatives versus the need to supply the world with reliable energy—the list go on. We collaborated globally on Covid vaccines in 2020 and 2021. Now we need a new Manhattan Project–-type endeavour to set the marginal cost of energy, adjusted for productivity, on the path to much lower levels while eliminating the impact of our energy generation on the environment. Such a move would unleash the most significant productivity cycle in history: we could desalinate water, make vertical farms feasible almost anywhere, increase computer powers to quantum states, and continue to explore new boundaries in biology and physics.” Oil is now recovering some of its earlier losses, as traders digest Opec’s output increase, and its decision to keep today’s meeting ongoing in case immediate adjustments are needed. Brent crude has risen back to $68.70 per barrel, only down 0.3% today. Opec+ have confirmed that they have agreed to lift output in January as planned, sticking to their agreed policy of production increases. In a statement, the group say today’s meeting reconfirmed the production adjustment plan, and the decision to lift overall production by 400,000 barrels per day in January. But unusually, today’s meeting will remain in session pending further developments of the pandemic. This will let the group “continue to monitor the market closely and make immediate adjustments if required”, it says. That, I think, means Opec could change policy straight away if demand or prices weakened sharply, rather than waiting for the next meeting on 4th January 2022. But for now, more oil entering the market should feed through to lower fuel costs for motorists. That will cheer the Biden administration, which has been under pressure over soaring gasoline prices. Here’s Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, on Opec+’s decision: Demand concerns were already on the rise and the last thing crude oil bulls were expecting to hear was another rollover of the current policy from the OPEC+ group. Yet contrary to some expectations for only a moderate hike or no hike at all for January, that’s exactly what happened. So, the OPEC+ will raise output by another 400K barrels per day, adding more oil to the global supply and thus completely removing the threat of supply shortages at a time when demand is expected to fall. Indeed, crude oil prices were coming under renewed pressure ever since yesterday afternoon when the first case of the new variant was detected in the US. But in light of the OPEC+ decision, they have just hit fresh weekly lows, with WTI slipping to $63 and Brent $66 – both at their weakest levels since August. Still, the OPEC+ has now stated that it may adjust future production plans if the market changes. So, I suppose it all now depends on Covid and lockdowns. If the situation deteriorates then the OPEC+ will stop further production hikes, possibly as early as their next meet on January 4th. Otherwise, the current policy may rollover as planned. Here’s some snap reaction to OPEC and its allies agreeing to stick to their existing policy of monthly oil output increases, despite fears that a U.S. release from crude reserves and the Omicron variant would hit prices. The oil markets have reacted sharply to reports that Opec will stick to its existing plan of lifting output again next month: The oil price is falling sharply, on reports that the Opec+ group has agreed to raise output again next month as planned. Reports from today’s meeting of Opec and its allies say the group has decided not to divert from its strategy of adding an extra 400,000 barrels of oil per day to the market each month. Reuters says: OPEC+ has agreed to go ahead with its planned January oil output rise of 400,000 barrels per day, two OPEC+ sources said on Thursday. Amena Bakr, chief Opec correspondent at Energy Intelligence, has tweeted that the group seems to be in agreement about sticking to their current policy: This has knocked the oil price, with some traders having anticipated that Opec+ would freeze production in January, given uncertainty over Omicron’s impact on the global economy. Brent crude has tumbled to $66.31 per barrel, down 3.7% today, its lowest since mid-August. It had hit three-year highs over $86/barrel in October, as Opec+ gradually reversed the steep production cuts implemented after Covid-19 lockdowns hurt demand for energy. But it has fallen since, as rising Covid-19 cases have dampened demand. The number of Americans filing new jobless claims has risen, but is still relatively low as US companies try to hold onto staff. There were 222,000 fresh ‘initial claims’ for unemployment support last week, up from the 53-year low seen in the previous week. That’s still below pre-pandemic levels, which Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, says is a very positive sign. Today’s release of initial unemployment claims puts us almost back to pre-pandemic levels. That’s great news, but it comes with the caveat that the new wave of Delta cases, and the specter of Omicron cases, could push layoffs higher in coming weeks.” The number of people dining out across the UK has fallen to the lowest level since the reopening of indoor hospitality, according to restaurant industry figures covering the first few days since news broke of the Omicron variant. The seven-day average estimate for UK seated diners fell six percentage points in the week to 29 November, reaching the lowest point since 17 May when indoor dining reopened in England, Scotland and Wales. While the number of people eating out remained above levels recorded during the equivalent week in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic, at 111%, the figure was down from a level of 117% in the previous week, according to the figures from the booking platform OpenTable. In a potential sign of growing consumer caution, the number of seated diners on Monday and Tuesday this week fell sharply compared with the same days earlier this month, dropping to 4% and 7% below pre-Covid levels for the same days in 2019. Although the number of people dining out is usually lower at the start of the week, this was the weakest daily figure since July. More here: UK household wealth soared last year thanks to rising house prices, pension values and savings. Households’ net worth grew to £11.2 trillion in 2020, an increase of 8.4% during a year in which the pandemic hammered the economy. It’s the second highest growth since the 2008 global economic downturn, the Office for National Statistics says. Over 40% of this increase in households’ net worth was due to land becoming more valuable, due to a 7.3% increase in average house prices. This rise was likely to have been affected by the reduction in stamp duty rates, the ONS says. Pensions added another 40%, mainly due to an increase in the value of defined benefit pension schemes, due to historically low gilt yields. “Currency and deposits” contributed 21.5% of the growth in households’ net worth, as due to the jump in savings during lockdowns and the furlough scheme which protected incomes. The increase in land values also lifted the UK’s net worth, which rose by £500bn to £10.7 trillion. But general government net worth fell by £445bn in 2020 to minus £1,494 billion, the largest annual fall recorded, due to the surge in borrowing to cover the cost of the pandemic. The UK’s financial net worth increased by £63bn, but remained negative at around minus £500bn in 2020, meaning the value of the UK’s financial liabilities continued to exceed the value of financial assets. The ONS explains: This was the first time UK financial assets increased more than financial liabilities since 2016 and have therefore made a positive contribution to growth in the UK’s net worth. This was mainly attributed to greater overseas bank deposits and loan contracts with UK banks. The factors that would have contributed to this include: the availability of financial support for businesses, cheaper forms of funding, changes in demand and reluctance to spend because of the uncertainty during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Brazilian economy has fallen back into recession, as high interest rates, rising inflation and a drought all hit growth. Brazil’s GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2021, following a 0.4% contraction in April-June, statistics agency IBGE reports. That puts Latin America’s largest economy into a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of economic contraction). Brazil’s economic rebound from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hit by a rise in inflation, which led its central bank to raise interest rates several times this year . Brazil has also been hit by the worst drought in almost a century, leading to water shortages and the threat of power blackouts, as the country has tried to recover from the pandemic. After another choppy morning, the UK stock market is still in the red. The FTSE 100 index is down 64 points, or 0.9%, at 7104 points, back towards the seven-week lows earlier this week. Despite omicron worries, airline stocks are actually higher today, with IAG up 1.8% and budget rivals easyJet gaining 3.8% and Wizz Air rising 3.3%. Oil producers BP and Royal Dutch Shell are also a little higher, ahead of the Opec decision. But cruise operator Carnival is down 6%, suggesting some concerns that passenger numbers could be hit by Omicron worries, after the US reported its first case yesterday. Overall, the market remains acutely sensitive to anything about omicron and will respond on positive or negative headlines with abandon, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com: Sector wise, healthcare and consumer defensives won out yesterday, quality tech provided some resistance with Apple and Microsoft barely declining. Momentum was a problem with ARKK [the popular innovation-focused fund] down almost 7%, almost 40% below the all-time high struck earlier this year. This is mirrored today on the FTSE with the likes of Unilever and United Utilities among the few risers. Shell and BP also higher as crude rallied 1% though oil remains under a heap of pressure with OPEC+ set to meet today to decide on whether to increase output by 400k bpd in January. A pause in the loosening of output controls would help sentiment in the market and is increasingly expected. Advertising boss Sir Martin Sorrell has said clients are cancelling Christmas events in response to Omicron, and criticised the UK government for failing to give sufficient guidance on masks. Sorrell, the executive chairman of S4 Capital and the founder and former chief executive of WPP, said event cancellations had gathered pace since the new Covid variant was identified. Sorrell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “What we are seeing our clients doing and other people [doing], the answer is they are … cancelling,” “There has been quite a sharp series of cancellations since this happened just three, four, five days ago.” Boris Johnson, who is embroiled in a controversy over Christmas parties at Downing Street during lockdown last year, has urged people not to cancel festive parties or nativity plays. But, business minister George Freeman says his department won’t have a big party this year. His parliamentary team will have a Zoom gathering, due to the omicron variant, he told Times Radio. The decision on whether Opec and its allies will lift oil production next month as planned, or freeze output at December’s levels, hangs in the balance. Under its existing pact, Opec+ agreed to raise output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month, as it reverses the large cuts introduced early in the pandemic. But market uncertainties mean its next move is uncertain, according to the latest words from delegates, as Reuters explains: Two OPEC+ sources said the group would discuss pausing the January increase as an option, while two sources said they expected the 400,000 bpd rise to go ahead. One source even said he expected a cut in production, without giving any figures.

II says the deal will let it build on its position as the UK’s second largest DIY investment platform, with almost £55bn of assets under administration and over 400,000 customers. II’s CEO Richard Wilson will join abrdn and continue to lead the platform, the asset manager said in a statement. The move will boost abrdn’s position in the personal investing sector, where ii competes with rivals like Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell. Abrdn (formerly called Standard Life Aberdeen) has been looking to expand its presence in UK adviser and consumer markets. Stephen Bird, chief executive officer of abrdn, says: “This is a unique opportunity and a transformative step in delivering our growth strategy. interactive investor is the UK’s number one subscription-based investing platform with a powerful reputation as a consumer champion. abrdn’s scale, resources and shared vision will enable interactive investor to grow confidently and expand its leadership position in the UK’s attractive savings and wealth market. Lord Rothermere has upped his bid to take the publisher of the Daily Mail, i, Metro and New Scientist private to try to win over investors who believe he is significantly undervaluing the business. The family, which founded the Daily Mail in 1896 and listed the parent company, Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), on the stock market in 1932, has upped its offer to 270p a share, valuing the newspaper business at £885m including debt. The previous offer of 255p a share, valuing the business at £850m, prompted two top 10 shareholders – Majedie Asset Management and JO Hambro Capital Management, which control or advise on shares accounting for a combined 10.2% of DMGT – to publicly criticise the offer as woefully undervaluing the assets. Rothermere, who has struggled to win acceptance of the deal from shareholders, has also changed the terms, so the family now needs only 50% approval from investors to delist. Those unwilling to sell will be offered shares in the private company. More here: Salih Yilmaz, senior oil analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, suggests Opec could pause its planned output hike, while it assesses the impact of omicron. In the eurozone, unemployment has dipped to its lowest level since the first wave of Covid-19 hit the region last year. The euro area jobless rate dropped to 7.3% in October, down from 7.4% in September, and the lowest since spring 2020. Eurostat estimates that eurozone unemployment has fallen by over 1.5m since October 2020, when the jobless rate was 8.4% The youth unemployment rate also dipped in October, to 15.9% from 16% a month earlier. But firms are also hiking their prices sharply, as they pass on higher commodity costs, energy bills, and labour costs. Industrial producer prices in the euro area jumped by 5.4% in October alone, and were 21.9% higher than a year ago. The increase is driven by higher energy costs -- up 62.5% year-on-year in the energy sector. But there was also a 16.8% increase in intermediate goods prices (items used to make final products), and a 4.2% jump in durable consumer goods. Neil Birrell, Premier Miton chief investment officer and manager of Premier Miton Diversified fund range, says: “The unemployment rate in Eurozone remains stubbornly high, but it was in line with expectations. Meanwhile, producer prices came in a lot higher than expected, up 5.4% month on month, reflecting the global concerns around inflation. The whole outlook is obviously muddled by the Omicron issue, but the data is quite clear. For now, inflation is rising fast and the ECB will have to consider this in their policy discussions, as will all other central banks.” The UK’s gas crunch continued last week. The ONS reports that wholesale gas prices rose by 8% last week, the third rise in a row. That squeeze has forced 25 UK energy suppliers to collapse since the start of September, and means the UK’s energy cap is likely to be lifted sharply higher next spring, driving up bills for consumers. Crisps remain in short supply at a quarter of UK shops, a month after a software problem at Walkers hit production. Multipack crisps were in low supply at 20% of shops surveyed last week by market researchers Kantar Public, while 4% had run out, showing no improvement on a week ago. Painkillers paracetamol and ibuprofen were also in short supply at 16% of shops, while 8% had run out of frozen turkeys after worried consumers shopped early for Christmas to avoid missing out. Sarah Riding, retail &amp; supply chain partner at the law firm, Gowling WLG, says: “From a supply chain perspective, overcoming these challenges in the coming weeks will be a litmus test of the ability to utilise key supply chain survival tactics for when normality returns in the New Year - something which is borne out by recent comments from the WTO. “As the global variables at play subside, it is vital that businesses use this experience to strengthen their supply chain strategies and efficiencies around vendor dependencies, the regularity of supplier reviews and of course ethics.” More UK companies are stockpiling materials and parts, as inflationary pressures and supply chain shortages continue to hit the economy. Across all industries, 6% of businesses reported they were stockpiling goods or materials in late November 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics’ latest survey of the UK economy. That’s the highest percentage reported since the question was introduced in early February 2021. Some 38% of businesses reported that the prices of materials, goods or services increased compared with normal expectations for this time of year, up from 37% in October 2021. Two-thirds of manufacturers reported that prices were unusually high. And these costs are being passed on; 16% of businesses reported increases in the price of materials, goods or services sold last month, compared with 15% in October. The oil price has risen this morning, after hitting three-month lows last night ahead of today’s Opec+ meeting. Brent crude is up 1.7% at around $70 per barrel, having tumbled sharply since the Omicron variant first worried markets late last week. Traders are watching to see if Opec and its allies decide to release more oil into the market in January. Their current deal is to add an extra 400,000 barrels per day each month; but they could could decide to restrain supply due to concerns over demand, and a US-coordinated release of oil last week. It’s a tricky call, as AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould explains: “Later today OPEC will make a call on oil production quotas as the producers’ cartel weighs up the threat to demand posed by Omicron. “The dramatic fall in oil prices in recent weeks means they may be tempted to make cuts but if they do so and it turns out the variant is more benign than feared, oil could then gush significantly higher, leading to demand destruction in itself. “Just like central bankers, investors and everybody else, OPEC is performing a high wire act at present and Christmas may be upon us before we return to solid ground.” Tesco’s festive TV campaign featuring Santa Claus bearing a Covid vaccine passport has been cleared by the UK ad watchdog despite anti-vaccination campaigners making it the second most complained about advert of all time. The advert, titled “This Christmas, Nothing’s Stopping Us”, prompted more than 5,000 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which determines whether marketing campaigns have broken the UK advertising code. The ad shows the public determined to enjoy a proper Christmas with family and friends after lockdown restrictions prevented gatherings last year. However, in one scene a reporter appears on TV with “breaking news” telling viewers that “Santa could be quarantined”. Father Christmas is then shown presenting his Covid pass at border control, proving he has been vaccinated to a customs official so he can enter the country without restriction. A spokesman for the ASA said: “Having carefully assessed the 5,000 complaints we received about the Tesco Christmas ad campaign, we have concluded it doesn’t break our rules and there are no grounds for further action,” “We consider that the depiction of Santa displaying a proof of vaccine status in an airport is likely to be seen as a humorous reference to international travel rules people have experienced this year. It is unlikely to be interpreted as a message about these rules or the Covid-19 vaccine more widely.

The biotechnology arm of the Japanese conglomerate Fujifilm, which is better known for its photography heritage, said the package would more than double its Billingham site’s development and manufacturing capability, creating the largest biopharmaceutical factory with several different technologies in the UK. The factory in Stockton-on-Tees produces ingredients from biological sources for pharmaceutical treatments, such as microbes, cell cultures and viral vectors, used to deliver genetic material into cells. More here: Technology stocks are also pulling Europe’s stock markets down, following a report that demand for Apple’s flagship iPhone 13 has slowed. Bloomberg reported that Apple has told its component suppliers that demand for the iPhone 13 lineup has weakened, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple had already been juggling supply shortages, and some consumers appear to have have decided against trying to get the hard-to-find item. Bloomberg explains: Already, Apple had cut its iPhone 13 production goal for this year by as many as 10 million units, down from a target of 90 million, because of a lack of parts, Bloomberg News reported. But the hope was to make up much of that shortfall next year -- when supply is expected to improve. The company is now informing its vendors that those orders may not materialize, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The company is still on track for a record holiday season, with analysts projecting a sales increase of 6% to $117.9 billion in the final three months of the calendar year. But it won’t be the blockbuster quarter that Apple -- and Wall Street -- had originally envisioned. Shortages and delivery delays have frustrated many consumers. And with inflation and the omicron variant bringing fresh concerns to pandemic-weary shoppers, they may forego some purchases. Shares in Dutch semiconductor maker ASML have fallen by 4%. It provide chip makers with essential hardware, software and services to mass produce patterns on silicon. Chipmaker Infineon Technologies are down 2.7%, In the City, the FTSE 100 index has dropped by around 0.7%, a day after its best session in four months. The blue-chip index is down 58 points at 7110 points, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 has fallen over 1%. Royal Mail is the top FTSE 100 faller, down 5% after its shares went ex-dividend today. Betting group Entain (-3%) and retailer JD Sports (-2.6%) are also in the fallers. Tech-focused investor Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust (-2.6%) is lower after US technology companies fell last night. But GSK’s shares are a little higher (+0.3%) after it reported that lab tests have shown its antibody drug sotrovimab retains its activity against Omicron. A drug treatment which, the makers say, works against the new Omicron variant of Covid-19, has been approved by UK regulators. UK pharmaceuticals group GlaxoSmithKline reported this morning that a lab analysis of the antibody-based COVID-19 therapy it is developing with US partner Vir has shown the drug retains activity against all tested variants of concern, including key mutations of Omicron. Sotrovimab, a single monoclonal antibody, binds to the spike protein on the outside of the COVID-19 virus, preventing it from attaching to and entering human cells, so that it cannot replicate in the body. Tests are ongoing to confirm the results against all of the Omicron mutations, with an update expected by year-end, GSK added. George Scangos, chief executive officer of Vir, explained: “Sotrovimab was deliberately designed with a mutating virus in mind. By targeting a highly conserved region of the spike protein that is less likely to mutate, we hoped to address both the current SARS-CoV-2 virus and future variants that we expected would be inevitable. This hypothesis has borne out again and again - with its ongoing ability to maintain activity against all tested variants of concern and interest to date, including key mutations found in Omicron, as demonstrated by preclinical data. We have every expectation that this positive trend will continue and are working rapidly to confirm its activity against the full combination sequence of Omicron.” The news comes as Britain’s drug regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, approved sotrovimab, also known under the brand name Xevudy. MHRA says it took the decision “after it was found to be safe and effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death in people with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who are at an increased risk of developing severe disease”. Wall Street’s ‘fear index’, the VIX measure of volatility, has hit its highest level since January. Volatility rose yesterday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the Omicron variant had been found in the US, knocking the earlier optimistic mood. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Uncertainty over the latest variant of Covid-19 continues to grip the markets, as oil producers gather (remotely) to decide whether to keep boosting their output despite the economic threat from Omicron. Wall Street took another dive yesterday, in the most volatile session since March after the first case of the Omicron variant was reported in the United States, in California. Wall Street’s benchmark S&amp;P 500 index ended down 1.2% on Wednesday after being up 1.9% earlier in the day, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.3% in another rollercoaster session. This knocked some Asia-Pacific markets, with Japan’s Nikkei dropping another 182 points, or 0.65%, to 27,753. European markets are set to slide at the open, having rallied strongly on Wednesday, with concerns that the US Federal Reserve could wrap up its stimulus package faster than expected also worrying investors. Given the uncertainty over the latest variant’s virulence, transmissibility, and vaccine’s efficacy against it, the markets are being buffeted by the latest headlines. As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says, In terms of developments about Omicron, we’re still in a waiting game for some concrete stats, but there was positive news early on from the World Health Organization’s chief scientist, who said that they think vaccines “will still protect against severe disease as they have against the other variants”. On the other hand, there was further negative news out of South Africa, as the country reported 8,561 infections over the previous day, with a positivity rate of 16.5%. That’s up from 4,373 cases the day before, and 2,273 the day before that, so all eyes will be on whether this trend continues, and also on what that means for hospitalisation and death rates over the days ahead. The Opec+ group of major oil producers will assess the impact of Omicron on energy demand, when they meet later today to agree how much oil to pump in January. Opec, led by Saudi Arabia will be joined by non-OPEC allies such as Russia. They must decide whether to stick with their plan to gradually increase oil production by 400,000 barrels per day each month, or pull back. Peter McNally, global lead for industrials, metals &amp; energy at research firm, Third Bridge, says today’s meeting will be one of Opec’s most important since the recovery began. Authorities have looked to control the spread of COVID with swift lockdowns and the oil demand recovery in those regions has stalled as a result. International air travel is still far away from a full recovery, so the impact of limiting travel from African countries may be relatively minor. Were OPEC+ to add another 400,000 barrels per day of supply for January 2022, it would be a signal that these countries expect the recovery to continue as previously planned. But this year began with Saudi Arabia unilaterally slashing production by 1 million barrels per day as the winter wave of COVID dashed the pace of recovery. This week’s meeting of OPEC+ ministers is shaping up to be one of the most significant since the pandemic recovery demand recovery began, and the key signal will be how much more oil will be added to supply to start the new year.” The agenda 9.30am GMT: Weekly real-time-indicators of economic activity and social change in the UK 10am GMT: Eurozone unemployment report for October 10am GMT: Eurozone producer prices report for October Noon BST: Brazil’s third-quarter GDP report 1pm GMT: Opec+ meeting begins 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless data"

          "headline": "Commons row prompts fresh warnings over Christmas alcohol supplies",
          "bodyText": "Alcoholic drinks companies have issued fresh warnings that the Christmas supply of wine, spirits and beer could be disrupted, after the government refused to provide an update on efforts to resolve the shortage of HGV drivers. In an exchange in the Commons, the trade minister Ranil Jayawardena said he was “not going to provide a running commentary on numbers”, after being asked how many of 5,000 temporary visas earmarked for non-UK drivers had been issued. The shadow trade minister Bill Esterson described Jayawardena’s refusal to provide an update as “extraordinary”. He said: “The reality is that the Wine and Spirit Trade Association warns of delivery chaos, of major delays on wine and spirit delivery times - up to five times longer than last year - and increases in freight costs; no doubt it won’t affect parties in Downing Street. “I have to ask the minister: does he want to be responsible for cancelling Christmas celebrations elsewhere, because if he doesn’t, he needs to give a much better answer than the one he’s just given.” The Labour MP cited a letter sent last week to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, by 48 firms including Pernod Ricard, Moët Hennessy and the Wine Society, which said rising costs and supply chain “chaos” had increased the risk that supermarkets run dry and festive deliveries arrive late. Drinks companies told the Guardian the situation was leading to extra costs and causing delays. The wine and spirits supplier Kingsland Drinks, which counts the large supermarket chains among its clients, fills about 185m bottles of wine every year, about one in eight drunk in the UK. Its managing director, Ed Baker, said the driver shortage was slowing down the company’s supply chain just as it was preparing for the busy Christmas period. “At this time of year our business trades 2.5m-3m litres of wine a week, most of which comes in bulk containers into UK ports and travels by rail to a rail hub near our Manchester site or to the port in Liverpool,” he said. “HGV drivers then transport the containers of liquid wine to our factory and are used to take the finished products to our customers, including major supermarkets. We, along with others across the wine and spirit industry, are experiencing hold-ups along the way.” Baker said the nationwide logjam in the supply chain had led to high demand for container spaces at the rail hubs. “We would normally expect to have 80 to 100 tank spaces but at the moment we can be down at 10 to 20,” he said. “This is limiting the amount of liquid getting to our plant and comes on top of the HGV driver shortages doing the deliveries. The driver surcharges will drive up costs and if products are turning up late it could lead to some festive drinks not making it on to supermarket shelves for Christmas.” Sam McMeekin, the founder of the Gipsy Hill brewery in south-east London, said the driver shortage was adding to his costs just as the business faced a hit from fears about the Omicron variant of Covid-19, which was making some people stay away from pubs, particularly in the city centre because of increase in home working. “We’ve finally managed to hire our own HGV driver, internalising that cost to hopefully save on the soaring cost of outsourcing it,” he said. “As a result the only impacts on us are ongoing super-high lead times for everything and lack of any flexibility in the market.” However the UK’s largest wine merchant, Majestic, insisted last week that “our shelves will remain full”."

          "bodyText": "We’re not back into lockdown, of course, or anything even vaguely resembling it yet. Instead we are tumbling once again down the rabbit hole of uncertainty, into that wearily familiar world where every plan feels made to be potentially broken. It’s back to the constant pinging of WhatsApp groups, just wondering if everyone’s still comfortable with the plan for getting together at the weekend; back to the Covid-era maths of counting backwards from whichever social highlight you really don’t want to miss this Christmas and then strategically cancelling anything in the run-up that might risk you getting infected, which explains why some firms are now scrapping the office party. Who wants to end up sadly self-isolating on Christmas Day, just for the sake of a night making awkward small talk with the boss? Unless, that is, you work in Downing Street, where aides were allegedly popping corks last December as intensive care beds were filling up. No 10 insists that reports of after-work drinking sessions featuring secret Santas, Christmas quizzes and letting off steam into the small hours were all within the rules that banned social gatherings at the time, which suggests it was defining parties in much the same creative way that Bill Clinton defined sex during the Monica Lewinsky episode. Parties are what other people were getting fined £10,000 for having. A few dozen people boozing in a packed room – well, that’s just government. How reassuring it is to know those responsible are still in charge as we head back into another fraught winter. Meanwhile, for those working in the NHS, or running a small business that wouldn’t survive another lockdown, or remembering how they struggled with their mental health during that last lonely winter, the knotted dread in the pit of the stomach is back. Since we still know so little about the Omicron variant of Covid-19 currently causing exponential growth in South Africa, the hope remains that all this could still be a false alarm. Perhaps it really will turn out to be less infectious than feared, at least in a highly vaccinated country such as Britain, or else a cause of mild infections only. It could be weeks before we know whether it really is the big one – the mutation scientists always half-expected to come along and make a mockery of our confidence that the pandemic was over – or just another damp squib. But until we know, the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, is right to warn against snogging under the mistletoe. Whatever happens with Omicron, the underlying reality is that Britain is still surfing into winter on a wave of existing Covid infections with all the red lights on NHS dashboards flashing. The sight of ambulances queueing outside A&amp;E is a telltale symptom of a hospital system struggling to cope with both a backlog of non-Covid cases and a growing crisis in social care, meaning frail elderly patients can’t be discharged because they have nowhere else to go. (Stopping people having to sell their houses to fund care, still the centrepiece of the government’s reforms, feels like the least of anyone’s problems this winter.) The scenario most likely to prompt more restrictions now isn’t mass Covid deaths but rising infections causing the NHS to buckle under pressure, which would risk people dying from lack of prompt medical care for all sorts of otherwise treatable illnesses or accidents. But that’s a more abstract threat than the visceral fear of a killer virus, and more complicated for public health experts to convey. Last week, after riots in Holland at the prospect of lockdown there, Chris Whitty told the Local Government Association that his biggest worry now was whether “we can still take people with us” if further restrictions were needed. On the surface, that seems surprising. Time and time again, Britons have proved more willing to put up with drastic constraints on their lives than anyone could have imagined. Polling shows that the handful of noisy keyboard warriors moaning this week about the return of masks in shops and on public transport are woefully at odds with the public mood. But if more painful restrictions were needed this winter, there are reasons to think it would be an uglier argument this time round. Before the vaccine, millions were genuinely afraid either of dying from Covid, or inadvertently killing those we loved. But the jab has made us bolder, and that’s what makes this winter different from the last. This time, a government trying to shut down pubs, restaurants or socialising would be grappling not just with exhaustion – the sense that people are tired of living like this – but anger from those who were repeatedly told that vaccination would set them free. They did their bit and got their jabs, so why should they sit around watching their livelihoods go to the wall, just because the virus still poses a very real threat to those who stubbornly refused the vaccine? The current wave of Covid-19 surging in Europe has seen a growing backlash emerging against unvaccinated people, the most obvious scapegoats for the fact that the virus still hasn’t gone away, and this is increasingly seeping into policy. In Austria, unvaccinated people were locked down last month while everyone else enjoyed their freedom. In Latvia, lawmakers who refuse the vaccine have been barred from voting on new laws and taking part in debates. In Singapore, unjabbed individuals are told they’ll have to pay for their hospital treatment, effectively a punishment for not doing the responsible thing. Here, such naked discrimination still seems as unthinkable as refusing to treat smokers for lung cancer; it’s a core principle of medicine that doctors treat all comers without judgment, no matter how distressed they may get about having to cancel much-needed operations because ICU beds are full of Covid patients realising too late they should have got the vaccine. But if new restrictions prove necessary, either to suppress Omicron or whatever variant comes next, don’t be surprised if there is a backlash against the idea that vaccinated and unvaccinated people should all be in it together – especially if the Treasury proves reluctant to offer the kind of generous support that cushioned the pain of past lockdowns. All this, of course, still feels very theoretical now. Many South Africans were baffled by the rest of the world’s heightened reaction to Omicron, and maybe in a few weeks’ time we too will look back and feel sheepish for worrying. But whatever happens, it would be wise to start thinking now about the shifting dilemmas of the post-vaccinated era, and to stay one step ahead not just of the virus itself but of its uncanny ability to disrupt and confound. For almost two years, the pandemic has been tearing up much of what we thought we knew about the way a modern economy and society functions. It may not be done with disconcerting us just yet.

Nick AMes reports from Vicarage Road ... Premier League: “Manchester City’s sixth consecutive victory derived from a scintillating Bernardo Silva goal that oozed quality from start to finish,” writes Jamie Jackson from Villa Park. Premier League: Wolves were the better side but couldn’t convert their chances on a frustrating night for the hosts at Molineux. Peter Lansley reports ... Premier League: Neal Maupay cancelled out Tomas Soucek’s opener with a sublime late bicycle-kick and Jacob Steinberg was at the London Stadium to see it. Premier League: “Jamie Vardy squandered a golden chance to win the game for Leicester City but ultimately it was a night when familiar failings put paid to any hopes of earning victory at Southampton,” writes Ben Fisher from St Mary’s. Premier League: “It was everything Everton had feared and Liverpool desired on their return to the stadium where the fault-lines first appeared in their title defence last season,” writes Andy Hunter from Goodison Park. On a night of staggered kick-offs and unforeseen but unavoidable delays, here are your Premier League final scores. It’s as you were at the top of the table, with Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool all winning. Southampton 2-2 Leicester Watford 1-2 Chelsea West Ham 1-1 Brighton Wolves 0-0 Burnley Aston Villa 1-2 Manchester City Everton 1-4 Liverpool View the Premier League table Premier League: Manchester City emerged victorious by the odd goal of three despite a spirited second half fightback from their hosts. Premier League: Liverpool can’t stop scoring while Everton have taken just two points from the past 24 available. Premier League: Chelsea take the points from a game that was interrupted for half an hour when a spectator had Vicarage Road went into cardiac arrest during the first half. The fan in question was hospitalised after receiving emergency medical treatment in the stand and is reported to be in a stable condition. Aston Villa 1-2 Manchester City: Jack Grealish enters the fray to a chorus of loud boos (and some applause) from Aston Villa fans moments after Tyrone Mings had skimmed a downward header harmlessly wide. That’s a weird reaction from those Villa fans, booing a former player and fan of the club that sold him for £100m during the summer. Premier League: “Wolves could have gone fifth in the Premier League if they had converted their dominance into victory but only scoring once in their past four matches balances the perspective of where Bruno Lage’s team are in their development,” writes Peter Lansley from Molineux. Premier League: From the edge of the six-yard box, Diogo Jota sends the ball into the roof of Jordan Pickford’s net after a nifty bit of footwork to create space for the shot. Aston Villa 1-2 Manchester City: On for Matt Targett, Carney Chukwuemeka runs on to a through ball and finds himself in a one-on-one with Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson, who receives the congratulations of several team-mates after saving superbly from the youngster who should have scored but didn’t do a great deal wrong. Excellent goalkeeping. Watford 1-2 Chelsea: More on that Hakim Ziyech goal. He converted a low cross from Mason Mount with his first touch and has just gone close again with a downward header that didn’t particularly trouble Watford goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann. Aston Villa 1-2 Manchester City: Steven Gerrard has got a great reaction from his half-time address to his Villa players, while Jack Grealish was actually booed by some fans of his former club as he warmed up on the touchline. He hasn’t come on yet.

Find out how with Scott Murray ... Premier League: Hakim Ziyech puts Chelsea ahead in the delayed game at Vicarage Road. Premier League: An entertaining match that could easily have gone either way finishes all square at St Mary’s. Southampton took the lead twice but were pegged back on both occasions by Leicester City. Southampton 2-2 Leicester City: We’re in the third of five minutes of added time at St Mary’s which the match very finally poised. Everton 1-2 Liverpool: Anthony Gordon is on for Everton, replacing the injured Salomon Rondon ... who has been playing instead of the injured Dominic Calvert-Lewin. That’s a blow, even if the man from Venezuela has struggled to find the net. Scottish Premiership: Kemar Roofe puts Rangers ahead at Hibernian with a goal from the penalty spot after 85 minutes. It’s 1-0 to the reigning champions. Premier League: Brighton were the better side but needed a late Goal of the Season contender from Neal Maupay to secure a point. Premier League: It’s a point gained for Burnley and two dropped by Wolves, who were dominant but couldn’t score at Molineux. Watford 1-1 Chelsea: In the Chelsea goal, Edouard Mendy dashes out of his penalty area to thwart Tom Cleverley. Premier League: Ollie Watkins runs on to a Douglas Luiz pass and sidefoots in off the upright to pull a goal back for Villa. Premier League: Neal Maupay holds off Craig Dawson to equalise for Brighton with a splendid bicycle kick, converting a terrific cross from Tariq Lamptey. His splendid strikes survives a VAR check but he gets booked for his over-exuberant celebrations. Scottish Premiership: Aberdeen double their lead against 10-man Livingston, with David Bates scoring their second of the evening on 75 minutes. Watford 1-1 Chelsea: Making a rare start for Chelsea, Saul Niguez suffers the indignity of being replaced at half-time. Again. Thiago Silva replaces him. West Ham 1-0 Brighton: Michail Antonio tees up Declan Rice on the edge of the Brighton penalty area but his shot is saved by Robert Sanchez. Watford 1-1 Chelsea: The fan who suffered cardiac arrest during the first half of the game, prompting a delay of 30 minutes or so, is reported to be in a stable condition, presumably in the hospital that is very close to Vicarage Road. Premier League half-times: Aston Villa 0-2 Manchester City, Everton 1-2 Liverpool. Scottish Premiership: Livingston’s Jackson Longridge is sent off after picking up his second booking. The 10 men he leaves behind trail Aberdeen by the only goal of the game. West Ham 1-0 Brighton: Adam Lallana misses a glorious scoring opportunity and his Brighton side are still a goal in arrears. Premier League: Bernardo Silva scores on the volley from a Gabriel Jesus cross as City sweep forward on the counter from a Villa corner. That’s a cracking goal! Leicester City 2-2 Southampton: A worrying sight for Leicester City fans as James Maddison goes down and then walks gingerly to the touchline rubbing his right hip/buttock after shipping a knock. He’s all smiles, so it doesn’t look too serious. Premier League: Following an interrupted first half at Vicarage Road, the players leave the field again, on this occasion for the half-time interval. Premier League: Demarai Gray makes it “game on” at Goodison Park. Scott Murray has the latest ... Southampton 2-2 Leicester City: Leicester City win a free-kick wide on the right and James Maddison’s delivery is superb. Vardy connect but sends the ball over the bar. Premier League: James Maddison pulls a low right-footed shot from a tight angle just inside the near post. Could ALex Mccarthy have done better in the Southampton goal? I’d need to see it again. Wolves 0-0 Burnley: Chris Wood has been subbed off by Sean Dyche just after the hour mark at Molineux. He’s not best pleased and makes a comment on his way to the bench that doesn’t seem to go down too well with his boss. Southampton 2-1 Leicester City: The second half is under way at St Mary’s following a delay due to a medical emergency in the stands. Sky Sports are reporting that the fan who needed attention is consious and communicative, which is good news. Premier League: It’s coming up to half-time in the delayed game at Vicarage Road, where Emmanuel Dennis has just equalised for the hosts. Premier League: Manchester City have been completely dominant against Villa and their good work is rewarded. Ruben Dias puts them in front with his first goal of the season. His shot from distance took a deflection off Leon Bailey that left Emi Martinez with no chance in the Villa goal. Premier League: West Ham’s second “goal” is choked off and to be completely honest, I’m not really sure why. It’s either a foul by Craig Dawson, an offside ... or something else. I’m going with an offside shout against Michail Antonio. Premier League: West Ham double their lead but there’s a VAR check. Robert Sanchez dealt horribly with a corner and in a pile of legs and arms the ball bounced in off Michail Antonio or Shane Duffy. Southampton 2-1 Leciester City: Oh dear. The start of the second half at St Mary’s has been delayed because of a medical emergency in the stands. Following the alarming news from Vicarage Road earlier, we obviously wish whoever has taken ill at this game well too. Premier League: Everton fans are already heading for the Goodison Park exits as their side go two goals down against Liverpool. Ouch. find out what sent them back to the warmth of the pub with Scott Murray ... Premier League: Mason Mount puts Chelsea ahead against Watford in the delayed game at Vicarage Road. Teed up by Kai Havertz, Mount slots home to finish a well-worked move from the visitors after a poor collective start. Everton 0-1 Liverpool: After good work from Diogo Jota, Trent Alexander-Arnold arrows the ball towards the top corner from a pull-back. Jordan Pickford flies across his goal to put the ball out for a corner. Scottish Premiership: It’s Dundee 1-0 St Johnstone as they approach half-time at Dens Park. Daniel Mullen got the goal for the hosts. Premier League: Jordan Henderson opens the scoring for Liverpool before the 10-minute mark at Goodison Park. Read all about it with Scott Murray ... Aston Villa 0-0 Manchester City: Manchester City have had 88% possession after nine minutes of play at Villa Park. Everton 0-0 Liverpool: It’s a frantic start at Goodison Park, where Mo Salah brings a fine right-handed save out of the diving Jordan Pickford, who is wearing an alarming amount of hair gel.

You can follow the Merseyside derby with Scott Murray ... This, from the Watford Twitter account. Of course we echo their sentiments and wish the stricken fan all the very best. Scottish Premiership: Aberdeen go a goal up against Livingston in one of four top flight games being played in Scotland tonight. Ryan Hedges with the goal at Pittodrie. West Ham 1-0 Brighton: Jakub Moder picks up a wonderful pass from Neal Maupay but is thwarted by West Ham goalkeeper Lucasz Fabianski, who saves his low drive splendidly. Watford 0-0 Chelsea: After a 22-minute delay for a medical emergency in one of the stands, the players are back out for a brief warm-up. I have no further information on what exactly happened to prompt the delay but will bring any news as it comes in. Our thoughts are with whoever it was that required treatment. West Ham 1-0 Brighton: Adam Webster is the second Brighton player to have been forced off by injury in the first half of their game against West Ham. He’s replaced by Shane Duffy. Premier League: Che Adams has restored Southampton’s lead at St Mary’s, diving between defenders to head home a Nathan Redmond cross from the right. Wolves 0-0 Burnley: Adama Traore hits the bar with a shot on the counter as Wolves break upfield. Moments previously, Romain Saiss whacked the ball out of play for a corner, accidentally hitting an unfortunate female fan in the face. She has a bloody nose and her young child is in tears but it doesn’t seem too serious. The physios are behind the goal looking after her and hopefully she’ll be OK. Watford 0-0 Chelsea: Play has yet to resume at Vicarage Road, where there has been a medical emergency in the crowd. West Ham 1-0 Brighton: Vladimir Coufal crosses to the far post, Michail Antonio heads across the face of goal and Pablo Fornals thumps the ball off the cross-bar. It bounces down but doesn’t cross the line. Inches! Southampton 1-1 Leicester City: McCarthy does better this time, getting down at his right post to save from a James Maddison drive that looked to be going wide.

          "bodyText": "Former parliamentary staffers have urged the Morrison government and other political parties to quickly implement the recommendations of the landmark Jenkins review or face a fierce backlash from women at the ballot box. Chelsey Potter, a former Liberal party adviser, told Guardian Australia she would be contacting parliamentarians – not just coalition MPs – to push for immediate action because “there is no other workplace in our country where these findings would be tolerated”. “I’ve spoken to women in the building who say that, throughout this process, perpetrators and bullies still believe they’re untouchable – that it is all business as usual,” Potter said. “This is why we must implement these recommendations in full and to deadline. After a year in which this prime minister’s words have rarely married up with his actions, he has an opportunity to honour Brittany Higgins’ incredible advocacy. “Alongside others, I’ll be contacting MPs to push for immediate action. Any hesitation to act on women’s safety by the Morrison government, or any other party, will be noted at the ballot box. Women in our community are tired of excuses.” Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, on Tuesday recommended a significant overhaul of federal parliament’s toxic workplace culture after handing down her landmark report that found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed. The report calls for a new code of conduct for parliamentarians and their staff as part of normalising employment conventions. It says that code should address current legal requirements that prohibit bullying, sexual harassment, sexual assault and workplace discrimination. As part of structural reforms, Jenkins recommended the establishment of a new Office of Parliamentarian Staffing and Culture to provide centralised human resources support, including policy development, training, advice, support and education. It also recommended the creation of an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission “to ensure that there are independent and consistent responses to reports and complaints of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault” in parliamentary workplaces. The Jenkins inquiry into parliament’s workplace culture was triggered after Higgins, a former Liberal staffer, alleged she was raped by another staffer after hours in a ministerial office in March 2019. Higgins’ allegations are the subject of separate criminal proceedings. The man accused of raping her has pleaded not guilty and denies any form of sexual activity took place. Potter has alleged she was sexually assaulted by another colleague in Canberra while working for the Liberal frontbencher Simon Birmingham in 2015. She was a key advocate ahead of the Jenkins inquiry to ensure the review maintained a workable balance between confidentiality for submitters, and the preservation of staff rights to access key records held by their former employers. Higgins echoed the call for prompt implementation on Wednesday. She said the recommendations had been informed by “the accounts of people who have had the privilege of working in the heart of Australia’s democracy and this was the abysmal treatment they were subjected to”. “They aren’t radical recommendations,” Higgins said. “It’s simply about bringing parliament house in-line with every other workplace in the country. We should expect more of our leaders. It’s time they step up and set the standard.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Jenkins review found more than half the people (51%) currently working in parliament had experienced at least one incident of bullying, sexual harassment or actual or attempted sexual assault, while 77% had experienced, witnessed or heard about such behaviour. Only 11% of people who experienced sexual harassment in parliamentary workplaces reported it. Jenkins made it clear in the report she believed the first set of changes – including a statement of acknowledgment that people had endured terrible experiences in some parliamentary workplaces – could be implemented within six months. She said a realistic timetable for implementation of all the recommendations would be 12 to 18 months. Scott Morrison told parliament he looked forward to responding to the review through a multiparty process. He said Labor had responded to the report by saying it would carefully consider the recommendations, and consult with parliamentary staff as it prepared a response. Morrison said that approach was “appropriate”. He said the toxic culture identified by the report manifested in all political parties, and he said Jenkins had “done an outstanding job in identifying many of the drivers that have led to this behaviour”."

          "bodyText": "’Tis the season! For all of your Swiftie friends to find themselves in the top 5% of Taylor Swift fans worldwide, for Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo to loom large on your Instagram Stories, and for the Weeknd’s Blinding Lights to be named everyone’s song of the year for the second year in a row. Yes, ’tis the season for Spotify Wrapped: the streaming service’s festive display of user data, presenting listeners with their most-played songs, artists and albums of the year in shareable graphics. It’s an effective marketing scheme, Spotify leveraging its own user base to create buzz on its behalf. The platform itself presents it as an opportunity for sombre reflection, like the Queen’s speech: a prompt “to look back on the year” on the music that “helped us get through”. Some users take it in that spirit, taking stock and finalising their pandemic playlist for posterity. Others parade their stats like a badge of honour (“hours spent listening to Post Malone”). Either way, since it began in 2016, Wrapped has become as anticipated as Black Friday; a new tradition in corporate Christmas. This time last year it led to a 21% surge in downloads of Spotify’s mobile app as users rushed to share their numbers on social media. I say: bah humbug. As someone who used to spend hours painstakingly tending to her iTunes music library, who felt a gap in her Last.fm history like an archival omission, I am exactly the sort of pedant who should be all for Spotify Wrapped – and yet I find it banal and depressing. After 10 years as a Spotify subscriber, it’s my longest-ever relationship, and I’ve never considered giving it up. Nevertheless, every year, I get the sense of my listening habits becoming increasingly tightly wound – into six daily mixes: my six modes – and increasingly like everyone else’s. I don’t know whether it’s my own failure of initiative and imagination, or one of product design and the paradox of choice, but when I open up the app each morning I mostly go with Spotify’s flow: I listen to albums I’ve recently been listening to and artists I already know I like. If I’m feeling adventurous, I might try one that the algorithm has deemed to be similar. But more often I bang on my playlist – dating back to July 2017 – of 1,107 “liked songs” and listen to the most recent additions. (Lately: a destabilising one-two punch of the new one from Mitski and Every 1’s a Winner by Hot Chocolate.) And at the end of the year, Spotify packages it up and gives it back to me, Wrapped – like a present so obvious you have to pretend you’ve not got four of them already. Ah, Hot Chocolate! You shouldn’t have! Without denying our agency, I think we can routinely underestimate the influence of platform design on our decisions and behaviours. It has never been easier to expand our musical horizons – yet many of us, conspicuously, don’t. I see the flattening effect, that feedback loop, on display every year in Spotify Wrapped posts celebrating the same handful of artists and songs. I’m not being a snob – I was a late-in-life One Directioner – but often what Wrapped claims to uncover is obvious to the individual, and unedifying for their friends and followers. Sometimes the numbers are so sweeping or skewed as to be meaningless: Call Me Maybe was in my most-played songs last year because I wrote about its 10th anniversary, and this year there will be Blinding Lights again (the most-streamed song in the world in 2020), because I sometimes listen to it on single-song repeat to motivate me to meet a deadline. Neither are musical memories to cherish – but it’s this kind of functional engagement that Spotify recognises and, with Wrapped, rewards. The platform has already cemented music as a numbers game: witness how streaming-savvy Drake can have the biggest album in the world without any ubiquitous hits, and how global fan armies strategise to drive singles up the charts. Wrapped, likewise, presents listening to music in terms of scale: top five songs, top artists, top genres, total listening time, even which percentile of an artist’s fans you’re in. Is being in the top 1% a point of pride, or a mark of monomania? What is listening time really a measure of, anyway? As a marketing blog wrote approvingly of Wrapped: the “sense of competition and achievement” motivates people to use Spotify for longer. But I believe this gamification of music comes at the cost of opportunities for actually connecting over it – one of my lifelong pleasures. Mainstream as my tastes may be, I take great pleasure in debating with friends – in highly specific and sometimes alienating detail – questions like which is the funniest Wings song, how we’d reorder our favourite albums, what makes one outro or intro or guitar solo great and another self-indulgent. The last dinner I had with my family, we named songs that had whistle solos, parentheses in the title or – the greatest challenge of all – were made after 1998 and which my dad might possibly like. My most recent friendship was cemented when we found out that we had both once cried to Fight Night by Migos. The number of plays wouldn’t have told us nearly so much. Instead of starting conversations about our favourite music, Spotify Wrapped cuts them short, framing them in terms that mean very little and that stymie further discussion – Adele’s your number two? She’s my number three! Like so much of social media, it’s a broadcast claiming to be a dialogue. It makes me wistful for an earlier internet. Last.fm, the primary site of my music discovery through the mid- to late-2000s, was as much a community for people who loved music as it was a log of what we listened to. It connected me with strangers with similar taste, who gave me recommendations and asked for them back. By contrast, Spotify is flat, functional, siloed – even my friends are reduced to a fast-moving stream of “activity” that is rarely inviting (my ex listening to Chumbawamba again, and not even Tubthumping). I would love Spotify to show me the dusty corners of their libraries, to dig out the albums they know too well to tell me about. Instead, it makes a big festive show of stating the obvious. Wrapped is little more than free advertising for a company that even the UK government has condemned for not extending a fair share of its profits and power to artists. Wrapped isn’t even the most interesting data it keeps on you. Each December, Spotify has a rummage through its drawers for something it’s willing to part with, which relates to you on the most surface level – and presents it to you with a bow. I’m going to be sitting out Wrapped this year, like the Grinch listening to Every 1’s a Winner. All I really want for Christmas is a new playlist, made by a person."

          "bodyText": "When Hadi Karam*, a soft-spoken Syrian, decided to leave the war-stricken city of Raqqa, he knew the journey to Europe would be risky. What he had not factored in was how technology would be a stumbling block once he reached Greece. “I never thought Skype would be the problem,” says the young professional, recounting his family’s ordeal trying to contact asylum officers in the country. “You ring and ring and ring. Weeks and weeks go by, and there is never any answer.” Karam, his pregnant wife and son spent two months trying to cross the land border Syria shares with Turkey – a feat accomplished after nine attempts. Travelling to Rhodes from Turkey and on to the port of Piraeus took less than a week. But negotiating Greece’s labyrinthine bureaucracy to notify authorities of their desire to apply for asylum has taken the best part of a year. “When, finally, I did get through I was told I could go for my interview in March 2022,” Karam says. “Until then we’re stuck here with nothing to do but wait in the camp.” Yet, the family is also lucky. Last week, in keeping with its mantra of “tough but fair” migration policies, Athens’ centre-right government announced that asylum procedures for first-time applicants would only be permitted in state-run reception centres. Use of the communications app, it said, would be limited strictly to those whose applications have been rejected and want to appeal. “There are people who for years evade detection by never declaring themselves to authorities,” Marios Kaleas, the country’s top asylum-service official, says in an interview with the Guardian. “For purposes of control, of having a full picture of who is here and for national security and public order reasons, they have to be traced.” How long the registration process will take, or where the “specially designated” sites will be, has yet to be decided, he concedes. “We’re still discussing location, but what I do know is that there’ll be two centres, one in the north [of the mainland] and one in the south.” Although Greece has seen a dramatic drop in arrivals since 2015, when it was at the centre of a refugee crisis – with more than 800,000 people crossing the Aegean Sea – its proximity to Turkey still makes it a popular route for those in Africa, Asia and the Middle East fleeing war, poverty and persecution. On Monday, Athens’ migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, hailed the fall in numbers, saying new arrivals were 90% lower than in 2019. “We set ourselves a goal to change what was happening at entry points,” he told the nation’s public broadcaster, ERT. “From open structures like Moria, which shamed the country, we can now talk about closed, controlled structures, which provide decent living conditions,” he said, referring to the notoriously squalid open-air camp on Lesbos that was gutted by fires last year. On the back of such rhetoric, and with Europe hardening its stance towards refugees, aid workers worry that the abrupt policy change is aimed more at “controlling and containing” asylum seekers than making their lives easier. Corinne Linnecar, advocacy manager at Mobile Info Team, a Greece-based charity that has long assisted people with asylum requests, describes the measure as chaotic and ill-defined. “Delays in entering the asylum system were not due to people trying to evade the authorities but instead were a consequence of an inefficient system,” she says. “This policy change will only see more delays.” Under a lottery-like procedure first enforced eight years ago, those who arrive via the mainland, as well as Crete and Rhodes, have been required to use Skype to inform the Greek asylum service of their wish to apply for international protection. The pre-registration system, which does not apply to Lesbos and other frontline Aegean isles, was a necessary first step before applicants received an appointment to register their claim in person. But as Karam and thousands of others have discovered, the system, which offers 210 slots in 17 languages a week, was often a huge impediment to requests being made. A recent study by Mobile Info Team found, on average, people had still not reached an asylum officer through the app after 14 months. Without registration, asylum seekers remain invisible, unable to access healthcare and legal protections, with many attempting to move on in frustration, continuing their journeys into central Europe through the Balkans. “The Skype procedure as it stood was inhumane, forcing people to remain undocumented and destitute for many months and often years,” says Linnecar. Until the new reception centres are operational, refugees who had been unable to reach asylum officials through Skype will be “completely blocked” from entering the system, she says. “Temporarily preventing all access to the asylum procedure, limiting people’s freedoms and forcing them into prison-like structures is not the answer,” says Linnecar. “The only registration facilities ever known to Greece are akin to prisons; on the mainland, these facilities are completely closed meaning people cannot leave at all.” Officials at the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, also voiced concern, saying “basic questions” needed to be answered, including how people would be transferred to designated sites. “Ensuring prompt and efficient access to fair and efficient asylum procedures is key for the adequate protection of people in need of protection,” says Stella Nanou, the UNHCR spokesperson in Athens. The UNHCR has warned that as many as half a million Afghan refugees could head west after the fall of Kabul and the Taliban’s takeover. Last month, the International Monetary Fund echoed that prediction, citing the collapse of the country’s aid-reliant economy. Greece would be a main gateway to Europe. With an increase in sea patrols, amid accusations of pushbacks of asylum seekers, it is believed most would try to enter by the land border the country shares with Turkey in the northern Evros region. This year, for the first time since 2012, when a wall was erected along part of the frontier, asylum seekers using the route outnumbered those reaching Greece by boat, making the mainland the main point of entry. By 21 November, 3,568 newcomers had registered at Aegean outposts compared with 4,311 who had arrived through Evros, according to the UN agency. Kaleas, the asylum service director, accepts that it has not been easy for asylum seekers to lodge applications using Skype, saying: “They have to insist.” But he rejects reports that the policy change would involve men, women and children being transferred from the mainland to islands close to Turkey, where a further two highly fortified EU-funded reception centres were opened at the weekend. Rights groups have condemned the Aegean island camps as being tantamount to jails. “In no way are people going to be held like prisoners,” he says, insisting that if asylum seekers underwent reception and identification procedures rather than electing to become “ghosts” they would have access to welfare benefits. “As soon as they’ve undergone fingerprinting and been checked by Frontex [EU border agency] officials and the Hellenic police, they’ll be able to go. I don’t foresee the process taking long, but how long it will take, I cannot say.” * Name has been changed Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:"

          "bodyText": "House prices in the UK continued their upwards climb in November, reaching double-digit growth again as demand remained strong after the end of the stamp duty holiday and the furlough job support scheme. The average UK house price rose by 0.9% last month, according to data from the building society Nationwide, after an increase of 0.7% in October, taking the average UK property value to £252,687. Average house prices are 10% higher than a year earlier. House prices have risen to almost 15% above levels seen in March 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic first struck the UK, Nationwide said. The continuing rising prices appear to be in part down to a reduction in the supply of houses available to buyers. The October property market was the quietest for almost a decade, according to data from HM Revenue and Customs, as house sales were 28% lower in October than a year earlier after a record surge in activity earlier in 2021. Recent figures from the Bank of England showed the number of mortgages approved for UK house purchases fell in October to the lowest level in 16 months. “There have been some signs of cooling in housing market activity in recent months,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. He added this was “almost inevitable” after the stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland finished at the end of September, as buyers rushed to bring forward their purchases to take advantage of the tax break, which also made larger homes with bigger gardens more popular. “Activity has been extremely buoyant in 2021. The number of housing transactions so far this year has already exceeded the number recorded in 2020 with two months still to go and is actually tracking close to the number seen at the same stage in 2007, before the global financial crisis struck,” Gardner said. However, the outlook remained uncertain, he said. “It is unclear what impact the new Omicron variant will have on the wider economy.” Gardner added that the increase in the cost of living was having an impact on consumer sentiment, while the housing market might be cooled further by the prospect of a rise in interest rates. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said mortgage rates looked to be rising. Swap rates, which lenders use to price their loans, have increased, and profit margins on home loans were already “very tight by past standards”, he said. “Admittedly, the link between variations in mortgage rates and changes in house prices isn’t stable.” Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agent Knight Frank, said: “Gravity-defying price growth is the result of low interest rates and tight supply, which are both things we expect to reverse next year, putting downwards pressure on prices. Interest rates may rise more slowly if the new Omicron Covid-19 variant proves to be more serious than the early anecdotal evidence suggests.” The Omicron variant could also cool the property market, by making some homeowners decide to wait before putting their property up for sale. “The number of homes for sale coming on to the market is slowing, which is nudging prices steadily upwards,” said Jonathan Hopper, the chief executive of Garrington Property Finders. “Supply is set to be curtailed even further by the festive season and the new Covid variant, both of which are likely to prompt would-be sellers to hold off on listing their home until the new year. For now, the loss of momentum is gradual, and while we are starting to see some sellers rein in their pricing aspirations, in most areas things are calming down rather than going down.”"

          "bodyText": "There are statistics, and there are vignettes in Kate Jenkins’ review that trigger deep revulsion. “The MP sitting beside me leaned over. Also thinking he wanted to tell me something, I leaned in. He grabbed me and stuck his tongue down my throat. The others all laughed. It was revolting and humiliating.” Another person said there were aspiring male politicians “who thought nothing of, in one case, picking you up, kissing you on the lips, lifting you up, touching you, pats on the bottom, comments about appearance, you know, the usual. The point I make with that … was the culture allowed it, encouraged it.” Another: “Frequently, like at least every week, the advice was go and cry in the toilet so that nobody can see you, because that’s what it’s like up here.” Parliament is not the only Australian workplace where women, and some men, feel unsafe. There are plenty of toxic places, plenty of terrible stories. But there are distinctive characteristics of political life that supercharge some of the risks. The Jenkins review lists them. The role of power, gender inequality, a lack of accountability, a culture of entitlement and exclusion. I sit on the edge of this world. I have for more than two decades. Political reporters are in it, and out of it. The hours are long. We all work under high pressure. The occupational requirements are unforgiving. Perfection is a high bar, and I certainly don’t claim to clear it. But if any external agency assessed my own news bureau in the terms in which the sex discrimination commission has just reviewed the parliament, I would dig a large hole, clamber inside, and never get out again. I would be paralysed by shame and remorse. I would feel the clinical rebuke in my marrow. There would not be enough ways of saying sorry. A review like the one tabled on Tuesday should trigger deep institutional atonement (which was actually recommendation one of the Jenkins report: stop, take a beat, acknowledge the wrong). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The women who spoke to the human rights commission about their private humiliations, people who have spent years being angry, should not be the only ones weeping. The Australian parliament, the political class, the whole arse-covering, ego-driven apparatus, should care enough to grieve. It should care enough to want to be better. But almost immediately after the Jenkins review was made public, someone in the Senate made a noise that sounded for all the world like a dog growling when the Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie was on her feet asking a question. The growl (or growl-adjacent sound – the Liberal senator who made it later contested it was a growl while apologising “unreservedly” to Lambie for the interjection) wasn’t audible on the internal broadcast. But the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young and Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, heard it clearly, and said it came from the government side of the chamber. Both objected in the strongest possible terms. While the Senate did pause momentarily to consider this development, nobody confessed immediately to inappropriate growling, so the Senate moved on – because why would the Senate become paralysed by introspection? As the Jenkins review notes, politicians don’t have conventional employers to account to. They can growl while a woman is talking without being reported to the nonexistent human resources department, and later contest the precise nature of the sound while promising to be better. Tomorrow obviously. Being better always happens tomorrow, or possibly the next day. The house was also in a mood. The testosterone was so thick and so noxious the new Speaker, Andrew Wallace, must have felt at risk of choking. After an extended rhetorical maul – hackles raised, chests out, voices raised, like unruly teenagers on the verge of a schoolyard brawl, man toddlers separated by Perspex screens – Anthony Albanese branded Peter Dutton a “boofhead” and shouted at him to sit down while Dutton accused the Labor leader of having a “glass jaw”. Shortly after this inspiring interlude, Wallace reminded MPs the just-released Jenkins review had called for “respect”. “As I said in my first speech as Speaker, I don’t expect this place to be a monastical library, but the Australian public does not want to see this place descend into a political colosseum,” Wallace counselled. “There will be a lot of discussion over the next days and weeks over respect in this place and I would ask members, all members, to show that level of respect in this chamber as well.” Before question time, we had Scott Morrison in his courtyard, being appalled, yet also not surprised, about the culture depicted by the review. Morrison didn’t say anything terrible. It wasn’t like those excruciating weeks after the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins came forward with her allegation of sexual assault – an allegation that blew the lid right off the often dysfunctional and sometimes cruel enterprise of working in the belly of the political beast. Back then, every word the prime minister uttered was wrong. Tuesday’s words were better, but just like with the Higgins matter, Morrison was also flat out managing, massaging, shaping. The prime minister’s very obvious objective immediately on receipt of the report was to make sure that nobody concludes this grossness is a Coalition problem, or a government problem. This muck was everybody’s problem. Liberals, Nationals, Labor, Greens, journalists. The prime minister thought this crook culture had been around for a long time – certainly longer than he’d been in the parliament. Everyone had a role in the clean-up. Morrison is correct to say everyone has a role in the clean-up. We are all culpable in our own spheres for knowing about these things, or a version of these things, but moving too quickly past them. But the problem with everybody being responsible is it is too easy for no one to be responsible, particularly when the reform options get hard, and some of the proposed changes will be contentious. Jenkins has given the parliament a structure to work with when it comes to attacking the root causes of some of the problems. But the measure of success will be action – and prompt action. This review is a landmark, but plenty of landmarks gather dust. Going forward, Morrison needs to understand two things. The first is he is responsible for making this change. He is the prime minister who has to build the necessary consensus to get this done. This moment of reckoning has presented on his watch. The other thing Morrison needs to understand is we are watching. We owe it to the victims of this crook culture to go on watching. The prime minister will be judged by what he delivers."

          "headline": "Omicron Covid variant prompts nervous governments to impose travel curbs",
          "bodyText": "The Omicron variant of coronavirus has been detected in several more countries, prompting nervous governments to impose tough travel restrictions to try to keep it at bay while scientists race to establish how dangerous it might be. Joe Biden said on Monday that the variant was “a cause for concern, not for panic”. He urged Americans to get vaccinated – including with a booster shot – as soon as they were eligible, and to wear masks in public places. “Sooner or later we are going to see new cases of this new variant here in the United States and we’re going to have to face this new threat just as we have faced the ones that came before it,” Biden said, but he added that further travel bans were unlikely. As cases of the variant appeared from Hong Kong to Australia and Scotland to Sweden, several countries opted for caution. Japan, which has not yet detected any Omicron infections, said on Monday it was reimposing border controls. “We are taking the step as an emergency precaution to prevent a worst-case scenario,” said the prime minister, Fumio Kishida. In Israel, a ban on foreign arrivals took effect overnight, while Morocco said it would suspend all incoming flights for a fortnight. Australia said it would delay reopening its international borders by two weeks after reporting its first Omicron cases, and India enforced mandatory on-arrival testing for flyers from a dozen countries including South Africa and Britain. Scientists have said it could take weeks to determine the severity of Omicron, which was first identified in southern Africa, but its emergence has already sparked a wave of responses among governments concerned that it could hinder economic recovery. The EU is expected to hold a summit on the situation at the end of this week or early next week, according to senior officials, in an effort to hammer out a common approach on several issues, including booster vaccine doses. Despite warnings that border closures can have limited effect and wreak havoc on lives, livelihoods and economies, countries opting to impose tighter travel curbs argued that the restrictions would provide valuable time to analyse the variant. Prof Salim Abdool Karim, a South African infectious diseases expert, said Omicron appeared to be more transmissible, including among vaccinated people, but that it was too early to say whether it was more virulent. Several experts have suggested the new variant may be more contagious, but may produce milder symptoms. South Africa has strongly criticised the restrictions that a growing number of countries have placed on travel from the region. President Cyril Ramaphosa said it was being unfairly punished for detecting the variant early. In a speech on Sunday night that was well received across the domestic political spectrum, Ramaphosa described the bans imposed by the UK and other governments as “not informed by science, nor effective in preventing the spread of this variant”. He said they would only serve to “further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to, and recover from, the pandemic”, adding that they went against promises made by G20 nations in Rome last month. Ramaphosa announced that South Africa would not move into a stricter lockdown, but the government would explore ways to make vaccines mandatory. “Government has set up a task team that will undertake broad consultations on making vaccination mandatory for specific activities and locations,” he said. South Africa and Botswana have fully vaccinated less than 25% of their populations. Omicron cases in Europe had already been reported in Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands before Portugal identified 13 infections among members of the professional football team Belenenses. One had recently travelled to South Africa. Dutch authorities said they had found another case, bringing the country’s total to 14 – all among 61 passengers who tested positive for coronavirus out of 621 on two flights that arrived in Amsterdam from South Africa on Friday. Poland said on Monday it would ban flights to seven African countries, extend quarantines for some travellers, and further limit numbers allowed into places such as restaurants amid concerns over the new variant. “We must appreciate the importance of this phenomenon and the risk that a new mutation emerging poses,” said the health minister, Adam Niedzielski, adding that Omicron was “a potential game changer”. The World Health Organization said any surge in cases could have severe consequences but noted that no deaths linked to Omicron had yet been reported. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the situation remained “perilous and precarious”. The UN agency urged its 194 member states to accelerate the vaccination of high-priority groups. “Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,” it said. “The overall global risk related to the new variant … is assessed as very high.” Some countries, however, were more relaxed. New Zealand said it would restrict travel from nine southern African nations, but insisted it would press ahead with plans to reopen internally after months of shutdown. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she did not anticipate any further restrictions and that bars, restaurants and gyms in Auckland could reopen, ending a coronavirus lockdown that began in August. “We’ve come through the past two years of Covid in better shape than nearly anywhere in the world,” Ardern said, pointing to low death rates, a growing economy and high vaccination rates."

          "headline": "‘Kill the viability’: big batteries to lose out from electricity grid rule change",
          "bodyText": "Tesla, Snowy Hydro and other big suppliers of storage capacity on Australia’s main electricity grid warn proposed rule changes amount to a tax on their operations that will deter investors and slow the decarbonisation of the industry. The Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) will release its final decision this Thursday on new rules for integrating batteries, pumped hydro and other forms of storage. The AEMC’s draft decision, released in July, angered many firms because it proposed charging storage providers for drawing power, ignoring a recommendation by the Australian Electricity Market Operator (AEMO) that they be exempt. Battery maker Tesla, which has supplied some of the largest storage to the National Electricity Market, said in a submission that the charges would “kill the commercial viability of all grid storage projects, causing inefficient investment in alternative network”, with consumers paying higher costs. Snowy Hydro, which is building the giant Snowy 2 pumped storage project and already operates a smaller one, said in its submission the proposed changes if implemented would jeopardise investment. “This is a major policy change, amounting to a tax on infrastructure critical to achieving a renewable future,” Snowy Hydro said. AEMO itself argued it was important storage providers were not “disincentivised from connecting to the transmission network, as they generally provide a net benefit to the power system by charging at periods of low demand”. Australia’s electricity grid faces economic and engineering challenges as it adjusts to the arrival of lower cost and also lower carbon alternatives to fossil fuels. While rule changes are necessary to account for operators that can both draw from and supply power, how they are implemented can have long-lasting effects on the technologies that get encouraged or repelled, independent experts say. “It doesn’t have to be this way,” said Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre. “In Britain, the regulator dealing with the same issues has said that storage devices don’t pay the system charges when they withdraw electricity from the grid,” he said. The prospect that storage operators will have to pay transmission charges could “drastically” affect their profitability since their business models rely on the difference between the price their pay for power and how much they can sell it for. Gas generators and network monopolies would benefit from the change, Mountain said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning An AEMC spokesperson said the commission had consulted widely, including from those who objected to the payment for transmission access. “The market is moving towards a future that will be increasingly reliant on energy storage to firm up the growing volume of renewable energy and deliver on the increasing need for critical system security services as the ageing fleet of thermal generators retire,” the spokesperson said, declining to elaborate on the final ruling before it is published. “The regulatory framework needs to facilitate this transition as the energy sector continues to decarbonise,” the official said. AusNet, which operates the Victorian energy transmission grid, said that while “technological neutrality is paramount for battery and hybrid unit connections to both the distribution and transmission networks,” it did not back charging storage access to networks in all cases. “[Ausnet] supports a clear exemptions framework for energy storage providers,” a spokesperson said. “We recommend that batteries and other hybrid facilities should have transmission use of system charges waived if they provide a net benefit to network customers.” We are not aware of anyone that supports the charging storage access to networks in all circumstances. “Batteries and hybrid facilities that consume energy from the network should be provided no preferential treatment relative to other customers and generators.” Jonathan Upson, a principal at Strategic Renewable Consulting, though, said the AEMC wants electricity flowing through batteries to be taxed twice to pay network charges – once when the electricity charges the battery and then again when the same electricity is sent out by the battery an hour or two later but this time with customers paying. “The AEMC’s draft decision has the identical rationale for eliminating franking credits on all dividends, resulting in double taxing of company profits,” he said. Christiaan Zuur, director of energy transformation at the Clean Energy Council, said that while much of AEMC’s draft proposal was constructive, “those benefits are either nullified or maybe even outweighed” by uncertainty over charges. “Risk perception” will be important since potential newcomers won’t be sure of what charges they will pay to connect to the grid and existing operators could have their connection agreements reopened, Zuur said. “Investors focus on the potential risk. It does factor through to the integral costs for projects,” he said. The outcome of new charges may prompt more people to put batteries on their premises and draw power from their own solar panels, Mountain said, cutting their reliance on a centralised network. “Ironically, it encourages customers to depend less and less on the grid,” he said. “It’s almost like the capture of the dominant interests playing out over time at their own expense.” Separately, the latest edition of the Clean Energy Council Confidence Index shows leadership by state governments is helping to shore up investor appetite for investing in renewable energy even with higher 2030 emissions reduction goals from the federal government. Overall, investor confidence increased by a point in the last six months – from 6.3 to 7.3 out of 10 – following strong commitments and policy development from state governments, particularly on the east coast, the council said. “The results of this latest survey illustrate the economic value in policy that lowers the emissions footprint of our electricity generation, supporting regional centres and creating jobs. Investors recognise the opportunities created by limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees,” said council chief executive Kane Thornton. Among the states, NSW, Victoria and Queensland led in terms of positive investor sentiment. • This article was amended on 30 November 2021. An earlier version stated Ausnet supported charging storage providers for network access. A spokesperson said it backed a waiver on charges if certain conditions were met."

          "headline": "English universities risk breaking law over offer withdrawals, say ministers",
          "bodyText": "Universities in England risk breaking competition laws if they add loopholes letting them withdraw offers from students at the last minute if courses are oversubscribed, ministers and regulators have told vice-chancellors. For the last two years, the surge in A-level grades allowed more students than forecast to meet their offer targets, and some universities withdrew offers when it became clear that courses would be oversubscribed. In a concerted push by the government, the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), universities have been told to remove the oversubscription clauses from their offers or face possible punishments from the regulators. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, told vice-chancellors that it was “vital” that their offers were fair as an incentive for hardworking students to attain their grades. “It is therefore disappointing that, during previous admissions cycles, there have been instances of providers introducing oversubscription conditions that permitted them to withdraw places where the number of students meeting offer conditions exceeded the number of places,” Donelan said in a letter sent to all vice-chancellors in England. The OfS said it was “concerned” that higher education institutions had added the oversubscription clauses to their contracts with students. “Our view is that providers should not use such clauses, as doing so would probably contravene consumer law,” the OfS stated. “A potential breach in consumer law may prompt the OfS to investigate and, if appropriate, carry out enforcement action to address any failures to comply.” The CMA, which regulates universities for possible breaches of competition law, reiterated its view that the offer and acceptance of a university place was effectively a legally binding contract, with the university obliged to reserve a place providing the student met specific entry requirements such as A-level grades. A clause allowing wide discretion to cancel an accepted offer “is likely to be unfair under ‘unfair terms’ legislation”, the CMA said. Similar clauses that would limit the liability of a university if it fails to provide qualified students with a place “are inappropriate and potentially unfair”. Universities UK, which represents the leadership of major institutions, said decisions on admissions were a key area of university autonomy, and that institutions were “well aware of their legal obligations under consumer law and strive to ensure these are met”. University leaders say they have been forced to withdraw places or offer incentives for students to change courses or delay their study because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic, especially the government’s decision to cancel formal exams and use teacher-assessed grades instead. That led to a much higher number of top grades awarded than admissions offices had forecast. Donelan also welcomed efforts by Universities UK and GuildHE to draw up a new sector-wide code of practice for admissions. But she also urged universities to reject the use of “conditional-unconditional” offers, which give students a guaranteed place in return for immediately rejecting all their other choices. During the pandemic, the OfS placed a temporary ban on the use of these offers, which expired in September. Donelan said she would “strongly encourage” universities to continue “avoiding the use of conditional-unconditional offers and other practices which may place undue pressure on students to make choices”."

          "headline": "Jorginho spot on as Chelsea fight back for point against Manchester United",
          "bodyText": "It was a day when Manchester United defended in numbers, when they sacrificed all attacking ambition in pursuit of something – anything – to stop a rot that had claimed the former manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, and sent their Premier League season into meltdown. It was a long way from pretty but, watched from afar by Ralf Rangnick – the manager who is set to step in until the end of the season – the team got what they wanted. Michael Carrick, the interim to the interim, had started with Scott McTominay, Nemanja Matic and Fred in front of the back four and, with United entrenched in the deepest of blocks, it felt like a trick of the mind when Jadon Sancho suddenly streaked clear to put them in front at the start of the second half. The goal followed a terrible piece of control by Jorginho on halfway after Bruno Fernandes had punted clear and, briefly, an outlandish thought formed. It had looked as if United simply wanted to avoid another humiliation after those against Liverpool and Manchester City – the other title contenders – that had in effect done for Solskjær. Could they steal victory? Jorginho would disabuse them of the notion, atoning in part for his lapse when he converted from the penalty spot after Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s silly foul on Thiago Silva, and his goal was the prompt for a grandstand finish. Chelsea appeared addicted to living dangerously and they almost threw it away in the 88th minute when Édouard Mendy played a pass straight to Fred. The midfielder was entitled to go for the chip but he got it all wrong and Mendy collected. Thomas Tuchel had felt the frustration build, mainly because of his team’s profligacy, with Callum Hudson-Odoi and Timo Werner most culpable. He lost his cool when Cristiano Ronaldo, involved only as a 64th-minute substitute, wrongly avoided an offside flag to win a last-gasp corner. Tuchel was booked for his complaints. But the Chelsea manager was on his knees in the final seconds when Antonio Rüdiger blew the chance to win it. Ronaldo had failed to follow the run of Christian Pulisic, another substitute, and when he crossed Rüdiger was free just outside the six-yard box. He blazed high over the bar. And so Chelsea, who had entered with nine wins and a draw in 10 matches, felt the stab of regret. Their lead at the top of the table is down to one point and they have to hope that the two dropped here do not return to haunt them. The pattern of the game was consistent from start to finish, Chelsea hogging the ball and pressing on to the front foot, United defending desperately and trying to get something going on the counter. Chelsea bossed the shot count 24-3 and David de Gea, the United goalkeeper, said he felt “danger for nearly the whole game”. It was easy to wonder whether Rangnick had influenced the selection, which saw Carrick double down in midfield, using three screening players. Perhaps it was a reaction to being without three of the first-choice back four – Harry Maguire, Raphaël Varane and Luke Shaw – and it was always going to invite pressure. Chelsea started brightly, with Hakim Ziyech shooting at De Gea after being allowed to turn too easily inside the box and a big chance followed shortly afterwards. When Marcos Alonso headed back a high ball, Wan-Bissaka got himself into a tangle and Hudson-Odoi moved inside Victor Lindelöf. De Gea turned the winger’s shot past the far post. Where would United be this season without him? Chelsea were aggressive with their press, despite being without the injured N’Golo Kanté, but they were unable to create much more of note in the first half. A blast from Rüdiger on 31 minutes that rattled the crossbar stood out; it was unclear whether De Gea had brushed the ball with his fingertips. Carrick had insisted Ronaldo’s reaction to being named among the substitutes was “great” and that it was simply a cold-headed selection decision which did not “need any more drama than that”. All the best with that, Michael. He recalled Fernandes and played him as a false nine, demanding that the Portuguese led the press with intensity, which he tried to do. Fernandes was more visible in deeper areas and it was not his day. On 36 minutes he popped up at left-back and tried to ping a crossfield pass only to send it straight to Hudson-Odoi, who was five yards outside the area. Hudson-Odoi advanced but he could not muster power in the shot. United offered precious little as an attacking force before the interval and they seemed perfectly happy with 0-0, musing that maybe they could nick something on the counter. Then they did. Jorginho had been the last man back and he did not bother to chase Sancho after his aberration. He knew what was coming. Sancho used Marcus Rashford to his left as a decoy, shook his hips and rolled past Mendy. United flickered on the break and Chelsea’s anxiety rose, particularly as Werner shot wildly when in space after a corner. Chelsea needed a break and they got one when Wan-Bissaka went through Silva as he attempted to clear another corner. Werner, Ziyech and Ruben Loftus-Cheek would have half-chances and, after Fred failed to beat Mendy, Rüdiger’s sights were awry at the very last."

          "headline": "Butlin’s owner gears up to auction off fabled holiday camp chain",
          "bodyText": "Butlin’s is poised to be sold off next year, potentially triggering a bidding war for the famous holiday camp brand, which has benefited recently from the staycation trend driven by the pandemic. US private equity giant Blackstone, which owns the majority of Butlin’s parent company, Bourne Leisure, is understood to have already selected investment bankers to conduct an auction next year. It comes as the travel industry reacts to the impact of the new Omicron Covid-19 variant, which could trigger a fresh wave of demand for UK holidays that do not involve the costly PCR tests, paperwork and a potential requirement to self-isolate upon return from abroad. Butlin’s was established 85 years ago by Billy Butlin, who had visited Barry Island in Wales and “felt sorry for families staying in drab guest houses with nothing much to do”. Butlin set up his first park in Skegness, Lincolnshire, in 1936 with the aim of creating a new type of seaside break, which would provide a range of activities and entertainment. That resort still trades today, along with two others at Bognor Regis in West Sussex and Minehead in Somerset. At one point there were nine camps, seven hotels and even a Butlin’s in the Bahamas. A camp on Barry Island opened in 1966 but closed 30 years later. For decades Butlin’s was famous – or notorious - for competitions to find the holidaymaker with the knobbliest knees or most glamorous grandmothers. It struggled with a downmarket image, and was widely lampooned. However, in recent years it has been trying to position itself as a rival to the likes of Center Parcs, with millions of pounds invested in new features such as pool complexes and improved accommodation, alongside moves into new markets such as live music weekends for fans and a bigger push into conferences and events. The decision to look at selling off Butlin’s comes less than a year after a majority stake in Bourne Leisure, which also owns Warner Leisure Hotels and Haven Holidays, was acquired by Blackstone for about £3bn. It is thought that Bourne Leisure and Blackstone have concluded that Butlin’s is “non-core” to their future objectives. Some analysts had predicted the move for some time. Bourne Leisure’s accounts for 2020 show the firm slumped to a £151m pre-tax loss, compared with a profit of £145m in 2019. The accounts stated: “The group, like many others, has been affected by the impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on the UK’s economy, mainly through the short-term closures of some of our sites.” The three resorts reopened their doors in May this year, and Butlin’s recently announced that its summer 2022 lineup would include the likes of dance group Diversity. The company’s accounts also said that during 2020 it refunded site fees to its owners during the lockdowns, and offered its holidaymakers cash refunds for any cancelled breaks. It is thought that investment bank Rothschild has been retained by Bourne Leisure and Blackstone to oversee the sale, which could prompt bids from rivals in the leisure sector. Bourne Leisure and Blackstone both declined to comment."

          "headline": "How will post-Covid Britain look? For many, like it did in the brutal 19th century",
          "bodyText": "In December 2019, Boris Johnson was electioneering in Salisbury, where he visited a butcher’s shop and local military veterans’ centre. The same city is also the home of the Trussell Trust, which runs the UK’s largest network of food banks – and Johnson was asked whether anything in the Conservative party’s manifesto might reduce the need for the kind of help it provides. He answered in the affirmative, claiming that helping people with living costs was a personal “crusade”, paying tribute to “everybody who gets involved with running food banks”, but also insisting that “it is wrong that people should be dependent on them”. He then mentioned “cutting national insurance for everyone”, before his punchline: “It is imperative in my view that the next government, if I’m lucky enough to be leading it, tackles the cost of living for everybody in this country. That’s what we’re going to do.” Then as now, words just tumbled out of his mouth. We all know what happened to the national insurance promise, and if Johnson and his ministers had any credible intention of reducing living costs, any such hope has now been quashed. Instead we’ve had soaring energy bills, higher inflation and the cruel end of the £20-a-week universal credit “uplift” – partially mitigated via changes in the budget aimed at people in employment, but still a grim reality for the 3.4 million people on that benefit who are not in work. But as worry spreads about the so-called Omicron variant of Covid, what millions of people face this winter is also part of another story. Three months after Johnson’s visit to Salisbury, the first lockdown saw an inspirational explosion of “mutual aid” and all those tributes to low-paid key workers – both of which, from an optimistic perspective, suggested public attitudes towards poverty and insecurity somewhat different from the mixture of indifference and old-fashioned moralism that we are often told form the views of a majority (“silent” or otherwise). For the briefest of moments, it felt as if the dawning realisation that being poor made people much more likely to suffer Covid-19’s worst effects might prompt at least the first stirrings of a political watershed. The footballer Marcus Rashford began campaigning on so-called “holiday hunger” in the summer of 2020, and not only forced two government U-turns, but breached the walls of daytime TV and the rightwing press. But now normal service seems to have been resumed. Whatever fantasies are still being entertained about “building back better”, we are facing the latest stage of the Covid crisis in an even worse social state than when the whole thing began. Last Wednesday, the Trussell Trust released figures showing that although its provision of food parcels had come down from its peak in 2020, the latest figure is 11% higher than it was at the same point in 2019. Over the ensuing two years, the number of food parcels it supplies for children has increased at double the rate for adults. In the six months to the end of September, its staff and volunteers provided around 5,000 parcels each day, and the trust expects that figure to rise to 7,000 by Christmas. “Food banks in our network continue to see more and more people facing destitution,” said its chief executive, Emma Revie. A few days ago, I spoke to people in charge of a handful of food banks, advice services and community organisations. The cut to universal credit, they told me, was causing gradually rising hunger, and there was a deep sense of foreboding about rising fuel prices. Moreover, things were much more difficult because grants from central government to food banks ceased in April, and the kind of ad hoc help symbolised by the £500m household support fund (hastily created by the government when anger about the universal credit cut was peaking, and somewhat optimistically intended as a one-off source of help “during the final stages of economic recovery”) was simply insufficient. “It looks like a lot of money on paper, but it’s going to go in an instant,” one chief executive of a food charity told me. In Somerset, my local food bank is part of an organisation called Fair Frome. When I spoke to the people in charge, they said that compared to October, need already seems to be up by around a third. Help from the public, I was told, is as generous as ever: “If we do a shout-out for food, it arrives.” New volunteers came aboard at the height of the pandemic, and have stayed. But they are endlessly dealing with the symptoms of very familiar problems, such as poorly paid work (around 40% of the people who need food parcels have jobs), and a paucity of affordable rented housing. The upshot? “This winter is going to be a nightmare for a lot of people.” The Bonny Downs Community Association does its work in the East Ham area of the London borough of Newham. Its chair, David Mann, told me that the end of the benefits “uplift” had pushed many of the people it helps into borrowing money, “but that’s unsustainable, and our team are bracing themselves for a crisis period after Christmas, when people will run out of stopgaps”. Because of the rise in fuel costs, he said, “landlords are now demanding an increase of about £100 a month, which most people can’t pay”. One woman his people were helping, he went on, was currently living in a converted shed owned by a rogue landlord, with a monthly rent of £850, which left her with about £15 a month to cover basic expenses such as food and clothes. “With the cut in universal credit,” Mann said, “she won’t be able to cover her rent, and she’ll have no money for food, let alone clothing or transport fares.” He also talked about people victimised by the asylum and immigration system who had no access to any help from the state at all, and many services the association provides that were now completely overstretched: “Our debt advice centre is at capacity and we’ve had to stop taking bookings for the rest of this year.” Five years after the 2016 referendum, there is a common view of Britain and its ruling politicians being stuck in the past. We tend to think of that condition in terms of Brexity nostalgia and faux-imperial arrogance, but the most appalling example of that failure to leave history behind is surely the return of a kind of poverty that often feels like some awful echo of the 19th century. Amid all the news about food banks, one recent story made that point with a vividness worthy of a Dickens novel. Last Monday, only 13 or so miles from East Ham, Johnson entertained donors at the Conservatives’ fundraising winter party, held in the grimly appropriate setting of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Partygoers had paid more than £1,000 for their tickets, and were treated to an auction, at which £22,000 was successfully bid for a “karaoke session” with Liz Truss, and a game of cricket with Rishi Sunak came in at £35,000. Here, in a different universe from the one in which people go hungry, lies one reason why Johnson’s idea of “everybody in this country” is nothing of the kind, and why poverty and everything that comes with it are being not just tolerated, but actively increased – even after all the horrors we have been through.

          "bodyText": "As Covid restrictions continue, many families with relatives abroad will be prevented from giving presents in person again this Christmas and, instead, have to send them through the post. As this is Britain’s first post-Brexit Christmas, the rules for sending items to the EU have changed, and you now need to state the value of what you are sending. Then you can look for the best-priced option – and also make sure the goods are not prohibited from the post. Posting to the EU If you are sending something from England, Scotland and Wales you need to fill out and attach a customs declaration form to your package. Anyone posting from Northern Ireland does not. These forms are for local customs authorities in the country to which you are posting the item to make sure the goods are allowed in and to calculate if there are duties and taxes to be paid. They explain what is in the package – a gift, document or a returned item, for example – as well as an exact description of what it is and the quantity, weight and value. Different forms are needed depending on whether the item is valued at over or under £270. Taxes, duties and a clearance fee may be due and depend on the value of what is being sent. Gifts from Britain valued at less than €45 (£38) are exempt from VAT or other charges. Customs charges for each country vary and are set by the authorities there. For example, VAT in Austria and Bulgaria is 20%, while in Greece it is 24% and Hungary 27%. Postage costs There are numerous companies to choose from when posting abroad, from Royal Mail to many courier companies, all with varying prices. How much it costs depends on weight and size of your parcel, its destination and how quickly you want it to arrive. The MoneySavingExpert website says the weight of the package is the most important factor. For items of less than 1kg, using Royal Mail usually works out the cheapest, it says, and heavier packages typically get cheaper quotes from courier firms such as Hermes, UPS, TNT and DPD. For example, the cheapest option for sending an 800g package to France with Royal Mail is £9.50 while a courier (Hermes in this case) is £13.16, according to the ParcelHero comparison site. But if you send a 4kg package to France from the UK, the price is £19.72 via DPD, much less than the £32.88 quoted by Parcelforce Worldwide, which is part of Royal Mail. There are a number of comparison sites where you can enter the weight and dimensions of your item and where it is going, which will them prompt prices from some of the main courier firms. ParcelHero, My Parcel Delivery and Worldwide Parcel Services all compare couriers. MoneySavingExpert also highlights the fact that if you are buying a gift from an online retailer, it is almost always cheaper to get the company to send it directly to the recipient, rather than you getting the item and sending it on. It can even be free, as going over a certain threshold, such as £50, often prompts free delivery. For example, sending a present of a Pictionary board game through House of Fraser to Ireland will cost an additional £5.83 in shipping costs. But if you buy the game and do it yourself, according to quotes from ParcelHero, the cheapest option is £12.64. What cannot be sent? It is common sense that some items will be banned or restricted from the post – drugs, guns and fake currency are all unsurprisingly on the list from the Post Office. The lists are supposed to prevent customers sending hazardous, illegal or fragile substances, or lodging large claims for lost valuables. Couriers reserve the right to refuse to carry such items or, if they discover the contents of a parcel are illegal or unsafe, to destroy them. However, there are some less likely items. Aerosols, such as deodorant, cannot be sent in international mail, nor can lottery tickets, flowers, fresh fruit and vegetables. Some items can be sent within the UK, such as small bottles of gin and nail varnish, but not abroad. Observer readers have been baffled in the past to find goods such as confectionery, designer shoes or photos banned by some courier companies. The Post Office tells customers that everyday items such as aerosols and perfumes are considered dangerous under travel legislation, and says it is up to the consumer to check whether or not an item is prohibited, or restricted. Getting it there in one piece Citizens Advice last week called for the communications regulator, Ofcom, to issue fines to parcel companies which negligently failed to deliver packages in the UK. The call came after the charity announced a league table of all of such companies. It found none of the leading delivery firms rated highly in terms of customer service, with significant problems in getting problems resolved. “While this should be a wake-up call for firms to strive to deliver a five-star service for consumers, we have serious reservations about how far they will improve if left to their own devices,” says Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty. “Our findings show it’s time for Ofcom to come forward and introduce tougher rules across the board.” The charity advised consumers to check the reviews of companies to find out how they dealt with complaints and refunds. Discounts site Wethrift advises people sending abroad to use secure packaging, including bubble wrap and heavy cardboard boxes, as they will be passing through, at the very least, conveyor belts in two transport depots."

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has announced that arrivals to the UK have to take a PCR test by the second day of their arrival and self-isolate until they have a negative result after the first two cases of the new variant were reported in Nottingham and Essex. Face coverings will also become compulsory in shops and on public transport in the UK from next week. Israel is to ban the entry of visitors from all countries due to the Omicron variant, Reuters reports. The country’s government will also reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology for contact testing in order to contain the spread of the new strain. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have begun urgent testing after two people who arrived on a flight from southern Africa overnight tested positive to the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Australia imposed new restrictions on Saturday on people who have been to nine southern African countries. Some of the 61 Covid-19 cases detected among a group of passengers that arrived in the Netherlands from South Africa this week are likely to be the Omicron variant, health authorities said. Two people with the new variant entered Germany at Munich airport on 24 November, before South Africa was designated a virus variant area and were now isolating, Bavaria’s health ministry said. Earlier, officials in the western state of Hesse, home to Frankfurt airport, said a suspected case of the Omicron variant had been found in a passenger arriving from South Africa. A case of the Omicron variant has been detected in Italy, Reuters reports. The genome was sequenced at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergency Diagnostics of the Sacco Hospital in Milan from a positive sample of a patient coming from Mozambique. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he “would not be surprised” if the Omicron variant was already in the US. The US has praised South Africa for quickly identifying the new Covid strain and sharing the information with other countries, AFP reports. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke to South Africa’s international relations and cooperation minister, Naledi Pandor, and they discussed cooperation on vaccinating people in Africa against Covid-19, the state department said. “Secretary Blinken specifically praised South Africa’s scientists for the quick identification of the Omicron variant and South Africa’s government for its transparency in sharing this information, which should serve as a model for the world,” the statement said. The introduction of compulsory PCR tests for Covid-19 for everyone arriving in the UK has been described as a “huge blow” for the travel industry. Abta, a trade association for tour operators and travel agents in the UK, said the added cost of testing for all arrivals to the UK will have an impact on customer demand for holidays, adding pressure to an industry which has been among the “hardest hit” during the pandemic. Without a negative result, people will have to self-isolate for 10 days. “While Abta understands that this is a rapidly evolving situation and public health must come first, the decision to require all arrivals to take a PCR test and self-isolate until a negative result is returned is a huge blow for travel businesses, many of whom were only just starting to get back on their feet after 20 months of severe restrictions,” an Abta spokesman said. “These changes will add cost to people’s holidays, which will undoubtedly impact consumer demand and hold back the industry’s recovery, so it’s vital that this decision is kept under careful review and restrictions are lifted promptly if it becomes clear there is not a risk to the UK vaccination programme. “The government must also now consider offering tailored support for travel businesses, which have been amongst the hardest hit during the pandemic.” A football game in Portugal’s top divison was abandoned in the second-half after a Covid outbreak forced Belenenses to start the match with Benfica with just nine men, two of them goalkeepers. Instead of postponing the game when news emerged that 14 players and three staff members had tested positive, Portuguese league authorities sanctioned it going ahead due to both clubs still being able to field the minimum required seven players. Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa recommended on Saturday that travel restrictions be widened to include Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia due to the Omicron variant. The recommendation comes a day after Brazil shut its borders to travelers arriving from South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, Reuters reports. The Anvisa recommendation will need to be implemented by the government, as the regulator does not have the authority to enforce such travel restrictions. Health officials in New South Wales, Australia, have begun urgent testing after two people who arrived on a flight from southern Africa overnight tested positive to the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Australia imposed new restrictions on Saturday on people who have been to nine southern African countries, as the new Omicron variant raises concerns about another wave of the pandemic, Reuters reports. “Urgent genomic sequencing is underway to determine if they have been infected by the new omicron … variant of concern,” the health department of New South Wales said in a release. The passengers arrived in Sydney on Saturday evening and were transported to a hotel for 14 days of quarantine. Other passengers on the flight may be considered close contacts and will need to get tested immediately and isolate for 14 days, and compliance checks will be undertaken, NSW Health said. Brazil reported 229 new Covid-19 deaths and 9,233 additional cases, according to data released by the health ministry on Saturday. In total, Brazil has registered 614,186 deaths due to Covid-19, the world’s second highest death toll behind the US, Reuters reports. Brazil reported 229 new Covid-19 deaths and 9,233 additional cases, according to data released by the health ministry on Saturday. In total, Brazil has registered 614,186 deaths due to Covid-19, the world’s second highest death toll behind the US, Reuters reports. Switzerland has widened quarantine requirements to stem the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant to travellers arriving from Britain, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Egypt and Malawi, where cases have been detected, its health ministry said. On Friday, Switzerland banned direct flights from South Africa and the surrounding region due to the detection of the new variant while also imposing restrictions on travel from other countries including Hong Kong, Israel and Belgium. Entry from those countries would only be possible for Swiss citizens or those with a residence permit in Switzerland or the broader Schengen area, Reuters reports. It did not state whether travel from those countries would be limited to Swiss citizens and residents or not. Israel is to ban the entry of visitors from all countries due to the Omicron variant, Reuters reports. The country’s government will also reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology for contact testing in order to contain the spread of the new strain. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that the ban, pending government approval, would last 14 days. Israel, the first country to shut its borders completely over the Omicron variant, has so far confirmed one case of the variant and seven other suspected cases. Bahrain has banned entry to travellers from four more African states over the spread of Covid-19, the state news agency BNA reported. The four additional countries are Malawi, Mozambique, Angola and Zambia, Reuters reports. The ban excludes Bahraini citizens and those with Bahraini residency visa holders, it said. Bahrain on Friday banned entry to travellers from South Africa and five other southern African nations. The Barbarians have claimed a decision by Public Health England led to their rugby fixture against Samoa at Twickenham being called off 90 minutes before kick-off despite their having enough players who had returned negative tests. A statement released by the Rugby Football Union revealed that four players and two members of staff from the invitational side had tested positive for Covid-19. The scrapping of the game followed last year’s fixture against England being called off after 13 players broke the Covid protocols, leading to widespread condemnation of the players’ behaviour. Boris Johnson has been accused of ignoring a senior official’s plan to prepare Britain for the emergence of vaccine-resistant Covid variants, the Observer can reveal. With the government announcing on Saturday that the first UK cases of the Omicron variant had been detected, the former head of the government’s vaccine taskforce said he could see no evidence that his blueprint for tackling the most worrying variants – submitted in the spring – had been acted upon. In an interview with the Observer, Clive Dix, a leading figure in drug development who chaired the taskforce until April, said that he believed the UK was no longer “on the front foot” in tackling the pandemic. “I wrote a very specific proposal on what we should put in place right now for the emergence of any new virus that escaped the vaccine,” he said. “That was written and handed into the [vaccine taskforce] at the end of April when I left. I haven’t seen a sign of any of those activities yet.” In response, a government spokesperson said: “This past year we’ve witnessed unprecedented scientific innovations and breakthroughs, made possible by collaboration between medical experts, governments and industry. “Earlier this year, we joined the 100 Days Mission, which will ensure industry is part of a robust collaboration alongside governments, international organisations and academia over the coming months and years to take action towards a common goal: protecting people from future pandemics through developing and deploying safe, targeted and effective diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines at scale.” Saudi Arabia will allow entry to travellers “from all countries” as long as they have received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine inside the kingdom, it has said, after suspending flights from seven African countries due to the Omicron variant on Friday. The ministry said the travellers would be allowed in from next Saturday and would need to quarantine for three days. It did not mention the flight suspensions, Reuters reports. Saudi Arabia has suspended flights to and from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho and Eswatini. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, National Institute for Health Research academic clinical lecturer, King’s College London, said the detection of two individuals in England infected with the Omicron variant is unsurprising given the news of the rapid spread of the variant in southern Africa and the emergence of cases in Europe. “The action to ban flights from the most affected countries is never a decision that should be taken lightly, but for a brief period it can buy the time needed to better understand the threat posed by this new variant and ensure the implementation of more robust identification and targeted contact tracing for individuals arriving from those countries now placed on the red list. “The decision by the government to reimplement the need for a PCR test from all individuals arriving in the UK from abroad on day two, with self-isolation until a negative test is reported, while frustrating for those travelling, is essential in order to rapidly identify cases of infection with the Omicron variant and implement prompt isolation and targeted contact tracing to limit the spread of the variant in the UK. “The decision to implement a requirement to wear face masks on public transport and in shops is welcomed, and while it is not yet a requirement to wear them in other environments, the British public would be wise to consider wearing them in all circumstances when they are indoors with gatherings of anyone other than close family and friends.” Less than a week ago, UK cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi took to the airwaves to predict that such was the progress of the vaccine programme, Britain would be the first big country to use vaccines to end the pandemic. Hours after he made those comments, scientists 9,000 miles away detected a worrying Covid variant that, just days later, prompted Boris Johnson to announce emergency measures that he had hoped would never be reintroduced. The speed at which Omicron’s initial discovery has led to the detection of cases around the world and the imposition of new restrictions has been startling. It is also a sign of desperation in Downing Street to avoid a lapse back into more severe restrictions, such as those the prime minister was forced to introduce – with great reluctance – last Christmas. Some more details have emerged about the Omicron cases in Bavaria, Germany. The two people with the variant entered Germany at Munich airport on 24 November, before South Africa was designated a virus variant area, and were now isolating, said Bavaria’s health ministry. The two had come forward for further investigations after they heard about the new variant, Reuters reports. The Bavarian ministry said anyone who had been in South Africa in the last 14 days should immediately reduce contacts, take a PCR test and contact their local health authority. “Bavaria has responded early and quickly to the very new variant,” a ministry spokesperson said. “Everything must be done to stop it spreading.” Of passengers arriving from Cape Town on Friday, 50 are in quarantine in Bavaria. Earlier, officials in the western state of Hesse, home to Frankfurt airport which is one of Europe’s busiest airports, said a suspected case of the Omicron variant had been found in a passenger arriving from South Africa. An update on an earlier story from the Netherlands. Some of the 61 Covid-19 cases detected among a group of passengers that arrived in the Netherlands from South Africa this week are likely to be the Omicron variant, health authorities said. “In a number of the tested persons the Omicron variant is presumed to have been found,” the Netherlands Institute for Health (RIVM) said. A spokesperson for the RIVM said it was “almost certain” the cases were of the new variant but further testing is needed, Reuters reports. Lyn Rickman and her family were hoping to travel across the ditch from Australia to visit her daughter Ellie, who lives in New Zealand and is due to graduate in Auckland at the beginning of May. Rickman is one of many Australians frustrated by New Zealand’s gradual border reopening timeline, which keeps Australians out until at least 30 April. Under the plan, fully vaccinated New Zealanders currently in Australia will be able to return home without quarantine from 17 January. But fully vaccinated non-citizens won’t be able to enter the country until 30 April next year, and they will still need to isolate for a week. Kuwait is to suspend direct flights from nine African countries from Sunday due to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa, the government communication centre said. The countries are South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zambia and Malawi, Reuters reports. A case of the Omicron variant has been detected in Italy, Reuters reports. The genome was sequenced at the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology, Virology and Bioemergency Diagnostics of the Sacco Hospital in Milan from a positive sample of a patient coming from Mozambique. The patient and his family contacts were in good health, the ISS said, adding that the sequence of the sample, “attributable to the one now known as variant of concern (VOC) and defined yesterday by WHO as Omicron”, was in the process of further confirmation. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, welcomed the UK government’s decision to impose tighter restrictions on face masks. He wrote on Twitter: “Today’s announcement that face coverings will be compulsory on public transport nationwide, as they already are across TfL [Transport for London], is welcome. “Evidence shows they help stop the virus spreading, and this is a measure I’ve repeatedly urged the Government to take.” Here is the full story on the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, announcing fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, including mandatory masks in shops and PCR tests for travellers entering the country after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected. Johnson said anyone arriving in the UK will be asked to take a PCR test for Covid-19 on the second day and must self-isolate until they provide a negative test. The rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will also be tightened, he said. Contacts of all confirmed cases of people infected with the Omicron variant will have to self-isolate for 10 days. Health officials are also examining the case for widening access to the booster vaccine programme, he added. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the state department have advised against travel to eight southern African countries due to the Omicron variant, Reuters reports. The CDC raised its travel recommendation to “Level Four: Very High” for South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana while the state department issued parallel “Do Not Travel” advisories on Saturday. The Welsh government has confirmed it will introduce the same measures on international travel as announced on Saturday by Boris Johnson, PA reports. A spokesperson said: “We have repeatedly raised our concerns with the UK Government about its decision to relax international travel rules quickly, precisely because of the risk of introducing new variants into the UK. We also warned against the removal of PCR tests for returning travellers. We will be introducing the same measures on international travel as those announced this afternoon by the UK Government and the other devolved governments. “The emergence of this new variant is a serious development in the ongoing pandemic and reinforces the need for everyone in Wales to get their vaccine or booster when offered, wear face coverings when necessary, and book a test if they develop symptoms.” Face coverings will become compulsory in shops and on public transport in the UK from “next week”, a statement from 10 Downing Street said. The statement said: “Face coverings will be made compulsory in shops and on public transport from next week. “All hospitality settings will be exempt.” Two new cases of the Omicron variant have been found in the German state of Bavaria, Reuters reports. The press conference has now concluded. On whether younger people should now be vaccinated as in other countries such as the US, Prof Whitty said the JCVI is looking into it. Sir Patrick Vallance has added that boosters will give high enough antibody coverage, which should be sufficient. Also vaccine manufacturers are devising “broader vaccines” that are effective against potential new variants. And two companies have said they can tweak existing vaccines against the new variant “in about 100 days”. On reasons to be more optimistic about dealing with the new variant, Sir Patrick Vallance said we now have a “changeable platform” for vaccines and antiviral drugs coming along compared with a few months ago. In response to a question about why he is not implementing further plan B measures such as telling people to work from home, Johnson cited the differences between the Delta and Omicron variant and its approach to “slow the seeding” through the border measures being introduced, accelerating the booster programme and giving scientists more time to understand the variant. Johnson has clarified that people must now wear face covering in shops and public transport with the health secretary to provide more details. On the new variant, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, said: “The reason this one is worrying is the combination of transmissibility and the potential for some degree of escape from vaccines because of the number of changes.” Johnson insists the UK is in a much stronger position, largely due to the vaccine and booster rollout. On the ramifications for Christmas plans, he said he is “absolutely confident” that this year’s Christmas will be considerably better than last year’s festive period. Johnson acknowledges: “We don’t know how effective our vaccines will be” against the new variant. “But we have good reasons to believe they will provide at least some measure of protection,” he added. Prof Chris Whitty is explaining a series of slides that show cases rose in November after a dip in October. Hospitalisations and the number of deaths are down. Johnson said there will be ramping up of mask wearing in shops and indoor settings. All these measures are “temporary and precautionary” and will be reviewed in three weeks, he added. The prime minister said the health secretary is asking scientists to consider giving boosters to more people and reducing the gap from when an individual has their second dose. Johnson said all close contacts of a positive Omicron case must self-isolate for 10 days regardless of their own jab status. Johnson has stressed people can continue to travel but arrivals have to take a PCR test by the second day of their arrival and self-isolate until they have a negative result. He added that the new variant diverges from previous configurations of the virus and reduces protection from vaccines over time. Johnson said it does appear that Omicron spreads very rapidly and can spread between two people who are double vaccinated. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, is due to give a live press conference now on the latest on the new variant which you can follow in the blog. The UK has recorded a further 131 coronavirus-related deaths and 39,567 cases in the latest 24-hour period, government figures show. After the Omicron variant was detected in Germany in a passenger arriving from South Africa, Peter Tinnemann, head of the Frankfurt Health Authority, said: “Our current routine procedures enable us, together with Frankfurt airport, to quickly implement the necessary measures to minimise the risk of spreading.” The Czech Republic’s president, Miloš Zeman, left a Prague hospital on Saturday to name the country’s new prime minister a day later, his spokesman told AFP. Zeman is due to appoint Petr Fiala, head of the right-wing Civic Democratic party, as prime minister at his Lany chateau residence on Sunday morning. However, it is still not clear how the ceremony will proceed as the 77-year-old Zeman has to isolate for two weeks under health ministry rules. Zeman went to hospital on 10 October. He was released last Thursday but returned to hospital on the same day after testing positive for Covid-19. Essex county council in England has confirmed it is aware of a case of the new Omicron variant: Here are more details on the UK government adding four more countries to its red list after two cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant were detected. Scientists in the UK are responding to the news that two cases of the Omicron variant have been detected in Brentwood and in Nottingham. Infectious diseases expert Dr Neil Stone tweeted that it was no surprise that the variant had been found in the UK, but noted travels bans might not be “completely useless” as both confirmed cases were linked to travel in southern Africa. He wrote: Surprise surprise, Omicron has been found in the UK. As usual, by the time we discover it exists, it’s everywhere. Importantly, both cases apparently linked to travel in Southern Africa..so maybe travel bans not COMPLETELY pointless just yet (they will be very soon though) That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today. I’m handing over to my colleague Tom Ambrose. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he “would not be surprised” if the Omicron variant was already in the United States. Speaking to NBC News today, the president’s chief medical adviser said there was yet to be a confirmed case of the variant in the US but added: You know, I would not be surprised if it is. We have not detected it yet, but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you’re already having travel-related cases that they’ve noted in Israel and Belgium and other places, when you have a virus like this, it almost invariably is ultimately going to go, essentially all over. Its ability to infect people who have recovered from infection and even people who have been vaccinated makes us say this is something you have to pay really close attention to and be prepared for something that’s serious. It may not turn out that way, but you really want to be ahead of it. Singapore has recorded 1,761 new cases, up from 1,090 the previous day. A further six deaths were also reported, compared with three on Friday. The latest figures take the total number of fatalities in the country of 5.7 million people to 690. England is to add four more countries to its travel “red list”, health officials have announced, after two cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant were detected in the UK. Following fresh advice from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), from 4am on Sunday Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will join the red list. Travellers who have returned from these four countries in the last 10 days must isolate and get a PCR test, officials said. The Guardian understands the UKHSA is now following up recent arrivals from these countries. Ministers are not ruling out adding further countries to the red list. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: We will do all we can to protect the UK public against this emerging threat and that is why we are surging testing capacity to the impacted communities and introducing travel restrictions on a further four countries: Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola. We will not hesitate to take further action if required. From 4am on Sunday non-UK and Irish residents who have been in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola in the previous 10 days will be refused entry into England, officials said. This does not apply to those who have stayed airside and only transited through any of these countries while changing flights. UK and Irish residents arriving from 4am on Sunday must isolate in a government-approved facility for 10 days. During their stay, they will be required to take a PCR test on day 2 and day 8. South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia were added to the red list on Thursday and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from 4am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a government-approved hotel quarantine for 10 days. Asked if the UK public should now expect changes “as we head into Christmas”, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: We’ve always been really clear that we will do whatever is necessary to protect the progress that we’ve made as a country. We’ve come a long way, especially since the summer, and we keep all of this under review and if we need to take further action, we will. Boris Johnson is due to take part in a news conference at 5pm with the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, and the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, “to set out further measures”. When asked what the public’s response should be, Javid replied: If anyone is sitting at home, thinking what can I do – get vaccinated. Four more countries are being added to the UK’s travel “red list” from 4am on Sunday: Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Sajid Javid, the UK health secretary, said: We have moved rapidly and the individuals are self-isolating while contact tracing is ongoing. We will do all we can to protect the UK public against this emerging threat and that is why we are surging testing capacity to the impacted communities and introducing travel restrictions on a further four countries: Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola. We will not hesitate to take further action if required. This is a stark reminder that we are not yet out of this pandemic. Getting the vaccine has never been more important – please come forward for your first jab if you haven’t already and if eligible, book your booster as soon as possible. After overnight genome sequencing, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed that two cases of Covid-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 have been identified in the UK. The individuals that have tested positive, and all members of their households, are being retested and told to self-isolate while further testing and contact tracing is under way, officials said. One case has been located in Chelmsford and the other in Nottingham. The two cases are linked, officials said, and there is a link to travel to southern Africa. The UKHSA is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to have been infectious. Two cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant have been detected in the UK, the health secretary has said. Sajid Javid said the two individuals are now self-isolating and the cases are connected. He added there would be targeted testing in the areas where the cases were found – in Chelmsford and Nottingham. The first suspected case of the Omicron Covid variant in the Czech Republic is under investigation. The prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said the suspected infection was a woman who stayed in Namibia, and then flew home via South Africa and Dubai. In Germany, a minister in the state of Hesse said the Omicron variant, known officially as B.1.1.529, had probably arrived in a traveller returning from South Africa. The country’s top health officials have raised the prospect of a national lockdown amid rapidly rising cases and hospitalisations. Dozens of people who arrived in the Netherlands on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid. Dutch authorities are scrambling to see if 61 passengers from South Africa who tested positive for Covid-19 have the new B.1.1.529 variant. There have been 77 fully confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in South Africa, four cases in Botswana and one in Hong Kong. Cases have also been reported in Israel and Belgium, although it is possible the variant has spread further. The Omicron variant is unlikely to “reboot” the pandemic in a population that has been widely vaccinated, according to Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group. South Africa has complained it is being “punished” for detecting the Omicron variant, as countries around the world rushed to impose travel bans from southern African countries. Travel bans from certain African countries have been introduced by the UK, US, EU, Australia, Brazil, Turkey, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Oman and Thailand, among others. BioNTech, the company that developed the Pfizer jab, has said it could manufacture and distribute an updated version of its vaccine within 100 days if the new Covid variant is found to evade existing immunity. Hi, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong again. South Africa has complained it is being “punished” for detecting the Omicron variant. The foreign ministry made the statement as countries around the world rushed to impose travel bans from southern African countries. “Excellent science should be applauded and not punished,” it said. The bans on flights was said to be “akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker”. Members of the UK’s Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) have expressed concern at the emergence of the Omicron variant when Covid cases in the UK are high and people are socialising indoors. Dr Zubaida Haque called on the government to take “early and preventative action now”, saying “high cases and no mitigations means spread of new variant is faster”. Meanwhile, Prof Susan Michie and Dr Kit Yates have thrown their weight behind Prof Stephen Reicher “debunking the idea of behavioural fatigue”. “The evidence is that people respond to clear leadership from trusted sources,” Michie said. Advocating for a policy of elimination, Dr Deepti Gurdasani stressed that “with every shift in the virus we risk dealing with a shift in the pandemic”. “Progressive coordinated and supported global elimination was the only way to really deal with this threat. And with every new variant, it gets harder to do this,” she said. Gurdasani said a lack of mandatory hotel quarantine in the UK means “spread can happen in households and onward” and called for comprehensive mandatory border quarantines from all regions, mask mandates, mitigations in schools and limits on large gatherings. She also urged the booster programme and vaccine drive for children to be accelerated. Authorities in the Czech Republic reported the first suspected case of the Omicron variant has been identified in a passenger who arrived from Africa. The prime minister, Andrej Babiš, said the suspected infection was a woman who stayed in Namibia, and then flew home via South Africa and Dubai. This is Harry Taylor, bringing you Covid news for the next hour. A useful thread from Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, on what factors to look out for in terms of learning about the Omicron variant. Among the key points to look for are the variant’s epidemiology, its clinical impact and how it fares under existing public health measures. Farrar adds: New variants are inevitable the virus remains highly plastic still evolving and will continue to do so. New variants are not a reason to stop doing what we know works. New variants are a reminder if we needed it that the pandemic is far from over, inequity is what will extend the pandemic. We do need to do inclusive public health better including urgent equitable access to vaccines and all the tools needed stop pandemic. The unequal sharing of Covid vaccines globally is likely to lead to more variants like Omicron emerging, the international affairs thinktank Chatham House is warning. “The emergence of a new Covid-19 variant with all its myriad mutations – on this occasion from South Africa – is not unexpected,” said Dr Osman Dar, the project director of Chatham House’s One Health Project and a specialist in public health and the control of communicable diseases. What it highlights are the continuing and fundamental risks to everyone associated with not seriously addressing the inequalities still at play globally in the fight against disease and poor health. Mutations will continue to surface, as will in all likelihood other infectious viruses with pandemic potential. This latest variant – rapidly detected thanks to South Africa’s relatively advanced genomic sequencing capability and willingness to engage with international partners and collaborating agencies – has for South Africa resulted in a series of travel bans restricting their citizens and impediments to international trade. African states will pay the price of travel bans which are implemented to try to contain the spread of Omicron, while drug companies will benefit from the search for modified vaccines, he added. Movement restrictions, including international travel bans do clearly slow and limit the spread of infectious disease, and as is the case is with the current pandemic, allow countries the time and breathing space to prepare medical countermeasures as well as adapt strategies to control local outbreaks. While for drug and vaccine manufacturers, largely based in the global north, it represents the firing of a start-gun in the next race for market share and profit as they test whether their currently licensed IP-protected vaccines will be effective and whether or not a new, modified vaccine is necessary. So in effect, a low/middle income nation – along with the continent it sits in – is economically penalised, socially ostracised and socio-politically stigmatised for demonstrating global solidarity and doing the right thing through their timely reporting and sharing of the variant’s genetic data. Meanwhile, a small group of hugely wealthy pharmaceutical companies find new opportunities to generate exorbitant profits as fear starts to once again grip politicians and the wider public. What’s necessary, therefore, to limit the negative socioeconomic impacts of these restrictive measures on trade and travel, is to have a sufficiently resourced global regime in place. This should support countries reporting new variants through the significant financial and social hardships that then ensue – a disaster or pandemic fund specifically engineered around the impacts of trade and travel restrictions. Hello! It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Aamna Mohdin. Here’s a bit more on the 61 passengers onboard the two flights from South Africa to Amsterdam who tested positive for Covid-19. Dutch health authorities said the positive cases were being quarantined in a hotel near Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. “We now know that 61 of the results were positive and 531 negative,” the Dutch health authority (GGD) said in a statement. “The positive test results will be examined as soon as possible to determine whether this concerns the new worrisome variant, which has since been given the name Omicron variant.” Those who tested positive will be required to stay in hotel quarantine for seven days if they show symptoms and for five days if they do not. Those who test negative are expected to isolate at home. The Dutch government had banned all air travel from South Africa early on Friday because of concerns about the Omicron variant. Testing is required before flights. Around 600 passengers arrived at Schiphol on the two KLM flights on Friday and then faced hours of delays and testing. The passengers from the two aircraft, which landed shortly after each other, were kept separate from other people at the airport, De Telegraaf reports. One aircraft came from Cape Town and landed at Schiphol around 10.30 am on Friday. The other flight, from Johannesburg, arrived at around 11am. Some people complained about the lack of information from airport officials and said it took seven hours before they were given anything to eat or drink. Lorraine Blaauw, who runs a support group for South African families in the Netherlands, told DutchNews.nl she had been contacted by several people onboard the two flights. “It was chaos,” she said. “No one knew what was going on. There was no food, no milk for the babies. KLM provided 30 blankets for 600 people. The KLM crew just went home.” The Kennemerland health board, which is responsible for testing at the airport, said it understood the frustration under passengers about the situation. “People who have just had a long journey … were confronted with a situation we have never had to deal with before,” the health board said in a statement. A German state minister has warned that the Omicron variant has “very likely already arrived” in Germany, as mutations typical of the variant were detected in a traveller returning from South Africa. “Last night several Omicron-typical mutations were found in a traveller returning from South Africa,” tweeted Kai Klose, the minister of state for social affairs and integration in the western German state of Hesse. The full sequencing of the variant hasn’t yet been carried out, but he said health authorities had a “high level of suspicion” that the person has contracted the variant. The traveller has been isolated at home. If confirmed, it would be the first case of Omicron in Germany. No further details were given about the passenger or which airport the infected person arrived at. Frankfurt international airport, Germany’s busiest airport, is located in the state of Hesse. “If you have returned from southern Africa in the last week, limit your contacts and get tested,” Klose warned. The UK should cut the gap between the second dose of a Covid-19 vaccination and the booster jab from six to five months, the Labour party said on Saturday, Reuters reports. As the new Omicron variant sparked concern around the world, Alex Norris, Labour’s junior health spokesperson, said: This new variant is a wake-up call. The pandemic is not over. We need to urgently bolster our defences to keep the virus at bay. Yesterday, Labour called on ministers to act quickly to “get a grip” of the issues before Omicron had a chance to take hold. The director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the Omicron variant and said it is unlikely to result in a reboot of the pandemic. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Prof Sir Andrew Pollard said: If you look at where most of the mutations are, they are similar to regions of the spike protein that have been seen with other variants so far and that tells you that despite mutations existing in other variants, the vaccines have continued to prevent very severe disease as we’ve moved through Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. At least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against this variant for severe disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed. But it is extremely unlikely that a reboot of a pandemic in a vaccinated population like we saw last year is going to happen Pollard added that it was still too early from the data in South Africa to make any decisive conclusions of the impact the Omicron variant will have. He was also hopeful that a new vaccine, if needed, could be developed rapidly. He said: The processes of how one goes about developing a new vaccine are increasingly well oiled. So if it’s needed that is something that could be moved very rapidly. Morning, I’m Aamna Mohdin and I’ll be helming the blog for the next few hours. If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or message me on Twitter (@aamnamohdin) Sri Lanka is the latest country to ban travellers from six southern African countries on Saturday over concerns about the new Omicron Covid variant. From Monday, travellers will not be allowed into the country from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho and Eswatini, a statement from the director general of health services said, local publication the Deccan Herald reports. Travellers who arrived from these six countries over the past two days will have to undergo mandatory 14 days quarantine. The number of confirmed Omicron Covid cases in South Africa is still relatively low, with 2,828 new confirmed cases recorded on Friday, but its speed in infecting young people in the country has alarmed health professionals, the Associated Press reports. “We’re seeing a marked change in the demographic profile of patients with Covid-19,” Rudo Mathivha, head of the intensive care unit at Soweto’s Baragwanath hospital, told an online press briefing. “Young people, in their 20s to just over their late 30s, are coming in with moderate to severe disease, some needing intensive care. About 65% are not vaccinated and most of the rest are only half-vaccinated,” said Mathivha. “I’m worried that as the numbers go up, the public health care facilities will become overwhelmed.” She said urgent preparations are needed to enable public hospitals to cope with a potential large influx of patients needing intensive care. Diagnostic tests so far indicate the Omicron variant may be responsible for as many as 90% of the new cases, according to South Africa’s health officials. Early studies show that it has a reproduction rate of 2 — meaning that every person infected by it is likely to spread it to two other people. Many passengers on the two flights that arrived from South Africa to the Netherlands last night did not wear face coverings, New York Times reporter Stephanie Nolen says. Nolen, who was on one plane, said many passengers did not follow the health guidelines despite a mask mandate by Dutch airline KLM, which operated both flights. We now know that dozens of those passengers tested positive for Covid, although authorities have yet to confirm the presence of the Omicron variant. Passengers were stuck on the airport tarmac for about four hours before being sent to be swabbed, tweeted Nolen, who later said she tested negative. “... still probably 30% of ppl are wearing no mask or only over mouth. Dutch authorities not enforcing. We’re just all in this unventilated room at hour 12, breathing on each other,” she added. “After all that time with maskless yellers in an unventilated space – we shall see what the next days bring.” As Europe braces for a possible outbreak of the new Omicron coronavirus variant, here is a quick visual refresh of where the continent stands in its fight against the coronavirus. This updated map indicates incidence rates across Europe. Dutch health authorities said that 61 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid-19, Reuters reports. Authorities are conducting further testing to see if any of the infections are with the recently discovered Omicron coronavirus variant. Around 600 passengers arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport on the two KLM flights on Friday and then faced hours of delays and testing due to concerns over the new virus variant. The Dutch health ministry said early on Saturday 61 tests had come back positive. “Travellers with a positive test result will be placed in isolation at a hotel at or near Schiphol,” health authorities said in a statement. “Of the positive test results, we are researching as quickly as possible whether they are the new variant of concern, now named ‘Omicron’.” The Dutch government banned all air travel from southern Africa early on Friday. The health minister, Hugo de Jonge, determined that passengers already en route to the Netherlands would have to undergo testing and quarantine upon arrival. Thailand is now the latest country to ban entry of people travelling from eight African countries it designated as high-risk for the new B 1.1.529 Covid-19 variant, a senior health official said. Starting in December, travel from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, will be prohibited, the official told a news conference, as reported by Reuters. Hi everyone, it’s Samantha Lock here, ready to take you through all the new Covid developments this weekend. It’s been a busy past 24 hours on the Covid front with nations racing to close borders and reimpose restrictions after a new Covid variant was detected last week. Today, the World Health Organization named the variant “omicron” and classified it as a highly transmissible virus of concern. Belgium detected Europe’s first confirmed case of the new variant on Friday as the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and multiple European nations imposed travel bans on south African nations. Let’s dive right back in with a quick recap of all the key developments you may have missed from the past few hours. The US and Canada introduced new travel restrictions in response to the Omicron variant. EU members also agreed to restrict travel from seven African countries. The first European case of B.1.1.529 variant has been identified in Belgium. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said no cases of the new Covid-19 Omicron variant detected in South Africa have so far been identified in the United States to date. New York governor Kathy Hochul issued a Covid-19 “disaster emergency” declaration on Friday, citing increasing rates of infections and hospitalisations. An order from the governor said the state was experiencing Covid-19 transmission “not seen since April 2020” and that hospital admissions has been increasing over the past month to over 300 a day. The UK reported a further 50,091 Covid cases and 160 deaths. India reported its lowest daily Covid case rise in 541 days, according to Union Health Ministry data updated today. The single-day rise of 8,318 new Covid infections and 465 deaths saw active cases decline to 1,07,019 - the lowest seen since March 2020. South Korea’s Covid deaths hit record high with new curbs expected. The country reported 4,068 new Covid-19 cases and 52 new deatgs. Critically ill patients hit an all-time high of 634, up 17 from the previous day, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). India will resume scheduled international flights from 15 December with a limited service to 14 nations, the Civil Aviation Ministry said. Australia confirmed it will close its borders to anyone who has been in southern Africa, and is not an Australian citizen. Australian citizens, residents and their dependents arriving from these countries will need to go into immediate supervised quarantine for 14 days. Brazil will shut its borders to travellers arriving from six southern African countries, chief of staff to president Jair Bolsonaro said. Germany reports an additional 67,125 Covid cases and 303 deaths, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute. Germany’s top health officials have raised the prospect of a national lockdown amid rapidly rising coronavirus cases and a dramatic increase in the number of patients in intensive care. The Netherlands will be “effectively closed from 5pm to 5am” according to remarks by caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte, announcing new Covid restrictions from Sunday. Dozens of people are likely to have tested positive for the virus within the 600 passengers who landed at Schiphol airport in the Netherlands from South Africa on Friday. The European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has classified Omicron, B.1.1.529, a “variant of concern”, warning the risk is “high to very high”. Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Morocco have introduced varying bans on travellers from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho and Eswatini according to AFP. Egypt has suspended direct flights to and from South Africa. Iran said it will ban foreign travellers from six countries, including South Africa. Canada introduced new border measures and ‘rigorous monitoring’, banning foreign travellers from seven African countries. Stocks in the US followed those in Asia and Europe by falling sharply on Friday in the wake of concerns about the new Covid variant."

Now Greenpeace is hoping to benefit in real life as well as in the fictional world of the media conglomerate Waystar Royco. Thousands of people have looked into leaving money to the environmental group since the darkly comic storyline about Cousin Greg losing his inheritance and then threatening to sue the organisation was broadcast. More than 22,000 people have accessed online advice about making donations in their wills to Greenpeace. The group’s legacy webpage has also seen a tenfold surge in traffic since the episode was first broadcast earlier this month. Greenpeace UK’s head of donors and legacies, John Hutchin, says the Emmy award-winning HBO series has brought an important but rarely discussed subject to the fore. “It’s incredible the amount of interest we’ve seen off the back of this storyline,” he says. “Our planet needs protecting now more than ever, and the gifts that people leave to us in their wills really are vital to funding our campaigns.” Greenpeace UK gets around a sixth of its income from gifts left in wills. This year it expects to receive about £5.5m. The fifth episode of the current series of Succession, which follows the bitter struggle to succeed ageing media mogul Logan Roy, revels in Cousin Greg’s impotent anguish as Ewan announces he is leaving his entire estate to charity partly to spite his grandson. Greg, a peripheral and permanently insecure family member, then threatens to sue Greenpeace, before his erstwhile confidant, Tom Wambsgans, remarks approvingly: “I like your style. Who are you going after next? Save the Children?” After the episode was broadcast, Greenpeace digital team changed the group’s Twitter handle to “Gregpeace” and tweeted Nicholas Braun, who plays Greg: “we heard Cousin Greg wants to sue Greenpeace” with a link to advice on donating. Braun replied, in character, “still gonna do it”. Save the Children got involved too, asking Braun if they were next. He responded: “No no, the children are safe.” The exchange has generated more clicks than any other link shared on Greenpeace’s Twitter account. The original tweet has over 3m impressions. Hutchin adds: “Whether you’re a lifelong environmentalist whose work is not yet finished, or, like Uncle Ewan, you have ulterior motives, leaving a gift in your will is a great way to achieving that.” In the following episode, broadcast last week, Greenpeace gets another mention. Greg is glimpsed being held aloft by Republican supporters chanting his name, with one calling out: “Fuck Greenpeace.” In a case of life imitating art, James Cromwell, who plays Ewan, is believed to be a long-term Greenpeace supporter. Cromwell, who starred in LA Confidential and Babe, is a seasoned activist who was jailed after a protest at the site of a gas-fired planned power plant. Although mainly set in the US, with a strong American cast, Succession was created by British writer Jesse Armstrong, who made his name with the innovative Channel 4 comedy Peep Show. The show’s writing team includes two prominent British writers, Lucy Prebble and Georgia Pritchett. The cast also draws on talent from this side of the Atlantic: the menacing patriarch, Logan Roy, is played by Scottish actor Brian Cox, and Tom is played by English actor Matthew Macfadyen. Legacy gifts have helped many charities survive as normal fundraising activities have been curtailed in the pandemic. The amount of money donated to charities in the UK has increased over the past 30 years, with gifts rising from £800m in 1990 to £3.4bn in 2020. More than 16% of wills now contain a charitable gift. Analysts expect the baby-boomer generation to pass on large amounts of wealth, with many charities in line to benefit. Research by the charity and bequest analysts Legacy Foresight estimates legacy income will be worth £19.6bn between 2021 and 2025 and climb to £23bn in the second half of the decade."

          "bodyText": "Time to wrap up, after a day in which world stock markets, oil, and risky assets such as cryptocurrencies have been hit hard by the discovery of a new coronavirus variant which could derail the global recovery. Here’s today’s main stories: Our main Covid-19 liveblog will be tracking the latest: Wall Street’s fear index, the VIX, jumped by over 50% today -- showing a very sharp increase in volatility. The US stock market has closed, with heavy losses on a shortened session after the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow Jones industrial average has closed down 905 points, or 2.5%, at 34,899 points, its biggest one-day percentage drop since late October 2020. American Express (-8.6%), Boeing (-5.4%) and Caterpillar (-4%) led the Dow fallers, in a global shift away from risky assets today. The S&amp;P 500 index fell 2.2%, its biggest one-day drop since February this year. Cruise operators and airlines led the fallers, including Royal Caribbean Cruises (-13%), Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (-11.3%), Carnival Corp (-11%), United Airlines (-9.5%) and American Airlines (-8.8%). The selloff was broad-based, with energy, financials, industrials, real estate and consumer discretionary sectors worst hit. Pharmaceuticals bucked the selloff, though, with vaccine makers Moderna (+20.5%) and Pfizer (+6%) seeing strong gains. “It is déjà vu all over again for like the eighth time,” said Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Global Investments in Atlanta (via Reuters): “What we understand about this variant could accelerate over the weekend, if there is more concerning news than good news, a lot of people don’t want to be holding risk assets on Monday morning, or are afraid of what that could look like Monday morning.” The World Health Organization has named the B.1.1.529 Covid variant Omicron and says an advisory group has recommended that it should be designated as “of concern” In a statement, WHO said preliminary evidence suggests the latest variant carries a “higher risk of re-infection than other variants of concern”. More here: Around £13.5bn has been wiped off the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized and smaller firms today, as it tumbled by 3.2% in a selloff led by travel companies. That’s on top of the £72bn knocked off the blue-chip FTSE 100 today. European markets also had their worst day since June 2020. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has closed down almost 3.7%, with travel stocks, banks, energy companies and miners all badly hit. Germany’s DAX fell 4.15%, while France’s CAC index slid 4.75% Worries over the B.1.1.529 variant have added to concerns that new lockdowns could be implemented to address rising Covid infection rates in some parts of Europe. Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, says (via Reuters): “With Europe and some northern parts of the U.S. in a stretched situation due to an already high number of new cases and hospitalisations, this new virus strain comes at the worst possible time,” “Equities are reacting negatively because it is unknown at this point to what degree the vaccines will be effective against the new strain, and thus it increases risk of new lockdowns.” Cruise operator Carnival led the fallers on the UK’s FTSE 250 index, sliding by 16% today on concerns that travel restrictions could be reimposed. Budget airline easyJet has fallen by 11.5%, and rival Wizz Air lost 15%, while holiday operator TUI shed 10%. The FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies, fell by nearly 3.2% today. Oil giants have also tumbled sharply today, hit by the tumble in crude prices. BP dropped by 7.8% and Royal Dutch Shell fell 5.6%. Britain’s stock market has seen its biggest plunge in over a year, as investors ditch shares in companies most exposed to the pandemic after the discovery of the new coronavirus variant. The FTSE 100 index has closed down 266 points, or 3.64%, which is its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. It knocks around £72bn off the value of the blue-chip index, taking it to 7044 points, its lowest level in seven weeks. Travel stocks were badly hit, with British Airways owner IAG ending the day down nearly 15%. Jet engine maker and servicer Rolls-Royce has slumped by over 11%, followed by manufacturing group Melrose which lost 10%. Hotel chain operators InterContinental (-9%) and Whitbread (-8.7%) were also in the top fallers, along with conference group Informa (-9%), and Standard Chartered bank(-8.9%). Wall Street’s selloff is intensifying, with the Dow Jones industrial average now down 1,016 points or 2.85% at 34,788 points. This puts the Dow on track for its worst drop of the year, points out CNBC, in a shortened trading day because of the Thanksgiving holiday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are both down over 2% too. The US dollar has also lost ground today, with pandemic worries making an earlier rise in US interest rates less likely. The dollar is down 1% against the euro, which has risen to $1.132. Earlier this week, the euro hit a 16-month low against the greenback. But, the emergence of a new Covid strain that puts the recovery in some doubt has prompted a sharp reversal in equities, bonds and FX markets, point out analysts at MUFG Bank. They write: For most of the week, market participants had been pricing in more rate hikes especially in the US encouraged by the ongoing hawkish shift in Fed rhetoric. However, those expectations for faster Fed rate hikes have reversed sharply at the end of this week in response to fears over further COVID-related disruption from the “Nu” variant that is feared may have a higher risk of evading vaccine protection. US crude has sunk below $70 per barrel for the first time since September. It’s down over 11% today, as oil markets are hit by heavy selling. Update: Brent crude has now slumped by over 10%, dropping below $74 per barrel, from $82/barrel last night. The oil price has now plunged by 9% today, as concerns over the B.1.1.529 variant rip through the markets. Brent crude has fallen to as low as $74.64 per barrel, a new two-month low, on fears that new pandemic curbs could be brought in, such as travel restrictions. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with ThinkMarkets, says: Crude oil and travel stocks took the brunt of the sell-off on Friday amid concerns the new variant will prompt fresh mobility restrictions and hinder economic activity. The UK was swift to announce a temporary flight ban from a number of southern African countries. If more countries follow suit, we could see demand for air travel fall. This, in turn could weigh on crude demand, just as the US and a few other oil consuming nations are releasing crude from their strategic reserves to add output to the global supply. Back in London, shares are heading lower. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is now down around 3.2%, or 234 points, at 7076, so still on track for its worst day of 2021. UK government bond prices are rallying, as investors seek safer assets, which is pushing down the interest rate (or yield) on these UK gilts. Shares in some vaccine makers are soaring, though, with Pfizer up 7% and Moderna jumping 22%. The selloff is gathering pace on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 905 points or 2.5% at 34,899 points after 20 minutes trading. American Express (-8.3%) are the top faller on the Dow, followed by aerospace manufacturer Boeing (-7%) and construction equipment maker Caterpillar (-5%). US travel companies are a sea of red, with cruise operator Carnival down 10% on the S&amp;P 500, Royal Caribbean off 9.1%, and United Airlines falling 9.6%. Hotel group Marriott are down 9.2%. The New York stock market is falling sharply at the start of trading, amid fears over the new Covid-19 variant. The S&amp;P 500 index, which covers a broad range of the market, has dropped by 1.25% at the open - down 60 points at 4,641 points. Energy, financial and industrial stocks are leading the selloff, along with travel firms, in what will be a shortened session for the Thanksgiving break. The Dow Jones industrial average, which contains 30 large US firms, is down 1.85%, losing 660 points to 35,143 points. But the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index is holding up better, down 0.75%. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says: Risk assets are getting pummelled at the end of the week as a new Covid variant sparks fears of new restrictions and lockdowns. The most worrying thing about the new strain at the moment is how little we know about it, with early indications being that it could be more problematic than delta. The biggest fear is that it will be resistant to vaccines and be a massive setback for countries that have reaped the benefits from their rollouts. We’ll no doubt learn more in the days and weeks ahead but for now, fear of the unknown will weigh heavily going into the weekend and could carry over into next week. We’re seeing a typical flight to safety in the markets with equities, commodity currencies and oil getting whacked and traditional safe havens like bonds, gold, the yen and swiss franc getting plenty of love. Climate activists have blockaded Amazon distribution centres across the UK to highlight the company’s treatment of its workforce and what they say are its “environmentally destructive and wasteful business practices”. Scores of Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists locked themselves together and used bamboo structures in an attempt to disrupt the online retail company’s distribution network on Black Friday – one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Unveiling banners reading “Infinite growth: Finite planet”, protesters said the blockade was part of an international action by XR targeting Amazon “fulfilment centres” in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. In the UK, activists targeted sites in Dunfermline, Doncaster, Darlington, Newcastle upon Tyne, Manchester, Peterborough, Derby, Coventry, Rugeley, Dartford, Bristol, Tilbury and Milton Keynes. More here: The UK is headed for its biggest Black Friday sales day with data suggesting shoppers had already spent over a fifth more than last year by mid-morning and 5.4% more than in 2019. Payments via Barclaycard, one of the UK’s biggest debit and credit card issuers, were up 21.4% between midnight and 9am compared with the same period in 2020, when most of the UK high street was in lockdown. Nationwide said its customers had made 1.3m purchases by 9am, 24% up on last year. Mark Nalder, head of payments at the building society, said: “We expect the day to get even busier as typically the busiest shopping periods are at lunchtime and into the early evening when people have finished work.” The figures show the UK is on track for shoppers to spend almost £9.2bn this weekend – 15% more than in 2020 – as predicted by analysts at GlobalData for the VoucherCodes Shopping for Christmas report. A first case in Europe of the new variant of Covid-19 has been identified in Belgium. Virologist Marc Van Ranst, whose laboratory works closely with Belgium’s public health body Sciensano, said on Twitter that the variant was found in a traveller who returned to Belgium from Egypt on November 11th. The person developed the first symptoms on November 22nd, he added. Our Covid-19 liveblog has more details. Global oil prices have plunged below $80 a barrel after “the most worrying” new variant of Covid-19 was identified in South Africa, raising fears in the market of renewed global travel restrictions that could derail the oil market’s recovery. The price of Brent crude had tumbled by more than $4 (£2.99) a barrel, or 4.9%, to $78.15 a barrel by mid-morning on Friday after countries across Europe and Asia brought in immediate travel restrictions to guard against the spread of the B.1.1.529 variant identified in several African countries. The US oil price per barrel plunged by more than $5 to just over $73. The new variant has multiple mutations to its spike protein that it is feared could enable it to evade the immune response induced by existing vaccines. After its identification earlier this week, the UK government announced on Thursday night it was putting six southern African countries back on England’s travel red list, with British travellers returning from those locations from 4am on Sunday having to quarantine. Meanwhile, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU also aimed to halt air travel from the region. B.1.1.529 threatens to reverse the oil market’s gains in recent months as travel and economic activity had begun to recover from a series of coronavirus lockdowns around the world. The sudden drop in global oil prices also wiped value from the UK’s largest listed oil and gas companies. The oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is down 4.8% this afternoon, with BP tumbling 6.5%. More here: US stock index futures are still signaling a tumble, with travel, bank and commodity-linked stocks bearing the brunt of the selloff. The Bank of England’s new chief economist has cited Chinese communist leader Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms today, as he explains why the BoE should take a cautious approach to monetary policy. Huw Pill told the CBI that if the UK jobs market remains strong, interest rates will need to gradually increase in the coming months, to make sure inflation comes back down from current high levels. In his first speech as the Bank’s chief economist, Pill says: At 4.2% in October, UK CPI inflation is well above its 2% target. This is clearly uncomfortable for a monetary policy maker with the objective of price stability. In my view, the ground has now been prepared for policy action But as the economic picture is still uncertain, the BoE can’t give precise guarantees on what will happen to interest rates, especially further into the future than the coming months [investors were surprised when the Bank didn’t raise interest rates this month] The main message, Pill says, is that the Bank should be cautious in offering guidance on the path of interest rates at those longer horizons, as policymakers weigh up the risks to growth and inflation. He concludes: Deng Xiaoping famously characterised China’s economic liberalisation as an attempt to ‘cross the river by feeling the stones’. That metaphor feels appropriate to describe the coming challenges for UK monetary policy. We know where we are headed: towards the 2% inflation target. We know that the passage there be challenging, with strong currents and hidden undertows all threatening our progress. But rather than identifying a point mid-river that we forge towards with no regard for the fast-moving eddies encountered along the way, it is better to adopt a step-by-step approach, where we ensure our feet are securely anchored on the slippery river bed, before inching further forward. Reacting to the ebbs and flows of the current. Showing caution rather than bravado. Learning by doing. These are the secrets to safely reaching the other side. That is the task that lies ahead for UK monetary policy. Our main Covid-19 liveblog is tracking all the developments in the pandemic today - here’s some of the latest news: A new variant of Covid, B.1.1.529, has been causing global concern after it was discovered in Hong Kong, having emerged in southern Africa. It has been detected in both South Africa and Botswana. The World Health Organization’s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE) is meeting in Geneva to assess whether the variant should be designated a “variant of interest” or “variant of concern”. B.1.1.529 has a very unusual constellation of mutations, which are worrying because they could help it evade the body’s immune response and make it more transmissible, scientists have said. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said in a press briefing on Thursday: “We don’t know very much about this yet. What we do know is that this variant has a large number of mutations. And the concern is that when you have so many mutations, it can have an impact on how the virus behaves.” England, India, Japan, Italy, Germany and the Czech Republic are among a number of countries who have rapidly imposed a range of travel restrictions on countries including South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia. UK transport secretary Grant Shapps described the move as “a safety-first approach”. South Africa’s foreign ministry said Britain’s decision to ban flights from South Africa because of the detection of a new Covid-19 variant “seems to have been rushed” UK health secretary Sajid Javid has described the new variant as “of huge international concern” and “may pose substantial risk to public health.” Israel’s prime minister Naftali Bennett called a meeting with public health officials and his government to take stock of the Covid situation in the country after a case of the new variant was discovered there. “We are close to an emergency situation... we must act strongly and quickly,” Bennett said in a statement from his office. “When we have a clearer picture of the situation, we will take decisions accordingly,” he added. Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme the new variant will “almost certainly” make the vaccines less effective, but “it is bad news but it is not doomsday.” More here: Today is also Black Friday, so here’s our guide to not getting scammed when looking for bargains: Spending has been brisk so far today. Barclaycard Payments, which processes £1 in every £3 spent on credit and debit cards in the UK, reports that spending was 21% higher than last year between midnight and 9am, and over 5% up on pre-pandemic levels in 2019. A quick recap. Britain’s FTSE 100 is on track for its worst day this year, as the emergence of the B.1.1.529 variant sends markets sliding around the globe. The blue-chip index of London’s largest listed companies is down 190 points, or 2.6%, at 7121 points, having hit a six-week low this morning. Travel, hospitality, oil and financial stocks are among the big fallers, on concerns that B.1.1.529 could lead to widespread new pandemic restrictions and slow the economic recovery. Airline group IAG are currently down 14%, with jet engine maker and servicer Rolls-Royce off 10%. Conference organiser Informa (-7.5%) and hotel groups Whitbread and InterContinental (both -6.3%) are also in the top FTSE 100 fallers. Other travel companies have been hit too, with cruise operator Carnival currently down 12.7%, holiday firm TUI off 10% and easyJet down 9.9%. The selloff came after the UK imposed travel restrictions on a group of southern African nations as a surge in cases of the highly mutated coronavirus variant. South Africa’s rand hit a one-year low. European markets are also sliding, with France’s CAC shedding 3.6% and Germany’s DAX down 2.9%. New York will join the selloff in a couple of hours, with the Dow Jones industrial average down over 2% or 800 points in pre-market trading. Oil has slumped to a two-month low, with Brent crude off 6% at $77.35 per barrel, on concerns that the global economic recovery could be hit. Industrial metal prices have also weakened. Wall Street’s fear index, the VIX, has surged, while cryptocurrencies have also tumbled as investors ditch riskier assets. Bitcoin is down almost 9% today, putting it into a bear market (more than 20% off its recent high). Joshua Raymond, director at financial brokerage XTB, says: “The new Covid variant has created uncertainty in the markets today, with investor appetite shying away from risk. As a result, we have seen European stocks start the day in sell off mode with the FTSE 100 and DAX30 both falling 3%. The main worry right now is the potential for this variant to evade the vaccines. This is the immediate concern amongst investors right now and their first move as a result has been portfolio protection. If this variant proves more potent and threatens the success of the vaccine rollout, its hard to see a bigger threat to market stability right now.” The pandemic is also hitting growth in Europe this autumn. The Swiss economy grew by a weaker-than-expected 1.7% in the third quarter of this year, new GDP data shows. That’s down from 1.8% in Q2, and below forecasts of a 2% increase. A worsening situation at home, increased restrictions abroad and the difficulty for companies to get parts and raw materials because of jammed supply chains, means economic development is likely to decelerate further during the fourth quarter, says Reuters. The Thanksgiving holiday is adding to the market volatility today, as the FTSE 100 heads for its worst day this year. With many US traders away from their desks, there’s less liquidity in the markets. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, explains: European markets have seen most of the gains made in the course of October and November evaporate overnight as investors around the globe react to the new Covid variant that has appeared in South Africa. Early reports suggest it spreads quickly and could be much more resistant to existing vaccines. While the situation appears confined to the region for now, markets are scrambling to price in return of restrictions across the globe, taking their cue from the UK’s travel restrictions and the tighter restrictions imposed in Portugal. This process is always a noisy and difficult one and has been exacerbated by the lack of liquidity that is always a feature of markets around Thanksgiving. Already some pockets of strength (or less weakness perhaps) have emerged, with Nasdaq futures holding up better than the rest as investors there hold their nerve, but perhaps some of the early moves today will be reversed if a more optimistic tone prevails into this afternoon and next week. Wall Street’s ‘fear index’, the VIX, has jumped by 40% this morning. The Vix index, which measures the likely volatility in US stocks over the next month, rose by 8 points on Friday to 26.6, the biggest increase since early 2021. That shows investors are worried, as they sell riskier assets such as shares and race into perceived ‘haven’ assets such as government bonds. Wall Street was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving, but opens at 2.30pm UK time (9.30am New York) for a half-day session. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently on track to tumble 800 points, or over 2%. Shares in travel and aviation businesses, including the British Airways owner, IAG, easyJet and the aero engine maker Rolls-Royce, plummeted on Friday over fears that a new coronavirus variant described as potentially the worst so far identified could lead to a new wave of global pandemic restrictions. The emergence of the new variant, which was identified on Tuesday and is feared to be more transmissible and poses a threat to current vaccines, prompted the government to put six southern African countries back on England’s travel red list on Thursday night. Flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini are to be suspended from midday on Friday. Officials are also reviewing a number of travel measures, including whether there should be a limited reintroduction of the use of PCR tests for arrivals. The news prompted a sharp sell-off of travel stocks on Friday, with IAG, which also owns the airline Iberia, tumbling as much as 14% in early trading. IAG was the biggest faller among FTSE 100 stocks alongside Rolls-Royce, which receives revenues based on the number of hours flown by aircraft that use its engines, which was down about 12%. Intercontinental Hotels and Whitbread, the owner of the Premier Inn chain, fell 7%. The FTSE 100 tumbled by 3% to its lowest level in six weeks on Friday morning as markets across Europe and Asia-Pacific countries were hit by a wave of selling. Here’s the full story: A new virus variant has come like a bolt out of the blue to rattle financial markets, writes Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM. The underlying concern is that vaccines may be less effective against this ‘Nu’ variant and it may spread easier thanks to its high number of mutations. The jury is still out though, as there isn’t much data available yet. Of course, markets aren’t going to wait around until all the details are known. Traders are already running for cover, slashing their exposure to stocks and loading the truck with bonds. European equity indices are down by roughly 3% while the S&amp;P 500 is set to open 2% lower according to e-mini futures. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is holding up better. It is mostly ‘real economy’ stocks that are getting hammered, with the drop in yields also cushioning the blow in the tech complex. Concerns over the B.1.1.529 variant could deter the Bank of England from raising interest rates next month. The pound hit a new 11-month low this morning, falling below $1.33 against the US dollar for the first time since last December. Market prices this morning imply a roughly 60% chance that the BoE leaves interest rates on hold at 0.1% at its next monetary policy committee meeting, on 16th December. Cryptocurrencies are also being hammered this morning, as investors dump riskier assets for the perceived safety of bonds, the yen and the dollar. Bitcoin, the largest digital currency, has tumbled by 7% to $54,840, its lowest since October 13th. That’s around 20% below its record high set earlier this month: Markets are likely to remain nervous until we know how the seriousness of the B.1.1.529 variant, says Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at Kingswood. “Stock markets have taken a 2.5-3% hit this morning from the news of a new, more infectious and potentially more vaccine-resistant coronavirus variant in a number of countries including South Africa. This follows hard on the heels of increasing worries about the sharp rise in infections and new Covid-restrictions being seen in Europe and means Covid is once again top of mind for markets. The extent of the threat posed by this new variant is far from clear and equities are likely to remain skittish until there is further clarity on this which may not be for a few weeks. Market nervousness is likely to be heightened as this latest development occurs just as the US Fed had begun talking of speeding up the pace of its tapering, paving the way potentially for a rate hike as early as the spring.” Industrial metals prices have also been hit by worries that the new Covid-19 variant will hit growth. Copper, seen as a gauge of the health of the global economy, has dropped over 2%, with aluminum, zinc, nickel and platinum also lower. After two hours of jittery trading, the UK’s stock market is on track for its biggest fall this year. The FTSE 100 index is down 204 points, or 2.8%, at 7105 points - slightly above its earlier lows. That would be the FTSE 100’s worst one-day percentage drop since September 2020, with travel, hospitality, oil companies and banks all still sharply lower. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, sums up the situation: “The drop in the oil price is the market’s way of saying it is worried about a reduction in economic activity, something which also explains the slump in metal prices. “Markets are clearly speculating that a rapid spread of a more brutal Covid strain could once again derail the global economy. Banking stocks were also weak as they are closely tied to economic activity. “Headlines calling it the ‘worst ever variant’ have caused investors to panic and dump shares in travel-related stocks for fear that we’re going to see tough travel restrictions once again “This is the worst possible news for airline operators as they were just starting to see a pick-up in trading, helped by people becoming more comfortable about travelling on a plane and routes like US/UK reopening. The selloff in energy markets is continuing, pulling US crude oil down almost 7% today. US crude has hit a two-month low below $73 per barrel, down around $5 per barrel today. Oil had rallied for much of this year, as the reopening of economies spurred demand for energy and fuel, but traders fear that the new B.1.1.529 variant could possibly derail that recovery. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explains: Oil prices are falling on fears that a new variant of the coronavirus identified in Southern Africa could force the reintroduction of travel restrictions, reducing global fuel demand. The virus-related worries appear to be multiplying the effect of the recent release of large quantities of oil from the strategic reserves of the US and other consumer countries. This increase in supply and fears over future demand caused a drop of almost 4.5% in the price of Brent during the early Friday trading. Ocado, the online grocery business, is a rare riser in London this morning, up around 1.5%, amid high concerns about the B.1.1.529 variant. “Things have escalated on the Covid front quite rapidly over the last 12 hours,” points out Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid. Yesterday the new Covid variant B.1.1.529 was slowly starting to gather increasing attention but overnight it has begun to dominate markets and has caused a notable flight to quality [such as US government bonds]. Other ‘stay at home’ stocks are also rising, points out Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor. The South African rand is continuing to slide, down 2% at a one-year low, she adds. European stock markets have all fallen heavily too this morning, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 down 2.7%. The European travel and leisure stock index hit a 10-month low, with airline stocks such as Lufthansa (-9%) sliding. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says fear has gripped the financial markets this morning, due to concerns that the new Covid strain could be far more contagious and might render vaccines less effective. The decision by the UK government to impose stringent quarantine rules on six southern African countries within hours has severely rattled the travel and tourism industry.... The immediate way the tough restrictions were imposed was a reminder of just how tied companies’ fortunes are to snap government decisions and the latest twists in the trajectory of the virus. Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has dropped by 5.5%, following the heavy falls in crude price this morning, while BP has tumbled 6.7%. Anxiety over the economic outlook is hitting banks too, with Lloyds Banking Group and NatWest falling 5%. Conference organiser Informa is also in the fallers, down 7.5%. Travel stocks are tumbling in early trading in the City, as the B.1.1.529 variant rattle markets. IAG, which owns British Airways, fell 20% at the start of trading to their lowest level since November 2020. It’s recovered slightly, but still down 10.5%. Rolls-Royce, which makes and services jet engines, is currently the top FTSE 100 faller, down 12%, after England imposed travel restrictions from South Africa and five neighbouring countries. Hotel operators are sliding, with Intercontinental Hotels Group and Whitbread (which owns Premier Inns) both down over 8%. Catering group Compass has lost 7%. On the smaller FTSE 250 index, budget easyJet has fallen by 11.5%, and cruise operator Carnival is down 15%. Holiday operator TUI has shed 13%. SSP Group, which operates Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza outlets at travel hubs, are down 14%. Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index has tumbled at the start of trading. Concerns over the B.1.1.529 variant are hitting travel stocks, hospitality firms, oil companies and banks hard. The FTSE 100 index has plunged by 243 points, or 3.3%, to 7066 points, its lowest point in six weeks, in a wave of selling. South Africa’s stock market has fallen sharply, with the FTSE/JSE All-Share Index falling by 1.7%. Hospitality stocks are leading the selloff, with City Lodge Hotels down nearly 20%. Casino and hotel operator Sun International is down 8%, and Tsogo Sun Hotels has dropped 9%. Marc Kimsey, Equity Trader at Frederick &amp; Oliver, predicts a heavy selloff today. We expect heavy selling action this morning as traders de-risk amid the discovery of a new covid variant. The FTSE is called lower by some 200pts, Dow Jones futures are trading 800pts lower. Expect double-digit losses in travel and tourism stocks. Oil stocks will also trade lower, tracking declines in underlying crude prices. Concerns that the B.1.1.529 variant could hit the global recovery is hammering the oil price. Brent crude has dropped over 3% to $79.37 per barrel, while US crude has slumped by around 4% to $75.25 per barrel. Jeffrey Halley, a senior analyst at brokerage OANDA, said the latest variant has sent “a wave of selling” through energy markets, on fears that mass social restrictions could be reimposed: All we know so far is the B.1.1.529 is heavily mutated but markets are taking no chances, equities are falling, haven currencies such as the US dollar, Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc are rallying, commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar are being sold, US 10-year bond yields have moved sharply lower, and oil has slumped. Traders are acting first and asking questions later, given the lack of information about the variant, says Bloomberg: “There is some risk off happening from Japan to Africa due to concerns around a new virus variant being found in South Africa but the good thing is countries such as U.K. are acting fast to curtail its spread,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian Research at United First Partners. “Given that the world has gone through this before with Delta, there is already a playbook for such situations - even if the new variant overstays.” South Africa’s rand has dropped more than 1.5% today, to a one-year low. Concerns over the B.1.1.529 variant pushed the rand to 16.2 against the US dollar, after England introduced travel restrictions on six southern African countries. The risk-sensitive Australian and New Zealand dollars each fell to three-month troughs, as Reuters reports: “Markets are anticipating the risk here of another global wave of infections if vaccines are ineffective,” said Moh Siong Sim, a currency analyst at the Bank of Singapore. “Reopening hopes could be dashed.” Selling pressure comes against an already growing backdrop of concern about COVID-19 outbreaks driving restrictions on movement and activity in Europe and beyond. More here. The World Health Organization will meet on Friday to assess the new variant detected in South Africa that is feared to be the worst Covid-19 variant yet identified. The meeting will determine if the B.1.1.529 variant should be designated a variant of “interest” or of “concern”. The variant, which was identified on Tuesday, initially attracted attention because it carries an “extremely high number” of mutations. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Financial markets have been rattled by the emergence of the worst Covid-19 variant yet identified. Stocks have fallen sharply in Asia-Pacific markets, the oil price has dropped, and European markets are expected to open sharply lower too. The variant, called B.1.1.529, contains an “extremely high number” of mutations, which could help it evade the body’s immune response, scientists have said. Those mutations mean that its spike protein looks different from the version that vaccines were designed to target. Last night, England imposed travel restrictions on six Southern African countries including South Africa, after data presented by South African scientists revealed that the variant also appears to be more transmissible and is already present in provinces throughout the country. South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe have all been placed on England’s travel red list. Two cases of B.1.1.529 has also been detected in Hong Kong. The news has sparked a sharp selloff in the markets. Asia-Pacific shares have suffered their biggest losses since August, with MSCI’s index of Asia shares outside Japan sliding 2%. Japan’s Nikkei is down 2.5%, with travel stocks among the big fallers. Japan Airlines has tumbled by 6.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has dropped 2.4%, as concerns that the B.1.1.529 variant could worsen the pandemic sent investors scurrying toward the safety of bonds, the yen and the dollar. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says the emergence of B.1.1.529 has triggered “a huge sell off” in Asia-Pacific markets. This variant which, it is understood, contains up to 30 identified mutations, has prompted WHO officials to call an emergency meeting to discuss what it means for vaccine efficacy as well as other treatments. The new strain has also prompted the UK government to implement flight bans from six African countries over concern as to what this might mean for infection rates, and other ripple out effects. For the moment it is understood that the number of cases is small, but due to the thin liquidity levels in Asia trading as a consequence of the US holiday the reaction does appear to be outsized, with a surge into bonds, sending yields plunging, and gold higher. Britain’s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is on track to tumble around 2% at the open, with losses seen across Europe.

          "headline": "Peng Shuai: the tennis star at centre of China’s biggest #MeToo allegation",
          "bodyText": "After Peng Shuai and Andrea Sestini Hlaváčková won the doubles final at the 2014 Beijing Open, they went to karaoke to celebrate. The fifth-seeded duo had just beaten India’s Sania Mirza and Zimbabwe’s Cara Black, who had never lost a match in the Asia-Pacific region. “She was at the beginning of her comeback and I was happy to be there to play with her,” Hlaváčková recalls, on the phone from Rome. Their victory called for a night out so they went to a big Beijing nightclub. “She was singing a lot of Chinese songs.” The tournament was their second together and Peng was ecstatic. The Chinese crowds had turned out in droves to watch their “superstar” player. For Hlaváčková it had been an eye-opening experience of the production scale of Chinese sport. “[Peng] always had someone helping her – a physio, a coach, a pairing partner. That to me was Chinese tennis: a lot of people helping, and everyone working hard. So hard.” Throughout much of it, Peng was also, allegedly, keeping a very big secret. On 2 November this year she finally decided to reveal it. In a Weibo post that was quickly deleted, Peng accused China’s former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of sexually assaulting her in his home, with his wife and at least one other person also in the house. In a lengthy and emotional post, Peng claimed the pair had sustained a long but intermittent relationship, which had paused while he served as one of China’s most powerful officials and refused to contact her. According to Peng, he reached out after his retirement, contacting her through a doctor at the Tianjin sports centre where she once trained, and invited her to play tennis with him and his wife. The doctor did not respond to a request for comment. Peng alleged he coerced her into sex, and later, with “complicated” feelings, they rekindled the affair. Then in late October this year the pair argued and Zhang failed to meet her for a talk, appearing to prompt her Weibo post. The details of the saga have been widely shared and reported outside China, but during the time she alleges she was in a relationship with Zhang, few – if any – others knew of it. “She was a very private person and there was not much we all knew about her, we just knew how good of a tennis player she was,” says Hlaváčková. “Nobody had any clue. She must have been really decisive to put it out there, because to put it out there in China is very difficult.” Born in Xiangtan, Hunan province, in 1986, Peng began playing at the age of eight with her uncle. She was sent to the state training centre in Tianjin at 12, where she would later meet Zhang when he was party secretary. By her late 20s she was a tennis celebrity, one who had pushed herself through the rigours of reaching an elite level among 1.4 billion people, battling injuries and multiple heart surgeries. She was lauded by state media with terms of endearment such as “golden flower” and “Chinese princess”. “We are all members of China’s glorious age of tennis,” she told state media earlier this year. “Leaving our different footprints in such a short lifetime is not representing the glory of one single Chinese player, but a decade of development for tennis in China, step by step.” But the fame and adoration was not enough to protect her when she made her allegations against Zhang. The case is the highest profile of any #MeToo case in China. Never before has a senior Communist party official, let alone one as high-ranking as Zhang, been accused by someone as part of the movement. China’s male-dominated government has made pledges and legal changes designed to address violence and harassment against women, but in practice cases have failed in court and women’s rights groups have been targeted in state crackdowns. Online groups have been closed, accounts censored or shut down, and figures such as the lawyer Huang Xueqin and activist Wang Jianbing disappeared. Peng’s post was live for about 30 minutes before it was taken down and all references to it and Peng were censored. Almost four weeks on it remains near impossible to comment or post online about the player. A prominent feminist activist inside China, who asked to remain anonymous, says it was the most powerful example of censorship against the #MeToo movement seen so far, making it almost – but not quite – impossible to discuss. “It prevented the topic from spreading after that night, but the censorship system couldn’t prevent people who already knew and believed in Peng Shuai from continuing to care about it,” she says. “I think after this incident, #MeToo may undergo more stringent review and questioning. But #MeToo will never stop, because this has never been a campaign planned by men.” For a while, there were fears Peng, who was not seen for about three weeks after her post, had disappeared like Huang and Wang. An international campaign built around her, led by the Women’s Tennis Association, calling for an investigation into her accusations and proof she was safe, well, and free. Eventually unable to ignore it, China’s state-run media issued ham-fisted “proof”, including videos and a purported email with language more closely resembling the forced confessions of dissidents than Peng’s emotional Weibo post. The clips, and a subsequent video call with the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, who said she was fine and did not address the allegations, only made observers more worried that she was under some form of state coercion. Natasha Kassam, a China expert with the Australian thinktank the Lowy Institute, says the censorship “makes it clear Peng is not able to speak for herself freely”. “It was very clear in the early days that the party state did not have a credible narrative with which to counter both Peng’s claims and then her disappearance,” says Kassam. Hlaváčková, who has retired from tennis, says she has been pleased with the advocacy of the WTA (which her partner also works for), and is following the industry’s broader debate over the balance of ethics and commerce with China. “I’m just happily confirmed that we are on the same page when it comes to women’s rights,” she says. “Until it’s really touching your sport, which right now it is, you do your business there and they do a great job of organising tournaments … But now it’s touching one of our players and we are very happy that business comes second.” The anonymous activist believes Peng is and will be physically safe, but that does not mean she is not in pain. “We don’t just want Peng Shuai to be safe, we also hope that she will no longer be suffering as much as she described.”"

          "headline": "Fingers pointed across the Channel as deaths renew UK-France blame game ",
          "bodyText": "Writing in Le Monde this week Julian Barnes, the novelist and chronicler of British-French relations, said both sides found it “easy to slip into the role of accuser or affronted victim”, often trading on decades- or even centuries-old stereotypes of one another. After 27 people died in the Channel, those stereotypes are in full view, and however much each side says it will rise above the blame game, or in Emmanuel Macron’s phrase “instrumentalise” the crisis, it has been almost impossible to resist sniping. The possibility that the simmering, adjacent dispute about post-Brexit fishing licences will finally explode with a blockade of Calais this weekend only adds to the sense that this is a relationship on the edge of nervous breakdown. The politics are raw. Emmanuel Macron, fighting to ensure a place in the presidential runoff in April, simply cannot afford to let the refugee crisis run away from him. Boris Johnson also has much at stake. Nigel Farage, his mysterious donors readying their cheques, is once again stirring and threatening the Conservative party’s right flank. Johnson’s backbenchers are struggling to square how Brexit regained control of the UK’s border when 25,700 people reached the UK in a slow but steady stream of inflatable boats. The British prime minister is positively neuralgic about the Channel, according to French sources, repeatedly returning to the subject of migrants and refugees in his private conversations with Macron. Johnson is 80% driven by short-term domestic politics, French diplomats say. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is in deep trouble, accused of chasing headlines rather than a real-world solution. She promised in 2020 to solve the crisis by the end of that year but has self-evidently failed. Politically, the easiest route for both sides is to point an accusatory finger across the Channel or adopt the role of victim. Many officials – military and diplomatic – are in reality eager to keep the relationship functioning and are trying desperately behind the scenes to do so. They are, for instance, still looking for openings to cooperate on defence, including areas such as Mali, knowing defence has been the solid glue in the Franco-British relationship. But alongside the rhetoric of David Frost, the Brexit minister, or Clément Beaune, Macron’s election attack dog, the glue is not sticking. The French, faced with accusations that they have been dilatory about the Channel crossings, point out it takes only a moment to look at the death toll in the Mediterranean over the past six years to know that if solutions the size of a tabloid headline could quell the urge to cross the Channel, then it would have been found. More than 20,000 people are estimated to have died in the Mediterranean, and more than 1,300 this year alone. But Britain is hitting back, saying France is not supposed to be a failed state like Libya, and should do more to close down the people smugglers. London has in the past threatened to cut financial support for France’s border policing if Paris fails to stem the flow of people. The French, in turn, complain that the UK, bereft of identity cards, oversees a labour market into which people can readily blend invisibly. Faced by this labour market, French opposition politicians, but not yet the government itself, are questioning the Le Touquet agreement, the bilateral treaty that allows British Border Force officers to carry out passport checks in France, and vice versa. The French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights recently said its terms “make France the police arm of British migration policy”. Before Brexit, it is claimed, this was justifiable, since the UK was subject to the EU Dublin convention, which obliges asylum seekers to apply to the first country in Europe where they have stayed. With Brexit, that obligation dies. France also grates at moral lectures from Britain; 83,000 asylum applications were lodged in France over the past year, compared with only 31,000 in the UK. In 2020, the UK registered 5.78 asylum seekers and refugees per 10,000 inhabitants, compared with 16.93 for France, 19.52 for Germany and 60.57 for Greece. But to unilaterally tear up the Le Touquet agreement – in effect waving migrants and refugees through to the UK – would be to drop a bomb into the relationship. Macron is also aware he needs the rest of Europe on his side. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign secretary, recently complained that the remarkable aspect of the map of global Britain was that it erased Europe. But there are limits to the European preparedness to fall behind the French tendency to equate the European national interest with the national interest of France. Germany, for instance, is busy preparing a bilateral agreement with the UK. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, will soon visit Spain, an astute choice for her first visit to an EU state. As each side manoeuvres, neither dare go beyond the brink."

          "headline": "Erdoğan gambles on economy amid protests and rocketing inflation",
          "bodyText": "Turkey’s president is gambling that a strong economic recovery from the pandemic will stay on track despite rocketing inflation that has hit living standards and sparked protests in major cities. The $750bn economy is on course to expand by 9% this year following a return of tourism and a surge in demand for exports that has pushed factory output to pre-pandemic levels. However, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s declaration of an “economic war of independence” has pitched him against many in his own party and the country’s technocrats who fear an inflation rate running at 20% will create further bouts of social unrest. “Some people who wanted to convey the opinion to the president that a different policy should be followed were not successful in this,” a senior official in the ruling AK party told Reuters, requesting anonymity. Three central bank governors who stood against Erdoğan’s demand for lower interest rates have been sacked since mid-2019, leaving the way clear for the governor since March, Şahap Kavcıoğlu, to bring down the base rate in three separate cuts from 19% to 15%. Rather than prompt a revival of foreign investment, lower interest rates have confirmed to investors the government’s lack of resolve in tackling inflation, causing the currency to fall further. Small protests in Istanbul and the capital, Ankara, on Tuesday called for an end to policies that have led to an inflationary spiral and a 40% slump this year in the lira to below 8 US cents. Police erected barriers in parts of Istanbul, the commercial capital, as protesters vented their fury against the AK-led coalition government, reported Bloomberg. Erdoğan, though, remains defiant. On Wednesday he sought to deflect attention from his economic woes with a visit from the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. A series of deals between the two sides, including a $10bn investment fund, pushed the lira up 6%, ending the longest losing streak in two decades. Paul Jackson, global head of asset allocation research at Invesco, said any respite was likely to be shortlived, with the currency falling further in the coming months. “There are worrying signs of instability from strong monetary growth, an inflation rate that has hit 20% and house price growth that has jumped to 35%. And even though the money supply has come down lately, successive cuts in interest rates mean the inflation rate will remain high. “It all means that what the president is doing is dangerous and damaging for the economy,” he said. Erdoğan came to power as prime minister in 2003 and engineered a change in the constitution that transferred most powers to the president in 2014. In the same year he was elected president, and was re-elected in 2018. In both roles, Erdoğan has always prioritised jobs and growth. Concerned that the nation’s young population might be restless without employment, he handed huge tax breaks to international firms looking to build manufacturing bases outside high-cost Europe. After the 2008 banking crash, he relied on figures such as the finance minister Mehmet Şimşek, a former UBS and Merrill Lynch banker, to reconstruct the economy. Galip Dalay, an associate fellow at the thinktank Chatham House, said the period when Erdoğan surrounded himself with experts to chart economic policy was long gone. “The whole economic team he built in 2011 has gone. The most important qualification now is loyalty,” he said. The president’s version of economic independence rests on a theory that low interest rates will fire up investment to boost jobs and growth. Jason Tuvey, a Turkey expert at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that in the run-up to the 2018 election campaign, interest rates fell and the economy boomed, yet the lira fell, ushering in high inflation. After the economy was allowed to overheat, there was a return to more orthodox central bank policies. But the president’s erratic policymaking discouraged foreign investment and the lira continued to fall, ushering in further bouts of inflation through high import costs. Tuvey said: “Turkey’s banks are in better shape than in 2018 when a borrowing spree in foreign currencies made them vulnerable to a slump in the lira. But if households lose confidence, there could still be a run on the banks.” Dalay said the president’s situation was becoming precarious. Elections are due in 2024, but could be brought forward if the economy looks like deteriorating further. “What you are seeing now is not part of a grand strategy, but a huge gamble that could come unstuck,” he said."

The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.1% in the third quarter, up from the 2% estimated previously, but this represents a sharp slowdown from the previous quarter’s 6.7% growth, with consumers spending less. Durable goods were much weaker than expected. On a brighter note, initial jobless claims fell to 199,000 in the week to 20 November, the lowest since 1969. Tonight, we’ll get the Fed minutes. Here are our main stories today: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Take care - JK The US Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, rose to an annual rate of 4.1% in October from 3.6% in September, as expected. On Wall Street, shares have slipped as expected after poor results from US companies, a mixed bag of US data and growing Covid worries in Europe. The Nasdaq is down more than 1%, while the Dow Jones opened 0.6% lower and the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.5%. Over here, the FTSE 100 index has given up earlier gains and is trading flat while Europe’s main indices are a sea of red. Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index, has looked ahead to the Wall Street open, and the barrage of US data. US stocks are set to open slower on the back of disappointing earnings from a number of big retailer names, after a mixed bag of US data and amid growing Covid concerns in Europe. On the one hand, Q3 GDP was revised up in the second estimate to 2.1%, from 2% thanks to stronger than initially estimated consumer spending. However, this was still short of forecasts of an increase to 2.2%. This is still down sharply from 6.7% in Q2 amid a resurgence of Covid, supply chain disruptions and labour shortages. Alongside a slightly disappointing GDP print were weaker than forecast durable goods sales. Durable goods sales unexpectedly contracted in October to -0.5% month-on-month, down from -0.4% in September and well short of the 0.2% increase forecast. On the other side of the coin, US jobless claims figures were impressive falling to a level not seen since 1969. The significant drop in jobless claims is offsetting weak data elsewhere because we know that the Fed is watching the labour market very closely. The Fed wants to see improvements in the labour market recovery in order to raise rates and today’s data is certainly a step in that direction. However it is worth noting that this huge drop could in fact be due to seasonal swings. Looking ahead there is still plenty more data for investors to sink their teeth into with Michigan confidence and Core PCE data due [at 3pm]. Core PCE is expected to show inflation at 4.1% with a high reading expected to prompt bets of a sooner move by the Fed. The minutes from the latest Fed meeting are also due and whilst these could shed some light on the transitory inflation theme, it’s important to remember that the meeting happened prior to the 6.2% consumer price index print. And the latest on the supply shortages. Keeping shelves stocked is “harder work than ever before”, the UK boss of Lidl has said as shortages of drivers, warehouse workers and food processing staff put pressure on grocery supply chains, reports our retail correspondent Sarah Butler. Christian Härtnagel, chief executive of the German discount chain’s British arm, said problems with availability of products in stores had eased in the past 10 to 12 weeks and “the worst times are behind us” but “daily hard work” was still required to ensure there were no gaps on shelves. He said the company was constantly having to seek new ways to work around problems, by simplifying ranges and other measures, as a combination of the pandemic, Brexit and trade disruption continued to affect businesses. And here is our story on David Cameron lobbying a Lloyds Banking Group director over the lender Greensill Capital, which has since collapsed. David Cameron lobbied a director of Lloyds Banking Group, whom the former prime minister had given a peerage, to reverse the bank’s decision to withdraw support from Greensill Capital, which it later did. Cameron appealed to James Lupton, a Conservative peer who had served as party treasurer and donated more than £3m to the Tories, to urge the bank not to withdraw funding from Greensill’s supply chain financing of NHS pharmacies. After his lobbying of Lord Lupton in January, the bank reconsidered its decision and agreed to continue providing financial support to Greensill, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the story. Here’s the latest on the fate of Bulb, from our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. Bulb Energy could be in the hands of an administrator within hours after the regulator applied to the courts for an advisory firm to run it after its collapse on Monday. Britain’s seventh-largest supplier is expected to become the first energy company to be placed into a “special administration” process so it can continue to provide gas and electricity to its 1.7 million customers through the winter after going bust on Monday. The provision for a special energy supplier administrator was first set in legislation in 2011 but has never been used, in part because previous supplier collapses have been small enough in scale to find a new buyer relatively quickly. Energy industry sources believe it could take “somewhere between six weeks and six months” for the fallout of the Bulb collapse to be resolved by the administrator and a team of banks, which are due to be appointed in the coming weeks. The energy regulator, Ofgem, has proposed that the global advisory firm Teneo take over the running of Bulb while the fate of gas and electricity customers is decided. A court hearing is expected to take place later on Wednesday before an appointment is confirmed. Ofgem urged Bulb customers not to worry and said they would “see no disruption to their supply, their price plan will remain the same and any outstanding credit balances, including money owed to customers who have recently switched, will be honoured”. Returning to the US GDP figures, they show that the economy slowed to a modest annual rate of 2.1% in the October-December quarter, slightly better than its first estimate, but down sharply from 6.7% in the second quarter. Economists are predicting a solid rebound in the current quarter as long as rising inflation and a recent uptick in Covid cases do not derail activity, AP reports. The small increase from the initial GDP estimate a month ago reflected a slightly better performance for consumer spending, which grew at a still lacklustre 1.7% rate in the third quarter, compared to a 12% surge in the April-June quarter. The contribution to GDP from business inventory restocking was also revised up. The economy’s weak summer performance reflected a big slowdown in consumer spending as a spike in Covid-19 cases from the delta variant caused consumers to grow more cautious and snarled supply chains made items such as new cars hard to get and also contributed to a burst of inflation to levels not seen in three decades. While Covid cases in recent weeks have started to rise again in many parts of the country, economists do not think the latest increase will be enough to dampen consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of economic activity. The expectation is that the economy in the current October-December quarter could grow at the strongest pace this year, possibly topping 8%. For the whole year, the expectation is that the economy will grow by around 5.5%, which would be the best showing since 1984 and a big improvement from last year, when the economy shrank by 3.4% as the country struggled with lockdowns. So far, the improving economy this year has not boosted the approval ratings of President Joe Biden because the US, with one of the most rapidly recovering economies, is also caught up in a global supply chain squeeze that is driving prices higher for everything from new cars and gasoline to the cost of food and airline tickets. Biden this week nominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for a second four-year term to head the central bank. Powell and other Fed officials had earlier in the year insisted that the spoke in pries was being caused by temporary factors, such as those snarled supply chains. However, recently the central bank has stressed that if the price increase persist it will be ready to start raising interest rates sooner than expected to slow growth as a way of dampening inflation pressures. More good news for the US economy: Initial jobless claims fell by 71,000 to 199,000 in the week to 20 November, the US Labor Department said. This was much better than the 260,000 expected by economists. This is the lowest level since November, 1969 when it was 197,000. The previous week’s level was revised up slightly, by 2,000 to 270,000. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of 2.1% in the third quarter, a tad higher than the 2% pace estimated a month ago, according to the US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. This comes after 6.7% growth in the previous quarter, due to a slowdown in consumer spending. BEA explains: A resurgence of Covid-19 cases resulted in new restrictions and delays in the reopening of establishments in some parts of the country. In the third quarter, government assistance payments in the form of forgivable loans to businesses, grants to state and local governments, and social benefits to households all decreased. Here is our full story on the CBI industrial trends survey. Britain’s factories are struggling to meet the record demand for their goods as severe supply constraints put a brake on production lines, the latest snapshot of industry has shown, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott. The CBI said manufacturers were running down their stocks of finished goods to meet the strongest order books since records began in 1977. Here is the latest on Bulb, one of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers with 1.7m household customers, which went bust on Monday. Britain’s energy regulator Ofgem has submitted a court application to appoint a special administrator for Bulb, and told Bulb customers not to worry. The regulator said: Ofgem has applied to the court to appoint a special administrator to run Bulb Energy Limited. Customers of Bulb do not need to worry. If a special administrator is appointed, they will see no disruption to their supply, their price plan will remain the same and any outstanding credit balances, including money owed to customers who have recently switched, will be honoured. The Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy said: Energy regulator Ofgem, with the government’s consent, has made an application to the court. We do not comment on ongoing court proceedings. The Special Administration Regime is long-standing, well-established mechanism to protect energy consumers and ensure continued energy supply when a supplier fails. US stock futures are also down ahead of the tsunami of US economic data at 1.30pm GMT, suggesting declines of 0.2% to 0.3% when Wall Street opens later. On the stock markets, the main European indices have turned negative again, while the FTSE 100 in London is still in positive territory, just about. UK’s FTSE 100 up 0.1% at 7,274 Germany’s Dax down 0.5% at 15,856 France’s CAC 40 down 0.1% at 7,035 Spain’s Ibex flat at 8,807 Italy’s FTSE MiB flat at 26,932 Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says about the CBI survey: Demand for goods still is increasing rapidly, leaving manufacturers struggling to keep up. Admittedly, the total orders balance overstates just how much demand increased in November, because it is not seasonally adjusted and nearly always falls in October, before bouncing back in November. Nonetheless, our seasonally adjusted version of the total orders balance rose 11 points in November to reach its highest level since records begin in 1977. Unfortunately, the relationship between the total orders balance and the official measure of manufacturing output is quite weak, because manufacturers are asked to compare orders to “normal levels”, and right now manufacturers cannot fulfil all orders. Even so, manufacturing output probably still has scope to rise further in Q4, as formerly-furloughed staff are recalled and as manufacturers invest to enhance productivity. Even if orders weaken next year, perhaps as restocking demand fizzles out, production will be supported by the large work backlogs that have accumulated this year. Meanwhile, resilient demand is enabling nearly all producers to hike their selling prices. Indeed, the output price expectations balance rose to +67—its highest level since May 1977—from +59 in October, consistent with core producer output price inflation rising to nearly 8.0% in January, from 6.5% in October. Core goods CPI inflation, therefore, still looks set to rise further over the next six months, helping to push the headline rate above 5% in the spring. Former bank of England rate-setter Andrew Sentance, a well-known hawk, and Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, tweet: Factory orders jumped this month, with growth hitting its highest level since at least 1977, according to the CBI. However, price expectations among manufacturers also climbed to a 44-year high, the business group’s monthly survey showed. The findings are likely to add to concerns at the Bank of England over mounting inflationary pressures ahead of its next meeting on 16 December. The CBI’s survey showed manufacturers’ monthly orders book balance jumped to 26% in November from 9% in October, marking the highest reading since the series started in April 1977. The balance deducts firms saying orders fell from those reporting order growth. Anna Leach, the CBI’s deputy chief economist, said: It’s good to see strong order books and output growth in the manufacturing sector holding up as we head into winter. But intense supply side challenges continue to put pressure on firms’ capacity to meet demand. The CBI’s measure of price expectations for the next three months climbed to 67% from 59% in October, the highest since May 1977. Stock levels of finished goods dwindled to the lowest on record, reflecting global supply chain bottlenecks and strong demand, as the economy rebounds from the pandemic slump. “Follow the science”: I was at the opening of AstraZeneca’s shiny new £1bn research &amp; development centre in Cambridge yesterday, which was unveiled by Prince Charles. The Discovery Centre (or DISC) houses 16 labs and 2,200 scientists, making it the biggest science lab in Britain along with the Francis Crick Institute in London. I’ve tracked AstraZeneca’s progress since 2014 when it fended off a hostile £69bn takeover approach from Pfizer. Mulberry shares jumped as much as 24%, and are still more than 22% higher, after the British handbag maker reported a return to pre-pandemic sales levels. It said its UK factories had allowed it to avoid the supply chain disruptions that have dogged some fashion rivals. Here is our full story: Britain is facing a Christmas booze shortage unless the government does more to ease the ongoing shortage of HGV drivers, a group of 48 wine and spirits companies have told the transport secretary, my colleague Rob Davies reports. In a letter to Grant Shapps, businesses including Pernod Ricard, Moët Hennessy and the Wine Society said rising costs and supply chain “chaos” had held up wine and spirit deliveries, raising the risk that supermarkets will run dry and festive deliveries arrive late. Members of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), which coordinated the letter, have reported it is taking up to five times longer to import products than a year ago, with two-day orders taking more than two weeks to process. Freight costs have increased by about 7%, the WSTA said, as delivery firms have had to raise HGV drivers’ wages to retain them, causing particular difficulty for small businesses that struggle to compete on salaries with larger rivals. It’s a different story in France, where business confidence has improved, with the business climate index from Insee rising to 114, well above the long-term average. Charlotte de Montpellier, economist for France and Switzerland at ING, sums up the findings: The improvement of the business climate shows that the French economy remains relatively well positioned in November, even if this is mainly due to the service sector, which is a major risk given the evolution of the pandemic. Inflationary pressures are stronger than ever. The increase is notable in both the industrial and service sectors. In the industrial sector, the increase is mainly due to growing order books, and mainly orders from abroad. In the services sector, the business climate is at its highest level since December 2000. The effects of the recovery are clearly being felt, with the balance of opinion of business leaders on activity over the last three months rising sharply to its highest level since 1990. Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, says the risks of stagnation or even recession for Germany at the turn of the year have clearly increased. Over the last few days, Germany has already introduced some stricter restrictions but is still far away from the Austrian situation. This could change soon. Not only has Austria been a very good leading indicator for what will happen in Germany in terms of infections and government measures, this morning’s news that the SPD, Greens and FDP have come to a coalition agreement could also bring change. Germany’s reaction to the fourth wave has suffered from a power vacuum, with the caretaking government not wanting to decide on stricter measures and the incoming government not ready yet, and possibly not really wanting to start a new era with tighter restrictions. The expected press conference of the leaders of the probable new government this afternoon could shed some light on potential next restrictions and measures. Returning to the economic outlook, the German economy was already suffering from ongoing supply chain frictions, higher inflation in general, and higher energy and commodity prices in particular. Industrial production actually shrank both in the second and third quarters, despite filled order books and low inventories. Sentiment in the German economy has worsened, according to a closely-watched survey from the Ifo research institute in Munich. The ifo business climate index fell from 97.7 points in October to 96.5 points in November, the lowest level since February, and marking the fifth month of declines. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation, and became more pessimistic about their prospects, amid supply bottlenecks and the fourth wave of the coronavirus. Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo institute, says: In German manufacturing, the index fell as companies assessed their current business as considerably worse. Their expectations, by contrast, brightened somewhat, especially due to developments in the automotive industry. Supply bottlenecks in intermediate products and raw materials still have a grip on the manufacturing sector and a majority of companies plan to raise prices. Sentiment in the service sector deteriorated noticeably. Skepticism grew substantially, especially as regards expectations. The last time the expectations indicator saw such a heavy decline was in November 2020. However, service providers were less satisfied with their current situation as well. The fourth coronavirus wave caused expectations to plunge especially in the tourism and hospitality industries. The index slid in trade because of greater pessimism in companies’ expectations, although they rated their current situation as somewhat improved. The mood in retail continues to suffer due to supply problems and prices are more likely to increase over the coming months. The business climate in Germany’s construction industry worsened slightly. Following the continuous upswing of recent months, expectations have turned more pessimistic. Companies judged their current situation to be somewhat better. Johnson Matthey shares have largely recovered from their earlier 8.3% fall and are now down 1.6% as investors are reassessing the company’s prospects. Nicholas Hyett, equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, has sent us his thoughts. The announcement earlier this month that Johnson Matthey would be exiting battery Materials raised questions about the group’s long-term future. That’s resulted in a £314m impairment in these results. But elsewhere there’s evidence that, in the here and now, the group’s core businesses are going from strength to strength. With automotive factories back up and running the group’s seen sales of its automotive catalysts boom – unsurprising in a world that’s increasingly focussed on reducing emissions wherever possible. The group’s started pitching for work on the new, and even tighter Euro 7 emissions standards, which should mean more complex catalysts attracting a higher share of overall automotive construction spend. There’s also been significant progress in the natural resources business, driven by platinum recycling, as increased demand boosted prices and volumes. Given a large portion of recycled platinum comes from old auto-catalysts the group’s long standing and financially powerful “circular economy” continues to tick along nicely. However, he added that there are only hints about what the group’s long-term solution to the end of the combustion engine age is. Electric cars don’t need catalysts and clean air accounts for over half of operating profits, throw recycling of old auto-catalyst into the mix and the total exposure to automotive market is huge. There are some signs of progress in the hydrogen and industrial catalyst markets, but planned sales of the advanced glass and health businesses make the group more dependent on automotive rather than less. With capital coming back to shareholders through buybacks rather than being reinvested in new “growth areas” we worry about whether management has a solution to the electric car threat. It may be some years away but it can’t be ignored. Johnson Matthey, one of the UK’s biggest chemicals companies, has warned that its decision to pull out of the electric battery materials market will cost it £314m. This drove it to a loss before tax of £9m in the six months to 30 September, compared with a profit of £26m a year earlier. Sales rose 23% to £8.6bn as the company benefited from higher precious metals prices and underlying operating profits more than doubled to £293m, ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Robert MacLeod, the chief executive, is stepping down after eight years in the role, and will be succeeded on 1 March by Liam Condon, an Irishman who heads up crop science at the German chemicals firm Bayer. Johnson Matthey warned that the supply chain crisis, especially the shortage of semi-conductors, was hitting production for its car and truck customers, while precious metal prices had also declined. This means full-year profits will be lower than expected. The news sent its shares down more than 8% in early trading. The firm said: Demand remains strong in many of our end markets. However, supply chain volatility especially the shortage of semi-conductors is affecting production for a number of our auto and truck customers. Global auto production is now forecast to decline 5% for our fiscal year which is a 14% reduction since our trading update in July. Consequently, precious metal prices have also declined, largely because of the lower demand from the automotive industry. We are also experiencing acute temporary labour shortages in the US that are adversely impacting our Health business. The firm makes most of its money from producing catalytic converters to clean exhaust emissions from petrol and diesel cars. Britain’s hopes to grab a slice of the fast-growing market for electric vehicle batteries was deal a blow by Johnson Matthey’s decision to exit a fortnight ago. The company explained that it was too far behind rivals who are already making batteries at gigantic scale. Samsung has said it will build a $17bn (£12.7bn) semiconductor factory in Texas, amid a global shortage of chips used in cars, phones and other electronic devices. The plant just outside of Austin would be the South Korean company’s biggest US investment and is expected to be operational in the second half of 2024. Samsung had also considered sites in Arizona and New York for the factory, which will be much bigger than its only other US chip plant, also in Austin. Samsung said the new facility would boost production of high-tech chips used for 5G mobile communications, advanced computing and artificial intelligence, and also improve supply chain resilience. The Financial Times has a great scoop: it’s reporting that David Cameron lobbied Lloyds Banking Group to reverse a decision to cut ties with the ailing lender Greensill Capital, appealing to a board member whom he had ennobled while prime minister. Cameron lobbied Lloyds in January, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter, when he contacted Lord James Lupton, a director of the bank who had previously been a Conservative party treasurer, and succeeded in persuading the bank to carry on doing business with Greensill. Lupton, Tory treasurer from 2013 to 2016, has donated more than £3m to the Conservative party and was appointed to the House of Lords in 2015, sparking accusations of cronyism against then-prime minister Cameron from rival politicians. The scandal surrounding Greensill, which has since collapsed, has spread throughout Westminster with allegations the lender was given preferential treatment. On the stock markets, the FTSE 100 index has pushed 37 points higher to 7,304, a 0.52% gain. Germany’s Dax is up 13 points at 15,950, pretty much flat, while France’s CAC has gained 0.5% to 7,079 and Italy’s FTSE MiB is 0.66% ahead at 27,116. The British handbag maker Mulberry said sales had returned to pre-Covid levels, up 34% to £65.7m in the six months to 25 September. It made a half-year profit before tax of £10.2m versus a loss of £2.4m a year earlier, partly boosted by a one-off profit on the disposal of a Paris lease. The company cut its workforce last year when sales suffered badly during Covid lockdowns. Mulberry has just launched “The Lowest Carbon collection”, crafted from the world’s lowest carbon leather and using a local supply chain. It has also launched a resale programme “Preloved Bags” to boost its sustainability credentials. New bags include the Sadie, a satchel with a Typography lock, and the Billie bag, with a “youthful crossbody slouchy silhouette”. Mulberry has been trying to connect with younger customers. Amid a global supply chain crisis, Mulberry is confident, as its two Somerset factories supply half of its handbags. Thierry Andretta, the chief executive, says: The bold decisions we have taken with regards to focussing on our UK production capabilities, means that we are well placed for the festive trading period and beyond. The German discount supermarket chain Lidl is ramping up its expansion in the UK as it reported a 12% rise in revenues to £7.7bn in the year to 28 February, despite the pandemic. It made a profit before tax of £9.8m compared with a loss of £25.2m in the previous year. Lidl has raised its store target to 1,100 by the end of 2025, creating up to 4,000 new jobs. It opened 55 stores over the year, taking the total to 880, and says it is on track to reach 1,000 stores by the end of 2023, its previous target. The company said it had repaid more than £100m in business rates relief it received during the pandemic, mirroring moves by other supermarkets that performed well during the crisis, unlike other businesses. Christian Härtnagel, the chief executive of Lidl GB, said: We continue to see tremendous opportunity in the market and that is why today we are announcing our new target of 1,100 stores by the end of 2025. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Turkish lira has weakened again this morning towards a record low that it hit against the dollar yesterday, after the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan signalled that he would not be deterred by rising inflation from cutting interest rates further. The lira is down 2% against the dollar at 12.95 after closing at 12.7 on Tuesday, when it fell as low as 13.45. It has lost more than 40% of its value this year. The Turkish president, who had declared himself an “enemy” of high borrowing costs, defended the four percentage point cut in interest rates this year to 15%. He said it would spur investment, increase job prospects and boost economic growth. However, amid concerns that his unorthodox management of the economy was likely to deter investment and increase inflation above the 20% level recorded in October, investors took flight. Some banks across the country stopped currency transactions yesterday, fearing that the steep fall in the lira’s value could spark a run on reserves, according to local newspaper reports. There was also speculation that the government had laid plans to impose strict capital controls to prevent further withdrawals should the economic situation worsen. With the US closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, we will get a tsunami of economic announcements today, including the second estimate for third-quarter GDP and culminating in the release of the latest Federal Reserve minutes. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: While the minutes aren’t likely to deliver too much in the way of surprises they could act as a decent insight into the deliberations of the FOMC into the decision-making process when it came to deciding the amount of the initial taper. While the initial reduction of asset purchases was widely expected, an initial monthly reduction of $10bn in Treasuries, and $5bn in mortgage-backed securities, it will be interesting to find out how many FOMC members wanted to go faster. This will be especially pertinent given how the committee was evenly split on raising rates next year, when it last met. We already know that there a number of Fed officials who are uneasy at the pace of price rises, and there does appear to be significant disagreement about how persistent some of these price pressures are. Today’s minutes could show where these divisions are, with today’s economic numbers giving added fuel to the argument for a faster taper when the Fed meets next month. Before that we get to see the latest revision of US Q3 GDP which is expected to see a modest upward adjustment to 2.2%, from 2%. In Asia, stock markets were mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei falling 1.6% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng edged 0.2% higher. European stock markets are expected to open higher, bringing some respite to Germany’s Dax which has fallen for four days amid a fourth wave of coronavirus infections, while the FTSE 100 index in London posted a modest gain for the second day this week.

          "bodyText": "Top story: Problems pile up for Johnson Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today. Boris Johnson is facing serious questions about his competence and drive from Conservative MPs after he gave a rambling speech to business leaders yesterday and was accused of losing his grip over a series of policies from social care to rail. After a backbench rebellion over the controversial social care cap continued a run of chaotic policy U-turns and embarrassments, dismay increased after his performance at the CBI conference in South Shields. Johnson lost his place for an excruciating 20 seconds, and diverted into a lengthy tangent about his trip to Peppa Pig World and being motoring correspondent for GQ, complete with car noises. A former cabinet minister said there was “an accumulation of things building up, really relating to his competence and that is beginning to look very shaky”. One of the government’s growing problems is how to stem the flow of migrants across the Channel and it has emerged that home secretary Priti Patel is coming under “immense pressure” from No 10 to do more on this touchstone issue. * * * Care rebellion– MPs have passed a controversial amendment to England’s social care cap which will disproportionately hit poorer pensioners, despite a rebellion from backbenchers. The change means that council contributions to care fees would not go towards the cap, meaning that people who receive means-tested help would end up paying the same as wealthier people if they needed care for a significant amount of time. The exchequer stands to save £900m a year by 2027, but analysts say it could be “catastrophic” for poorer homeowners, who might be forced to sell their homes to fund care. The vote passed by 272 to 246, a majority of 26. * * * Depression therapy – Millions of people with mild depression in England should be offered therapy, exercise, mindfulness or meditation before antidepressants, according to the first new NHS guidelines in more than a decade. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) recommends the “menu of treatment options” be offered to patients by health professionals before medication is considered. Currently, those with mild depression are offered antidepressants or a high-intensity psychological intervention, such as cognitive behavioural therapy. * * * Workforce shrinks – The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has made Britain’s workforce smaller, younger and more female after a sharp rise in people leaving work during lockdown. The Resolution Foundation said the number of people who had exited the workforce and were no longer looking for a job had increased. Around 586,000 older workers had opted for early retirement. Young people and women have taken the hardest psychological and financial hit from the pandemic, according to a YouGov survey taken in 27 countries.

          "bodyText": "“Quiet on set, please!” They are not the words you might expect to hear at a theatre, but these are not usual times. Behind the stage and cosy velvet auditorium of the National Theatre’s Lyttelton venue, we are in a dark, cavernous complex overrun with wires and scaffolding, where the film Death of England: Face to Face is being shot. Light falls through the windows of a makeshift flat where Delroy (played by Hamilton’s Giles Terera) is reconciling with his friend Michael (Utopia’s Neil Maskell) after a longstanding feud. The characters reflect on the tumultuous events of the day, before Michael takes Delroy’s baby daughter back to her mother. “I’ll have her back in your loving arms before it gets dark – just chillax,” Michael tells her on the phone. The dialogue continues but the baby’s unscripted wails prompt a “cut!” from director Clint Dyer. The film, broadcast on Sky Arts this week, takes Dyer and co-writer Roy Williams’s Death of England saga – which has included two acclaimed stage plays – back to its original form: film. The series began with a microplay made with the Royal Court for the Guardian’s website in 2014, following a grieving son (played by Rafe Spall) who gives an alcohol-induced, no-holds-barred speech at his father’s funeral. “It came off the back of England’s disastrous performance in the World Cup in 2014,” explains Williams. “They stank the house out – they were bloody awful!” It became a metaphor: not just how a football team may be viewed but a whole nation. Around the same time, Williams started hearing the word “Brexit”. The microplay’s title, Death of England, is “kind of how I felt – yeah, this country is going to die”. That short film was later expanded for a monologue of the same name performed by Spall at the National’s Dorfman theatre at the start of 2020, followed by a sequel at the NT later that year. Face to Face is a feature film “but we’re telling it in a very theatrical way,” says Dyer. “So now we’re harnessing both mediums.” It is the second film to be created solely for the screen by the National since the pandemic began. Simon Godwin’s production of Romeo and Juliet aired in spring. “The National was desperate to still employ all the people that it had employed for the original [stage] production of Romeo and Juliet,” says Dyer, who is the NT’s deputy artistic director. “The only way to keep it moving was to film it. And so the idea was to try and use the Lyttelton as a film studio.” The success of Romeo and Juliet led them to consider the same treatment for Face to Face. The first stage sequel, the monologue Death of England: Delroy, was also affected by the coronavirus shutdown, which led to it closing early. “It ended on its first night,” explains Dyer. But there was a silver lining as that monologue was later streamed. “We won because thousands more people saw it … That was what really encouraged Rufus Norris [the National’s artistic director] to accept our crazy idea. I’m not sure if I’ve seen a film made in the same form. It’s a proper arthouse film, innit!” “Originally, we thought we’d get kickback against some of the things we were saying,” says Dyer of the Death of England stage productions’ exploration of nationalism and identity. “But what we really found across the board was that people could tell that whatever we were saying was done with love – there’s an emphasis and an understanding inside it – none of it is done out of trying to poke the finger,” Dyer adds. After Death of England, the pair found they had so much material that they could tell a story from the point of view of Delroy, the black best friend of Spall’s character, Michael. “As we wrote it, Delroy’s story came out, which is just as important – we gave it as much time as Michael’s,” says Williams. Death of England: Delroy was originally to star Giles Terera, but illness led him to be replaced on stage by Michael Balogun for a monologue that in part responded to the Black Lives Matter movement. Delroy, with an ankle tracker, recounts being unjustly arrested when en route to the hospital for the birth of his daughter. With Delroy’s story told, Williams explains that the next step was to “put them in the same room. Michael’s told his bit, Delroy’s told his bit – we want to hear them tell all that stuff to each other now.” Death of England, in its various instalments, is a story about class, race, British identity and sport – more relevant than ever in light of the Euro 2020 racism and cricket’s current crisis. “It’s impossible to talk about ‘Britishness’ or ‘blackness’ without talking about what is considered the opposite – as in ‘whiteness’,” says Dyer. Yet, Death of England is among the few works to have a black character talk into the sensibilities of a white character, and vice versa. Delroy and Michael’s lenses are effectively those of the real-life experiences of Dyer and Williams – both growing up as black working class and predominately among the white working class. Williams feels that he is “living in country that’s saying all the right things but not doing the right things to make me – and other people like me – feel equal. It’s what led me to want to write these stories.” For Dyer, the Death of England series is “the same conversation that I’ve been having in my work forever” but the difference is that “the response to my work has changed … I think that people are able to hear it in a more nuanced way than ever before.” The stories have become intertwined with the pandemic and Face to Face takes place during the January lockdown. Has Covid brought about newer and more inventive ways to create art? “I know it’s given voices to a lot of people that didn’t have voices before,” says Dyer. “I know that it pushed us to create in a way that we’ve never created before. I think most theatres would say that that was a fact. I hope one day when we’re really out of this that we can look back and applaud some of the amazing courage that was shown.” Death of England: Face to Face is on Sky Arts on 25 November."

          "bodyText": "Japan’s government is hoping that children’s fascination with bodily functions will help them appreciate the importance of paying taxes when they reach adulthood. Years after he fuelled huge sales of school textbooks, Unko-sensei [Professor Poo] has been enlisted by the finance ministry’s tax agency to appear in a brochure as part of a campaign to engender an appreciation of the role of the treasury among the nation’s youngest citizens. The character, who is shaped like the eponymous emoji and sports a handlebar moustache and round spectacles, explores topics such as the consumption tax – a 10% levy on goods and services children pay every time they buy a bag of sweets. One of the questions he poses to children in the brochure is: what do poo and tax have in common? The answer: fertiliser, since both are used to grow things. The character behind the brochure, which is to be distributed to primary schools across Japan, will be familiar to millions of children who have him to thank for their ability to memorise hundreds of kanji characters. A series of kanji study books featuring Unko-sensei became a hit when they were released in 2017 by the Bunkyosha publishing company. The books have sold around 5 million copies, according to the publisher, meaning that two in every three Japanese primary schoolchildren own a copy. The scatology-inspired Unko Doriru (poo drills) exercise books proved so popular that officials in the rarefied corridors of the finance ministry were reportedly receptive when Bunkyosha’s founder, former Lehman Brothers employee Shuji Yamamoto, approached them with the idea. Now they are banking on Unko-sensei doing for tax what he has already done for kanji components and stroke orders. “We hope the drills prompt elementary school students to take an early interest in taxes,” a ministry official told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper."

          "headline": "Cafes are scrambling for staff, while other economic ruptures lie hidden",
          "bodyText": "When Sandy Green, the owner of Green Refectory, a popular cafe in Melbourne’s inner north, advertised a job before the Covid pandemic, she could expect a flood of applicants. Nowadays, as economies roar out of lockdown, the tables appear to have turned. “We’ll put up an ad on our website or in our window, and where we might have had 60 applicants, we’ll have one or two applicants,” Green says. “It’s a drastic change.” Similar tales are also playing out in Sydney, a city that had a headstart of a few weeks on the Victorian capital in easing restrictions. “We need four people – two on the floor and two in the kitchen,” said Alex Gomez, an assistant manager at the Canopy, a “rustic chic” restaurant beside Hyde Park in Sydney’s CBD. “It’s hard and complicated to find people.” A couple of blocks away, Japanese restaurant Inase has just reopened for dinner after renovations timed fortuitously for the lockdown. Staff would love to open a lunch shift but just can’t find the eight waiters and chefs they need. Similar tales are likely to constrain the hospitality industry for months, if not longer. One reason is the industry relied heavily on students – particularly international ones in the main cities – and other short-term visitors. The surge in labour demand extends across many sectors and regions, and had Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe this week predicting the jobless rate looks to be headed to 4% by 2023 from 5.2% last month. That rate would be the lowest since the early 1970s, and a level the central bank has “little historical experience” of dealing with in terms of accompanying inflationary pressures if wages spike too. How the scramble for staff plays out has implications for interest rates, particularly for mortgage holders who have taken on extra debt during the past year’s 25% run-up in Australia’s house prices. It may also frame the federal election, with the Morrison government this week keen to talk up a “jobs boom”. Labor looks set to challenge that reading, with leader Anthony Albanese saying: “We need more jobs, but we also need more secure jobs.” Employer groups have demanded borders be reopened and for the migrant intake to be expanded. On the latter score, consultancy group EY recently estimated that by 2024 Australia’s population was projected to be smaller by about 800,000 because of the dent in migration caused by Covid. Labour shortages loom in a host of industries from software to construction because of the absence of those skilled immigrants. “We are seeing an increasing number of firms reporting the lack of suitable workers,” Jo Masters, EY’s Oceania chief economist, said. Many economists including Masters had expected the rebound from the extended shutdowns after the Delta strain arrived to be more muted than the first Covid wave. However, a host of data – from firms acting to secure staff before lockdowns lifted to increased credit-card spending on gyms, travel and other services – indicates the second revival may match the first. “We’ve seen what we saw last time, which is the economy coming back in a really jobs-rich recovery,” Masters said. Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is among those seeking a return of migration. He estimates Australia needs as many as 200,000 skilled arrivals a year if “we want to realise our economic potential”. “The internet vacancy index released by the National Skills Commission earlier this week recorded more than 250,000 job vacancies, the highest level in 13 years,” McKellar said. “With job vacancies figures expected to rise to 280,000 by the end of the year, the tremendous pressure we’re seeing in the labour market is going to hinder businesses from operating at full capacity.” However, while the mood may be picking up, it’s far from universal. The shop windows in the central business districts of Melbourne and Sydney belie the boom, with many “for lease” signs their only display. “If you look all around the world, as restrictions ease, you are seeing quite similar patterns, and that is office occupancy gets back to about 75% but stalls around there,” Masters said. While workers wanted “the magic” of in-person collaboration, they have also enjoyed the convenience of working from home and wished to retain some of that. The drop in overall traffic matches what the experience of Elly Bruin, the manager of Patricia, a cafe in Melbourne’s CBD. While customer loyalty has bolstered her turnover, having fewer competitors helps too. “We’re actually kind of thriving,” she said. “But we have noticed some [new] people coming in saying a lot is closed around here, like new faces that we’ve never seen before. So I think they’re coming here because they know we’re still open.” For Waan Bransgrove, operator of the KnickKnack Cafe in central Sydney, revenue is barely meeting their $5,000 a month rental bill. “We just feel helpless,” she said, as she shut up for the day on a recent afternoon. “I’ve never felt so deflated in my life.” “The CBD worker is a dinosaur,” her husband, David, said, adding they planned to exit their shop by the end of the year. “I’m absolutely confident [business] is never coming back.” For Brad Chan, chief executive of the Banna Property Group and a leading advocate for Sydney’s Chinatown, there’s little talk of labour shortages as the outlook for many companies is dire. “You’re either struggling or you’ve lost a lot of money or you’ve lost the lot,” said Chan, a third-generation property owner in an area he described as “the opposite of vibrant”. The absence of Chinese tourists and students had only served to highlight a long-term neglect of the historic Haymarket region, he said. “Chinatown needs some attention now – or rather, yesterday.” That hospitality outlets can be in fierce competition for staff even as shopping centres are pockmarked by shop closures hints at underlying problems with the industry, according to a common refrain among those Guardian Australia spoke to. Gomez at the Canopy, for instance, worked in human relations in France before moving to Australia two-and-a-half years ago. Once his English is up to scratch, he would happily return to that profession. “It’s hard to have a personal life” with the long hours and weekend shifts, he said. “It’s good when you’re a student.” Kathryn Frances formerly worked in bars in Ascot Vale in Melbourne’s inner north-west, but found it hard to cover her living expenses even before the pandemic. “From bartenders, supervisors, assistant managers – they need people to fill them all,” Frances said. “But at the same time for the bar staff, they can’t really promise regular and consistent hours, so it’s really difficult for people who are trying to get a full-time wage. “Like the max I was really able to take home a week was about $500 to $600,” she said of her recent employment in the sector. “There is plenty of bar jobs available but the available hours are actually a joke. You can be hard-pressed to get more than 16 hours when you are hoping to work full-time.” Richard Denniss, chief economist of the Australia Institute, said the pandemic and its aftermath should prompt the public and policymakers to reconsider whose responsibility it was to train employees and how they should be rewarded. “You won’t see it in any [economic] textbook, but it’s not a labour shortage,” he said. “It’s a wage shortage.”"

          "headline": "‘It’s typical’: Transpennine ‘express’ passengers voice cynicism over Boris Johnson’s rail plans",
          "bodyText": "Few travellers would disagree that the Transpennine Express makes for a splendid journey across the rugged spine of northern England, snaking through beautiful green valleys and picturesque stone villages, from Manchester Piccadilly to Leeds railway station. But perhaps many would quibble with the use of the word “express”. It took just over an hour to traverse the 35 miles between the two cities on the 08.30 from Manchester on Friday – less an intercity bullet train than a rural heritage experience. The long-promised high-speed link was intended to cut the time to 25 minutes, but last week the government announced that it had abandoned those plans, along with the HS2 eastern section to Leeds. On the quarter-full 8.30, the news inspired no great surprise and a certain amount of head-shaking frustration. “It’s typical,” said Maggie, a legal worker. “It’s the southern establishment deciding against the north again.” Two distinct but related ideas about the north have featured in the various Conservative administrations since 2010. The first was the much-heralded”northern powerhouse”, which George Osborne promoted when he was chancellor. That initiative envisioned the north’s main cities rivalling the south-east by banding together to maximise their strength. And then in 2019, Boris Johnson made inroads into Labour’s northern strongholds, partly by committing to “level up” by redistributing power and wealth towards a region that has suffered a shortage of both. Neither policy appeared to be advanced by last week’s announcement. “It’s certainly a counter-productive move in terms of levelling up,” said Andy Whiting, an operations manager, who, like Maggie, was taking the opportunity to work on his laptop as the train stopped at the old mill town of Stalybridge on its leisurely progress eastwards. The decision to backtrack on rail modernisation comes on the back of a difficult period for the government, following the ill-fated move to save Owen Paterson and the ensuing allegations of sleaze. Both events could affect Conservative backing in the north. “I was beginning to wonder what it would take for this government to lose the electorate’s support,” said Maggie. But neither Whiting nor Phil Weaver, a motoring executive, thought that the stories of Tory former ministers and MPs earning large sums in second jobs would change voting intentions. “It’s just politics,” said Weaver, while Whiting believed that if Keir Starmer were elected, his government would be facing a similar crisis within 18 months. At Leeds station, passengers appeared to be less forgiving. Although the city has been promised a new transit system, it has been somewhat removed from the high-speed map. Not only has the HS2 leg north of the East Midlands been scrapped, but the Leeds-Manchester link had been due to go through Bradford, a city even less well served by transport. “It’s pretty appalling really,” said Heather Heath, a music educator from Huddersfield. Originally from Essex, she had witnessed a steady decline in services and cultural life in the 30 years she’d been living in the north. “The gap between north and south is getting wider and wider, and this decision will only increase it,” she said. The phrase “northern powerhouse” was guaranteed to prompt cynical laughter, rather as if a visitor had gone to the Scottish Highlands and inquired about the Loch Ness monster. “If you believe in that,” said Peter, a septuagenarian who disembarked with a bicycle, “you’re a bigger fool than I took you for.” Graham, who works for the NHS, took a solid Yorkshire line that could probably be traced back to the Wars of the Roses. “The Northern Powerhouse?” he asked rhetorically. “That means Manchester. Leeds and Yorkshire in general are always left out of everything.” He said that Leeds often felt cut off and neglected, and complained that getting to Manchester was invariably a trial, with either snarled-up motorways or delayed or cancelled trains. “But maybe that’s just me being bitter about their success in football,” he said. Both Peter and his friend John had decided not to concern themselves with rail policy on the grounds, they explained with faultless logic, that they’d be dead before any of the plans were completed. “And in the meantime, we’d have to put up with all the disruption,” said John. Levelling up was, he concluded, “just Boris Johnson again telling people what they want to hear”. With that they both cycled off, clearly happy to be free of the train. Only half of one per cent of Leeds inhabitants visit Manchester in a year. And the same the other way round. What is striking was how many people stated that a) they didn’t use rail travel very much, finding it expensive, unreliable and time-consuming and b) didn’t think that the Conservatives would suffer too badly from breaking a firmly established promise – two years ago Johnson pledged to fund the Leeds to Manchester route. Whether or not the gathering cracks in the futuristic vision of a northern powerhouse will reverse the damage inflicted on the “red wall” remains to be seen. “To be honest,” said a despairing Adele Syrat in Leeds station, “Johnson seems able to do anything and get away with it.” That may have been true up until the Paterson affair. But the prime minister has now learned that he can go too far. He may yet discover that in ditching a high-speed rail line to Leeds, it’s also possible to not go far enough."

Or, to use a different metaphor: I was treading water in what I saw as a glorious and expanding sea of media, such a contrast to the options of my rural youth, when my choices were severely limited by the options at the video rental store, extended cable and the one CD a month I could afford on babysitting money. Of course, elements of my access were either illegal (BitTorrent) or paid the artist very little (Spotify). But I also felt, very much like the 27-year-old I was, that I had finally achieved a sort of comfortable fluency, the kind that allowed me to always answer “Yes” when someone inevitably asked: “Have you seen/read/heard this? Soon, the definition and number of television shows that felt essential – or “quality” or part of the larger conversation – began to grow. It wasn’t enough to have watched The Wire and The Sopranos and be caught up with Mad Men and Breaking Bad. There was The Americans and The Good Wife, Outlander and The Knick, Game of Thrones and Homeland, Broadchurch and Happy Valley, plus all the ongoing seasons of shows that previously felt very important (see: House of Cards) but increasingly felt like a slog. Maintaining my fluency was getting harder and harder: I was a media studies professor who was able to devote hours of my ostensible working day to the task of consuming media. I was still falling far behind, and more so every day. In discussing my struggle to metabolise what felt like a never-ending meal, I’m focusing on television. But television was just part of the larger, overwhelming feast. Around the time television options began to expand, so too did the supply (and our access) to so many other forms of culture, from YouTube to digital mixtapes. In 2009, for example, 7 million people worldwide were using Spotify, with its seemingly infinite musical access; by 2014, that number had ballooned to 60 million. Also in 2009, the teen YouTuber known as “Fred” became the first to have his channel hit one million subscribers. By 2014, a new YouTube channel was reaching that milestone every day. By 2012, 10 hours of music and audio were being uploaded every minute to SoundCloud, leapfrogging traditional production and distribution methods. In 2010, around 1,500 podcasts launched on iTunes every month. By 2015, it was nearly 6,000. But something about the way television consumption standards expanded made it seem more overwhelming. Maybe it had something to do with how hard it became to have a shared conversation about a show: with my friends, who all seemed to be embarking down different pathways; or with my students, who didn’t seem to be watching anything at all; or even online, where the cherished art of the episode recap seemed less and less useful. Part of this phenomenon could be blamed on Netflix, which in 2013 began its now standard practice of releasing the whole of a season at one time. Another factor was the continued, slow-motion decline of media monoculture, first set in motion with the spread of cable in the 1980s. Technology made it easier to make more television and, through on-demand, for people to watch more of it. Cue: 389 scripted television shows airing in the US alone in 2014 – compared with just 182 in 2002. It was around this time that critics started asking if we’d reached “peak TV”. From the Guardian, in 2015: “Four hundred shows and no time to watch them: is there too much TV on television?” From the New York Times: “Is there too much TV to choose from?” And from NPR: “Is there really too much TV?” A survey commissioned by Hub Entertainment Research found that 42% of viewers who watched at least five hours a week thought there was too much television in 2014. But that survey also found something fascinating: 81% of viewers reported that the time they did spend watching television, they spent watching shows they really liked. To anyone who grew up sharing a television with their family and choosing from anywhere between three to 15 good options, this is a real change. Instead of spending your Thursday night watching a rerun of a sitcom you never really liked in the first place just to have something on before Friends starts, you’re watching something you chose and, at least theoretically, continue to choose. There are limits, however, to the pleasures of choice. When Hub Entertainment Research asked the question again in 2017, only 73% responded that they were spending their time watching shows they really liked – while the percentage of people who felt that there was “too much television” went from 42% to 49%. The survey didn’t ask respondents to dig into their reasoning, but maybe they were feeling something similar to what I felt at that point: like half the things I was watching, I was watching out of some odd completist tendency; and the other half I was watching because it felt as if I “should”, particularly if I wanted to continue to be part of some imagined online cultural conversation. The result was a mix of resentment and paralysis. I would watch two episodes of a show and bail, simply because I didn’t want to commit to the entire season. Wading through the streaming menus felt akin to babysitting hundreds of small children, all of them clawing at me, desperate for my attention. Whenever I saw a poster in the subway for yet another new show that I’d somehow never heard of, I wanted to graffiti it. How dare these networks produce so many things, in so many forms, with so many seasons! How dare they produce so much content! Of course, that sentiment was wholly irrational and entirely wrong. “Peak TV” meant more television shows, but it also meant more shows directed at people who weren’t me, AKA people who weren’t middle-class, straight white ladies. The history of television is, in some ways, the history of executives figuring out that people other than white people can spend. Black people spend money, for example, and would you believe that gay people spend money, too? But the thing about Netflix is that – unlike, say, a network – it wasn’t trying to attract a type of viewer that it could then sell to an advertiser, because there were no advertisers. Instead, Netflix was just trying to have enough content, catering to enough interests, that it could convince as many people as possible that they should continue to pay for its services every month. To make itself ever more valuable to ever more people, Netflix began employing their massive datasets, gleaned from the watch histories of millions of customers, to give flailing consumers a way to stay afloat. When you logged on, instead of feeling overwhelmed, you were supposed to feel comforted by the fact that the screen showed you what was popular, and what other viewers like you were watching, and what you had been watching. It was supposed to feel organised yet abundant; contained but appealingly infinite. Maybe that’s how it felt to you. It’s certainly not how it felt to me. At the time, I was burning out hard at my job, working myself into the ground in an attempt to find the sort of stability I hadn’t really felt since that studio apartment in Austin. Back then, I would finish my day of writing with a movie, or a couple of hours of the latest show I’d torrented, or even live music. It felt like a bookend, like an exhale, like an actual break. By 2017, all that media felt like another item on my endless to-do list, as obligatory and joyless as picking up the dry-cleaning. So I did what I’ve done when it comes to so many of the causes fuelling a wider sense of burnout: I lowered the bar, then I lowered it again. I have stopped listening to most podcasts, save the ones that I really, really like. When I watch TV, it’s a mix of things I actually enjoy and give me comfort, regardless of coolness or quality (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit), shows that reactivate the anticipation and glory of the weekly appointment watch (Succession), and shows I arrive at a week, a month or a year late. I detest the Spotify algorithm, but delight in music that comes to me the old-fashioned way: by people I know telling me about it. I crave the escape of a movie theatre, and will come back to it soon – but I’ve also stopped feeling guilty about a pandemic aversion to movies. That love and hunger will return. Feeling bad about it won’t make it happen faster. If someone were to give me that survey, today, asking whether or not there’s too much television, or even just too much media, I’d say no. I’m glad there’s so much out there to press other people’s buttons, to prompt them to watch and rewatch, to make them feel seen and celebrated. I hope there’s more weird and esoteric and experimental stuff that challenges our understanding of what art can do, and I hope there are more shows like Ted Lasso that remind us of our steady craving for tenderness. I hope, in other words, that there’s more, even if that more isn’t always for me."

          "headline": "Cricket Australia undermines itself with confusing messages over Tim Paine",
          "bodyText": "Tim Paine’s captaincy of the Australian men’s cricket team ended with a familiar scene on Friday – a flood of tears and a scripted apology. Paine, whose text messages to a work colleague in 2017 have now come to light, was full of regret as he announced he would be standing down from the Test captaincy. While Paine’s actions instantly caused a storm around the nation, presumably there are more details yet to come to light. As such there is little to be gained from speculating further on what transpired. What we do know is that Cricket Australia conducted an internal investigation in mid-2018 when they first became aware of the incident. The investigation concluded that Paine had not breached CA’s code of conduct and was free to continue in the captain’s role that he had taken on just months earlier after the infamous sandpaper scandal. Presumably the national body hoped that would be the last anyone would hear of the text messages. The investigation took place behind closed doors and ended favourably for their captain so it could be filed away neatly into the ever-expanding filing cabinet marked “Scandals – non-career ending”. But these things have a way of coming to public attention – it would be naïve to assume the messages would never emerge. And so CA chair Richard Freudenstein’s inconsistent statement is quite baffling, considering the time CA have had to prepare for this day. Freudenstein noted that the board has accepted Paine’s resignation, before going on to acknowledge that he was cleared of any breach of the code of conduct during the 2018 investigation. He then stated: “CA does not condone this type of language or behaviour. Despite the mistake he made, Tim has been an exceptional leader since his appointment and the board thanks him for his distinguished service.” This throws the whole situation into confusing territory. If CA does not condone this behaviour, why is it acceptable under their code of conduct? If the incident is serious enough that Paine is stepping down, why wasn’t he found to be in breach of the code at the time? Are the actions serious enough that they are not befitting of a captain, but acceptable for any other player? It’s an overly cautious approach from an organisation that usually holds itself to much higher standards. In some ways that’s to be expected – the leadership of CA has changed considerably since the investigation took place. But that very fact also presents an opportunity to show the work that has been done since that time. This was the moment to put their hand up and say, “We got this wrong. We have evolved as an organisation since then and we are working to ensure this situation never happens again.” A statement along those lines may well be coming, but it could be too late. The initial impact has been felt, the public have made their judgements and there is the potential for significant fall out. How safe, for example, will women now feel applying for roles in cricket knowing that this behaviour doesn’t breach the code of conduct? It appears CA have undermined their own investigation by not taking a stronger stance. If they have confidence that the outcome they reached in 2018 was the correct one, they could have refused to accept Paine’s resignation and fronted the media with him to explain their rigorous processes and their belief in his suitability to continue on as captain. Instead they have taken an approach that is neither here nor there. Refusing to condemn Paine’s actions, but not condoning them either. Allowing Paine to step down from the captaincy, but making it clear he is still available for selection. Some good may yet come from this – the public reaction may prompt more meticulous standards on workplace behaviour within CA and its state organisations. There may be a re-examining of the code of conduct and a clearer set of guidelines for all employees about what constitutes acceptable workplace behaviour. But by not playing a shot upfront and letting this incident go through to the keeper before considering its stance, CA has lost an opportunity to establish itself as a forward-thinking, progressive organisation. They must hope it doesn’t take another scandal for that opportunity to present itself again."

          "headline": "British soldiers to give more support to Poland amid Belarus border crisis",
          "bodyText": "A hundred British military engineers are to provide practical support to help Poland tighten up its eastern border with Belarus, where thousands of migrants had been attempting to cross in often freezing temperatures. The plan was confirmed by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on a visit to Warsaw, in which he said Belarus was making a “conscious attempt” to destabilise Poland and all of Europe by encouraging migrants to the border. “The best way to respond is to work together hand in hand, not only within Nato, but simply as good friends and partners,” Wallace said, and accused Belarus’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, of a “disgusting attempt to use people as a weapon”. A small team of British soldiers completed a study visit on Thursday and are working up detailed plans to strengthen the border fence, which has been repeatedly breached by migrants from the Middle East, desperate to reach the EU. Once the plans are finalised, work is expected to start later this month, Poland said. The minister was speaking at a press conference with his counterpart Mariusz Błaszczak, who said “the support of British soldiers” would help ensure that “no one who tries to cross the border illegally will be able to do it”. Belarus appeared to be trying to ease political tensions by removing its hastily constructed migrant camps at the border, although that could prompt people previously located there to disperse without shelter. Thirteen people have already died during the crisis, mostly from exposure, including a one-year-old Syrian boy whose family had made it across to Poland. Aid agencies have criticised the UK for focusing on border security rather than providing humanitarian assistance, in an agreement that also cements ties between two countries who have been involved in their own disputes with the EU. Poland has also refused to accept help from Frontex, the EU’s own border agency, preferring to declare a state of emergency and reach a wider military agreement aimed at better securing itself against its eastern neighbours. Warsaw said it was intending to buy British-made missiles and jointly develop air defence system intended to counter Russia. The deal is likely to be worth around £3bn to manufacturers based in the UK, including missile maker MBDA. It is the second arms deal that the UK has discussed in a week. On Tuesday it was confirmed that the UK would provide £1.7bn in loans to Ukraine so Kyiv can boost its naval capability in the Black Sea by buying two minesweepers from British supplier Babcock, and jointly build a frigate and eight other missile-bearing ships."

          "headline": "Fifa will not intervene over former World Cup media officer jailed in Qatar",
          "bodyText": "Fifa will not intervene in the case of Abdullah Ibhais, a former employee of Qatar’s World Cup committee who is on hunger strike after being detained by police in Doha. Football’s governing body said it would not be taking any action but would “continue to follow this matter closely”, after Ibhais was arrested at his house on Monday. Ibhais held the position of deputy communications director for the Supreme Committee, the Qatari body responsible for the delivery of next year’s World Cup. He was removed from the role in 2019 after being accused of fraud over a contract to produce social media content for the tournament. A trial in Doha ended with Ibhais being sent to jail for five years, before he was released on bail pending an appeal earlier this year. Ibhais, who is of Palestinian descent and holds a Jordanian passport, has always denied the charges. He says he has been singled out by Qatar because of his support for migrant workers in the country. Ibhais’s latest arrest followed the publication of an article by the investigative website Josimar, which detailed WhatsApp messages apparently from the ‘Crisis Comms’ group of the Supreme Committee during a strike by migrant workers in 2019. In those messages the head of the Supreme Committee, Hassan al-Thawadi, is seen to argue that the communications team should avoid referring to World Cup workers being part of the strike and that the team should “put a narrative” on delays which had seen workers go without pay for months. Ibhais then says “we can’t say that there were no WC workers striking”. In a separate conversation with the executive director of communications, Fatima al-Nuaimi, Ibhais says of the strike: “We need to fix it then do the PR part. Lying is not Qatar’s way and should not be.” These conversations took place on 4 August 2019. On 12 November Ibhais was arrested on suspicion of fraud. On Wednesday Ibhais’s family released a statement accusing Fifa of “turning a blind eye” to his fate and said he had not been given a fair trial, an accusation supported by representatives of Human Rights Watch. “We demand a serious, prompt and meaningful action from Fifa to stop the extreme injustice put upon Abdullah by the authorities of the country they chose to host the World Cup,” the family said, “[and] to press for a fair trial for Abdullah and for his immediate release – as there is no justification for his detention.” Ibhais says he was denied access to legal representation during his interrogation by police and signed a confession that was false. Qatari authorities, meanwhile, argue they have audio and visual evidence of criminal activity on his part. On Thursday Fifa responded publicly for the first time. In a statement released to the Guardian, it said it had spoken with Ibhais “several times” and “carefully reviewed” the available information. “It is Fifa’s position that any person deserves a trial that is fair and where due process is observed and respected,” it said. “Fifa has duly received the complaint from Mr Ibhais and replied to the complaint in writing, having carefully reviewed the available information about his case. We have since been in touch with our Qatari counterparts and on several occasions with Mr Ibhais. Fifa will continue to follow this matter closely.” In a statement released to the Guardian, the Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy said: “Abdullah Ibhais’ claim that he was targeted for taking a position on a labour-related matter is a fabrication and a lie. “The allegations presented by Ibhais have no credibility. The case against Ibhais is rooted in evidence [of alleged manipulation and misuse of state funds], and has absolutely nothing to do with personal opinions or actions on labour-related matters. “The reality was that no World Cup workers were involved in the strike. Any suggestion that the use of the words ‘narrative’ and ‘spin’ indicates a desire to cover-up is wholly false.” On Friday Amnesty International added to the voices calling for action on Ibhais’s detention. “Abdullah Ibhais was arrested just days after he spoke publicly about his case, in what appears to amount to arbitrary detention in retaliation for speaking out about his experiences,” said Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. “Qatari authorities must immediately launch an independent investigation into Abdullah’s claims of ill-treatment, and quash his conviction and sentence if they are found to have been based on a coerced ‘confession’. Qatar must ensure fair trial standards are upheld in all cases, including ensuring all defendants are provided with legal representation from the moment of their arrest.”"

          "headline": "Azeem Rafiq’s testimony on racism plunges English cricket into crisis",
          "bodyText": "English cricket has descended into crisis after Azeem Rafiq’s powerful testimony laid bare its institutional failings on racism, bullying and dressing room culture while also alleging a past drugs cover-up by Yorkshire. This was a day that the sport will never forget – nor should it – as Rafiq sat in front of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee and outlined his harrowing experiences at Headingley, summed up by six simple words that must now prove a watershed moment: “I lost my career to racism.” For nearly two hours Rafiq fought back the tears, detailing the dressing room he first entered in 2008 – one in which phrases such as “Paki”, “elephant washers” and “you lot” were commonplace – through to his release in 2018, just months after his first child was stillborn and allegations of racism were ignored. It was not about individuals, Rafiq insisted, but rather cricket as a whole, with the former England Under-19s captain claiming he had been told similar stories by players at Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex and describing the “inept” handling of his complaints by the Professional Cricketers’ Association. Certainly the panel of MPs chaired by Julian Knight looked to broaden the inquiry, subjecting the England and Wales Cricket Board, led by Tom Harrison, to a stiff interrogation that highlighted the governing body’s record on diversity, its conflict as both regulator and promoter and, ultimately, took a dim view of its inaction after Rafiq first blew the whistle last year. Nevertheless, names such as Matthew Hoggard, Tim Bresnan, Michael Vaughan, Gary Ballance and Andrew Gale emerged, to varying degrees, as alleged perpetrators during Rafiq’s two spells at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018, with the former off-spinner starting proceedings and speaking freely without fear of legal reprisal under parliamentary privilege. The devastating allegations portrayed a toxic county dressing room that paused only during Jason Gillespie’s spell as head coach from 2012 to 2016. These were later expanded upon further when the DCMS published the witness statement Rafiq had submitted during the recently settled employment tribunal case; a 57-page document that is, frankly, incendiary. In this Rafiq claimed he was regularly called “Raffa the Kaffir” by Hoggard – the former England seamer personally apologised for this in 2020 when Rafiq first spoke up in the media – and bullied by Bresnan. Speaking yesterday, Rafiq said he was among a group of players who reported Bresnan to the club over the bullying allegations, only to find himself singled out and painted as a “troublemaker”. Rafiq also gave a heartbreaking retelling of Yorkshire’s indifference to the death of his first child, accusing Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket, of having “ripped the shreds off me” on his return to the club and claiming that Gale, who had moved from the role of captain to head coach by this stage, showed no sympathy. A running theme of both Rafiq’s oral and written submissions was a sense of being treated differently from white players – something that has been echoed during recent allegations at Essex – and at one point in his statement he alleged that Ballance, a player whom he claimed used regular racial slurs in the dressing room, was allowed “to miss drug hair sample tests to avoid sanctions”. “When he failed a recreational drug test and was forced to miss some games, the club informed the public he was missing games because he was struggling with anxiety and mental health issues,” Rafiq added in his statement. A legal representative for Ballance subsequently denied the allegations. The revelations went beyond the Headingley dressing room, with Rafiq alleging during his evidence session that the use of the word “Kevin” by Ballance to describe people of colour had bled into the senior England set-up. Alex Hales, he claimed, was rumoured to have named his black dog accordingly. Either way, the link to the national team will prompt further questions in the coming days. Rafiq also responded to the recent assertion by Joe Root, the England Test captain, that he could not recall any specific instances of racism during his 14 years at the club. Asked about this, the former off-spinner replied: “Rooty is a good man, he’s never engaged in racist language. “[But] I found [his comments] hurtful. He was Gary’s flatmate. He was involved in social nights out during which I was called a Paki. He might not remember [the incidents of racism] but it shows how normal it was that even a good man like him doesn’t see it for what it is.” Asked if anyone had stood up for him during this time, or when as a 15-year-old at Barnsley Cricket Club he had wine poured down his throat despite this going against his Muslim faith, Rafiq replied: “You had people who were openly racist and you had the bystanders. No one felt it was important.” This agonising watch was followed by evidence from the former Yorkshire chair, Roger Hutton, and his successor in Lord Kamlesh Patel. Both Mark Arthur, chief executive until last week, and Moxon, currently signed off for stress, had declined the invitation to attend and were criticised for this by Knight. In this Hutton tried to explain the club’s handling of Rafiq’s allegations and the resistance that followed internally when, after a 12-month investigation that began in September 2020, the club’s report was produced. For Hutton the blame here lay with both Arthur and Moxon, the board members whom he claimed were unable to “accept the gravity of the situation”, refused to apologise and would not move on the recommendations that the panel put forward. Hutton claimed he was unable to stand the pair down as the Graves Family Trust, owed more than £15m by the club, had a veto on board members. After this apparent blockade was scrutinised by the MPs, and later bemoaned by Harrison despite previously working under Colin Graves at the ECB, Hutton was asked if Yorkshire was institutionally racist and replied: “I fear it falls into that definition.” This conclusion was further than Harrison was prepared to go, with the ECB chief executive insisting only the handling of Yorkshire’s investigation into Rafiq’s claims could be described as such and stressing the convoluted process by which the governing body, as the sport’s regulator, could not step in sooner. By this stage Harrison, joined by two executives and the ECB board member Alan Dickinson, had already infuriated his interrogators with indirect answers that were riddled with corporate jargon. This contrasted hugely with Rafiq’s earlier testimony, spoken without notes, from the heart and in everyday language, despite having little of the same training. “I want to become the voice for the voiceless,” the 30-year-old had said. In a sport in which 30% of the recreational game is made up by the British Asian community, only to see this drop to 4% at professional level, this may prove to be his legacy."

          "bodyText": "Reconstruction after Covid – a new dedicated long read series from the Guardian – will explore how coronavirus has influenced the way we live and provide original and thought-provoking ideas on the future of society, from voting rights and the climate crisis to the way we eat and how we think about death. The ambitious project, developed as part of the Guardian’s 200th anniversary, will feature essays by world-leading experts, journalists, academics and writers as they reflect on the impact of the pandemic and consider how society might rethink and adapt in the future. Launching today (Tues 16 Nov), David Runciman, professor of politics at Cambridge University, outlines how Covid-19 has exacerbated the already enormous age divide in our society – and why he believes one solution is to allow children to vote. In his essay, Runciman writes: “I believe there is a strong case for lowering the voting age to six, effectively extending the franchise to any child in full-time education.” Reconstruction after Covid is inspired by Reconstruction in Europe; a series of essays on the economic revival of postwar Europe that was commissioned by Guardian editor CP Scott in 1921 and edited by the economist John Maynard Keynes. Published by the Guardian in 1922, the series featured major contributions from leading economists, politicians and Nobel laureates, as well as Keynes himself. Upcoming essays in the Reconstruction after Covid series include: Guardian columnist Rebecca Solnit on how to confront the climate crisis without losing hope; Kwame Anthony Appiah, professor of philosophy at New York University on how to avoid a repeat of the ‘shadow pandemic’ that has blighted the developing world over the past two years; Jill Lepore, professor of American history at Harvard University, on the future of society after Covid; Jacqueline Rose, co-director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, exploring how the pandemic might prompt us to rethink death; and author and journalist Bee Wilson on why we need a national food policy. Other leading journalists, authors and academics set to write Guardian long reads as part of the Reconstruction after Covid series include Gary Younge, Suketu Mehta, Emily Bell and Shoshana Zuboff. Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News &amp; Media says: “Covid 19 has exposed just how broken our societies are – from inequality and loneliness, to the climate crisis and racial injustice. In the Guardian’s 200th year, Reconstruction after Covid takes inspiration from CP Scott and John Maynard Keynes’s groundbreaking essay series published a century ago, to tell a new story about what can be done to rebuild a better world in the wake of the pandemic.” David Wolf, editor of The Guardian Long Read, says: “As we slowly begin our recovery, Reconstruction after Covid will explore how the world has navigated coronavirus, and how we can ensure the crisis does not go to waste. The pieces we have coming up over the next few weeks are extremely varied, but they are all united by their clarity and boldness. One of our priorities in commissioning the series was to make sure the writing itself was a pleasure to read, and we’re thrilled with the roster of wonderful writers who are contributing to the series.” Reconstruction after Covid launches on the Guardian today, with new articles in the series due to be published over the coming weeks.

          "bodyText": "Australia remains well-placed to weather a “perfect storm” of inflationary pressures triggered by the Covid pandemic without resorting to an early raising of the cash rate, although how the labour market responds remains uncertain, the reserve bank governor has told a meeting of economists. Philip Lowe on Tuesday maintained his view that a recent jump in consumer prices did “not warrant an increase in the cash rate in 2022” as markets have been betting. “The economy and inflation would have to turn out very differently from our central scenario for the board to consider an increase in interest rates next year,” Lowe said. There would be a case, though, to lift the cash rate – now at a record low 0.1% – before 2024 as currently flagged by the RBA if the “global inflation shock” turns out to be more persistent than expected. A key unknown is how quickly the labour market will tighten as swathes of the economy recover from lengthy lockdowns. That could determine how rapidly wages rise and whether they feed expectations of further prices increases to come. “We are expecting the [economic] recovery to continue and the unemployment rate to trend lower, reaching 4% by the end of 2023,” Lowe said, noting that level hasn’t been seen in Australia for half a century, giving the reserve bank “little historical experience” of how the labour market works at such a low rate. Mortgage holders and other borrowers are among those listening carefully for any hint from the RBA that rising prices – for used cars to petrol to coffee – will prompt it to lift the cash rate soon. Lowe said there was “a very low probability” the current surge in inflation would trigger an early increase in the official rate. Australia is far from alone in facing higher inflation. Covid disruptions limiting the supply of some goods and services, combined with pent-up demand from households and businesses alike, are common in many nations. Lowe, though, was at pains to highlight Australia’s differences with similar market-based economies such as the US. One difference was the greater disruption to the American workforce because of the pandemic. Labour-force participation there remains about 2 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels. “In contrast, in Australia, we were hitting record highs for participation just before the Delta outbreak and are expected to return to these highs in the coming months,” Lowe said. Australia’s participation rate perked up 0.3 percentage points in October, nudging the jobless rate temporarily to 5.2%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The jobkeeper income-support payments also maintained ongoing links between businesses and employees, unlike the “significant shock” to labour supply experienced in the US, the RBA governor said. While wages will probably pick up “gradually” in Australia as employers scramble to attract and retain staff, the existence of multi-year enterprise agreements and the annual minimum wage case “impart a degree of inertia” into salary outcomes. Lowe said that he would be worried if household debt continued to grow at double-digit annual rates but incomes only rose 4-5%. Australia has also been shielded from some of the higher energy prices stirring inflation in northern hemisphere economies, lately buffeted by wintry blasts. Energy prices in Australia have been trending lower for a number of years, as zero fuel cost renewable sources increase their share of supply. Among the trends that could throw forecasts off is how Australia’s labour market will change once borders open up. While many potential short-term workers may be attracted to visit Australia, young Australians would also be heading overseas, depleting the domestic labour pool. Home-bound consumers also spent more on goods than services during the lockdowns at a time when factory output was disrupted. With modern supply chains operating on a ‘just-in-time’ basis with stocks kept to a minimum, it didn’t take a big shift in demand and supply to create the “perfect storm” for pressure on prices. “Looking ahead, an important question is whether consumption patterns will normalise over time, and if so what effect will this have on prices,” Lowe said on Tuesday. “There is genuine uncertainty here. It is likely, though, that consumption patterns will return to something more normal,” he said. “This is not only because we can once again consume many services, but also because households are unlikely to make repeat purchases of durable goods.”"

          "bodyText": "Communities in western Canada who were forced to flee their homes this summer by wildfires and extreme heat are once again under evacuation orders after overwhelming floods across the region. The heavy rainfall and pounding storms are also taking a toll on the US Pacific north-west, where flooding and mudslides in Washington state have also forced evacuations and school closures. Helicopters were dispatched on Monday to Highway 7, more than 100 kilometres (62 miles) east of Vancouver, to rescue about 275 people, including 50 children, who had been stranded on the road since it was blocked by a mudslide late on Sunday. Footage from the area shows stranded travelers heading toward a yellow emergency helicopter during the rescue operation. The surrounding landscape is littered with debris from a landslide blocking access to the highway. “I definitely heard people screaming for help,” Adam Wuisman, who was driving the section of the highway when a landslide hit, told CBC News. “It’s kind of helpless to feel like you’re between a very vulnerable mountainside on one side and the Fraser River on the other side. And there’s really nothing you can do about it, but hope nothing comes down on top of you.” Images of surging rivers, mudslides, flooded cities and destroyed highways circulated on social media as officials scrambled to assess the full extent of the damage, warning residents the situation could deteriorate further as winds picked up throughout the day. According to Environment Canada, 225 millimetres of rain fell on the community of Hope since the storm began Saturday and 180 millimetres had fallen around Agassiz and Chilliwack in the eastern part of the Fraser Valley. After two bridges and its water treatment facility were overwhelmed by flood waters, the city of Merritt issued an evacuation order to all residents, warning that “continued habitation of the community without sanitary services presents risk of mass sewage back-up and personal health risk”. Merritt last issued evacuation orders this summer after the wildfire that destroyed the village of Lytton came dangerously close to the city. Since June, the province has experienced a record-setting “heat dome”, huge wildfires that destroyed two towns and choked the air for weeks, extreme events that experts say were worsened by the climate crisis. Last week, Vancouver, British Columbia’s largest city, was briefly placed under tornado watch, a rare event for the region. In Washington state, the National Weather Service warned that winds nearing hurricane strength were possible in the region, which has seen nearly ceaseless rain for about a week. A wind gust of 58mph (93km/h) was reported on Monday at Sea-Tac international airport in Seattle. More than 158,0000 customers were without power in western Washington at one point Monday, the Seattle Times reported. Parts of the region have seen more than 6in (15cm) of rain in the past several days. Less than halfway into the month it is already the third wettest November that Seattle has seen in more than a century, according to the Washington Post, with rainfall records likely to be broken. A state of emergency was declared over the weekend for the town of Hamilton, about 80 miles (129km) north-east of Seattle, and residents were urged to evacuate as soon as possible, the Skagit Valley Herald reported. As the water was making its way down the Skagit River, people were warned to expect flooding in the cities of Sedro-Woolley, Burlington and Mount Vernon. Just south of the Canadian border in Sumas, Washington, officials said city hall was flooded and that the flooding event was the worst in decades. Nicole Postma, who owns a coffee stand in Sumas and is president of the Sumas Chamber of Commerce, told the Bellingham Herald on Monday that people are nervous. “We knew that the flood was imminent, but had no idea it would be like this,” she said. The Associated Press contributed reporting • The headline of this article was amended on 19 November 2021 to be more accurate about the area affected by these events. The Pacific north-west, which was the only area highlighted in an earlier headline, generally refers just to the US. To make clear that parts of Canada are also affected, “British Columbia” has now been added."

          "headline": "Tourists’ cars may be banned from most popular parts of Lake District",
          "bodyText": "For most of the years he explored his beloved Lakeland fells, Alfred Wainwright arrived by bus, carefully timing his descents so he never missed the last service back to Kendal. Thirty years after his death, more than 90% of the Lake District’s 19 million annual visitors arrive by car, seeking – perhaps ironically – the unspoiled views, clean air and stunning scenery Wainwright extolled in his Pictorial Guides. Now, in a move that might prompt a smile from the curmudgeonly AW beyond the grave, tourist cars could be banned from some of the most popular parts of the Lake and Peak Districts next summer as they struggle with surging demand from domestic visitors. National parks across the UK are grappling with congestion and their climate commitments. Unable to limit visitors via entrance charges, as their American counterparts do, they are looking for solutions to an increasingly unsustainable problem. “It feels like we are at peak car,” said Richard Leafe, chief executive of the Lake District national park (LDNP). “I want to see less reliance on it into the future. It cannot go on getting worse otherwise it really will become too much to handle in our national parks. We need to see a shift to more sustainable travel.” Last summer free shuttle buses were trialled along the Wasdale valley by Wastwater and from Cockermouth to Buttermere, a lake that has become increasingly popular because of TikTok and Instagram and which is getting “rammed with parking”, according to Leafe. The park is now “actively considering” closing the most popular valleys to cars during peak season, said Leafe. Access would be retained for residents, buses and bikes, as well as walkers. Likely candidates include Great Langdale, which includes Wainwright favourites Bowfell and the Crinkle Crags, and Wasdale. At the same time, the LDNP is infuriating residents by granting planning permission for ever bigger car parks in an attempt to stop “fly parking” in certain hotspots. Locals in Portinscale, near Keswick, are trying to stop a car park under consideration near Cat Bells, an easy peak where rangers discovered a mini rave after the first lockdown eased in 2020. Dr Julie Carter is among many objectors. “It’s not just the climate and congestion issues, it is also that the lichens are dying from emissions, and the otters are washed out by the tarmac, leading to increased runoff rates, and the bats are disturbed by the lights,” she said. In the Peak District, park bosses want to trial “hail-a-ride”, an on-demand bus service to encourage visitors to leave the car at home. “It’s Uber but on bus scale,” said Sarah Fowler, the park’s chief executive. “It’s not a scheduled bus service, but you hail it using an app, and it carries people from gateway sites in to the park.” She has also begun discussions with the local rail companies about putting on special bike carriages to encourage more people to cycle in the park. Fowler said she was interested to explore a proposal put forward by the Hope Valley Climate Action Group to close selected roads to cars, probably in the Ringinglow/Stanage area, freeing space for walkers and cyclists. Making the Peak District more accessible by public and active transport is a social justice issue, the group argues. “One-third of households in Sheffield do not have a car and Manchester has one of the lowest car ownership rates in the country,” they noted in a recent report. “Reimagining travel could open up the national park to more low-income households, new arrivals to the UK and people living with impairments,” they argue. Fowler said the car-free days were “a really interesting concept” she was keen to explore. In Scotland, a free shuttle bus service is being piloted next year in Loch Lomond &amp; The Trossachs national park, with park bosses considering hiking parking prices in future. Kenny Auld, head of visitor services, said: “If you want to park your car at the bottom of a hill, that could come at a premium. And that could help subsidise other transport modes which are more inclusive,” he said. But he stressed: “I think at the moment it’s very unfair for us to criticise any car drivers enjoying the national park because we don’t have a system that provides many choices. We’re working hard to quickly catch up and create a system that gives people choice and that’s inclusive, affordable and keeps people connected to the landscape.” In Wales, the most popular car park at the foot of Snowdon now costs £25 for eight to 12 hours as part of measures to deter motorists. A report last year into transport and parking in Snowdonia concluded that “the current over-reliance on cars to access key honeypot sites and the chronic parking problem at busy times of year is failing the national park’s core purposes.”"

          "bodyText": "Righto, that’s us done over here. But join Rob Smyth now for more Women’s Football Weekend fun. Talking to his players, Marc Skinner looks aggravated and well he might. That game was there for his team, but a passive second half cost them. As such, United stay fifth in the table, a point behind Brighton in fourth and two behind Spurs in third; Everton move above Reading into ninth. The home side will be ok with that, given they went behind and struggled to do much about it. United, on the other hand, will be raging with their inability to build on a fantastic opening goal and the equaliser they gifted. 90+3 min Here come United again – they’ve been better these last few minutes – and Galton does well, back to goal, to turn a pass into Blundell’s path. But MacIver is awake, collecting her cross comfortably, and that looks like being that. 90+1 min Sue Smith gives Dali player of the match, which I guess is fair enough – she’s been crucial in dragging Everton back into the game. I’d probably have gone for Toone, who’s been the best player on the pitch over the 90, but as I said, she was better in the first half than the second. 90 min There’ll be three added minutes. 90 min The corner misses everyone. 90 min Toone has played well today, even if she’s had a quiet second half, and with the game in the balance she cleverly wriggles space just outside the box, leathering another terrific shot that has MacIver flying across goal to shove behind. 89 min Ye’ve gottae score! Another good cross from Dali puts United under, and when Magill retrieves the ball, sending an even better one into the box, Duggan watches it all the way onto her laces, only to caress a weak shot straight at Earps. 88 min Dali has looked far more dangerous since pulling wide and she teases Blundell down the line, rolling studs over the ball. But Blundell keeps eyes on it, eventually bringing it away. 87 mi Bludell drives forward and infield from left-back – she’s been a threat when she goes forward – but she can’t decide whether to find Hanson, and is eventually crowded out. 86 min Duggan finds Dali down the right and she slings over another decent ball, but this time Thorisdottir takes no chances, clearing her lines immediately. 84 min But here come United with their first attack for a bit, Toone doing really well to manufacture space down the right before standing up a cross aimed at Zelem in the middle. She gets up well, but can’t get a meaningful header on the ball, which winds up going behind. 83 min But in the meantime, it’s Everton with the initiative, Dali thrashing high from 20 yards. 82 min United have struggled to get Russo on the ball this half – I’d like to see her given the 10 minutes through the middle, because she looks more likely than Galton and Hanson to make something happen. 82 min Another change for Everton, Emslie, who was good in the first half but has been quiet since the break, replaced by Bennison. 81 min That goal has changed everything – suddenly, Everton are playing with confidence and cohesion, though that might allow United to counter on them. 80 min Dali finds Duggan down the right and Earps does well to come and claim her cross confidently, given what just happened. 78 min Earps thought she had both hands on the ball and she did, but it wasn’t under control and I’d say Magill’s touch came as she clasped. I’d not be favouring defender and keeper in that situation, both of whom got what they deserved. Eeeesh, this is a disaster for United! Thorisdottir gets her body between Magill and Earps as Earps chases a speculative long throw. But perhaps bothered by injury, Earps is slow and indecisive, getting hands to the ball but not solidly, so as she does that, Magill reaches around Thorisdottir to poke through her legs! The defender should’ve helped her keeper and cleared, I guess, which is to say this was an almighty ricket from both of them. 76 min Earps looks to have hurt herself so the physio comes on to treat her but she’ll be fine. 74 min Look what we’ve for you when we’re done here! Join Rob Smyth for all the buildup. 73 min The more time elapses, the more nervous United will get. They conceded late last week, and won’t be sure whether to hang onto what they have or look for more. 72 min Hanson does, though, look lively, even if she then shows too much of the ball to Turner, looking to sneak around her outside only to be easily robbed. 71 min Turner advances and finds Duggan down the left, but Hanson is wise to the ruse, stealing possession and driving forward, only to waste a decent situation with a shot dragged straight at MacIver. 70 min Excellent from Galton, harrying and hounding George, winning the ball ... only for the ref to appraise a foul. 69 min Ah, here come the Everton changes, Clinton and Magill replacing Graham and Gauvin. 68 min Nice from Galton, dashing infield and finding Russo, who moves it one more to Toone ... who lashes wide of the near post. 67 min On the other hand, those are good, proactive changes from Skinner: United are still on top, but something a little different will ask different questions of Everton and might help them find the clincher. 67 min I’m surprised Vesseur hasn’t made a change yet because his team remain second-best. 66 min Double change for United, Staniforth replacing Boe Risa and Hanson coming on for Thomas. 64 min Maier finds herself on the right wing and following a tussle with Zelem, the United captain is penalised – she needs to be careful. Meantime, Dali will send in a cross from just outside the box, right-hand side, but George can only head it high. 62 min This is better from Everton, finding Duggan at the far post, who pulls away then aims just inside what is now the near. But Batile deflects the shot behind and United get the corner away. 61 min United see the free-kick away but for maybe the first time in the game, Everton pen them in and Dali crosses well from the right, Thorisdottir extending a knee to send the ball behind. 60 min Now it’s Sevecke’s turn to stride forward and be encouraged to eat the grass, Zelem pulling her back then making sure with the trip. She too is booked. 59 min When Dali dallies on the ball, Blundell robs her, skating over halfway, so Sevecke introduces her to the grass and is booked. 58 min Christiansen’s been really quiet today, and when Dali finds her her attempted pass out to Graham, down the right, has too much on it. That is so careless. 56 min Lovely from United, Toone finding Galton, who takes a lovely touch away from George. They can’t make anything of it, but sustain the attack, Batile scavenging to mug Turner, by the by-line, then clipping to Thomas, who turns her close-range shot over the bar. I’m not sure how she got it so high from so near and that ought to have been 2-0. 54 min United allow a rare counter, Dali finding Turner, who crosses directly into Earps’ midriff. That’s such a waste. 53 min Toone moves so cleverly with the ball, a touch taking her into space and allowing her to waves by Dali and Graham. She then feeds Thomas, who tries to fade a cross at Russo, but MacIver collects. 52 min So far, the second half looks a lot like the first, United the more purposeful team but Everton staying in the game. And here they come again, Blundell finding Galton down the right, whose cross flies behind. 50 min Better from Everton, Graham sending Dali away down the the left, and I actually think her cross is deflected behind by Blundell, but the ref awards a goalkick. 49 min Russo picks up a loose ball and finds Batile, then takes it back and picks out Zelem, who tries a clever pass in behind that no one else reads. 47 min United attack down the right with Russo, and eventually the ball ends up with Batile, who crosses for Blundell at the far post ...where Maier does brilliantly to insert a head and send the ball behind. The flag then goes up for offside, but she didn’t know that, so the intervention was just as brave as it looked. 46 min No changes for either side, but Everton need to make some in terms of style – the gaps between their midfield and defence, and midfield and attack, are too big. 46 min We go again... Back come our teams... Also going on: Half-time reading: this is really interesting and important. United have been much the better side, but haven’t created much, so there’s a route back into the game for Everton. Thing is, the more they look to throw players forward, the more they open themselves up the counter. 45 min There’ll be one added minute. 44 min Emslie has looked the player most likely to haul Everton back into this, but they’re relying on individual moments, whereas United look a nicely-grooved team. 43 min And here comes Emslie again, picking the ball up in a central position, driving forward, then clattering a rasper that screeches over Earps’ dive ... but clips the top of the bar! What a strike that was! 42 min Emslie’s had a decent half and she nashes down the left then slings over a cross that Gauvin attacks, but her flick is straight at Earps. 40 min Aaaarrrrggggghhhhhh! Graham does superbly, bustling by Blundell down the right and she’s got Gauvin in the middle! Her square-pass does the trick too, but Gauvin can only impart a small touch – a more emphatic connection and that’s 1-1. She looks extremely displeased with herself, and rightly so – ye’ve gottae score and all that. 38 min Zelem goes short to Thomas as Everton switch off, and when the return arrives she looks for Thorisdottir at the back post. But Maier is marking, so heads clear and the home side build again. 37 min Batile advances again, winning a corner down the right... 35 min United have got Everton’s measure here, Zelem and Boe Risa tidying up every time they look under pressure in central areas. And as I type that, there’s Galton wandering infield to foul Graham, who looked to have found space. 33 min And Zelem sends a decent ball to the near post, Thomas running across Gauvin at the near post to flick hard, and at the far, Mannion, her back to goal, tries to help it behind her into the far side-netting. But an infelicitous body-position means the ball strays just wide, and though Mannion is annoyed with herself, that was a good effort. 32 min So far, Duggan has only had five touches, the fewest of all 22 players. Conversely, Russo has had most and looks the best on the pitch, winning a corner off Turner as I type that, her cross blocked behind. 30 min Batile plays a one-two off Russo, running onto the return and clipping a cross at Thomas, who contorts to head, but can only send the ball wide. 29 min Everton have had more of the ball the last few minutes, but United still look the likelier scorers – ultimately, they’ve got the better attacking players. And here they are again, Zelem prompting outside the box before Galton’s cross runs behind. 28 min Maier advances down the right and crosses low, but Mannion is there and actually does pretty well to let the ball run - I’d not have fancied having to clear that one. 27 min If United win today, they’ll only be five points off the top, following yesterday’s north London derby. Spurs will be sick to have conceded a late equaliser – as United were when they scored one last week – but their improvement has been significant. 25 min It’s more of an even game now, but Everton are still struggling to threaten – though, as I write that, Turner curves a lush ball around Batile and Emslie, who looks the home side’s most likely source of something good, races onto it. Her cross isn’t bad either, except there’s no one gambling, running across the near post, allowing Earps to gather under nae pressure. 23 min Sevecke looks for Duggan, but Mannion is up too, crowding her out. 23 min Everton just can’t get anything going, but when Thorisdottir goes in the back of Gauvin, they’ll hump one into the box... 21 min ...but seeking Russo, peeling away at the far post, she puts too much on her cross. 19 min Marc Skinner and his staff look to have done a pretty decent job in inculcating the way they want United to play. They press in unison and move the ball about nicely, making good angles for each other. Anyway, a frustrated Christiansen leaves one on Galton and Zelem will curl the free-kick into the box... 18 min United are making it really difficult for Everton to play out, Dali and Turner arguing as they’re shut down again. But then Emslie targets Gauvin with a high ball, nipping inside Batile to create the space, but Earps rushes out to punch. 17 min Everton have been better these last few minutes, but as the goal showed, United are a serious threat on the counter. And as I type that, Russo brings the ball away again, pumping a cross towards the back post which MacIver collects well. 15 min And here they come now! Dali snaps a terrific pass in behind – Thorisdottir should cut it out really, but Emslie runs onto it and she’s in! The angle, though, is not in her favour, so as Earps advances, she tries a chip which floats just over the bar and onto the roof. 13 min United are searching for a second here, and rightly so – Everton won’t be this tepid for the full 90. 11 min United deserved that. They’ve started the game playing with confidence and tempo, forcing Everton to chase. United counter quickly, one tremendous pass from Blundell sending Russo away. She makes great ground then finds Thomas, who dips inside George then tees up Toone who, from the edge of the box, opens her body to punch-swerve a gorgeous finish inside the post, halfway up. 10 min Better from Everton, Emslie running at Batile then easing infield and flipping a terrific cross aimed for Duggan, but Mannion is up to clear. 8 min A bit of possession for Everton, but United have their measure at the moment, easily taking it back and moving it quickly through midfield. Toone looks to be in control of that area – she finds space so well. 7 min And here’s Thomas down the right, skipping around Turner and crossing low but to no one, then when United regain possession, Boe Risa drags a low shot just wide form outside the box. 6 min I’m a little surprised it’s Russo on the flank – she’s playing so well at the moment, I’d not want to change her, but would want her involved as often as possible. 5 min Everton look to play out from the back, but United press – words that look strange written down – so George heaves down the line. Duggan wins the flick-on, but there’s no one running in behind, and United clear up easily enough. 4 min United prompt again down the right, Batile finding Russo ... who’s gone too early, straying offside. 3 min But here come United again, Thomas – who’s playing through the middle today, with Russo on the right – crossing low, but no one is there to finish. This is a good start from United. 2 min United quickly win a free-kick down the right when Thomas is fouled, but Zelem drills the free-kick at the nearest defender. 1 min Pre-match, they played Grand Old Team, the Everton anthem. I wonder why they’ve not replaced “Everton boys” in the lyrics with something more appropriate. 1 min Away we go! The teams take a knee. All black lives matter. The teams have laid wreaths and the last post is now being played, after which there’ll be a minute’s silence. It’s nice and sunny in Liverpool, which is more than can be said for north London. It looks a lovely day for football. Here come the teams, Z Cars blasting out over the PA. I missed this in the week, but apparently the return fixture will be at Old Trafford, which is great to hear. United took a decent contingent to Spurs last weekend, and Manchester’s appetite for football means that crowds should steadily increase. United, though, have been poor at the back this season, conceding 10 times in six league games. They’ve got plenty of attacking threat – Russo, in particular, is a player – and I fancy them to find a way today. I’m also interested to see how Toni Duggan gets on today. I totally get why Everton re-signed her, but can’t help but wonder if the game has passed her by a little. Obviously she can still play, but I’d be trepidatious about relying on her to score as many goals as Everton are probably hoping she’ll get. In the studio, Stephen Warnock says he wants to see players running in behind, not just coming short for the ball, and Karen Carney identifies Emslie as the player Everton need to create for them. I’m also looking forward to seeing how Gauvin does making her first league start of the season – hopefully she’s fully fit. Anyhow, Vesseur tells Sky that he’s looking for his best team and formation, but won’t know until after the game whether he’s made the right call. Marc Skinner, meanwhile, says he’s brought in Thomas as she has a really good forward’s instinct in the box - he’s got wonderful creators, but wants someone to finish off the chances they create. He also likes Boe Risa’s midfield passing, and plans to build an attractive, sustainable, winning team who represent the fans and the city of Manchester. There should be a really good level of desperation about this game because neither side can afford a defeat. There should be plenty of needle too. As for United, Ladd and Hanson drop out – the former is, I think, injured as she’s not on the bench – with Boa Rise and Thomas coming in, the latter making her first start of the season. As you’d expect, Vasseur makes changes as he gets to know his squad. At the back, Bjorn is replaced by Maier; in midfield, Graham comes in for Galli, while Bennison also drops out; and up front, Anvegard loses her place to Gauvin, while Emslie also plays. Everton (4-3-3): MacIver; Sevecke, Maier, George, Turner; Christiansen, Dali, Graham; Gauvin, Duggan, Emslie. Subs: Brosnan, Magill, Finnigan, Clinton, Bennison, Pattinson. Man United (4-2-3-1): Earps; Batile, Mannion, Thorisdottir, Blundell; Zelem, Boe Risa; Thomas, Toone, Galton; Russo. Subs: Baggaley, Fuso, Hanson, Smith, Jones, Stanniforth. Hello and welcome to Women’s Football Weekend! It’s been a tricky start to the season for United, who made such huge strides during the last under the brilliant Casey Stoney. Sadly for all concerned, though, the club did not give her or her team the support they and the women’s game in general deserve, so rather than pushing for the title, which looked possible a year ago, they’re fighting to convince themselves a Champions League spot is within their ambit. And if all that wasn’t enough, this time last week they looked to have held out for a crucial away win at third-placed Spurs, only to concede a 95th-minute equaliser, the kind of week-ruiner that can be hard to shake off. We shall see. Everton, meanwhile, fancied themselves a top-three finish after adding Toni Duggan to a squad that already boasted a decent array of attacking talent. But they’ve made a miserable start to that bid, enduring bad beatings from Manchester City – twice – Chelsea and Arsenal, so changed manager, replacing Willie Kirk with Jean-Luc Vasseur. But the start he made was an inauspicious one and weekend’s home defeat to Brighton will have stung badly, meaning they, like United, are desperate for a result this afternoon. Kick-off: 12.30pm GMT"

          "headline": "Ban ads for cryptocurrencies at stations and on buses, TfL urged",
          "bodyText": "Transport for London (TfL) has been urged to ban adverts for unregulated financial products after it ran a three-week poster campaign for a crypto token funded by an anonymous group. Posters for Floki, a so-called meme coin named after a dog owned by Elon Musk, appeared on buses and in Underground stations across London last month. Since the invention of bitcoin in 2009, the software used to make crypto coins has become widely available, leading to hundreds of new digital tokens, with many based on jokes and internet memes, such as Dogecoin. But digital tokens remain unregulated in the UK and many other countries, and some have been used as scams. Siân Berry, the Green party London Assembly member, has tabled a question to Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, about the poster campaign. She said: “This should have raised a red flag and someone at TfL should have looked at this before it was approved. We have guidelines on junk food and on advertising.” She said TfL had accepted three ads for crypto products, including Floki Inu, in recent weeks. “Where the advert says ‘this is completely unregulated, you may lose all your money’, they ought to have had second thoughts. I don’t think cryptocurrency ads should be on the network. They’re unethical.” There is no evidence that the entities behind Floki Inu are scammers, but digital tokens can be used in “pump and dump” scams, where a small number of investors pump attention towards a coin, sometimes using internet influencers, then rake in large profits by dumping their assets after the price rises. At the end of October a token based on the Netflix show Squid Game gained worldwide publicity, prompting a 310,000% rise in value to $2,856 in a single day. But the value collapsed within hours and the anonymous developers behind the Squid token have disappeared, apparently with a profit of at least $2m. In September the chair of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Charles Randell, called for ministers to give it powers to regulate cryptoassets after Kim Kardashian West was paid to advertise Ethereum Max, a token that had been created a month earlier by unknown developers. TfL admitted to the Observer that it did not know the identity of the people or organisation funding the posters, which read: “Missed $Doge? Get $Floki.” The website promoting Floki Inu coins gives no names of anyone involved, nor contact address, and the RealFlokiInu Twitter account did not respond to the Observer’s request for information about the entity or individuals behind Floki Inu. Similar inquiries by the FT last month were also unanswered, but it quoted someone called Sabre, describing themselves as the group’s head of marketing, saying that the campaign was intended to “legitimise” the coin and that “You get a lot of scam artists in this game.” Jamie Bartlett, presenter of the BBC podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen, said that he had been surprised to see the adverts for Floki: “This is real wild west territory – it’s very hard to know which ones are serious projects and which pump and dump schemes. “Some people think all cryptocurrencies are a scam, but there are other ones designed by really technical people who were quite pioneering in their understanding of encryption, and how these coins might be used as a sort of banking settlement system.” The new meme coins were a reaction to that seriousness, he said. “They use funny internet memes – Dogecoin is based on a famous 4chan dog meme that was funny, although no one could really explain why. The meme coins are going back to that playful internet sub-culture. “For people to now be advertising these absurd joke coins seems to be another step, another level of risk. People lose a lot of money on these speculative crypto investments. Ethically, I think TfL should consider whether it’s wise to have these types of ads on their buses.” Chris Reader, head of commercial media at TfL, said: “Since 2018, we have asked our advertising partners to refer all cryptocurrency advertising to us for review prior to it running on our estate. When reviewing copy now from cryptocurrency brands who wish to advertise on our estate, we ensure that campaigns contain sufficient information to comply with both our policy and the ASA [Advertising Standards Authority] ruling.” The Treasury consulted last year on whether cryptoassets should be covered by financial promotions rules. An FCA spokesperson said: “The FCA does not currently have the power to oversee how unregulated cryptoassets, like Floki Inu, are advertised to consumers. We continue to work with HM Treasury on their proposals to extend financial promotion rules to unregulated cryptoassets. “The FCA has continually warned of the risks of cryptoassets. If people invest in these types of product, they should be prepared to lose all their money and they are unlikely to have access to any redress or compensation schemes.”"

          "headline": "Boris Johnson’s betrayal of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe shows us who he really is",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson should look Richard Ratcliffe in the eye. If he did, he would catch a reflection of himself that might prove painful but illuminating. For contained in his handling, and fateful mishandling, of the case of Richard’s wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is almost every aspect of the Johnson modus operandi. It is a parable of the prime minister’s approach to politics – and to other human beings. Ratcliffe is in the last stages of a hunger strike that has seen him camped outside the Foreign Office for 20 days and nights, weak, dizzy and shivering from cold. His wife has been detained in Iran since April 2016, and he wants her back home. There are other UK nationals held in Iran, including Anoosheh Ashoori and Morad Tahbaz, but it’s Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case that implicates Johnson specifically – and says so much about him. Start with his most infamous involvement, four years ago this month, when as foreign secretary Johnson told a Commons committee that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was “simply teaching people journalism”, apparently oblivious to her insistence that she had been in Iran on holiday. Three days later, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was hauled before an unscheduled court hearing in Iran, where Johnson’s words were cited as proof that she had engaged in “propaganda against the regime”. In that act alone, you can see the essence of Johnsonism: carelessness, in both senses of the word. Most obvious is the slapdash failure to master his brief, to pay attention to detail. But most egregious is the lack of human care, the cavalier disregard for the impact his actions would have on others. That casualness, that lack of empathy, was a warning to his fellow Tory MPs, one they chose to ignore when they made Johnson their leader less than two years later. Had they paid attention, they could have anticipated that this would be a man who would turn up at the UN or his own climate conference with nothing more than a few warmed-up jokes and vague exhortations, rather than a willingness to put in the hard, detailed work such diplomacy demands if it is to make a breakthrough. Nor would they have been surprised that he would respond to calls for a Covid lockdown by shouting to his advisers that they should “let the bodies pile high in their thousands”. Careless and without care: the clues were already there. But the Commons gaffe was not the worst of it. Ratcliffe believes that it was the move that followed a few days later, as Johnson sought to put out the fire he had started, that cost his wife most dearly. Johnson briefed friendly papers that Britain would repay the £400m it owed Iran for an unfulfilled 1970s arms deal, a move he clearly tied to Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release. According to Ratcliffe, setting that price for Nazanin and not meeting it is “why she is still held to this day”. Again, that one act contains multitudes. Johnson let people believe he was going to pay off the debt to Iran because he needed to get out of a hole, and that’s how he always is – telling people what they want to hear, issuing promises he won’t keep. In 2018, he assured Unionists that there would be no border down the Irish Sea; a year later he’d made a deal that would put a border down the Irish Sea. He promised “frictionless trade” after Brexit, only eventually to have a colleague admit that there would, after all, be the friction of border checks. Whether it’s £350m on the side of a bus, 40 new hospitals or a continued 0.7% on aid, a nice number thrown out by Boris Johnson should always prompt a swift counting of spoons. Richard Ratcliffe is one of many to have learned that lesson the hard way. So little in Johnson’s method has changed. Ratcliffe recalls how, straight after the then foreign secretary had made his calamitous remarks four years ago, he “didn’t apologise, but sent his mates out on the airwaves to defend him and to muddy the waters”. That could be a description of last week, when the prime minister dispatched cabinet underlings to embarrass themselves over the Owen Paterson affair. And note how, rather than devising a diplomatic channel or strategy that might reach Tehran and actually get Zaghari-Ratcliffe out, Johnson’s priority was squaring the Daily Telegraph. That remains the default even now, whether it’s the Northern Ireland protocol, the pandemic or the gravest issues of geopolitics: what matters most is keeping the base on side. All of this would be clear to Johnson if he had wandered out of Downing Street and come face to face with Richard Ratcliffe. But naturally he didn’t do that, even as a simple gesture of compassion. He wouldn’t do it, because that would have meant confronting something awkward and taking responsibility for it. That’s not Johnson’s style, as we saw again this week when he ducked the emergency Commons debate on the Tories’ rising sleaze scandal, sending out one of his human sponges to absorb the mess instead. He lacks the empathy to look properly chastened by the plight of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Indeed, he seems unable to feel any shame at all. Any man who has to be told three times to wear a mask in a hospital obviously lacks that capacity. Even so, Johnson is clearly too frightened to face Ratcliffe, a man frail and exhausted with hunger. Perhaps he knows that in the story of that man and his imprisoned wife all his weaknesses are laid bare – and he can’t bear to look. Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "‘Super rare’: Antarctic penguin washes up in New Zealand, 3,000km from home ",
          "bodyText": "An Antarctic penguin has traversed 3,000km of icy waters to find himself far from home and on new and puzzling shores: the south-eastern coastline of New Zealand. The Adélie penguin in question, affectionately named “Pingu” by locals, was spotted looking somewhat lost at Birdlings Flat, a small settlement on New Zealand’s South Island. It’s only the third recorded instance of a live Adélie penguin – a species that makes its home on the Antarctic peninsula – making it to New Zealand. Its arrival is a reminder of the threats the birds face from warming waters, increased competition over food supplies, and changed habitats. After observing that the penguin was not getting in the water and could be vulnerable to dogs, locals called Thomas Stracke of Christchurch Penguin Rehabilitation. Stracke said when he arrived with a vet, he was shocked to find an Adélie penguin. “Apart from being a bit starving and severely dehydrated, he was actually not too bad, so we gave him some fluids and some fish smoothie,” Stracke said. The penguin was released into a bay on the banks peninsula, where his helpers hope he may be able to make the journey home. “I would have preferred to get him on the Hercules [air force plane] that drops staff at Scott Base,” Stracke said, but he was told by the Department of Conservation that the idea was not feasible. “They had a meeting with the other big penguin guns and they said no.” Stracke said warming waters meant the birds were struggling to find food supply. “When the waters warm up because the fish usually go into deeper cold waters. And so there’s no fish around,” he said. New Zealand’s populations of yellow-eyed penguins were also struggling as they competed with fishing businesses for food and the rehabilitation centre was seeing increasing numbers of malnourished or starving penguins come in, he said, calling the situation a “nightmare”. Otago University zoology professor Philip Seddon said Pingu’s appearance was “super rare,” and that it could have been a younger bird that strayed too far and got caught in a current that carried him into New Zealand waters. Seddon said that while Adélie penguin populations looked to be stable at the moment – increasing in some areas and decreasing elsewhere – there were plenty of possible threats in their future, and changes in penguin behaviour could be an early warning sign that the marine ecosystem was in crisis. “All species of penguin are like marine sentinels … when they’re doing badly, they’re giving us an early signal – canaries in coalmines – an early signal that things are not good,” he said. Seddon said while one arrival did not make a trend, “I think if we started getting annual arrivals of Adélie penguins, we’d go actually, something’s changed in the ocean that we need to understand.” “More studies will give us more understanding where penguins go, what they do, what the population trends are like – they’re going to tell us something about the health of that marine ecosystem in general.” Global heating is affecting Antarctic penguin habitats in uneven and sometimes unpredictable ways: in some areas, sea ice is expanding, but in other crucial areas it’s decreasing. That can have a mixed effect on penguin populations: some loss of sea ice can actually help Adélies, allowing more viable breeding space. But too much warming can also disrupt those habitats, or the food supplies penguins rely on: according to Nasa, in the areas of Antarctica that are experiencing warming, Adélie populations are either declining or expected to drop off in the next 40 years – and as sea ice decreases it can prompt changes in the migration patterns of the Ross Sea penguins. At times, those changes have led to disaster: in 2017, a colony of 40,000 Adélie penguins suffered a “catastrophic breeding event” – where all but two chicks died of starvation. It was the second mass death in just four years, marking a cluster of breeding disasters not previously seen in more than 50 years of observation."

          "bodyText": "Ozlem Demirboga Carr is not really into all that woo‑woo stuff. “I’m definitely a full-science kind of person,” says the 41-year-old telecoms worker from Reading. She doesn’t believe in crystals, affirmations or salt lamps. But she did find herself unusually anxious during the UK’s Covid lockdown in March 2020 and, like many people, decided to practise yoga as a way to de-stress. “I tried to be open-minded and I was open to advice on trying to improve my wellbeing and mental health,” she says. So she followed a range of social media accounts, including the “somatic therapist and biz coach” Phoebe Greenacre, known for her yoga videos, and the “women’s empowerment and spiritual mentor” Kelly Vittengl. The Instagram algorithm did its work. “I suddenly found myself following so many wellness accounts,” she says. When the deployment of the Covid vaccine got under way, Carr began to see posts that troubled her, ranging from polite concern about the social consequences of mass vaccination, or the politics underpinning it, to full-blown rejection of the science. “The conversation and tone of their posts shifted,” she says. “At first it was all about self-care and being part of a community that is caring for each other. But then they started to speak more about how there should be a choice when it came to vaccines. They were saying things like: ‘My body, my choice.’” Carr watched as Greenacre posted an Instagram story describing vaccine passports as “medical apartheid”. Vittengl went further. In a post in July, Vittengl, who is unvaccinated, compared vaccine passports to the social polarisation witnessed during the Holocaust and spoke about the “mess” caused by the “ideology of the western medical system”. “We aren’t being shown the full picture,” Vittengl concluded, in a post that was liked by Greenacre. Greenacre subsequently invited Vittengl on to her podcast, where Vittengl discussed the pernicious influence of “big pharma” and celebrated the work of the controversial doctor Zach Bush, who has been called a “Covid denialist” by researchers at McGill University in Montreal. Such views are anything but exceptional in the wellness community. If anything, they are on the milder end of the spectrum. Anti-vaccine or vaccine-hesitant attitudes are as abundant in online wellness circles as pastel-coloured Instagram infographics and asana poses on the beach at sunset. “People are really confused by what is happening,” says Derek Beres, the co-host of Conspirituality, a podcast about the convergence of conspiracy theories and wellness. “Why is their yoga instructor sharing QAnon hashtags?” In May, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that just 12 influencers were responsible for nearly 65% of anti-vaccine content on Facebook and Twitter. “Many of these leading anti-vaxxers are alternative health entrepreneurs … They’re reaching millions of users every day,” says Callum Hood of the CCDH. “This is a serious problem. Vaccine hesitancy has become a difficult and entrenched obstacle to dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.” Included within the CCDH’s “disinformation dozen” are Joseph Mercola, a US wellness entrepreneur called the “most influential spreader of Covid-19 misinformation online” by the New York Times; Dr Christiane Northrup, a wellness expert who helped popularise the notorious Covid pseudo-documentary Plandemic by sharing it with her 560,000 Facebook followers; and Kelly Brogan, a contributor to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop wellness platform. Mikki Willis, the director of Plandemic, is well known in the California yoga scene, while David “Avocado” Wolfe, a conspiracy theorist and raw food advocate, is a regular figure at anti-vaccination protests across the US. Away from the CCDH’s list, other prominent figures include the yoga instructor Stephanie Birch, who has posted QAnon hashtags on her now-deleted Instagram account, and Krystal Tini, a wellness influencer with 169,000 Instagram followers, who has consistently posted anti-vaccine content, including one post that compared lockdowns to the horrors inflicted on Polish Jews in the Warsaw ghetto. Comparing vaccine deployment to historic atrocities such as slavery and the Holocaust is a routine trope in anti-vaccine wellness circles; the Los Angeles wellness and beauty guru Shiva Rose recently compared vaccines to McCarthyism, slavery, the Cultural Revolution, the Spanish Inquisition and the Holocaust, all in one post. Beres says many of these wellness influencers are “using cult leader techniques in digital spaces”, sowing fear and hesitancy about the Covid vaccine among their followers, one Instagram post at a time. They maintain, however, that they are misunderstood or misrepresented. When contacted by the Guardian, Greenacre distanced herself from Vittengl’s comments on her podcast. “It would be incorrect and misleading to your readers to suggest comments from a third party reflect my own,” she said. She also said that she used the term “medical apartheid” to refer to “the use of discrimination and segregation based on medical status, for example treating people negatively based on their medical status by use of Covid vaccine passports”, rather than anything relating to historical discrimination based on race. Vittengl, meanwhile, stated that she is “not against the western medical system … However, I do feel that the industry has been heavily taken over by big pharmaceutical companies who are primarily concerned with finances over health.” She defended the work of Bush. “He is compassionately trying to help find more answers,” she said. Carr, however, decided to unfollow both women. Now, when she wants to practise yoga, she watches the Sweaty Betty YouTube channel. *** We have had more than a decade of the modern iteration of wellness. A decade of vagina candles, chia bowls, coffee enemas and spirulina shots. A decade of burnt-out, anxious, unhappy women seeking to detoxify their bodies, rebalance their chakras and recentre their divine femininity, ideally while losing weight. The global wellness industry is worth about $1.5tn (£1.1tn) – and for every saintly Yoga With Adriene there are thousands of grifters pushing untested therapies on impressionable people. Although the modern iteration of wellness rose out of the primordial goop of the late 00s (Paltrow, the high priest of wellness, founded her lifestyle brand in 2008, originally as a newsletter), the origins of the movement go back to the hippy counterculture of the 70s. Then, as now, wellness presented itself as a remedy to the travails of modern life. It was structured around three tenets: robust individualism, distrust of western medicine and a commitment to self-optimisation, usually through restrictive diets and vigorous exercise regimens, designed to stave off disease and death for as long as possible. In her 2018 book Natural Causes: Life, Death and the Illusion of Control, Barbara Ehrenreich wrote: “Wellness is the means to remake oneself into an ever-more perfect self-correcting machine, capable of setting goals and moving toward them with smooth determination.” In the 70s and 80s, Ann Wigmore proselytised the ability of a raw-food diet to cure cancer, diabetes and Aids. “There is this belief that if you stay true to a certain lifestyle and only ingest a particular kind of food and drink, that guards you against disease,” says Carl Cederström, the co-author of Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement: A Year Inside the Optimization Movement. “You create a strong armour around yourself by living healthily.” By contrast, western medicine – in particular the pernicious influence of big pharma – conspires to keep the masses sick. “There’s this suspicion about science,” Cederström says. “You often hear the rhetoric that modern civilisation is poisoning our lives, poisoning our food, and we need to find ways of living clean again, by cutting ourselves loose from a society that is constraining us and forcing us to live an inauthentic, unnatural lifestyle.” The polluting tributary in wellness’s fresh, clear stream has always been its unwavering insistence that health is a choice rather than something genetically predetermined or socially ordained. Few wellness practitioners say outright that people who are morbidly obese, have type 2 diabetes or have a mental illness suffer by their own hand: they instead couch their judgment in euphemisms and misdirection. “Wellness has very strong ties to the self-help movement,” says Cederström. “And what you find at the core of these movements is the idea that you should be able to help yourself.” Rhonda Byrne, the author of the bestselling self-help book The Secret – which portrayed the power of positive thinking as a curative to all of life’s ills – once claimed that the victims of 9/11 were in the wrong place at the wrong time due to their own negative thoughts and outlook on the world. “A more general theory as to why people would happily tune into the ideology of wellness, and in particular this individualistic attitude, is that it is in some ways self-flattering,” says Cederström. “We live in a culture that connects morality to health. If you have a good, middle-class life, you’re encouraged to believe that you deserve it. If you’re poor and unhealthy – well, you didn’t work hard enough.” For nearly 50 years, the world of wellness has viewed health as something that can be shrugged on or off at will, like a cashmere sweater. Doctors are to be distrusted and individuals should take responsibility for their own “wellness journey”. Then the Covid vaccine programme began – and this anti‑scientific attitude metastasised into something far more harmful. “This is a very long-running thing,” says Hood. “We’re seeing that erosion of trust in mainstream medicine flowering now. And it’s very dangerous.” *** Before Catherine Gabitan, who is 31 and lives in northern California, became an “overcoming self-sabotage” coach, she worked in the service industry. Gabitan usually rose to manager roles easily, but despite the promotions she never felt that she was fulfilling her true potential, as an A-grade student with a college degree. She smoked cigarettes, drank coffee and alcohol and ate processed foods. Despite her best efforts, she could never kick these habits. “One of my initial inspirations for becoming really healthy was to make sure I had a really clean body, so that I could be the healthiest vessel I could be in order to have the healthiest baby,” Gabitan says. In early 2020, Gabitan bought a $199 lecture series from the self‑sabotage coach Jason Christoff. Christoff, who also styles himself as a nutrition and exercise expert, shares misinformation about the Covid vaccine on his public Facebook page and his Telegram channel. When contacted by the Guardian for comment, Christoff responded: “Maybe you should look into who sponsors your own newspaper, but that would get you sacked.” He subsequently wrote a blog linking the Guardian to a plot by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the global population by 10-15%. “Is the Guardian and their sponsors watching out for public health or are they colluding to decrease population and public health, in order to place the remaining population under firm tyrannical control?” Christoff wrote. Christoff helped Gabitan to realise that, for years, she had not believed herself to be worthy of “a higher level of health”. She explains: “My subconscious beliefs regarding why I didn’t feel worthy of having a business or learning to invest, or why I drank alcohol or smoked cigarettes – all these things were related to what I felt worthy of achieving.” Christoff’s lecture series had the invigorating quality of an ice bath after a sauna. Almost immediately, Gabitan embarked upon what she calls her “health journey”. She quit coffee, smoking, alcohol and gluten. She began exercising three times a week and eating only organic, locally produced food. She also quit the service industry, rebranding as a self-sabotage coach. When the Covid vaccine programme began, Gabitan, who is unvaccinated, began sharing anti-vaccine content on her Instagram page. “Injecting poison will never make you healthy,” she posted on 8 July. “We’re taught that ‘germs’ and genetics make us sick so we don’t have to take responsibility for our toxic lifestyles,” she wrote on 23 July. “Could other people’s need to micromanage what we put on or in our bodies be a projection of their poor health history and inability to take responsibility for their own health?” she asked on 16 August. Gabitan sees health through a hyperindividualistic moral frame. She takes control of her own health; if other people won’t help themselves, why should she? “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink,” she says. “I spend a lot of money investing in the highest-quality foods available to me. I believe in natural immunity and supporting my immune system. I’ve taken radical responsibility for that, especially over Covid. And there are other people out there who are still drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes who want me to protect their health, but they won’t even protect their own health.” In this, Gabitan exhibits the logical fallacy of wellness: the idea that the human mind is a drill sergeant and the organs of our body obediently fall in line. “You may exercise diligently, eat a medically fashionable diet, and still die of a sting from an irritated bee,” Ehrenreich said in Natural Causes. “You may be a slim, toned paragon of wellness, and still a macrophage within your body may decide to throw in its lot with an incipient tumour.” Gabitan does not need the vaccine, because she is a shining paragon of health. The people dying from Covid are people with disabilities, or those who are already sick, obese or old. What happens to them is nothing for Gabitan to trouble herself about unduly, as an able-bodied member of the wellness community. “A lot of the people that are experiencing hospitalisations from Covid had a lot of other co-morbidities, right?” Gabitan says. “Or they are overweight. If our government had promoted a healthy lifestyle, healthy eating, from the beginning … that would have done a lot more to prevent some of these hospitalisations by actually encouraging people to become the healthiest versions of themselves. Right. So, for me, one premise is people taking responsibility for their own health.” It sounds, I respond, as if you are saying that, when people get sick, it is their fault; not bad luck, because anyone can get sick at any time. “See, I don’t think it’s just bad luck,” she says. “I think part of it is people taking responsibility for their own health, to make sure they’re not putting toxins in their body – and the other part of it is not being exposed to pollution.” Nobody close to her has died from Covid. Gabitan also believes the vaccine to be dangerous and ineffective. “The vaccine doesn’t stop transmission,” she says. (The vaccine is thought to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to other people, although this protection wanes with time.) She is concerned about the impact of the vaccine on her fertility – this is a common fear among the vaccine-hesitant and is particularly prevalent in wellness circles, which are mostly female – and doesn’t trust data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US health agency. She prefers to get information about the vaccine from Telegram, the Children’s Health Defense (a group founded by Robert F Kennedy Jr that is a major source of vaccine disinformation) and Project Veritas, a far-right conspiracy theory site. As a result of the research she has conducted over the last year, Gabitan’s distrust of medical science now extends beyond the Covid vaccine. If she had children, she would not vaccinate them against any disease. She would reject modern medicine in virtually all cases, excepting broken bones. Modern medicine is “designed to deal with symptoms, not the reason the symptoms showed up in the first place”, she says. I ask Gabitan, who is affable and willing to answer all my questions, why she agreed to speak with me, given our dramatically different perspectives on the vaccine. “To have open dialogue, even with people with different opinions, is the only way that we can heal what’s going on in the world,” she says. I tell her that many people would find her attitude selfish and disturbing. “I don’t want to be callous,” Gabitan says. “Because my goal is to help other people live the healthiest life that they can. That’s my passion in the world.” I am certain that she believes it. *** Gabitan’s views are by no means a reflection of all wellness practitioners. Deepak Chopra, the famed yoga and meditation expert, has urged people to get vaccinated. “It’s mistaken and unfair to use a fringe group as the tar that stains everyone else,” Chopra wrote in a blog in June. But Gabitan’s attitude is an example, however extreme, of how the ideological structures of wellness may support anti-vaccine attitudes. Before Conspirituality’s Beres worked in technology, he was a yoga instructor. “Even though I’ve been involved in the yoga and wellness world since the 90s, I’ve always been sceptical of a lot of the claims,” he says. “When you get into yoga, there are a lot of health claims that sound OK if you’re at a nice yoga studio in a major city, but don’t reflect reality.” He sees people like Gabitan as the logical end point of 50 years of telling people that virtue is to be signalled with striated abs and a rippling musculature. “When you live in a country where even a relatively modest middle-class lifestyle is way above what the rest of the world can sustain, it’s very easy to get locked into anecdote and your circle of friends,” Beres says. “You think: I drink smoothies and go to yoga and work out seven days a week and eat organic food. Why can’t everyone else do it?” The US – the avocado stone of the global wellness community – is, and always has been, extremely individualistic. “Everything is about personal freedom and personal knowledge. What we see here is late-stage capitalism merging with hyperindividualism,” Beres says. The US is also a country without universal healthcare. “If you don’t have insurance, it’s incredibly expensive to get treated,” says Hood of the CCDH. “People develop an interest in looking into alternatives and that’s where wellness influencers step in. You don’t have to spend thousands on doctors. You can just take this supplement or follow this regimen and you will be fine.” Finally, it is a country where pharmaceutical companies have long behaved contemptibly. Last month, Purdue Pharma paid $4.5bn to settle its role in the opioid crisis, after overwhelming evidence emerged that the pharmaceutical company played down the addictive qualities of OxyContin for many years. Claims about the pernicious influence of big pharma are de rigueur in anti-vaccine circles; Plandemic’s central thesis is that big pharma is suppressing affordable cures for Covid to make money from patented medicines. “One thing alternate health entrepreneurs have in common with anti-vaxxers is that they talk about big pharma a lot,” says Hood. “It’s no coincidence that the organised anti-vaxx movement has its home in the US. Because there’s a greater profit motive in US healthcare, there’s a level of suspicion.” The irony, of course, is that many wellness practitioners are also motivated by profit. “It’s a business for them, but they’re not open about it,” says Beres. But to understand why some people may be driven to anti-vaccine attitudes is not to excuse their wider impact on community health, or the distressing implication that they regard the lives of those less fortunate than themselves as having scant value. “Some of the most strikingly nasty stuff I’ve seen with Covid misinformation has come from wellness influencers,” Hood says. On the subject of nastiness, he refers to a widely circulated meme (shared this year by the TV presenter Anthea Turner, to outrage) featuring a fat person on a mobility scooter asking a slim person to wear a mask. “The implication is that the person in the mobility scooter is somehow morally deficient and doesn’t have the authority to ask someone to wear a mask,” says Hood. There are similar attitudes where vaccines are concerned. “There is this nasty sense from some anti-vaxxer people that the people who have fallen ill with Covid are somehow deserving of it.” *** Social media companies, for their part, are reluctant to take down disinformation. “Social media is the wild west when it comes to health claims,” says Hood. “You can say whatever you want.” Research in 2020 by the CCDH found that platforms failed to act on 95% of Covid and vaccine misinformation reported to them. Wellness influencers – including members of the CCDH’s “disinformation dozen” – remain on social media platforms with a nudge and a wink. Often, they refer users to their Telegram channels, where they really let rip. (Telegram is unmoderated.) While Northrup has had her Instagram account disabled, her Facebook page links to her Telegram channel, in which she deluges 58,000 people with a flow of anti-vaccine disinformation. Likewise, Wolfe exhorts his Facebook fans to follow him on Telegram, where he unleashes. Technology companies are slow to take down anti-vaccine content, because it is lucrative. Mercola has 1.7m engaged followers on Facebook; Wolfe an astonishing 11.9m. Outrage fuels engagement, which drives revenue, for the influencer and the social media platform. In March, Mercola joined the newsletter platform Substack – his paid-for subscription costs $5 a month, of which Substack takes 10% as commission. It is already the 11th-most-read paid health newsletter on the platform. (While Substack’s terms of use ban plagiarism, pornography and intellectual property theft, there is no prohibition on disinformation.) Some of the people pushing anti-vaccine content do so in the sincere belief they are working for the public good. “They believe themselves to be martyrs,” Beres says. “They’re fully bought in. They think this is an apocalyptic-level battle they were made for, to be the champions.” But Beres believes others “are like: ‘Wow. I can make a bunch of money here.’” When wellness influencers start to post anti-vaccine content online, a calcifying effect takes place. Pro-vaccine people unfollow; a few push back in the comments, but ultimately also unfollow, whereas followers who were hesitant about vaccines waver towards anti-vaccine attitudes and committed anti-vaxxers congregate, with applause. Before Gabitan began posting anti-vaccine content on her Instagram account, an average post would get 20-30 likes; now, she can easily get more than 150 likes on a post about big pharma. “The more people get this social reinforcement, the more anti-vaxx they become,” says Hood. As a result, anti-vaccine wellness influencers get an influx of followers, many of them new to the community. “What happened after Plandemic is that QAnon infiltrated wellness circles,” says Beres. “Yoga instructors started using QAnon hashtags and watched their following grow by hundreds of thousands.” Online wellness is so closely affiliated with QAnon that the phenomenon has been called “pastel QAnon” by Marc-André Argentino, a researcher at Concordia University in Montreal. Carr is baffled by how QAnon, a rightwing movement, has infiltrated what was historically a hippy, countercultural space. “The similarities between rightwing groups and the wellness community scares me,” she says. This dopamine pull of likes and engagement encourages influencers to skew extreme, all the while positioning themselves as victims of so-called cancel culture or online hate mobs. In an Instagram story posted after Vittengl stated her views on vaccination, she portrayed herself as a victim. “The backlash is unbelievable,” she wrote. “As an energetically sensitive person [someone who feels emotions in a heightened way] it can sometimes be too much. But … not speaking up no longer feels like a choice.” She later tells me: “I understand how this may come off as ‘victim mentality’, but it is a very real and very intense phenomenon.” Carr finds this narrative maddening. “This community feels like they are being victimised, but they are not victims. They are privileged, well-off people with choices.” Carr is British-Turkish and takes umbrage with how the community co-opts the language of human rights to advocate against vaccines. “That makes me crazy,” says Carr. “To portray vaccines as against human rights ... I come from a country where human rights are constantly being diminished.” In the absence of action from the social media giants, all users like Carr can do is unfollow their former gurus. “In a passive way, that’s my solution,” she says. Many more users will no doubt replace them. “If you’re an ordinary person who’s having doubts about the vaccine and you start looking for answers, you’re far more likely to come across an anti-vaxx source than you are an authoritative source like the NHS or CDC,” says Hood. “These are effective and very intentional ways of radicalising people.” He hopes that this alignment of the wellness community with anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists will prompt a wider reappraisal of an industry that, for many years, has been replete with charlatans and quacks, profiting from that most fundamental of human desires – a desire for health. “I’m not saying the whole thing is rotten,” Hood says. “But there are broader questions to be asked about wellness and the alternative health industry. This is the end product of telling people they can control their health through willpower and diet. Most of the time, as a society, we don’t think that’s so harmful. But when it comes to the pandemic, it’s quite obvious that it is harmful. Probably the harms were there all the time. But the pandemic has exposed them.” • This article was amended on 11 November 2021. A previous version said CCDH research found that 95% of social media platforms failed to act on Covid and vaccine misinformation reported to them. In fact, the figure of 95% referred to the percentage of reported misinformation that was not removed by social media companies."

          "headline": "Government reveals plan to reform Australia’s whistleblowing laws",
          "bodyText": "The federal government has outlined a detailed plan to reform Australia’s whistleblowing laws and remove secrecy offences to drive “trust and accountability in the public sector”, as new research shows the current scheme is failing to protect those who speak out about wrongdoing. The assistant attorney general, Amanda Stoker, told the National Whistleblowing Symposium on Thursday that the government would move to reform the Public Interest Disclosure Act, which is designed to shield public sector whistleblowers from reprisal. The government was warned of the failings of Australia’s whistleblower laws more than four years ago, in a review by Philip Moss, but has not yet acted on his recommendations. The former attorney general Christian Porter signalled a willingness to reform the act in 2019, after the police raids on the ABC and the search of Herald-Sun political editor Annika Smethurst’s home. But Stoker on Thursday laid out for the first time a detailed plan for reform. She described the current whistleblower laws as “inaccessible and overly complex” with “structural and technical flaws, which make its provisions difficult to navigate and interpret”. Stoker signalled the government would seek to make it easier for whistleblowers to access legal advice and compel the heads of government agencies to take greater steps to support them during the disclosure process. Witnesses to alleged wrongdoing would also be better protected, she said, and all investigation reports produced as a result of a disclosure would be required to go to the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the intelligence watchdog, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Those agencies would be given greater powers to perform oversight roles to ensure disclosures were properly handled, including the ability to “make inquiries and recommendations about an investigation report”. “Further consideration is also being given to prescribing additional agencies as investigative agencies,” Stoker said. “This will give disclosers additional avenues through which to make a disclosure and will leverage the investigative agencies’ expertise and specialist powers under their own legislation to address wrongdoing.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Stoker also signalled the government would tighten the kinds of conduct that could prompt a disclosure. Disclosures made in the pursuit of workplace grievances, she said, would not attract protection. “This will free up agencies’ valuable resources to focus on allegations of more serious wrongdoing,” she said. The government, she said, wanted to remove the general secrecy offence, which broadly criminalises the revelation of anything secret, saying it was “not fit for purpose and is limiting the ability of agencies to respond to alleged wrongdoing”. The intention of the reforms was to bring the public sector whistleblowing laws in line with the recently reformed corporate whistleblowing scheme, which had been widely praised by experts. That would involve expanding the definition of “detriment” to protect against a broader range of reprisals against whistleblowers, and reversing the burden of proof in civil claims to make it easier for whistleblowers to prove their claim for protection. It would also clarify that protections would be afforded to former public officials, not just current ones, and would shield those who had the potential to make a disclosure, regardless of whether or not they actually go ahead with it. That would protect people who become aware of information that could enable them to make a disclosure. Stoker also reaffirmed greater protections for journalists, including a review of secrecy provisions to give greater protection to public interest journalism, and introducing safeguards against warrants being issued for journalists over unlawful disclosures. The government would not commit to the reforms prior to the election. But Stoker said work on the reforms was “well advanced”. The reform pledge comes as new research out of Griffith University showed the current whistleblowing regime was failing to protect individuals, even in high-priority cases. As a result of making a disclosure, about 77% of whistleblowers reported experiencing collateral damage, including stress, isolation or ostracism, and 43.7% reported direct damage, including harassment or intimidation, discipline, or the denial of promotions. Prof AJ Brown, a leading expert in whistleblower protections, welcomed Stoker’s commitments to reform, telling the symposium he was heartened to hear the detailed plan for the first time. He told the symposium that less than half of all whistleblowers who were high priority for protection and experienced repercussions received any remedy. Compensation, the data showed, was extremely rare. “There’s not much evidence that compensation is flowing in cases where it’s really needed,” Brown said. He said the research showed the urgent need for reforms to the whistleblower regime. “I’m really glad to say that what senator Stoker has outlined is really starting to address some of those issues, many of those issues, indeed,” he said. “And the question now is how quickly we can get on to it.”"

          "bodyText": "That is it for the liveblog today. A lot has happened and it certainly got more exciting as the day wore on. Here is a quick round up of where we are. A draft of the Cop26 negotiation outcome was published overnight. Reaction has largely been negative, but there are some areas where progress has been made. We’ll have a detailed analysis of what it all means from our resident expert Fiona Harvey shortly. On transport day, protesters have been advocating for better public transport and a greater focus on sustainable transport modes such as cycling and walking, which have been largely overlooked by officials. The Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, urged delegates to “come armed with the currency of compromise … what we agree will set the future for our children and grandchildren and I know we will not want to fail them”. Thirsty congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is on the hunt for some Irn-Bru.. Boris Johnson made a very brief visit to Glasgow urging world leaders to make a final effort in negotiations as Cop26 draws to a close An hour or so later [though not sure it had anything to do with the UK prime minister] the US and China, world’s two biggest emitters, revealed a joint declaration promising to work together across a range of critical issues, surprising many observers and potentially breathing some life into the last days of this summit. Join us tomorrow for day 11 at Cop26. The US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration follows a flurry of diplomacy. My hopes were raised when I saw John Kerry sit down with Xie Zhenhua and other officials in the China delegation office last week. At the time I tweeted “Fingers crossed that chief negotiators of worlds two biggest emitters can work together and nudge the world closer to 1.5C climate target.” I’d also heard from sources in China that the two climate diplomats held a convivial meeting in London shortly before the conference started. The foundations for an agreement were coming together. In an interview last week, senior adviser Wang Yi made clear China could peak coal use by 2025. He also said China was taking domestic action on methane and other non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases, though on principle it did not sign up to last week’s Glasgow alliance on this subject because it felt developed nations should take the lead. That position appears to have softened in this agreement, which Kerry will be able to take back to Washington as a sign that the two nations can work together on climate, even if they remain at odds in other areas of gepolitics. This has got to be a boost for negotiations in Glasgow. The biggest historical emitter (USA) and the biggest current emitter (China) have sent a strong signal they will scale back together. That has made my day. No meaningful deal is possible without them. Now, let’s see how far they are willing to go. Bernice Lee, an expert in environment and climate politics from Chatham House think tank, said: It can only be good news that the US and China are working closely on climate change and slashing methane emissions. Details remain patchy but this declaration should dissolve any fears that US-China tensions will stand in the way of success at COP26. But the statement is not enough to close the deal. The real test of Washington and Beijing is how hard they push for a 1.5C aligned deal here in Glasgow. Thom Woodroofe, a former climate diplomat and now fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute working on US-China climate cooperation, says the declaration by the two countries is an important acknowledgement by the two big emitters “that more needs to be done and of their responsibility to do more”. But he says it is also an acknowledgement of the shortcomings of the outcome expected in Glasgow, and the extent to which the world is relying on what happens next. ”While this is not a game-changer in the way the 2014 US-China climate deal was, in many ways it’s just as much of a step forward given the geopolitical state of the relationship. It means the intense level of US-China dialogue on climate can now begin to translate into cooperation. ”Both sides benefit from this. For the US, it shows they are coming away from Glasgow with at least a signal by China that they hope to be able to do more this decade and with ways to hold their feet to the fire. For China, it helps stem the perception they came to Glasgow entirely empty handed. It will also be a helpful shot in the arm for the final COP26 negotiations over the coming days and helps smooth the runway for next week’s Biden-Xi call. ”The big substantive outcome here is China’s affirmation of acting in line with the Paris temperature goals, to ‘make best efforts to accelerate’ a decrease in coal consumption and joining the tent on methane reductions (but stopping short of signing the recent global methane pledge).” The Kerry conference has now finished. Back in the press conference Kerry says that there are lots of people around the world “ready to come to the table” and that together they will be able to move things forward much faster. “If we work hard we can take this to a better level.” A bit more reaction coming in on the US/China deal. This from the secretary general of the UN. Meanwhile E3G chief executive Nick Mabey said: “The big significance of this is geopolitical. US &amp; China have signalled they will end the wars of words that marred the past days. They will now build climate cooperation bilaterally &amp; in multilateral fora. This high profile commitment puts pressure on both countries to move their positions to make COP 26 a success.” Kerry said the US and China had been honest with each other. He said both presidents had made it clear that while there were differences on many issues between the two countries they were determined to work together on the climate crisis which he said was the most pressing issue facing the world. “We are stepping up,” he added. John Kerry is now speaking. He says out of the co-operation between China and the US will accelerate the reduction in emissions. He said people could leave Glasgow with people working together to solve the issue of climate change and that is the road US and China had chosen. This is from my colleague Fiona Harvey. China and the US announced a surprise plan to work together on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the crucial next decade, in a strong boost to the Cop26 summit, as negotiators wrangled over a draft outcome. The world’s two biggest emitters had been trading insults since before the start of the conference, but on Wednesday evening unveiled a joint declaration that would see the world’s two biggest economies cooperate closely on the emissions cuts scientists say are needed in the next ten years to stay within 1.5C. The remarkable turnaround came as a surprise to the UK hosts, and will send a strong signal to the 190-plus other countries at the talks. China and the US will work together on some key specific areas, such as cutting methane – a powerful greenhouse gas – and emissions from transport, energy and industry. Xie Zhenhua, China’s head of delegation, said: “Climate change is becoming an increasingly urgent challenge.We hope this joint declaration will help to achieve success at Cop26.” John Kerry said: “The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together on emissions in this decisive decade.” The China US Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s came despite growing political tensions between the two powers, that had been reflected in the climate talks. In his parting shot at the conference, Joe Biden on Tuesday slammed China’s president Xi Jinping for “not turning up”. After that, Xie took a swipe at the US in an interview with the Guardian, saying: “We are not like some countries who withdrew from the Paris Agreement after entering into talks.” Reaction on the China US declaration from climate scientist and author Simon Lewis here. While we are waiting for Kerry’s press conference to start it is worth saying that this already feels like a big moment at Cop26. The world’s two most powerful countries - and biggest emitters - have done what feels like a fairly far reaching deal setting out ongoing co-operation over the next decade across a wide range of issues. Xie says he hopes to create a global carbon market to enhance efforts to tackle emissions. Then he says that is the end of the press conference as John Kerry is waiting outside and wants to give his briefing. The full declaration is now available here online. It states: The United States and China, alarmed by reports including the Working Group I Contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report released on August 9th, 2021, further recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis. And adds: The two sides intend to cooperate on: a. regulatory frameworks and environmental standards related to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in the 2020s; b. maximizing the societal benefits of the clean energy transition; c. policies to encourage decarbonization and electrification of end-use sectors; d. key areas related to the circular economy, such as green design and renewable resource utilization; and e. deployment and application of technology such as CCUS and direct air capture. Recognizing specifically the significant role that emissions of methane play in increasing temperatures, both countries consider increased action to control and reduce such emissions to be a matter of necessity in the 2020s. To this end: a. The two countries intend to cooperate to enhance the measurement of methane emissions; to exchange information on their respective policies and programs for strengthening management and control of methane; and to foster joint research into methane emission reduction challenges and solutions. b. The United States has announced the U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan. c. Taking into account the above cooperation, as appropriate, the two sides intend to do the following before COP 27: i. They intend to develop additional measures to enhance methane emission control, at both the national and sub-national levels. ii. In addition to its recently communicated NDC, China intends to develop a comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane aiming to achieve a significant effect on methane emissions control and reductions in the 2020s. d. The United States and China intend to convene a meeting in the first half of 2022 to focus on the specifics of enhancing measurement and mitigation of methane, including through standards to reduce methane from the fossil and waste sectors, as well as incentives and programs to reduce methane from the agricultural sector. In order to reduce CO2 emissions: a. The two countries intend to cooperate on: i. Policies that support the effective integration of high shares of low-cost intermittent renewable energy; ii. Transmission policies that encourage efficient balancing of electricity supply and demand across broad geographies; iii. Distributed generation policies that encourage integration of solar, storage, and other clean power solutions closer to electricity users; and iv. Energy efficiency policies and standards to reduce electricity waste. b. The United States has set a goal to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. c. China will phase down coal consumption during the 15th Five Year Plan and make best efforts to accelerate this work. Recognizing that eliminating global illegal deforestation would contribute meaningfully to the effort to reach the Paris goals, the two countries welcome the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use. The two sides intend to engage collaboratively in support of eliminating global illegal deforestation through effectively enforcing their respective laws on banning illegal imports. Xie is now taking questions and said a joint working group between China and the US would meet in the first half of next year and would focus on methane reduction, decarbonisation and deforestation. Xie said China and US needed to “think big and be responsible” and “actively address climate change and through cooperation” bring huge benefits to people around the world. It seems like China and US are planning to work together across a wide range of climate issues. Xie Zhenhua said the two countries intended to put their cooperation on a firmer footing in the years ahead. He said climate change was a common challenge faced by humanity and was an existential threat. He said that on climate change there was more agreement than divergence between China and US and he hoped this new declaration would help make Cop26 a success. He said both sides had agreed to cooperate on renewable energy rollout and decarbonising the energy system. He said China planned to set up its own methane reduction plan to work alongside the deal set out by the US and others last week. He said the US and China had reached agreement on climate finance, NDCs and would work with other countries to tackle other issues. He said both countries had reiterated the Paris goal and committed to adapt to an “enhanced climate action” progress in the 2020s. The press conference has started and China’s climate spokesman Xie Zhenhua has announced a “China-US joint Glasgow declaration on enhancing climate action”. He said since the beginning of this year the two teams had been working in dialogue, have had 30 virtual meetings and have reached an agreement. We are expecting a press conference from the Chinese delegation shortly. It is not clear (at least to me) what the main thrust of it will be but my colleague Fiona Harvey is there and we will keep us updated. Not many people addressing Cop26 are speaking up for fossil fuels openly (though it appears hundreds probably are behind closed doors), but Yury Sentyurin, the secretary general of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, gave it a go today. The GECF includes Russia, Iran, Nigeria and Qatar. Sentyurin ticked off all the industry talking points. “Natural gas complements intermittent renewables,” he said. Hundreds of millions of people in Africa without access to electricity or clean cooking fuel should “use gas as the core source of energy”. “We believe sincerely that natural gas does offer the balanced solution that the world seeks to achieve sustainable development goals,” he concluded. The problem is not many agree these days that gas should be a bridge fuel between coal and renewables. That’s because burning gas still produces a lot of CO2, time is very short to halt the climate emergency and renewables are getting ever cheaper. Last week, a report from Climate Analytics (the team behind the alarming 2.4C projection that made headlines yesterday) dismissed the arguments for gas. “Gas is not a bridging fuel, blue hydrogen is not a bridging technology, ultimately, gas is a bridge to nowhere. All governments concerned about climate change who have stated their support for transitioning to a 1.5C world need to understand one thing: gas is the new coal,” said Bill Hare at CA. In September, a scientific study found that 59% of existing gas reserves must stay in the ground to keep global temperature rise below 1.5C. This is a quick report of Johnson’s speech from my colleague Peter Walker. Boris Johnson has urged fellow world leaders to make a final effort in negotiations as Cop26 draws to a close, warning them that failure to reach an effective agreement would bring an “immense” and well-deserved backlash from around the globe. Speaking at the start of a press conference as he made his second visit to Glasgow, the UK prime minister called for “a determined push to get us over the line” – and said some countries had not done enough to achieve this. Leaders not in Glasgow needed to “pick up the phone to their teams here and give them the negotiating margin, give them the space they need in which to manoeuvre and get this done”, Johnson said. “Here in Glasgow the world is closer than it has ever been to signalling the beginning of the end of anthropogenic climate change, and it’s the greatest gift we can possibly bestow on our children and our grandchildren and generations unborn. “We just need to reach out together and grasp it. And so my question to my fellow world leaders this afternoon as we enter the last hours of Cop is – will you help us do that, will you help us graph that opportunity, or will you stand in the way?” Johnson criticised some countries, which he did not name, for “conspicuously patting themselves on the back” for signing up to the Paris climate accord but doing too little at Cop. Citing speeches to the conference such as one given at the start by Mia Mottley, the Barbados prime minister, who called for concerted action, Johnson said: “If you stood and applauded her then, you cannot now sit on your hands as the world asks you to act. Because the world knows what a mess our planet is in. “The world will find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver that. And the backlash from people will be immense and it will be long-lasting, and frankly we will deserve their criticism and their opprobrium. “Because we know what needs to be done, and we all agree what needs to be done. We just need the courage, actually, to get on and do it. “So now is the time for everyone to come together and show the determination needed to power on through the blockages.” With the prime minister’s brief intervention seemingly over it is worth remembering this is supposed to be transport day at Cop26. My colleague Severin Carrell has this update on the failure to tackle global aviation emissions. Transport campaigners have roundly condemned a decision to postpone for at least a year any detailed proposals to curb the global aviation industry’s climate emissions, unveiled during transport day at the Cop summit. A declaration backed by 20 states who are the first to join the international aviation climate ambition coalition (IACAC) was published on Wednesday, signed by some major economies such as the UK, US, Japan and France. But other major economies – Germany, China, Russia, and India – were noticeably absent. It commits signatories to “align” aviation with the Paris target of limiting temperature increases to 1.5C, but has postponed adopting interim reduction targets and strategies until an assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation – the industry’s governing body, in a year’s time. Cait Hewitt, policy director of the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “Our politicians seem to be living in a fairytale world where the aviation sector quits its dependence on fossil fuels – and overcomes all the barriers that have existed so far to decarbonisation – at no cost and with no need to curb passenger growth. “We need our leaders to stop pretending that these targets can be achieved just through new fuels and technofixes.” At present, airlines and manufacturers are focusing on “sustainable aviation fuel”, carbon-based fuels that replace or dilute kerosene; carbon offsetting; electrification and hydrogen-fueled aircraft. But there is little expectation green technologies will work on long-haul flights for many years. Haldane Dodd, of the air transport action group in Geneva, told an audience at the summit only 6.5% of global aviation fuel needs would be met by sustainable biofuel sources by 2030. Mira Kapfinger, from the coalition group Stay Grounded, said the technical fixes were illusory and failed to tackled the core issue with aviation: its unrestricted growth and its failure to pay the true environment costs. “More flights mean more emissions - that’s why any serious climate deal for aviation must include measures to reduce air traffic in rich countries,” she said. “IACAC relies on the same strategies that have been proven not to work for years such as offsets and the wait for technological solutions that will not be ready for decades.” Pete Buttigieg, the US transport secretary, told the summit the US, which emits the most aviation emissions per capita of any major country, had yesterday committed its aviation sector to meeting the 2050 net zero target which has already been endorsed by ICAO. It would target 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030, he said, but added that the laws of physics dictated how fast new low carbon technologies could be found, tested and deployed. “It’s a significant contributor to climate change and without dramatic urgent action, there will be a substantial additional growth in emissions, so it falls to us to limit those emissions urgently: the question becomes will we act quickly enough,” he said. One small but important point that is worth flagging up. Johnson said during the press conference that the UK would look at what is being proposed by Denmark and Costa Rica who are organising a coalition of countries committed to phasing out oil and gas production. It gave the impression that this was the first the UK had heard of the plans, but as my colleague Damian Carrington reported this morning, the UK government has already said it is not signing up. And with that Johnson leaves the stage telling the audience he is heading back to London. Short and typically light on specifics. I am not sure that brief intervention is really going to move the dial much on the negotiations. Asked what his presidency has achieved, Johnson said he has tried to listen to the NGOs and those that speak for billions of ordinary people around the world. He says the key outstanding issue is securing a financial deal between the rich, developed world and the countries in the global south on the frontline of the climate crisis. Asked whether the UK will join a international initiative to phase out fossil fuels over the next 30 years put forward by Denmark and Costa Rica, Johnson points to the UK’s record (though of course does not mention the new oilfield off Shetland or its £750m backing for a massive new gas terminal in Africa) and says it will take a look at the proposals on the table. Johnson says he does not want to single out any specific countries at this stage but again urges leaders to take responsibility, to ring up their negotiators and tell them to make progress. Johnson says there are billions of people around the world who are worried about climate change. He adds that Cop26 is not going to solve the issue on its own. But adds that if “things go well … there is the possibility we can still come away” with “a roadmap” for a solution to “anthropogenic climate change”. Asked what can be done to keep 1.5C of warming alive, Johnson says that that critical target is “in the balance”. He says there was progress last week, but says things are now “tough”. He says the 1.5C target is still possible but adds it is “anything but a done deal”. Johnson acknowledges it is not going to be easy and adds what Cop26 achieves “may not be enough” but he urges everyone to step up as the negotiations enter the final hours. He says the world is closer than it has ever been to tackling climate change. He says tackling climate change is within reach – “we just need to reach out and grasp it”. Johnson calls on world leaders to help achieve that, to pick up the phone and give their negotiators the room to compromise and to be more ambitious. Johnson is speaking now and urges “everyone to come together and power on through the blockages”. While we are waiting for Boris Johnson to begin speaking it is worth flagging up this extremely useful guide by my colleague Fiona Harvey which expertly explains and dissects the draft text that was released this morning. A quick Irn-Bru/ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez update. It appears no less than the Scottish first minister hand delivered the can of fizzy pop to the US congresswoman. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, is due to address the Cop26 climate summit shortly urging climate negotiators to “pull out all the stops” with just days of the conference left. The prime minister travelled by train this afternoon after being criticised for flying back from the summit to London last Tuesday (before heading straight to The Garrick Club in London for dinner with the former Telegraph editor Charles Moore, a climate denier). Despite a flurry of carbon-cutting pledges from governments in the first week of Cop26, a new report released yesterday said the world is on track for disastrous levels of global heating far in excess of the limits in the Paris climate agreement. Before today’s speech Johnson said: “This is bigger than any one country and it is time for nations to put aside differences and come together for our planet and our people. We need to pull out all the stops if we’re going to keep 1.5C within our grasp.” Earlier Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, said the prime minister should remain in Glasgow until the end of the summit, and call out countries that are not doing enough. “You’re going to have to have a big public fight about this,” he said. “Don’t go back home after a few hours: stay!” Boris Johnson should stay until the end of Cop26 and wade into the negotiations to prevent the summit ending in failure, Ed Miliband has warned. The prime minister has made a day-trip to Scotland’s second city to meet negotiators and is due to speak shortly – but the shadow energy secretary said Johnson should remain in Glasgow and call out countries that are not doing enough. “You’re going to have to have a big public fight about this,” he said. “Don’t go back home after a few hours: stay!” He added: “The message to world leaders from Boris Johnson today should be very clear, which is no more fudges, no more loopholes, no more get-out-of-jail cards”. Miliband said the UK should be pushing for an unambiguous commitment to 1.5C warming, and to revisiting emissions targets next year, to be clearly included in the final text. “We are in the territory of doing everything in our power in the time that we’ve got left to salvage what we can from this, because it’s not an overstatement to say that future generations depend on this,” he said, briefing journalists in Glasgow. “The world cannot wait until 2025 to return to these decisions. Because if we did, 1.5 would effectively be dead in the water,” he added. Miliband said the summit should have aimed to cut carbon emissions from a projected 53bn tonnes in 2030 to 25bn tonnes, to keep 1.5C of warming in sight – but just 4.8bn tonnes of that gap had been closed through the short-term pledges made. Sharma says he is pushing “very hard” to increase finance for adaption for countries on the frontline of the climate crisis. Sharma reiterates it is vital to keep 1.5C of heating in reach, reminding people of the words of the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, who told the summit last week that 2C of heating for her country would be a death sentence. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president, is now holding a press conference. It was only a couple of hours ago since he gave his last update, but we will keep across the latest event for anything new. An interesting response to activists opposing greenwashing and net zero targets here from whoever is in control of “external projections” at the Cop26 venue [worth looking at the entire thread....] Environment campaigners have attacked Scottish government proposals to dramatically increase hydrogen production in Scotland as a way of “sneaking fossil fuels in by the back door”. The government, which now includes two Scottish Green party ministers alongside the Scottish National party, has unveiled draft proposals to develop around 5GW of hydrogen power within a decade, in a programme initially priced at £100m. It would be used to heat homes, fuel buses and lorries, and power industries, and provide nearly a sixth of Scotland’s energy needs by 2030, promoting regional hydrogen production hubs. The government said it will promote alternative low and zero-carbon fuels, but Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was in reality a trojan horse for North Sea oil and gas. Michael Matheson, the Scottish climate minister, said earlier this month his government supported continued oil and gas extraction. It is putting heavy emphasis on using carbon capture and storage to trap CO2 emissions from gas-sourced hydrogen. The plan promotes “blue hydrogen”, where natural gas is used to create hydrogen, as well as renewables-powered “green” hydrogen. FoES said the policy failed to set out how much of that 5GW came from fossil fuels Alex Lee, a FoES climate campaigner, said: “This is a plan to sneak fossil fuels in the back door through the use of blue hydrogen. The Scottish Government is marketing blue hydrogen, made from gas, as ‘low-carbon hydrogen’ but studies have shown [it] actually releases more carbon emissions than just burning gas. “The plan also states that hydrogen could be used to heat homes and to power transport. However these uses are an inefficient, misdirected and expensive use of renewable electricity, which should be used to directly power electric vehicles and keep homes warm rather than converting electricity to hydrogen power.” After he arrived by train into Glasgow this afternoon, Boris Johnson paid a brief visit to look at two eco-friendly trains at the city’s central station – the country’s first hydrogen-powered train and the first electric battery train. He spoke to West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, about the trains, both of which were developed in the West Midlands. “The West Midlands was the home of the first industrial revolution and we will be the home of the green industrial revolution,” said Street. “It is critical to our future economic success that we take our historical strength and apply it in these new areas. Clean technology is already the fastest growing area of our economy, 94,000 people are already employed in it and it grew 7% last year.” On whether the conference will be a success, Street said it’s still too early to tell but was adamant the UK government had done enough. “It’s still in the balance, but I think Britain has made a really convincing show,” he said. “Whether it will be enough to get all participants on board we don’t know, but it’s hard to think what more, as the host country, we could have done.” I have been speaking with Dr Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund, about how the organisation plans to give away $10bn of the Amazon founder’s money by the end of the decade. So far, $947m has been given in grants. “We are willing to take significant risks when the potential gain is very large,” the former head of the World Resources Institute said. “It’s a wonderful privilege to be able to help do this. Before the end of November, we will be announcing a set of grantees in the Congo Basin and the tropical Andes. Those will generally be groups that will be internationally recognised. They themselves will have deep roots into those geographies.” Steer said: “Whilst we’ve been here in Glasgow, we’ve had several meetings with indigenous leaders and we will be channelling funds through organisations that specialise in working with indigenous peoples.” Back to the big drink issue of the day briefly as US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is in Glasgow for Cop26, says she has now managed to acquire some Irn-Bru. Last week, the Guardian interviewed delegates about their experiences with the famous Scottish pop, producing typically divisive responses – and earlier today AOC appealed to her Instagram followers to help her find some. We are yet to hear her verdict … The EU’s Franz Timmermans, vice-president of the European Commission, has told Cop26 his “sleeves are rolled up” as the summit enters the critical part of the negotiations, when compromises must be made to avoid failure. The EU was criticised earlier for not stepping up. “Consider my sleeves rolled,” said Timmermans. “We’re ready and willing to make sure we deliver on the highest possible levels of ambition, leading to prompt global action.” He said the “clear intention” in the draft “cover decision” to close the gap in emissions cuts needed to keep 1.5C alive within a year was extremely important. The cover decision was seen as weak on the finance needed by vulnerable nations. But Timmermans said: “In the past three days, nearly $800 million has been raised for adaptation finance, in support of the most vulnerable developing countries. More than three-quarters of that has come from Europe.” “I hear the calls for more. And I can just say: the EU is here. We will continue to listen, and we are willing to engage in discussions about future commitments.” A new poll has found that concern for the environment among the UK public has hit a record high, with more than 40% of the UK population putting it in their top three issues facing the country. Anxiety about the state of the planet comes behind the economy at 43%, and health at 48%, a YouGov poll found. The number of people worried by climate change has been climbing since 2018, YouGov said, and its pollsters found that concern accelerated following the first wave of Extinction Rebellion protests in 2019 (and presumably the school strike movement and the ever clearer evidence of climate breakdown in the form of wildfires, extreme heatwaves and floods.) Young people are most concerned, with 43% citing it as the top concern facing the country – but all ages are worried, with 39% of those aged 65 and above saying climate change is a major issue. UK PM Boris Johnson has arrived in Glasgow - by train this time - ahead of his speech at 4.30pm, and is wearing a small badge with the Cop26 Earth logo: A quick recap of the day so far: A draft of the Cop26 negotiation outcome was published overnight. Reaction has largely been negative, but there are some areas where progress has been made. We’ll have a detailed analysis of what it all means from our resident expert Fiona Harvey shortly. On transport day, protesters have been advocating for better public transport and a greater focus on sustainable transport modes such as cycling and walking, which have been largely overlooked by officials. The Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, urged delegates to “come armed with the currency of compromise … what we agree will set the future for our children and grandchildren and I know we will not want to fail them”. Thirsty congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is on the hunt for some Irn-Bru. Naturally, we’ll keep you up to date with any developments. I’m now handing over to my colleague Matthew Taylor. You can email him at matthew.taylor@theguardian.com or find him on Twitter at @mrmatthewtaylor The three joint winners of the Cop26 Photo Competition organised by Nature Picture Library have been announced. According to NPL, “they were selected by public vote because they best encapsulated the beauty of the natural world and our critical relationship with nature and the environment”. Here they are: You can browse all the entries here. The Guardian is running a live event at 8pm GMT focused on youth climate activists and school strikers. It will be hosted by Franny Armstrong, director of The Age of Stupid, and feature activists Fatima Ibrahim, Slater Jewell-Kemker, Alexandria Villaseñor, Nisreen Elsaim and Luisa Neubauer. For more details and tickets, see here. Sharma says it is clear some significant issues remain unresolved, and reiterates that he expects a comprehensive and ambitious outcome to be reached on Friday. He says his team will review documents and progress from 7pm this evening, and that the final documents will be published in all UN languages (unlike this morning’s draft text, which was only available in English). Sharma says he invites anyone who wishes to meet him in the next few days to contact him – his mobile phone will be buzzing already. He urges delegates: “Please come armed with the currency of compromise … what we agree will set the future for our children and grandchildren and I know we will not want to fail them.” Dan Jørgensen of Denmark is now speaking about the crucial goal of keeping a heating target of 1.5C in reach, arguably the main focus of Cop26. He says countries all recognised that damage will be much lower if heating is limited to 1.5C, but that there was a significant gap between what is needed and pledges so far. He says many parties called for updated pledges in 2022 and for speedy improvements to their commitments. “The sense of urgency was made very clear,” he says. Simon Stiell of Grenada, who has also been working on mitigation, says countries agree that the Paris agreement should not be renegotiated. He says this is reflected in the draft text released this morning, but that they would continue to refine the text over the coming days. The UK’s rail unions have called for a massive increase in spending on rail services and infrastructure, and deep cuts to fares, in a bid to shift people from their cars onto zero carbon trains. Gary Kelly, a Scottish organiser with the TSSA union, said the International Panel on Climate Change had warned this summer it was “code red” for humanity. “It’s not just the climate which is code red, it’s the railway itself,” Kelly told an event in Glasgow timed to coincide with Cop. “The time for talking is over, and we need action.” In a rare joint policy statement the four rail unions, the TSSA, the RMT, Unite and Aslef, have called for all Scottish rail services to be nationalised, peak rail fares to be scrapped and significant extra spending to update and upgrade the network, including much greater use of freight trains. Kelly said the UK government proposed cutting up to 10,000 rail jobs UK-wide and closing ticket offices. Last year’s Stonehaven derailment in north east Scotland, which killed three people and injured six in August 2020, was caused by climate-change-triggered storms that weakened the embankment. ScotRail and the Scottish government wanted to cut 300 services a day, said Mick Hogg, of the RMT. That would damage services and increase reliance on cars and roads. “As far as we’re concerned, Scotland’s railway is burning and no-one is listening,” Hogg said. Simonetta Sommaruga, the Swiss delegate handling the question of how quickly countries will have to update their pledges, says progress is being made on that front – another area where there is understood to be significant disagreement between countries – and that she thinks they are heading towards what she describes as a “landing zone” of agreement. If countries are not expected to bring back improved pledges before 2025, this will be seen as a significant failure of the conference, and many countries have been pushing for annual updates to pledges. Sharma introduces a Norwegian delegate to report back on article 6, which relates to the implementation of carbon markets. Espen Barth Eide says there have been 15 rounds of negotiations, and that good progress has been made. He says one of the main outstanding issues is that of money for adaptation for poorer countries, which has long been a sticking point. But he says the negotiations have been conducted in a positive spirit and that he is optimistic negotiations can be concluded by 6pm on Friday. Alok Sharma has finally begun speaking at the stocktaking plenary. He opens by thanking delegates for their cooperation so far and exhorts them to “continue to rise to the challenge”. He says he still intends to close Cop26 on time this Friday, which draws a small laugh from those in the room. The draft text of the final Cop26 “cover decision” is pretty strong on the necessity to cut emissions by 45% this decade to keep 1.5C alive, say expert NGO observers. But they say it is much too weak on other critical issues - the money needed by vulnerable and poorer nations to fund clean development, to protect their populations against the impacts of global heating hitting already (adaptation) and to compensate for the damages already being caused (loss and damages). They also said the EU and US had not yet stepped up in the negotiations to drive towards a strong outcome. The EU and US must form alliances with the vulnerable and poorer nations in order to face down the “blockers”, the experts said. “The text currently put forward by the UK presidency is extremely problematic, as it does not actually address the crucial need to scale up adaptation finance and mitigation finance,”said Eddy Pérez, at Climate Action Network Canada. “It is not enough to just acknowledge that there is a need for loss and damage finance, there needs to be greater clarity that, if we are to keep 1.5C within reach, the resources need to be there so that developing countries and emerging economies have access to the trillions of dollars that are needed to really close the gap,” he said. Alden Meyer, at the thinktank e3g said: “Is 1.5C alive?Just barely. We’ve particularly not seen the EU and US step up to push for the financial support they need to deliver for vulnerable countries to bring balance to the [Cop26] package.” I’ve been in this process for a long time, and I’ve seen the bargaining game go on,” he said. “But if the EU and the US hold their bargaining chips to the very end game, on Thursday morning or Friday night, their money is going to be worthless.” “To get what they say they want in Glasgow on [emissions cuts] and transparency from countries like China and others, they need to build a much stronger high ambition coalition by giving the vulnerable countries what they need and deserve on adaptation and finance and loss and damage. And for both the US and the EU, that means crossing some of their red lines.” Meyer also said it was “absurd” that a commitment to end fossil fuels subsidies were only entering Cop texts 13 years after the G20 first pledged to end them: “We are still paying hundreds of billions of dollars a year in taxpayer money to encourage production and consumption of fossil fuels. The first rule of finding yourself in a hole is stop digging.” Jennifer Morgan, at Greenpeace International, said: “I think you’ll see the most vulnerable countries of the world coming out and just fighting for their very lives, which is what is at stake here.” At a protest held in Glasgow’s George Square this morning, local residents and climate activists called for greater investment in public transport, rather than just shifting people to electric vehicles. Nancy Henderson, an artist who lives in Glasgow, said that cycling flourished during lockdown but that many people have switched back to cars as they don’t feel safe in traffic. “That’s an issue with electric cars, people will still feel unsafe with them around,” she said. “It doesn’t actually change the issue of congestion and the number of cars on our streets. Going electric doesn’t change the blight of cars in our cities, we are still isolated in our little booth, not communicating, not meeting other people.” Henderson said many Glaswegians were resentful of the smartcard public transport passes given to Cop26 delegates which enables unlimited use of trains and buses during the conference. “No-one else around here has ever got one of those smartcards,” she said. “It marginalises people when you don’t have good public transport.” UK prime minister Boris Johnson called Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia, this morning on his way to Cop26 at Glasgow. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia has often sought to weaken the climate decisions taken at Cops, which are agreed by consensus among the 196 nations. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “[Johnson] welcomed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to reach net zero by 2060 and their efforts to transition away from fossil fuels. They discussed the importance of making progress in negotiations in the final days of Cop26” “The prime minister said all countries needed to come to the table with increased ambition if we are to keep the target of limiting global warming to 1.5C alive.” We will see if Johnson’s intervention softens the Saudi’s stance. Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president from the UK, will be holding an “informal stocktaking plenary” at 12.30pm. Early this morning the presidency released an early draft of the “overarching decision”, the main document that will come out of the conference. Reaction has largely been negative, but some have pointed out areas in which progress appears to have been made, not least an ambition to bring countries back with improved pledges next year. For some countries, especially those who believe not enough action is being taken, the stocktaking meeting may provide an opportunity to have their say and lay out what they believe is missing. For anyone who wants to watch live, a stream can be found on this page. My colleague Damian Carrington will be following along and we’ll bring you updates on this liveblog. Myles Allen, the Oxford geoscience professor, does not mince his words on the wording of the draft text: “Hmmm … are they now telling us that by ‘keep 1.5 alive’ they always meant ‘buy a big defibrillator to resuscitate 1.5C by 2100’? “It’s a bit worrying that they seem to suggesting the parties agree things that aren’t true, such as: ‘limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century’. “First, does this mean we have all now agreed that pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5C in the Paris agreement always meant getting temperatures back to 1.5C by 2100? I always thought it meant limiting peak warming (which is the main driver of peak impacts) to as close to 1.5C as possible. “And if it is now agreed that the 1.5C goal does not refer to peak warming at all (I confess I missed that memo), then the statement simply isn’t true. What 45% by 2030 and net zero around mid-century delivers is to halt warming to close to 1.5C (probably within the range of recent revisions to pre-industrial temperatures) not long after mid-century, nothing more – temperature trends after mid-century will depend on the balance of emissions and removals after mid-century, which are not in the control of today’s decision-makers anyway.” Oceanographer Sylvia Earle, the “queen of the deep”, has been in Glasgow calling for an end to industrial fishing on the high seas. “It’s the No 1 priority, because we have the chance, in a stroke, to safeguard the blue heart of the planet,” she said. “It’s where most of the oxygen that comes from the ocean is generated. It’s where most of the carbon is taken up. “All of that wildlife taken out of the ocean not only affects biodiversity and fosters extinctions at an accelerated rate. It breaks the carbon cycle – the nutrient chain that maintains the fabric of life on Earth.” Dan Collyns has the story here: The Alliance of Small Island States, a group of countries who are especially vulnerable to the effects of climate breakdown, have expressed their disappointment with what they see as a disappointing draft text. Aubrey Webson, an ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda, said: “The text provides a basis for moving forward but it needs to be strengthened in key areas in order to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable, particularly on finance. “We won’t get the ambition on emissions we need for 1.5C if we don’t scale up the provision of finance, and this includes the long overdue recognition of a separate and additional component for loss and damage. “‘Urging’, ‘calling’, ‘encouraging’ and ‘inviting’ is not the decisive language that this moment calls for. We have limited time left in the Cop to get this right and send a clear message to our children, and the most vulnerable communities, that we hear you and we are taking this crisis seriously.” Sustainable transport campaigners gathered outside Glasgow city chambers on Wednesday morning to protest at a lack of integrated and affordable bus and rail services in the city – contrasting that with unique multimodal travel cards handed out to Cop delegates. Ellie Harrison, a campaigner with Get Glasgow Moving, said the city region’s residents faced very high fares, a deregulated bus service and poorly integrated bus, tube and rail networks, despite the region’s historically high and disproportionate levels of poverty. She said a standard single bus fare in Glasgow, where a large majority of services were run by First Group, cost £2.50. In London, where fares are regulated, a single is £1.55 and travellers have the multimodal Oyster card; in Edinburgh, where bus services are publicly owned, a single bus fare is £1.80. “It’s Cop transport day and we wanted to draw attention to the services that have been laid on for Cop delegates, who have all been given multimodal travel passes to get around the city easily. “Compare those to the services that Glaswegians are used to, which is zero integration between the bus network, subway and our trains, as well as extortionate fares.” US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is in Glasgow for Cop26 and in between her packed schedule, she appealed to her Instagram followers to help her find the famous Scottish delicacy Irn-Bru. In response to a question about whether she had tried the fizzy drink, AOC said she was trying to get her hands on some and asked where she could find it. (If you’re reading this, AOC: nearly every shop and vending machine at the SEC venue.) In a separate post, Ocasio-Cortez said she wanted to try Irn-Bru, touch Harris tweed and see a castle before she leaves. Last week, we interviewed delegates about their experiences with the drink, producing typically divisive responses, especially among the Rwandan delegation: “Is it lemonade? Is it cola? Is it alcohol? It’s not even written what it is. I don’t understand it.” Here’s some footage of a protest this morning by cycling advocates who are angry that the Cop26 day dedicated to transport focuses almost exclusively on fossil fuel-powered means such as motor vehicles and aviation, with almost no attention paid to sustainable methods of transport such as cycling and walking, which already exist. Separately, the European Cyclists’ Federation, Greenpeace and more than 300 civil society groups have signed an open letter to governments and transport ministers: Our world is on fire. We must urgently leverage the solutions that cycling offers by radically scaling up its use. What we need now is for governments to politically and financially commit to more, safer and integrated cycling that is equitable for everyone living in our countries, cities and regions. Read the full letter here. Guardian columnist George Monbiot has written this morning about the need to make extreme wealth extinct: Big money now buys everything: even access to the meetings that should address these dysfunctions. On some accounts, Cop26 is the most exclusive of all climate summits. Delegates from poor nations have been thwarted by a cruel combination of byzantine visa requirements, broken promises to make Covid vaccines available, and the mad costs of accommodation, thanks to government failures to cap local prices, or make rooms available. Even when delegates from poorer nations can scale these walls, they often find themselves excluded from the negotiating areas, and therefore unable to influence the talks. Read the full piece here: The UK, host of the Cop26 conference, is not joining the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which was founded by Denmark and Costa Rica as a club of countries committed to phasing out oil and gas production. The announcement of new members was expected on Wednesday but appears to have been pushed back until Thursday, perhaps to try to corral more countries. The absence of the UK from the initiative could be embarrassing, and the country has been criticised at home for failing to rule out a large new oilfield called Cambo off the Shetland islands, as well as a new coalmine in Cumbria. A UK government spokesperson said: “No other significant oil and gas producing nation has gone as far as the UK in supporting the sector’s gradual transition to a low carbon future, as demonstrated by our North Sea Transition Deal. “While the UK’s reliance on fossil fuels continues to fall, there will continue to be ongoing but diminishing need for oil and gas over the coming years while we ramp up renewable energy capacity, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee. “The UK will continue to work with international partners on supporting the transition away from fossil fuels towards clean energy so we can create jobs, build new industries and drive economic growth.” 24 countries and a handful of car manufacturers have today joined a pledge to end the era of fossil-fuel powered vehicles by 2040 “or earlier”. However, the group largely consists of countries who had already made that pledge such as the UK and Ireland, and does not contain major car manufacturing countries such as the US or Germany. Meanwhile, the car manufacturers’ pledges contain caveats such as that their phaseout promises only apply in “leading markets”. My colleague Oliver Milman has the full story here: The European NGO group Transport &amp; Environment said the pledge needs to be supported by binding targets. Julia Poliscanova, T&amp;E’s senior director for vehicles and e-mobility, said: “The car industry’s electrification plans place it ahead of regulators on climate action. But these won’t materialise without actual targets to end car emissions by 2035 at the latest. The US and Europe, especially Germany and France, need to lead.” More reaction to the draft Cop26 “cover decision” text, this time from scientists: Neil Harris, professor of atmospheric informatics at Cranfield University, said: “The current text shows that the world’s governments are yet again incapable of addressing this issue. Politics is getting in the way. They seem to be happy if they can get a reduction in warming from 2.7 to 2.4C agreed at this Cop and to leave further decisions for the future. “The only hope is that the slack [from governments] is taken up by local and regional governments (especially cities), the private sector and by individuals. The anger of the youth, the indigenous peoples and the global south is entirely justified.” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Institute on Climate Change, is more optimistic than some about the wording of the draft text, but points out that the target of “keeping 1.5C alive” is not currently in reach: “This draft includes all the key elements of a successful outcome, but there needs to be more ambition and more precision,” he said. “It is clear that the current set of pledges on emissions are not yet consistent with having a reasonable chance of holding warming to no more than 1.5C. “We need countries to agree to return every one or two years with more ambitious pledges. We also need stronger evidence of action to deliver the pledges. Rich countries must come forward with credible plans for delivering the overdue financial support for developing countries and offer significantly increased support from 2025 onwards.” Often during Cop26 the UK government have put out a press release late in the afternoon detailing their big announcement for the next day, usually embargoed until 10.30pm or midnight. Some have been quite good (deforestation) and some not so good (see my colleague Fiona Harvey’s analysis of last week’s coal press release here). It’s safe to say this announcement last night teeing up Cop26’s transport day is one of the less memorable, amounting to a restatement of a pledge made in July and a new design for electric vehicle charging points. For those of you wondering, this is what the charging point looks like, as modelled by Grant Shapps. The press release goes on to say the charger “could become as iconic as the Great British post box, London bus or black cab.” We’ll have to let posterity be the judge of that. Campaign group Global Witness have responded negatively to this morning’s draft text release. Although the text mentions phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, coal is the only fossil fuel it explicitly mentions phasing out. Campaigner Murray Worthy says: “It’s plain to see the impact of the hundreds of fossil fuel lobbyists at the Cop in this draft decision. The science is clear – we must start phasing out all fossil fuels, starting now, if we’re to have a hope of limiting warming to 1.5C. “Yet this agreement falls spectacularly short – only calling for an accelerated phaseout of coal, and an end to taxpayers bankrolling the fossil fuel industry through subsidies. Emissions from coal are less than half the problem – if the final declaration is to have any credibility it must call for a phaseout of all fossil fuels. “This simply does not match the ambition people all over the world have looked to Cop26 for. Nor does it match what is needed to avert the climate crisis the world is currently experiencing.” This morning youth activists including Greta Thunberg filed a petition to the UN secretary general, António Guterres, demanding that the UN declare a “global level 3 emergency”, the highest level available. If one were declared, it would allow more resources and technical expertise to be directed to countries which have been hit hardest by climate breakdown. Miranda Bryant has the full story here: Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, has written in the Guardian this morning about the “hollow promise” of a net zero target. It will not surprise followers of his work that he blames capitalism for the state we find ourselves in. [Capitalism] has always gained pace through the incessant commodification of everything, beginning with land, labour and technology before spreading to genetically modified organisms, and even a woman’s womb or an asteroid. As capitalism’s realm spread, price-less goods turned into pricey commodities. The owners of the machinery and the land necessary for the commodification of goods profited, while everyone else progressed from the wretchedness of the 19th century working class to the soothing fantasies of mindless petit-bourgeois consumerism. You can read the full piece here, and as a bonus you’ll get to see one of the more striking byline photos we’ve published: My colleagues Adam Morton and Fiona Harvey have published a first take on the draft text published this morning. It includes reaction from Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, one of the groups behind yesterday’s projection of 2.4C of global heating under current plans. He says the draft does not recognise the urgency needed to close the 2030 emissions gap: The UN secretary general should be invited to convene world leaders at the end of 2022 specifically to address closing the 2030 mitigation and finance gap,” he said. “If this is pushed off until 2023 then the process will really only be addressed in commitment for 2035 – nearly 15 years away – leaving the massive gaps in 2030 unaddressed.” You can read the full news story here: Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, has weighed in on this morning’s draft Cop26 text: “The last 24 hours have been a devastating reality check on what has actually been delivered at this summit,” he said. “We are miles from where we need to be to halve global emissions this decade. Today, Boris Johnson needs to stop the spin and confront the reality. Given this summit will not deliver anything like what we needed, now he has to turn to plotting a path out of Glasgow that can keep 1.5C alive.” Dozens of protesters stood with their bicycles at the entrance of the Cop26 conference in the early morning, ringing their bells under the slogan “this machine fights climate change”. Electric cars will be the main point on the agenda for transport day at the climate conference and bikes are not expected to be discussed at all. Eleanor, who has cycled every day since she was a child, said cycling should be made safer in Glasgow for more people to enjoy the physical and mental health benefits. “Cycling is activism,” she said. “The infrastructure isn’t fully set up yet, so if cycling is your main mode of transport, you need to be prepared to make the effort.” Bob, from Glasgow agreed with the sentiment: “Cycling’s been airbrushed out of our future,” he warned, saying electric cars should not be the main vehicle on the agenda. “Children shouldn’t be told they’ll get a car when they grow up, but they’ll get to own a bicycle.” Get Glasgow Moving are also be holding a demo on public transport from 9am this morning. For the masochists among you, all the key UN texts can be found on this page, and the key draft Cop decision is here. As for the rest of the day, the focus will be on transport. Here are the key events: 9.15am: Launch of initiative to establish “green shipping corridors”. 10.45am: Event on accelerating uptake of electric vehicles. 3pm: Launch of coalition aiming to encourage and promote sustainable aviation. 4.30pm: Event looking at future of road freight. Also at 4.30pm, we’re expecting the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, to give a speech. If any of these take your fancy, streaming links for all these events and more can be found here. So what happens next? Negotiators from countries around the world will now take this draft text back to their bosses and identify areas they want to change. We can still expect significant changes to be made to the text before it’s finally published this weekend. There will be a flurry of negotiations with countries using their bargaining chips to strengthen or weaken the wording of passages that most affect their own interests. The UK presidency has said it expects the summit to finish on time at 6pm on Friday, but you’d be unwise to bet on that actually happening - negotiations at Cop summits almost invariably run late into Friday and often into Saturday or even Sunday. One crucial inclusion in the draft text relates to the acceleration of the ratchet mechanism. Here’s the relevant passage: 30. Recalls Article 4, paragraphs 3 and 11, of the Paris Agreement, and urges Parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022; Much of the hopes for Cop26 are being pinned on an agreement to speed up the ratchet mechanism by which countries would return with improved pledges, known as NDCs, annually instead of every five years. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said on Monday that this would be an essential outcome of the talks and behind-the-scenes negotiations on the subject have been taking place through the conference. The inclusion of a request for strengthened targets by the end of 2022 is not a commitment to annual updates, but will still please the poor and developing countries who had been pushing hardest for the acceleration. It does not, however, specify the 1.5C target, just the ParisaAgreement, so countries could argue that they are aiming for the lower 2C target included in that document. The big news overnight was the release of the latest draft text. It was only released about an hour ago so analysts are still getting their heads around it, but early observations include that it explicitly mentions the phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies (seen as a step forward), emphasises the Paris agreement target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels (rather than focusing on the lower 2C target) and criticises developed countries for their failure to meet the $100bn annual target of climate finance for developing countries promised in Paris in 2015. Greenpeace International’s executive director, Jennifer Morgan, was one of the first to react: “This draft deal is not a plan to solve the climate crisis, it’s an agreement that we’ll all cross our fingers and hope for the best. It’s a polite request that countries maybe, possibly, do more next year. Well, that’s not good enough and the negotiators shouldn’t even think about leaving this city until they’ve agreed a deal that meets the moment. Because most assuredly, this one does not. “We’ve just had a landmark study showing we’re heading for 2.4C of warming. The job of this conference was always to get that number down to 1.5C, but with this text world leaders are punting it to next year. If this is the best they can come up with then it’s no wonder kids today are furious at them. “The text needs to be much stronger on finance and adaptation and needs to include real numbers in the hundreds of billions, with a delivery plan for richer countries to support less developed nations. And we need to see a deal that commits countries to coming back every year with new and better plans until together they get us over the bar and we can stay below 1.5C of warming. “And while the text calls for an accelerated phaseout of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, wreckers like the Saudi and Australian governments will be working to gut that part before this conference closes. Ministers now have three days to turn this around and get the job done here in Glasgow instead of once again kicking the climate can down the road.” Welcome to the Guardian’s coverage of day 10 of the Cop26 climate summit, which is supposed to be dedicated to transport. The UK government’s self-identified four big themes for the conference were “coal, cars, cash and trees”. The other three have been the subject of much debate and a few pledges, but nothing of note has been agreed on cars yet. Of course, cars are only one form of transport, though one of the most polluting. Walking and cycling advocates have complained that the official schedule for transport day seems to focus solely on motorised transport - cars, ships and planes - rather than more sustainable forms of travel which could in themselves provide part of the solution to the climate crisis. We’ll be following the action throughout the day. You can get in touch with me at alan.evans@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @itsalanevans."

          "bodyText": "Inflation has surged in the US, China and Germany. In the US, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.2% in October amid global supply shortages, the highest since 1990, while the core rate excluding food and energy picked up to 4.6%, the highest since 1991. There was a fresh jump in gasoline prices which had levelled off in recent weeks, while prices for hotel rooms and car rentals bounced back amid a recovery in travel, and new and used car prices also rose. Inflation in China rose to a tamer 1.5% annual rate last month, but this was a doubling from 0.7%, while German inflation came in at 4.5% in October versus 4.1% in September. Wall Street is down while the major European indices have also edged lower, with the notable exceptions of the UK’s FTSE 100 index, up 0.6%, and Italy’s FTSE MiB, up 0.4%. Here are today’s other main stories: Efforts to combat a looming debt crisis in the world’s poorest countries are being hindered by a lack of up-to-date, reliable figures showing how much individual nations owe, the World Bank has said. Demand for jeans, jogging bottoms and workwear have helped Marks &amp; Spencer to a long-awaited turnaround of its clothing business, prompting the group to forecast profits of £500m for the full year, its second profit upgrade in three months (and this century). Its share price jumped by more than 15%. Out of the frump slump: how M&amp;S lifted itself back into profit Twenty-four countries and a group of leading car manufacturers have committed to ending the era of fossil-fuel powered vehicles by 2040 “or earlier”, in a major new commitment set at Cop26. The Jeff Bezos-backed electric carmaker Rivian is aiming for a market value of $65bn (£48bn) when shares start trading in New York on Wednesday, in one of the biggest-ever stock market floats. Shares in ITV soared 14% on Wednesday after the broadcaster said it was on track to enjoy the best year for advertising revenues in its 66-year history, as businesses pour money into marketing to drive a post-pandemic recovery. Wetherspoon’s has suffered a slump in sales below pre-pandemic levels, which the pub chain’s chairman, Tim Martin, blamed on older customers staying away because of lingering caution about the danger of Covid-19 infection. Thank you for reading and commenting. We’ll be back tomorrow. Bye! - JK Here is our full story on US inflation: Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: The 0.9% month-on-month surge in consumer prices in October illustrates that the upward pressure from supply shortages remains intense and that, even when those effects eventually fade, rising cyclical pressures are likely to keep inflation unusually high. The biggest concern for the Fed should be signs that longer-lasting cyclical inflation pressures are continuing to build rapidly, with CPI rent of primary residence and owners’ equivalent rent both posting strong gains of 0.4% m/m. As the improving labour market and prior gains in house prices continue to feed through, a further acceleration in shelter inflation looks nailed on. Headline prices were also boosted by a huge 0.8% m/m rise in food away from home prices and, with leisure sector wage growth continuing to surge, that also has further to run. The bottom line is that, while it remains difficult to predict how far or for how long the various “transitory” factors will boost inflation, there is mounting evidence that inflationary pressures are building throughout the economy. That underlines our view that inflation will remain elevated for much longer than Fed officials expect. Meanwhile, Tesla has fallen out of the $1trn club again after sharp share price declines today and yesterday. The US electric carmaker broke through a trillion dollars in market capitalisation late in October, becoming the fifth US company to join a club that includes Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. Tesla shares are falling as investors gear up for the chief executive Elon Musk’s proposed sale of about a tenth of his holdings after he held a Twitter poll on it. Musk, the world’s richest person, tweeted on Saturday that he would offload 10% of his stock if users of the social media network approved the proposal. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street: Dow Jones down 58 points, or 0.16%, at 36,261 S&amp;P 500 down 19 points, or 0.4%, at 4,665 Nasdaq down 132 points, or 0.83%, at 15,754 Karen Ward, chief market strategist EMEA at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said: The rise in US inflation was again greater than expected and the upside surprise on core inflation is particularly noteworthy. We don’t however think this will prompt a hawkish shift from the Fed. Like other developed world central banks – the Fed have settled on the narrative that headline inflation is being boosted by short-term factors; that elevated energy and raw material prices, production and transport issues in emerging markets, and domestic labour shortages will all resolve themselves in the fullness of time. I am not convinced these shortages – particularly in the labour market - will resolve themselves quickly and government bond curves should be steepening on the basis that eventually the Fed will have to do more. It shouldn’t however deter appetite for stocks at this stage. Today’s print essentially tells us firms have pricing power which is good for corporate earnings. US stock futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street in 20 minutes’ time, suggesting declines of 0.34% (S&amp;P 500) to 0.66% (Nasdaq). The dollar has gained 0.4% against a basket of currencies, and 10-year US government bond yields rose. The price of spot gold rose 1.1% to $1,853 an ounce. Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation. Last month the Fed started scaling back the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases. Neil Wilson at Markets.com said: Well this is a mess, an inflation report so bad even the Fed might actually do something about it? Hohoho, I joke of course… Inflation way ahead of forecast and exceeding 6% on the headline number, highest in 30 years, core month-on-month accelerated to +0.6%. Yet Fed still sticks to its ‘transitory’ narrative. Gold has blown past resistance and the path to $1,875 is clear. Stocks offered and the dollar is bid. Bonds sold off with US 10year yields jumping above 1.480%. 30 year real yields (TIPS) [Treasury Inflation-Protected Security] touched a record low -0.595%, whilst 10yr TIPS fell to I think a record low of -1.224%.m Stocks are paring losses and the dollar is paring gains – so far only really gold holding onto the spike with real rates the biggest loser from all of this. Well, after the Fed’s credibility. As economies around the world recover from the pandemic, demand for oil and other commodities has increased. Brent crude prices have gained more than 60% this year as a result, while gasoline prices in the US are at seven-year highs. Many countries, including the US and the UK, are also struggling with shortages of skilled workers. The US Labor Department reported today that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 4,000 to 267,000 for the week to 6 November. That’s the lowest level since mid-March 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic first struck and the economy ground to a halt. Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina, told Reuters: Supply disruptions and the recovery of services poses a substantial concern that higher-than-expected inflation could persist for longer than the Fed believes. We expect goods inflation to hand the baton to services over the course of the next year, but all signs indicate that supply chain bottlenecks will keep fanning the flames off inflation in the near term. US inflation is now at the highest annual rate since November 1990, amid a global supply chain crisis, suggesting price pressures could remain uncomfortably high well into next year. It rose to 6.2% last month from 5.4% in September. The Federal Reserve has reiterated that high inflation should prove temporary but many economists at sceptical. Even excluding food and energy which tend to be volatile, the consumer prices index jumped 4.6% year-on-year, the biggest increase since August 1991, after being steady at 4% for two straight months. That’s the so-called core CPI. Senior currency market analyst Simon Harvey at Monex tweets: NEWSFLASH: US inflation has jumped to an annual rate of 6.2% in October, higher than the 5.8% forecast by economists. Excluding food and energy which tend to be volatile, inflation was 4.6%. In a few minutes, we’ll be getting the latest US inflation reading for October. We are expecting an annual rate of close to 6%, 5.8% or 5.9%, which would be a 30-year high. In China, the debt-laden property developer Evergrande Group is (once again) teetering on the brink of default. Some bondholders have not received their coupon payments of more than $148m due at the close of Asian business today, sources told Reuters. The company holds the dubious title of being the world’s most indebted developer and has been stumbling from deadline to deadline in recent weeks. It has more than $300bn in debts, $19bn of which are international market bonds. Evergrande has narrowly avoided default so far, but a 30-day grace period on coupon payments on its April 2022, 2023 and 2024 bonds ends today, though it is uncertain when exactly. A failure to pay would result in a formal default by the company, and trigger cross-default provisions for other Evergrande dollar bonds, worsening a debt crisis in China. The US Federal Reserve warned yesterday that China’s struggling property sector could pose global risks. Moody’s Investors Service, the credit rating agency, downgraded Kaisa Group today, citing liquidity risks, limited financial flexibility and poor recovery prospects for its creditors. Kaisa has the most offshore debt of any Chinese developer after Evergrande. It has coupon payments of more than $59m due on Thursday and Friday. Paolo Pizzoli, senior economist for Italy and Greece at ING, said: There’s good demand, but Italian producers seem to be meeting increasing supply-driven obstacles. This will likely limit the scope for a substantial industrial contribution to the country’s GDP growth in the coming quarter. Looking ahead, evidence from recent business confidence surveys points to a continuation of the current production pattern. The combination of strong domestic and foreign orders and declining inventories is, in principle, a good best omen for higher production, but businesses are also signalling that materials and capacity are increasingly hampering production. Even assuming that some businesses managed to hoard intermediate goods and commodities, longer delivery times suggest that that might not have been enough to meet growing demand. Furthermore, even though demand is not yet perceived as an obstacle, the vulnerability to supply disruptions of Italy’s main trading partners might eventually negatively hit Italian producers. Germany, Italy’s premier export destination, is a case in point, with Italian car subcomponent producers clearly exposed to the risk of production stops from chip scarcity in the car industry. The bottom line is that, notwithstanding the notable resilience in manufacturer confidence, we believe that temporary factors will limit the scope for a solid contribution of industry to GDP growth over 4Q21. Add to this some cooling down in services on the back of Covid-19 concerns, we will likely end up with a clear deceleration of GDP growth over the coming quarter. We are currently pencilling in a 0.5% QoQ GDP expansion in 4Q21, which would still leave the average Italian 2021 GDP growth at a comforting 6.2%. In Italy, industrial production edged 0.1% higher in September from August, the country’s statistics office Istat said this morning. In August, output slipped 0.1%. In the three months to September, output was 1% higher than in the prior three months. It is M&amp;S’s second profit upgrade in three months, and only the second this century. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: Something spectacular must have happened since August for Marks &amp; Spencer to upgrade earnings guidance once again. Back then, it believed pre-tax profit for the year would be above the upper end of a previously guided £300m to £350m range. Now it’s talking about profit hitting £500m which is quite some jump. Food sales are doing incredibly well, particularly instore. It has really nailed the proposition with decent quality products and an ever-widening range of items. Quality is the key word as it caters for a specific type of customer who is happy to pay that bit extra for something nice. Its online joint venture with Ocado has also helped the business reached a broader audience, such as individuals who want higher quality products but don’t want the faff of visiting a store. However, clothing continues to be a mixed bag, he said, although the company comes across as more confident about its prospects. Overall sales aren’t growing but operating profit is, thanks to selling more items at full price. Marks &amp; Spencer has a reputation for being the place you buy you undies and socks, or perhaps push the boat out and buy a pastel-coloured sweater. Yet that isn’t enough to sustain a proper clothing business. Suits and formalwear have been pushed to one side and more floorspace given to athleisure, jeggings and jeans. The only problem is that so many of its customers are old and don’t want to wear splashproof running bottoms. The company needs to attract a younger crowd and it could take a long time to change its image as the brand is still associated with slippers and socks. “Just imagine if Marks &amp; Spencer and Next merged. The former has nailed the food proposition and the latter is an expert in clothing. Together they could be a real force in the retail sector. But such a tie-up seems unlikely as Next doesn’t need any help and it is full of bright ideas to keep growing profits, food certainly not being on the menu.” Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, the trading and investments platform, said about the M&amp;S results: This is a great return to something like normality, the market rewarding the news with a 15% bounce in the shares, with a prudent note of caution where the dividend is concerned. The shares have come roaring back from the brutal decline of June/July, but with January 2020 levels now recovered the question will be where the next big of good news can come from. If it can dodge most of the supply chain concerns there is room for more upside, but the stock needs a fairly rosy assessment of Christmas sales to keep moving higher, and that might just put off disappointment until January and the post-festive trading statement. And here is our story on ITV: Here is our full story: Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer have jumped more than 15% to 223.5p! After the retailer returned to profit in the first half and upped its profit forecast for the full year. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, tweeted: Oil stocks, along with strong earnings from companies including the German chipmaker Infineon, are driving European shares higher. In London, BP is the third-biggest riser, up 2%, while ITV is the No 1 gainer, after the broadcaster said it was enjoying its best year for ad revenues in its 66-year history. Crude oil prices have been boosted by industry data showing US crude stocks fell unexpectedly last week. On the stock markets, shares are pushing higher, shrugging off higher German and Chinese inflation. Only the Dax in Frankfurt is slightly down at 16,033. The FTSE 100 index in London has gained 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7,296 while the CAC 40 in Paris is flat at 7,046 and the FTSE MiB in Milan is 0.46% ahead at 27,566. In other news this morning, Britain’s employers are offering bonuses of up to £2,000 to recruit Christmas workers amid fears over staff shortages disrupting the festive season, reports our economics correspondent Richard Partington. Research from the jobs website Adzuna showed there are currently 26,307 seasonal job vacancies ahead of the pivotal Christmas shopping period, almost double the 13,668 at the same point a year ago. My other colleague Jasper Jolly has visited the West Midlands, which is also carving out a new role in electric vehicle production. He writes: Corners of the Alucast factory in the Black Country would be familiar to metalworkers several centuries ago. Workers pour molten aluminium at 720C into steel moulds. The cooling metal is then quickly pressed into shape before being sanded down into parts for gas-guzzling British sports cars. Yet for all its traditional West Midlands manufacturing roots, Alucast is finding a role for itself in a fast-growing new industry: electric cars. It needs to make the switch fast. The UK will ban the sale of all petrol and diesel cars by 2035, and other big car markets are following suit. The accelerated end of the internal combustion engine surprised and delighted environmental activists and has proven politically popular. Yet it has thrown into sharp relief the peril facing workers in the fossil fuel economy, who risk being left behind in the energy transition. My colleague Joanna Partridge has visited the German carmaker Volkswagen’s Zwickau factory in east Germany to find out how it is recovering from dieselgate, with its €35bn bid to lead the charge in electric vehicle production. It is a wider tale of how Germany is trying to wean itself off fossil fuels. She writes: Volkswagen hopes investment in its Zwickau plant – where Trabants were once built – will put dieselgate to rest. Two bronze statues that guard the entrance to Zwickau train station in Saxony tell the tale of Germany’s struggle to wean itself off fossil fuels. A crouching miner cradles a lamp in a nod to the lignite, a particularly dirty form of coal, that was dug from this part of former East Germany, fuelling its factories and power stations. His companion, an engineer, represents the car industry that dominates Germany’s industrial heartland. But while mining for coal is on the way out, the country’s influential car industry, which employs more than 830,000 people, is heading in a new direction. Volkswagen’s enormous plant on the outskirts of the medieval town is the first in the German carmaker’s empire to fully embrace the future. ITV is set to enjoy the best year for advertising revenues in its 66-year history, as businesses pour money into marketing to drive a post-pandemic recovery and content such as the Euro 2020 tournament prove a hit with viewers, reports our media business correspondent Mark Sweney. ITV, which said that it is performing more strongly than in 2019 before the pandemic hit, said that total advertising revenue for the first nine months is up 30% year-on-year to £1.3bn. The UK’s biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster said that for the year it expects total ad revenues, which includes the growing income from ads on streaming service ITV Hub, to be up a quarter over 2020 to hit an all-time high. The broadcaster said that in final three months of the year - which is forecast to see a record spend in the run up to Christmas and is when ITV usually makes about 30% of its annual ad income - will be up as much as 13% year-on-year. “2021 looks set to have the highest revenue in ITV’s history,” said Carolyn McCall, chief executive at ITV. “By any standards ITV has had an outstanding nine months.” Total revenues including ITV Studios, which makes and sells shows such as Coronation Street, Line of Duty and Come Dine With Me, rose 28% year-on-year to £2.38bn in the first nine months. This is 8% higher than in 2019. “Revenue from each business is up both on last year and 2019,” said McCall, who said that content spend will hit £1.16bn next year due to programming including the FIFA World Cup and investment in dramas. The broadcaster said the share of total TV viewing taken by its flagship ITV channel increased in the first nine months. However, total viewing including across its digital channel portfolio fell 5% year-on-year. Marks &amp; Spencer is back in the black, but warned that the impact of the pandemic, supply chain issues and Brexit would weigh on its performance into 2022. The retailer, usually seen as a bellwether of the high street, made a first-half profit before tax of £187.3m versus a loss of nearly £88m a year earlier. Food prices jumped 10% and it hailed a “substantial” improvement in its struggling clothing and homewares business. Clothing and homewares sales were down just 1.0% compared with 2019/20, despite lockdown extending into the first week of the period. Sales grew in the second quarter and overall full price sales were up 17.3% for the period. Operating profit before adjusting items was £156.2m, up from £109.6m in 2019/20. Steve Rowe, the chief executive, said: Given the history of M&amp;S we’ve been clear that we won’t overclaim our progress. Unpacking the numbers isn’t a linear exercise and we’ve called out the Covid bounce back tailwinds, as well as the headwinds from the pandemic, supply chain and Brexit, some of which will continue into next year. But, thanks to the hard work of our colleagues, it is clear that underlying performance is improving, with our main businesses making important gains in market share and customer perception. The hard yards of driving long term change are beginning to be borne out in our performance. M&amp;S said it had ‘re-engineered” its clothing &amp; homeware division to try and reverse years of decline in the business. This includes training staff in efficient buying and merchandising, creating a more focused core range while also broadening choice in growth area such as activewear, kids’ daywear and homewares. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We’ve woken up to news that inflation has picked up in China and Germany, while oil prices are also climbing, adding to worries that mounting price pressures could prompt central banks to raise interest rates. Inflation in Germany picked up to 4.5% in October from 4.1% in September, but is slightly below August’s 4.6% rate, according to the country’s statistics office Destatis. A surge in energy prices was behind the rise, up 18.6% year on year and up for the fourth month in a row. Prices of heating oil doubled and motor fuels jumped 35% while prices of natural gas and electricity rose by 7.4% and 2.5% respectively. Food prices are also rising, up 4.4% in October, pushed higher by dearer dairy products and eggs, and bread and cereals. Meanwhile, China’s inflation jumped to an annual rate of 1.5% in October from 0.7% in September, marking a 13-month high, official figures showed. The increase was driven by higher prices for food and fuel. Factory gate prices soared 13.5%, the fastest rate in 26 years, as coal prices soared amid a power crunch in China’s industrial heartland. On the oil markets, Brent crude has risen by 0.6% to $85.31 a barrel while US light crude is at $84.46 a barrel, up 0.37%. Shares in Asia have retreated, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng down 0.3% while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.4%, recouping some of their earlier losses, and Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.6%. European stock markets are set to open lower ahead of the latest US inflation data. Out at lunchtime, US inflation figures for October are expected to show consumer prices galloping ahead at 5.8% year on year, a 30-year high, according to a Reuters poll of economists’ forecasts. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With a number of Fed policymakers making louder noises about the need for rate hikes next year, a strong number here could well prompt a rebound in US [bond] yields which have declined quite sharply in the last week or so, with the 10-year down over 15bps from last week’s highs.

          "headline": "Hong Kong prosecutors cite Dominic Raab comments in bid to deny bail for Apple Daily boss",
          "bodyText": "A Hong Kong newspaper executive on trial for national security offences had his bail denied in part because of comments made by Dominic Raab after his arrest, which prosecutors cited as evidence of a “close association” with foreign political groups. The ruling handed down on 5 November against Cheung Kim-hung, the former chief executive of Apple Daily’s parent company Next Digital Media, also cited the US awarding of a congressional medal to Cheung and his colleagues, and a statement by the US state department. Cheung is facing charges of conspiracy to commit foreign collusion alongside the company’s founder Jimmy Lai, and editor-in-chief Ryan Law Wai-kwong. Convictions for national security crimes “of a grave nature” attract sentences of 10 years to life in prison. Corporate entities Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited and AD Internet Limited, are also on trial. The defendants were arrested during a police raid on the Apple Daily newsroom and executives’ homes in June. They are accused of conspiring to use the outlet to collude with foreign entities and seek sanctions, blockades, or other hostile activities against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, endangering national security. In denying bail, Judge Susana D’Almada Remedios cited prosecutors’ claims that Cheung had “a close association with the USA and foreign political groups as evidenced by their prompt reactions condemning law enforcement actions against the applicant and the condemnation of [the national security law] and enforcement actions against Apple Daily”. The ruling quoted comments made by Raab, the UK foreign secretary, in the aftermath of Apple Daily’s forced closure and the arrest of the executives. Raab had said the paper’s closure was a “tool to curtail freedoms and punish dissent – rather than keep public order”. It also cited a US state department statement calling the use of the national security law to suppress journalism a “serious and negative step” that undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy and the rights and freedoms of residents. Raab and the state department were among numerous international government figures and organisations as well as legal and human rights groups to have criticised Hong Kong’s crackdown on journalism and Apple Daily in particular. The paper, run by Lai, had become a vocal supporter of the pro-democracy movement and strident critic of Beijing and the Carrie Lam-led Hong Kong government and the city’s police force. In her reasons, Remedios also cited prosecutor claims that Cheung maintained business connections to Apple Daily in Taiwan, which they said “posted articles for making unfounded allegations against the HKSAR government and the Hong Kong police repeatedly”. The national security law reverses the onus of proof regarding bail, requiring defendants to convince the judge they would not “continue to commit acts endangering national security” if released. Remedios found she was “not satisfied that there were sufficient grounds for believing that [Cheung] will not continue to commit acts endangering national security if bail is granted to him”. There has been no trial or legal finding of such alleged acts being committed. This article was amended on 10 November to correct the name of Judge Susana D’Almada Remedios"

The NBN has ended up costing almost as much as the estimated cost of a full-fibre plan. The technology in the Coalition’s cut-down version cost up to three times more than forecast and was closer to the initial estimated cost of a revised version of Labor’s full-fibre plan, according to figures the government has sought to keep secret for almost a decade. Redacted figures, obtained by Guardian Australia, show NBN Co estimated the cost of using the hybrid fibre-coaxial was between $800 and $850 a premises and fibre-to-the-node was $600 to $650 a premises. In reality, as NBN Co encountered upgrade issues with both types of technology, pushing the average costs to $2,752 and $2,330 respectively. Temperature rises will top 2.4C by the end of this century, based on the short-term goals countries have set out during Cop26, according to research by Climate Action Tracker. The findings should serve as a “reality check” to the talks, said Niklas Höhne, one of the authors. “Long-term intentions are good, but their short-term implementation is inadequate,” he said. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics said: “We are concerned that some countries are trying to portray [Cop26] as if the 1.5C limit is nearly in the bag. But it’s not, it’s very far from it.” Australia is doing little to help, with the government’s policy response to the climate crisis ranked last out of 60 countries, and an overall ranking of 54.

South Korean horror drama Squid Game has quickly become Netflix’s most-watched series. For those who haven’t seen it, the premise is simple: a group of contestants on the poverty line are pitted against each other in a series of deadly games, all for the entertainment of the super-rich. At its core – and partly why it’s so compelling – is the class struggle. But long before the Korean hit, the rich were using the poor for blood sport in action classics like Surviving the Game and the Australian cult horror Turkey Shoot. Listen In 2019, a 29-year-old Yamatji woman – known as JC – was homeless, suffering from poor mental health and walking through Geraldton holding a kitchen knife, when the police were called.

          "headline": "Alleged massacres of Afghans by SAS not properly investigated, court told",
          "bodyText": "British soldiers and Ministry of Defence officials were aware of – and failed to properly investigate – a series of alleged massacres of 33 Afghan men by SAS soldiers at the peak of the conflict about a decade ago, a court has heard. The claim is being made on behalf of Saifullah Yar, four of whose male relatives were killed in a special forces night raid, and whose lawyers raised a string of questions as to whether the British military had concealed what happened. Richard Hermer QC, representing Yar, told the high court on Tuesday that there had been allegations of “patterns of unlawful killings and a cover-up” as he sought to obtain further records relating to alleged SAS executions of “fighting-age males”. Yar’s father, two brothers and a cousin were killed in an SAS raid on a compound in Helmand, southern Afghanistan in February 2011. The soldiers said they acted in self defence against men who carried assault rifles and grenades, but the family deny they possessed the weapons. Lawyers representing Yar want Mr Justice Swift to order the MoD to release further official documents – but the department said that Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, had adopted “a duty of candour” and had released 1,800 pages of material so far. “This is not a public inquiry and there is not a duty to provide any document that might look embarrassing,” said Lisa Giovannetti QC, acting for the minister. The court hearing was part of a wider judicial review claim, in which a judge will have to decide if the MoD broke human rights law by failing to commence a “prompt investigation” into the Yar family killings – and whether it failed to investigate “systemic issues”, to see if there was a pattern of battlefield executions. Other disputed killings took place in the week before the deadly raid on the Yar family compound, Hermer told the court. In one incident nine people were killed in similar circumstances, while in a second a single person died. Emails revealed that “senior officers were raising concern about the way the SAS was operating”, Hermer said, and that there were “implausible explanations that Afghans were shot and killed after going to their homes and returning with weapons”. Other emails released by the MoD in relation to the Yar family case showed two British officers discussing the incident later that day on email, under the heading “EJK” – extrajudicial killings. “They express astonishment that those involved seemed to be beyond reproach,” he told the court. “Why are we the only one who see this bollocks for what it is?” one of the officers wrote at the time. Further deadly incidents took place in the weeks following, prompting another officer to set down their concerns in a statement written in March 2011, writing: “During these operations it was said that all fighting age males are killed on target regardless of the threat they posed. this included those not holding weapons… “It was implied that photos would be taken of the deceased alongside weapons that the fighting age male may not have had in their position when they were killed.” A short internal military review of 11 separate incidents took place April 2011. Officers did recommend that service police investigate, but it spent only a week on the ground, and was accused of “uncritically accepting” accounts provided by soldiers involved. The 11 incidents were referred to Operation Northmoor in 2014, which was responsible for investigating alleged war crimes by British forces in Afghanistan, but it was closed in 2020 without any prosecutions being made. Investigators did not review video footage, which could have been been of relevant incidents, the court heard. The MoD said it did not intend to respond to Hermer’s version of events. Giovannetti said “that shouldn’t be taken as agreement or that it is accepted”. The hearing is due to last four days, some parts of which may be held in private, with a judgment expected at a later date. The full case will also be heard at a later date."

          "headline": "UK plc risks long-term stagnation and rising destitution, warns top thinktank",
          "bodyText": "Britain’s economy risks emerging from the pandemic into a long period of stagnation that damages household incomes and undermines plans to level up the regions, according to a hard-hitting report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. As it downgraded growth forecasts for next year and predicted a rise in prices that could push inflation above 5%, the thinktank accused the government and the Bank of England of mismanaging the economy since the 2008 financial crash. Jagjit Chadha, the NIESR director, said the government had come to rely on low interest rates to prop up the economy, allowing ministers to abdicate responsibility for directing investments to corners of the economy that needed it most. He said it was likely the regions outside London would miss out on much of the recovery, widening the gap between rich and poor regions. Cuts to welfare benefits and rising levels of inflation would also hit the disposable incomes of poorer families, doubling the level of destitution in the UK. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says adults with an income below £70 a week or couples with two children below £140 a week are unable to afford the basic needs of life and are destitute. Britain’s economy is expected to grow by 6.9% in 2021 and by 4.7% in 2022, as it recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, before slowing sharply to 1.7% growth in 2023 and 1.3% in 2024, NIESR predicted. It said the Bank of England was unduly optimistic about the economic outlook and had only a 30% chance of its forecasts for inflation and growth being met in three years’ time. It also said inflation was likely to reach about 5% next year and stay high for longer than Threadneedle Street expected. “We’re getting the economic management of the UK economy wrong,” Chadha said. “There is a persistent problem over many years of economic growth disappointing on the downside,” he said, which he blamed on low levels of public investment to raise the level of workers’ skills and improve productivity. In a swipe at the government, Chadha said a hard Brexit had made the situation worse. “Short-run supply problems will persist and are likely to be exacerbated by Brexit. This is because our exit from the EU has acted to reduce the pool of labour, contributed to lower levels of firm investment than might otherwise have been the case, and led to some contraction in the size of our traded sector. “Of course the squeeze on less well-off households is now well over a decade old, predating Brexit, and has primarily resulted from an inability to address our productivity shortfall. “Our problems are not insurmountable, but prompt and consistent interventions by the state to support training, labour mobility, house building may act to alleviate some of the costs of adjustment to that high wage-high skill economy for which we yearn,” he said. The NIESR deputy director Adrian Pabst described the extra £1bn over three years to boost training budgets as “a drop in the ocean”. The Bank of England kept interest rates on hold at 0.1% last week despite widespread speculation in financial markets that it was preparing for an increase to 0.25%. Members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted seven to two in favour of maintaining rates at the historic low – a level put in place in March 2020. The NIESR deputy director Paul Mortimer-Lee said the pressure from rising inflation would become impossible to ignore next spring, forcing the MPC to increase rates to 0.5%. “The Bank of England (is) hoping – unreasonably, we believe – that inflation will go away of its own accord quite quickly,” he said. “It doesn’t need to move quickly to raise interest rates, but it does need to show willing.” Shortages of vital components and goods, especially those made in emerging economies, will also hit growth in the global economy and by more than currently expected by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, the thinktank said. Growth of the world economy is likely to slow to 4.3% in 2022 and 3.7% in 2023, the thinktank forecast."

          "headline": "‘Unacceptable’: outrage as Air Canada chief gives Quebec speech in English",
          "bodyText": "The head of Canada’s largest airline is facing public outrage and calls for his resignation after giving a speech in English to business leaders in Quebec – a misstep that has inflamed longstanding grievances over linguistic rights and and protections in the lone province where French is the only official language. The row began last week, when in his first major public appearance as head of Air Canada, Michael Rousseau chose to address the city’s chamber of commerce without speaking French. Rousseau’s gaffe comes as the Quebec government attempts to dramatically strengthen protections for the French language amid fears English is overtaking it, especially in large cities. After his speech, Rousseau told reporters that despite having lived in Montreal for 14 years, he had not learned Quebec’s official language – and dodged questions posed to him in French. “I’ve been able to live in Montreal without speaking French, and I think that’s a testament to the city of Montreal,” he said, adding that his schedule did not allow him time to take French courses. Local outlets have reported that the company, which is headquartered in Montreal, was warned in advance by both the province’s premier and the federal language commissioner that an English-only speech could prompt backlash. But despite a quick apology – and pledge from Rousseau to immediately learn French – the incident has reignited resentments over language rights. For many, the incident evoked the 1950s, when company bosses would speak only English to their workers – and often refuse to allow French to be spoken. Those dynamics helped spark the Quiet Revolution – the bloodless overthrow of Catholicism and the anglophone ruling classes in the province – and a Quebecers separatist movement. “The big boss of Air Canada expresses everything we rejected decades ago: contempt for our language and our culture at home in Quebec. These words are beneath the job he holds,” tweeted Simon Jolin-Barrette, the province’s minister responsible for the French language. Others expressed disbelief that Rousseau, whose mother and wife both speak French, had somehow avoided picking up a conversational ability after more than a decade in the city. “It is possible, but very, very, very difficult to live in Montreal for 15 years and not be able to understand that question. You really have to be actively trying not to pick up a single thing,” tweeted one citizen. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, called the situation “unacceptable” and various political figures have called for Rousseau to step down. On Monday, Chrystia Freeland wrote to Air Canada’s board, calling the remarks “utterly inconsistent” with the company’s pledge to language diversity after the airline – which was once operated by the government – went private. In the letter shared with the Guardian, the deputy prime minister and finance minister noted that the government still owns 6% of the company’s stock, and called for a “significant” improvement to Rousseau’s French – and for his language skills to be tied to his annual performance review. Canada’s language commissioner usually receives 100 complaints about the airline per year – but since Wednesday, the office has received more than 1,000 complaints, a spokesperson said. The language row also comes under the shadow of legislation pushed by the provincial government that would significantly strengthen language laws. Bill 96 would change the country’s constitution to define Quebec as a nation, with its official and common leagues being French. It would also require all provincial communication with immigrants to be in French, starting six months after they arrive in Quebec. The bill would create a French language ministry and give new powers to the French-language watchdog."

          "headline": "Jordan Henderson the pass master set for new milestone at Liverpool",
          "bodyText": "Jürgen Klopp can often display a breezy indifference to statistics but, while his team are on the verge of setting a record for the longest unbeaten run in Liverpool’s decorated history, a different fact caught his eye. Jordan Henderson will become the fourth player to make 300 Premier League appearances for Liverpool on Sunday, putting him in distinguished company alongside Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Sami Hyypiä. As Klopp noted, he is nevertheless already in uncharted territory. “He surpassed Gareth Barry as the player with the most passes in the Premier League, is that right?” Klopp said. “I read that and he still has four or five years to go.” Henderson’s tally stands at 17,002 and his manager, with deliberate understatement, said: “What it says about Hendo is he is an absolutely great and very important figure in this team. He is so incredibly valuable.” There are other measures of the significance of a Premier and Champions League-winning captain. Take at least a point against West Ham and Liverpool’s undefeated sequence in all competitions will stretch to 26 games, one more than Bob Paisley’s class of 1982. In another respect, Henderson is the Anfield almost Invincible. Liverpool suffered a series of defeats when he was an emergency centre-back last winter. But in the past four years, they have lost two league games when he has started in midfield; both to Manchester City, 2-1 in a January 2019 meeting defined by a remarkable goalline clearance from John Stones and 4-0 in July 2020, after Liverpool had clinched the title. The last time anyone other than City took three Premier League points when Henderson began in his preferred position was at Tottenham in October 2017, a couple of months before Virgil van Dijk arrived to operate behind him. Results may be an indirect indication of his influence, but an appropriate one. Henderson’s 299 games have yielded 40 assists and 28 goals, the most recent a lovely opener against Brighton last Saturday, but he has been essentially a team player, defined in part by his impact on the collective, by the points totals and the trophies. His contribution has been as crucial in the dressing room as on the pitch. “Hendo has been essential to all the things we achieved,” Klopp said. His captain’s character may be a reason why he loses so rarely. A motivator of a manager seeks to gee others up but not Henderson. “His natural motivation is already at the limit,” he said. “You don’t have to put oil in the fire, there is enough fire there already. That’s Hendo.” It is a reason why he was never tempted to pension his captain off. At 31, Henderson was afforded a four-year deal in the summer. Klopp never feared it would prompt a lapse into complacency. Rather, he appreciates Henderson’s role in creating a culture he deems special. “I was not concerned that the new contract could stop him being a crazy devil from time to time on and off the pitch,” he said. “His mindset is made for winning things and I am really happy to have him here.” A workhorse can be a work in progress, even in the autumn of his career. “Hendo is not old, he can still develop, he has to and he will and I will not stop helping him with that,” Klopp said. As Liverpool’s greatest generation for three decades enter their 30s, Klopp sees scope for potential record-breakers to get better again. He is relying on Henderson to drive them on. “As long as these boys aren’t 40, we will improve them,” he said. “We need players like him at the club in the long term. These boys, with the quality, mindset and attitude of them, they set standards for all the rest.” If the Henderson years have become a golden age at Anfield, and Klopp is determined to savour them when they are over, he is trying to extend an era with his brand of tough love. Kicking the losing feeling further into the past involves kicking backsides. “The way we work together, the things we do, how we inspire ourselves and each other: all these kinds of things make this a very special group,” he said. “And they will be considered in the future, looking back, as a very special group. I know this already. I don’t praise them or celebrate with them. I’m here to kick their butts from time to time. That’s what you do to make the next step.”"

          "bodyText": "In 2013, Dave Eggers’ techno-dystopian satire The Circle described a sinister social media company that aims to abolish privacy for good. Its devotees aspire to “go transparent” – allow every moment of their lives to be captured on camera and beamed to the world. After his debut memoir, it is probably his best-known book, spawning a Hollywood movie. Nearly 10 years on, Eggers has written a sequel. The Every returns to the world of The Circle and takes its premise even further. The titular social media/search company of the first novel has swallowed up a competitor – “an ecommerce behemoth named after a South American jungle” – and created the “richest company the world has ever known”. The company continues to believe that privacy is theft; and it adds to that a growing insistence that human decisions in practically every area of life can and should be outsourced to the firm’s proprietary algorithms. A few “trogs” still refuse to share their data, but the drift of society leaves them increasingly ghettoised. The book’s protagonist Delaney, rather like Mae in The Circle, starts out as a recruit to the company – but her notion is to destroy the Every from within. (Mae, readers of the first book will remember, had a potential shot at that. She returns in this book as the chief executive of the whole company, from which readers can draw what conclusions they will.) Eggers is admirably, well, transparent, when I ask what sent him back to the themes of that earlier novel: “I had, you know, a few hundred pages of notes that I didn’t put into The Circle. There were some ideas there that I couldn’t squeeze into the first book ... ” But there was also what he calls “a catalyst”: “I saw this really widespread change happening, where it seemed to me that nobody ever wanted to make a decision any more.” He adds, by way of example: “In California there’s a movement to get rid of human decision-making” – to dispense with umpires who call balls and strikes in baseball “because sometimes there’s the possibility of error”. Already, algorithms are being used to grade college essays. “Everybody is having the wool pulled over their eyes, collectively, and nobody really seems to care. [You’d think] we would raise the alarm that essays were being so devalued to the point where non-thinking machines were reading and determining the fate of the students – [but] you find a protest and it’s maybe six people, lunatics like me and a few old hippies … This is the water that everybody swims in now.” The world of The Every is heading rapidly towards a sort of voluntary totalitarianism, described by one character as a “species-level evolution”; Eggers endorses that. “I think it would qualify as radical speciation,” he says. “The vast majority of humanity is now tethered to a device. There’s never been anything remotely like that, in terms of how quickly we changed. The closest thing would be the advent of radio or TV, but in both of those cases, those were not with us. Most of the time we disconnected from them. Now, we’re always accompanied by one device. We direct most of our life’s experiences through that device. We’re willing to be surveilled, 24/7, without discomfort. And we’re willing to give up most of our power to a handful of monopolies.” Surveillance and sousveillance is woven into all manner of human interaction. Pre-Googling, or its equivalent in The Every’s post-Google world, is routine etiquette: if you meet someone at a job interview or a party and you don’t already know all about them, they regard you as quaint. “You didn’t pre-search me?” one character says to the protagonist. “Oh god. You’re worse off than I thought.” So it’s a bit disconcerting when, while we’re making small talk ahead of the interview, Eggers says: “I read about your car getting stolen. Did you ever get a new one?” He must have pre-Googled me and found me whingeing in print. As an adoptive Californian, Eggers has lived for three decades at the centre of this shift. He describes himself as having been “beyond an early adopter of the Apple stuff” – all those early products, making the power of computers available to the mathematically challenged, enabled his first career as a graphic designer and publisher. But having been in San Francisco since 1992, he says, “I saw the internet change from, you know, cool toys and tools – as dorky as so many of [the tech entrepreneurs] were, it was really just about gadgets, and access – and then the switch was flipped and it became about wealth, and control.” That change was the germ of The Circle. The 51-year-old Eggers of today is a late or non-adopter. He doesn’t have social media, he doesn’t use a smartphone – “if I did, I would be watching baseball highlights all day” – and talks to me down an audio line “from an old fishing boat on the San Francisco Bay, where I work because it has no wifi going in or out and no possibility of a signal”. He is also refusing to sell the hardback edition of his book through Amazon in the US, “to highlight the vital importance of independent bookstores”: “Amazon is a monopoly that uses unfair business practices to drive out competition. They do not play by the rules and they do not pay anywhere near their proper tax burden. Meanwhile, you can bet your local indie bookstore is paying taxes. Amazon loses money on book sales because they can make up those losses through other revenue streams. That’s the essence of predatory pricing, and it should be illegal under existing antitrust laws. Because The Every is about an all-powerful monopoly that seeks to eliminate competition, it seemed like a good time to remind book buyers that they still have a choice.” In the US Eggers’s stand was made possible because the book is published by his own McSweeney’s imprint – “while there was a vigorous debate, in the end I agreed with myself and we went ahead” – but he’s realistic about the unlikelihood of his sparking an Amazon spring. “I’ve heard from two authors just yesterday who said they’re going to try to do the same thing, so that’s good. But listen: not everyone can do this. Amazon’s tendrils are everywhere. It’s mainly because McSweeney’s is a small independent company that we could cut Amazon out of the loop.” It’s a different story with UK publication. “Most companies, and distributors, are locked into contractual obligations with Amazon that preclude them from having a choice. Which is part of the problem.” When I mention that Sally Rooney has also used the publication of her book to make a political stand, refusing an offer from an Israeli publisher to translate Beautiful World, Where Are You into Hebrew due to her position on the Israel-Palestine conflict, Eggers is positive: “I think it’s a very reasonable way to protest peacefully, and I’m always in favour of peaceful protest.” One of the things that adds shade to Eggers’s novel is that the creeping totalitarianism he describes is a totalitarianism, at least ostensibly, of the left rather than the right; or, at least, of mega-capitalism monetising progressive concerns. “Silicon Valley is liberal politically,” he says. “So you do have most innovation wrapped in the cloak of liberalism and progressivism, diversity, equity and inclusion: they know how to sell an innovation that to them is profitable, gives them more power and control.” The idea that governments and big companies should have access to our data – that privacy is not an unqualified good – runs through the novel as a counterargument. Eggers says he has no problem with the idea of vaccine passports. The question is where you draw the line. “The one that keeps me up at night is surveillance cameras in the home,” he says (touching on a late plot point). “I don’t think that there’s any possibility that in two years, we won’t have surveillance cameras in the home. It’ll start voluntarily – in hotels and Airbnbs, and other sorts of semi-private places – and then there will be community spread, like the Ring cameras that are in most homes now, and partnerships with police departments. “The justification will be: there’s 10m cases of domestic violence in the US each year. Surveillance cameras would put a dent in that. How do you justify not having it? You could make an argument, well, OK, sure, domestic violence is catastrophic but privacy is more important. I don’t think it’s a powerful argument for most people. The more compelling and emotional argument is: save some lives.” One driver of the plot is the way in which the power and potential of the Every tends to quietly co-opt resistance. That comes from life. The big tech people he knows socially, he says, “recognise some of the problems they face”: “They’re not blind; they’re usually fairly idealistic people, and they’re definitely smart. They feel like, on balance, the good that the company is doing outweighs the evil.” The climate crisis is an example much on his mind (our first conversation was delayed by a week because Eggers’s kids were at a summer camp in an area hit by wildfires and he had to go and rescue them). “When I was in the middle of writing it, the sky was red, we had to stay inside, our air was unbelievable. We’ve had fires again this summer, a little further north. And, well, what if, you know, what if one of these companies was given more powers – maybe climate change would be better addressed if it was more of a command economy on a worldwide scale … ” One of the book’s central themes is the seductiveness of moral purity. Eggers takes a swipe at millennial sensitivities – and in these sections, you might be surprised to be reminded of Bret Easton Ellis’s broadsides against Generation Snowflake. One character denounces the environmental and human cost of exotic fruits in the staff canteen, and soon they are banned; with the inevitable catastrophic consequences for growers and hauliers. When Delaney organises a company visit to the beach to see elephant seals, most of the employees are so triggered by exposure to dirty, smelly real creatures in a natural environment that they daren’t leave the bus (those few who weren’t already boycotting the trip because they’d discovered a photograph online of the packed-lunch supplier posing with an Israeli flag). Eggers says he doesn’t see that hypersensitivity as “a generational thing”, though; it’s rather that “across the board, people of every age are getting more expectant of perfection in their lives, partly because they spend less time interacting with people”. Is he worried about “cancel culture” affecting what novelists can and can’t write? “I don’t know if, you know, five people tweeting about something really has the power to change a publisher’s mind? I certainly hope not.” In The Every, even art is seen as a problem to be solved by big data. The idea that machines are more “objective” than humans induces the company to run a series of projects designed to judge painting, literature and music by algorithm. One of Delaney’s more purposefully outrageous suggestions – the running joke is that like all her outrageous suggestions, which she hopes will prompt the populace to rise up in revolt, it is promptly and enthusiastically taken up – is FictFix: The main thrust of FictFix was to take old novels and fix them. Unsympathetic protagonists were made likeable, chiefly through aggregating online complaints and implementing suggestions; problematic and outdated terminology was changed to reflect contemporary standards; and superfluous chapters, passages and anything preachy was removed. This could be done instantly in e-books, even those purchased long before. When FictFix rolled out, it was done gingerly, Alessandro assuming the blowback would be extreme. But there was not much, and it was confined to a few irrelevant academics, whose own back catalogs were soon fixed by their former graduate students. Eggers is, to my surprise, unaware that five years ago Stanford University’s Literary Lab’s “bestsellerometer” used “cutting-edge text-mining techniques” on 20,000 novels and declared The Circle “the single most paradigmatic bestseller of the past 30 years”. Since the researchers aimed to show that the elements of theme, plot, style and characterisation that appeal to readers are, essentially, formulaic and predictable, this is a distinctly qualified compliment. “It wasn’t a joke?” he says. “I’ve never seen anything [about that]. Like, I never know anything once a book comes out: I don’t read anything about it. So the starting point is that I’m just blissfully unaware. But it seems like something that I would have made up as a gag or somebody else could have done as a prank.”If reality can anticipate dystopian fiction, how much does he think that a satirical novel can put the brakes on? “I’m trying to present a fork in the road where we might still have a choice to take one path rather than the other,” he says. “If you present the darker, sillier path, you can illustrate it vividly. You might convince people that that’s not where we want to go. That’s the best we can do with dystopian fiction to some extent.” “If I had one hope that would be, well: you know what? There’s going to be things that we aren’t going to measure, we’ll never be able to measure. Somebody sent me an article about some type of imaging to measure awe. There’s a bunch of smart people that are trying to do this, Lord knows why. Putting a pin into a butterfly and sticking it in a box: it’s a strange human impulse. “I would hope that we get comfortable with a little bit of discomfort, and be OK with a little bit of uncertainty, and embrace a little bit of the remaining mystery.” The Every is published by Hamish Hamilton.

          "headline": "Bugaled Breizh: how its sinking prompted 17-year fight for answers",
          "bodyText": "It sounds like the plot of a thriller. A fishing boat sinks off the Cornish coast as submarines converge for a naval exercise. Years of allegations, conspiracy theories, and denials by military chiefs follow. More than 17 years after the Bugaled Breizh sank with the loss of its five crew members, bereaved relatives remain convinced a submarine pulled the trawler down, but an inquest has now ruled otherwise. What happened to the Bugaled Breizh on 15 January 2004? The 24-metre-long Bugaled Breizh – whose name means “children of Brittany” in the Breton language – was fishing 15 nautical miles south of Lizard Point on a rough day when it sank. A major air and sea rescue was launched but none of the five crew members were saved. What investigations have taken place? The sinking was investigated for years by the French maritime authorities and courts. There are two theories: either it sank after its trawl gear burrowed into the seabed – a “soft snag” – or that a submarine became entangled in its warps, heavy lines that connect a boat to its nets. In July 2008 the French investigating judges stated that only the involvement of a submarine provided a coherent explanation. However, they could not identify any submarine as having been present. On Friday a British inquest judge concluded that a submarine did not cause the sinking. Were there submarines in the Channel at the time? Yes, three allied submarines were there, ready to take part in a Nato exercise. Closest was the Dutch submarine Dolfijn, which reported that it was about 11 nautical miles from the sinking at the time. A German submarine, the U22, was more than 40 nautical miles away and the British submarine HMS Torbay about 100 nautical miles away. Dolfijn helped in the search and rescue mission. Its presence surprised some. One rescuer, Philip Burgess, the coxswain of an RNLI lifeboat, said he had never seen a submarine involved in a rescue. “They’re a secretive lot,” he told the inquest. The pilot of a navy rescue helicopter claimed at the inquest that his commanding officer told them: “We don’t need to mention the submarine.” The pilot said he found this “strange”. Could there have been any other submarines in the area? Relatives have long suspected that a second British submarine, HMS Turbulent, was involved. The inquest heard testimony from the UK’s most senior submarine commanders that it was berthed in Devonport, Plymouth, that day. Another theory was that a US submarine was in the Channel keeping an eye on the loading of nuclear waste in France. The US has said none of its submarines were within 100 nautical miles. The Royal Navy said it was certain no non-allied submarines were within 50 nautical miles. Has this convinced the families? No. The families do not believe the soft snag theory. They argue the crew were too experienced to let such an accident happen. In court their barrister, Oliver Hymans, said that although no submarine had yet been placed at the scene, the soft snag idea did not explain the sinking. What was the response to the cover-up claims? Commander Daniel Simmonds, responsible for all UK submarine tasking, told the inquest it was “unthinkable” that logs and other documents recording the allied submarines’ positions had been falsified. But the families were angry they were not allowed to call into question the credibility of the navy by asking the commanders about the case of the Karen, a trawler whose gear was snagged by a Royal Navy submarine in 2015 off Northern Ireland. The UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch criticised the navy for not revealing until almost five months after the incident that a submarine was involved. Hymans said they had wanted to use the case of the Karen to test the MoD’s credibility."

          "headline": "Record number of people cross Channel to UK in small boats",
          "bodyText": "The number of people crossing the Channel by small boats in a single day reached a record number for this century on Wednesday, eclipsing the daily arrival figures during the summer. Despite the low November temperatures, at least 853 people came to the UK, the Home Office confirmed. The figure surpasses the previous daily record of 828 set in August. The figures will prompt renewed concern in Downing Street and the Home Office after high-profile pledges that the numbers of people entering the UK by boat would be curbed. It was widely assumed that the numbers of arrivals by boat would drop in the winter. They come after a week of fatalities for those trying to leave France for the UK. A train struck and killed a person from Eritrea near Calais and at least two bodies were recovered from the sea and a beach. The Home Office confirmed on Friday that the UK authorities rescued or intercept 853 people in 25 incidents. French authorities said two people died this week while attempting the journey and several more were feared lost at sea last week. Bridget Chapman, a case worker at Kent Refugee Action Network, which helps young refugee and asylum seekers, said recent rivals may have made the crossing on Wednesday because of clear weather and because of their increasingly desperate plight in France. “It was a cold but calm day to cross the Channel, followed by bad weather. We also hear that the conditions in Calais for people living rough are getting worse – French police beat young men and break up roadside encampments,” she said. The figure has been surpassed on previous occasions when local people in Kent welcomed refugees. During a single day in mid August 1914, around 16,000 Belgian refugees landed in Folkestone Harbour, doubling the number of people in the coastal town. Speaking of the Calais train incident, Franck Dhersin, a regional vice-president for transportation in the Hauts-de-France region, told the French broadcaster BFM-TV they were among a group of migrants walking along the tracks in heavy rain and after dark, making it hard for the train driver to see them. As well as the fataility, one person is in a critical condition after the incident on Thursday evening and two others sustained minor injuries, according to Dhersin. Dhersin, also a village mayor near the coastal town of Dunkirk, said dozens of migrants were arriving daily in the area. He appealed for help, saying: “We feel abandoned by the government.” More than 21,000 people have made the crossing to the UK so far this year, more than double the total for the whole of 2020. Campaigners and aid charities have repeatedly called on ministers to overhaul the asylum system in light of the soaring numbers. The Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said one person was found dead on the beach at Wissant, near Calais, on Thursday morning after the discovery of a boat filled with water. Two other people found with them were suffering from hypothermia, and were treated by emergency services and taken to hospital. Another person died attempting the crossing on Wednesday, said French authorities, who had carried out a rescue mission in the strait of Pas-de-Calais. It is believed they were unconscious when they were pulled from the water and pronounced dead as rescuers returned to shore. Another person has been reported as missing. Two men – both Somali nationals – were rescued off the Essex coast near Harwich on 25 October and searches for any possible remaining survivors have been called off. Refugee charities have pointed out that people seeking asylum have no choice but to take extreme and dangerous journeys to find safety in the UK. In 2019, the home secretary, Priti Patel, promised to make migrant crossings an “infrequent phenomenon” by spring 2020 and pledged in August last year to “make this route unviable”. During this time, the government has agreed to pay France tens of millions of pounds to increase security on its northern coast."

          "headline": "Ventilate your home to stop Covid spread, UK government says",
          "bodyText": "People are being urged to open their windows for 10 minutes every hour when they are socialising at home in an attempt to stop the spread of Covid-19 as winter approaches. Doctors and scientists are backing a government-funded campaign across all media platforms to encourage people to ventilate their home to help disperse virus particles. It will include a short film asking people to “stop Covid-19 hanging around” and showing how the coronavirus can build up in an enclosed space where an infected person is talking to someone else, linger in the air and then get passed on to someone else. Dr Thomas Waite, a deputy chief medical officer for England, said: “Small but important actions can help protect us against Covid-19. Getting vaccinations, wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces and taking regular Covid-19 tests all make an important difference but it is also crucial that we don’t overlook the value of ventilation. “With winter fast approaching and people spending more time indoors, it’s vital everyone understands the importance of using ventilation, such as regularly opening windows – even if just for a few minutes – to keep the air moving and prevent infections.” The Department of Health and Social Care is asking people to take ventilation more seriously after a representative survey of 3,000 people in England found that 64% do not know that opening windows helps limit Covid’s spread and only 29% do so when visitors come to their home. It said: “With fewer restrictions in place this winter, following the success of the vaccination programme, the act of refreshing air in the home when people have visitors is even more important for everyone to keep infections down.” Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the leader of the British Medical Association, welcomed the campaign and belated communication with the public about the benefits of ventilation. But he added: “We believe action should go further than a campaign, by setting explicit standards for ventilation in public spaces, including the appropriate use of CO2 monitors to assess adequate levels of ventilation. “There should also be resources and guidance to businesses so they can implement changes.” Experts involved in the push on ventilation hope to prompt a much greater use of open windows, especially with much greater social mixing indoors set to occur before and during the festive period."

          "headline": "Abba: Voyage review – no thank you for the music",
          "bodyText": "The journey to Voyage, Abba’s final studio album and their first in 40 years, began with a tweet from their shiny new Twitter account in August, coaxing people to “join us”. Billboards across London followed, featuring images of a sort of solar eclipse, a glitter ball in a sci-fi silhouette. A week later came news of a 10-track album and a “digital avatar” concert residency in a custom-built London arena. The signs were good. Here was a band alive to their legacy as makers of sparkling pop, but also to the spirit of disco’s futurism, understanding that they had to harness the shock of the new. In September, one of two album taster tracks, Don’t Shut Me Down, fulfilled this brief exquisitely, morphing from vulnerable Swedish noir to piano-and-horn-propelled pop-funk. Its impact was unexpected and exciting and it became Abba’s first Top 10 hit since 1981, charging Voyage with the promise of forward motion and glamour – qualities that felt wildly attractive in our messy, mid-Covid times. And so it is hard to reckon with the disappointment that Abba’s ninth album delivers, as it prefers to languish in often bafflingly retrograde settings. It begins with I Still Have Faith in You, the other taster track released in September. An epic example of the “bittersweet song” Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Fältskog refer to in the lyric – in their different, yet still lovely, older voices – its meditation on how to confront and own the ageing process is precision-tailored, in glistening silver thread. The opening, elegiac string phrase yearns for resolution throughout, before returning wistfully in the song’s final bars. The second verse’s soft drum rolls (by Per Lindvall, veteran of Super Trouper and The Visitors) are among many fine, musical details that urge the women on. It is, admittedly, a little cheesy, but its tenderness still feels triumphant. But rather than reflecting poignantly on the past, much of the rest of Voyage feels terminally stuck there. When You Danced With Me tells the story of a girl left behind in Kilkenny when a boy she loved “left for the city”. She’s spent years waiting for him to return, we’re told; presumably she’s oblivious to the existence in Ireland of train routes, driving tests or text messages. The Celtic-leaning melody in the intro recalls Abba’s incursions into other global settings, such as the Mexican battlefields in Fernando, or the Spanish-Peruvian musical moodboards of Chiquitita. The overall effect doesn’t prompt folkloric nostalgia, but mild nausea. Then comes the album’s big crime against sense, sentimentality and sequencing, Little Things, a Christmas song shoved in at track three. All about the delights of the season, it includes a children’s choir singing about their grandma (the St Winifred’s school singers would sound like rebel punks in comparison), but also, in a jolting juxtaposition, intimations about mum and dad’s sex life. Particularly weird is the implication of a grim transactional quality behind a romantic gesture. “You’d consider bringing me a breakfast tray, but there’s a price,” Lyngstad sings, having noticed her partner’s “naughty eyes”. You hope if she’s presented with a breakfast sausage, she’ll impale it then bin it. Admittedly, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson have never been the most enlightened lyricists on the feminism front. One of Us and Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) are two Abba songs among many featuring a fraught woman desperate for any man to pop along and quick-fix her loneliness. Now four decades have passed, and one can’t help but despair at the chorus of I Can Be That Woman (“You’re not the man you should’ve been / I let you down somehow”) and that’s after its terrible lyrical twist about a female her husband is sleeping with, who turns out to be … a dog. Keep an Eye on Dan offers another miserable monologue from a pining divorcee, spoiling its fantastic mixture of Visitors-era iciness and Voulez-Vous-era disco propulsion. Ulvaeus recently said these songs were written “absolutely trend-blind”. It shows. Including tracks such as the rejected 1978 single Just a Notion (a reminder of early, jangly Abba glam, but nothing more) and Bumblebee (a naive attempt to say something universal about climate change) makes you doubt their quality control. At least Voyage’s finale, Ode to Freedom, hints at a grand, closing statement, pastiching and stretching a phrase from a waltz in Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake. But then its lyric talks about the futility of writing an ode that’s worth remembering, which leaves an odd note, especially when we’re talking about a band whose songs are known around the world. “If I ever write my ode to freedom / It will be in prose that chimes with me,” it concludes. Maybe it’s a reference to the female members’ preference for privacy, or even Abba’s determination to keep creating their unusual song structures in their Swedish reading of English – but it also suggests Abba feel they can exist in their own bubble. They can’t. In the past, they excelled when they twisted the sounds of their times in their own way, when they were within glam, disco and electronic pop but also apart from these genres; when their idiosyncrasies elevated them, rather than diminished them. If only they had stopped at those two knowing songs, leaving the rest to our dazzling imaginations."

          "headline": "Owen Paterson resigns as MP for North Shropshire after sleaze row – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Owen Paterson has announced his resignation as MP for North Shropshire, after Boris Johnson made clear he would no longer seek to prevent the former cabinet minister from being punished by parliament for lobbying. Yesterday Johnson ordered his MPs to vote down a report saying Paterson should be suspended from the Commons for 30 days. But less then 24 hours later, in one of the swiftest and most comprehensive government U-turns in recent times, No 10 announced that it was going to effectively tear up yesterday’s vote, allow a fresh debate on suspending Paterson and start again from scratch in attempting to gain cross-party support for reform of the disciplinary process for MPs. There is a Westminster joke about how eventually everyone gets let down by Boris Johnson, and the U-turn meant that Paterson - who yesterday enjoyed the full support of the No 10 machine - was today facing inevitable suspension from the Commons, and a possible recall election too. (See 4.31pm.) Paterson, who only last night was saying that he was looking forward to clearing his name and was calling for the resignation of the parliamentary commissioner for standards (see 11.11am), responded to the PM cutting him adrift by announcing that he was resigning as an MP. In a statement Paterson said he was doing so to put his family first. (See 2.45pm.) Johnson’s U-turn makes the government less vulnerable to the toxic charge of corruption and cronyism than it was, but the episode must have caused some reputational damage and Tory MPs who loyally defended what the government was doing yesterday are looking particularly exposed. It also remains unclear whether reform of the standards system will ever happen. Labour has not entirely ruled out joining a cross-party initiative in this area, but ministers’ main demand is to insert an appeal process into the current system - and Sir Keir Starmer argues this is unnecessary. (See 3.38pm.) Claudia Webbe, who was elected as a Labour MP, has been sentenced to 10 weeks in custody suspended for two years after being found guilty of a campaign of harassment, including threatening an acid attack, against a woman. Lord Evans, the chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, has launched a full-frontal attack on the government’s decision to tear up the independent system for combating sleaze in parliament, describing it as “a very serious and damaging moment for parliament and public standards in this country”. Boris Johnson has been accused of “staggering hypocrisy” after it emerged that he flew back to London from the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow by private jet to go to a dinner at a men-only private members’ club. Johnson has admitted receiving a free holiday at a luxurious Spanish villa linked to Zac Goldsmith, the former MP who was given a peerage and job by the prime minister. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, has described Owen Paterson’s resignation as a victory for the British public. Davey said: Boris Johnson thought he could rewrite the rules to defend himself and his Tory chums from charges of sleaze and corruption without anyone noticing. But he underestimated the British people and how badly this would go down, including among many lifelong Conservative voters. It just shows that the Conservatives are taking people for granted. The public wants decency and honesty from their government, instead under Boris Johnson all they get is lies, chaos and cronyism. Boris Johnson has issued a statement paying tribute to Owen Paterson. He said: I am very sad that parliament will lose the services of Owen Paterson who has been a friend and colleague of mine for decades. He has had a distinguished career, serving in two cabinet positions, and above all he has been a voice for freedom - for free markets and free trade and free societies - and he was an early and powerful champion of Brexit. I know that this must have been a very difficult decision but I can understand why - after the tragic circumstances in which he lost his beloved wife Rose - he has decided to put his family first. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, wants Boris Johnson to launch an inquiry into Tory sleaze. One suspects he is unlikely to get his wish. At the No 10 afternoon lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson also said that Boris Johnson still had confidence in Mark Spencer, the government chief whip. “The prime minister has confidence in the chief whip and he continues to do an excellent job delivering for the government,” the spokesperson said. According to the Guido Fawkes blog, many Conservative MPs blame Spencer for the Paterson vote fiasco, which has led to one of the swiftest and most comprehensive government U-turns on record, and prompted Owen Paterson to resign as an MP. (If MPs had voted to suspend Paterson, he may have decided to resign anyway. If he hadn’t, campaigners might have tried to get the 10% of voters necessary to sign a petition calling for a recall election – a procedure allowed for a suspension of more than 10 sitting days. But there is no guarantee that this would have inevitably led to Paterson’s departure. Recall has been tried in three seats since the process was introduced in 2015 but in one, North Antrim, campaigners did not collect enough signatures. In another, Brecon and Radnorshire, the offending MP was reselected by his party to fight the byelection, which he lost. And the two seats where recall did lead to the MP changing – Brecon and Radnorshire, and Peterborough – are both marginals. North Shropshire is a safe Tory seat (see 3.21pm), which means activists from other parties would have little incentive to trigger a byelection.) At the afternoon lobby briefing Downing Street said that there was now no need for a vote on the standards committee report saying Owen Paterson should be suspended, in the light of his decision to resign as an MP. Gavin Barwell, the Tory peer who was chief of staff to Theresa May when she was prime minister, has criticised Owen Paterson’s friends who encouraged him to contest the standards committee report saying he broke the rules banning paid lobbying. Pete Wishart, the SNP spokesperson on Commons matters, is also calling for Boris Johnson to apologise for his handling of the Owen Paterson affair. Wishart said: Boris Johnson must now come to parliament to answer for his grubby role in the Tory corruption scandal. The prime minister must perform a full U-turn, apologise to the standards commissioner, and commit to an independent inquiry into the growing problem of Tory sleaze, cronyism and corruption at the heart of the UK government. This Tory government is the sleaziest in decades. It has been beset by scandal after scandal - with the prime minister and his Tory colleagues guilty of breaking the ministerial code, acting unlawfully, handing peerages to donors, contracts to cronies and special access to their pals. The Owen Paterson affair is just the tip of the iceberg. It absolutely stinks. In an interview with BBC Radio 2’s Jeremy Vine show at lunchtime, before Owen Paterson announced his resignation, Sir Keir Starmer said that Paterson and his supporters were “completely wrong” when they claimed that the Commons standards process did not give him a right of appeal. Starmer explained: I’m sorry, that is completely wrong. The independent commissioner comes to a decision and then there is an appeal to the standards committee. And that appeal involves that individual, Owen Paterson, being able to put in, with his lawyers, his appeal points in writing and also to make his case in person which he did. So he’s been through the appeal. And this idea there’s not an appeal is such a ... I’ve been six years in politics and many years as a lawyer, I’ve heard some really, really dodgy defences. That is as dodgy as they come. Starmer said that Labour would not get involved in cross-party talks if they were designed to “get rid of the independent commissioner and replace it with a group of politicians to judge our own behaviour”. But he said he was open to plans that might strengthen the role of the commissioner. Yesterday the Commons voted to set up a committee with a Tory majority, chaired by John Whittingdale, the former culture secretary, to review the way standards inquiries are carried out. But Labour and the SNP both said they would boycott it, and the plan to set it up has now been shelved. The government is now going to make another attempt to reach cross-party consensus on reform (see 10.50am), but almost nothing has been said yet about what this might entail. Labour sources say whether or not the party participates will depend on what is being proposed. Owen Paterson’s decision to resign means there will be a byelection in North Shropshire. But Paterson had a majority at the last election of 22,949, and so for the Conservatives to lose there it would have to be a catastrophic electoral meltdown for the party. The Tories did lose Chesham and Amersham, another very safe seat, in a byelection earlier this year. But their majority in the seat in 2019 was “only” 16,223 (29%), not 41% as it was in North Shropshire at the general election. And in 2019 the Lib Dems (byelection experts, who specialise in hoovering up soft Conservative votes) were in second place in Chesham and Amersham, where HS2 was also a big factor. Paterson’s main opponent at the last three elections in North Shropshire was the Labour candidate. Sir Keir Starmer has issued a statement responding to the news of Owen Paterson’s resignation, saying Boris Johnson should apologise. Starmer says: This has been an unbelievable 24 hours even by this government’s chaotic standards. Only yesterday Boris Johnson was forcing his MPs to rip up the rules on standards in public life is a truly damning indictment of this prime minister and the corrupt government he leads. Boris Johnson must now apologise to the entire country for this grubby attempt to cover up for the misdemeanour of his friend. This isn’t the first time he’s done this but it must be the last. And Boris Johnson must explain how he intends to fix the immense harm he has done to confidence in the probity of him and his MPs. Opposition MPs may be surprised by the claim in Owen Paterson’s statement that some of them mocked his wife’s death by suicide last year. (See 2.45pm.) He may have been referring to a moment during PMQs yesterday. In his sketch (paywall) for the Times (paywall), Quentin Letts said: “At PMQs earlier, Boris Johnson had mentioned Rose Paterson’s suicide. Up went several aw-diddums ‘ahhs’ from the Labour side.” My colleague John Crace, the Guardian’s sketchwriter, was also in the gallery and he tells me he did not see anything that could be described as MPs mocking Rose’s death. My impression was that when Johnson mentioned Rose’s suicide, that did prompt a faint reaction from some MPs, but that was more because they felt Johnson was using Rose’s death as cover because he was finding it hard to justify the vote exempting Paterson from the standards committee recommendations. But I was listening to the debate on TV, not watching from the gallery, so I may have missed aspects of the reaction. Here is the full statement from Owen Paterson announcing his decision to resign as an MP. I have today, after consultation with my family, and with much sadness decided to resign as the MP for North Shropshire. The last two years have been an indescribable nightmare for my family and me. My integrity, which I hold very dear, has been repeatedly and publicly questioned. I maintain that I am totally innocent of what I have been accused of and I acted at all times in the interests of public health and safety. I, my family and those closest to me know the same. I am unable to clear my name under the current system. Far, far worse than having my honesty questioned was, of course, the suicide of my beloved and wonderful wife, Rose. She was everything to my children and me. We miss her every day and the world will always be grey, sad and ultimately meaningless without her. The last few days have been intolerable for us. Worst of all was seeing people, including MPs, publicly mock and deride Rose’s death and belittle our pain. My children have therefore asked me to leave politics altogether, for my sake as well as theirs. I agree with them. I do not want my wife’s memory and reputation to become a political football. Above all, I always put my family first. This is a painful decision but I believe the right one. I have loved being the MP for North Shropshire and have considered it a privilege to have been elected to serve my constituents for 24 years. I would like to thank my staff who have worked for me so loyally over many years. I also want to thank those who have stood by me so staunchly. I wish them all the best in that difficult but vital job of being a member of parliament. I will remain a public servant but outside the cruel world of politics. I intend to devote myself to public service in whatever ways I can, but especially in the world of suicide prevention. At this incredibly difficult time for my family, we ask that the media respects our privacy and lets us grieve my beloved Rose, the best person I ever met. Paterson said he would not be making any further comment. Owen Paterson is going to step down as an MP, PA Media reports. The meeting between Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, and Clément Beaune, the French minister for Europe, in Paris this morning does not seem to have achieved much. They were talking about the dispute about fishing licences. But in its readout afterwards, the UK government just said: Lord Frost and Europe minister Clément Beaune met in Paris this morning. As foreshadowed, they discussed the range of difficulties arising from the application of the agreements between the UK and the EU. Both sides set out their positions and concerns. The two ministers will speak again early next week. Frost also has a meeting tomorrow in Brussels with Maroš Šefčovič, his EU counterpart, which will focus on the ongoing dispute about the Northern Ireland protocol. According to Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, on the World at One, Owen Paterson did not get any advance warning about the government U-turn that means MPs will get a fresh vote on suspending him from the Commons. My colleague Heather Stewart says this will reinforce suspicions (see 9.34am) that Paterson was not really the priority for No 10. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, has criticised Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, for the interview he gave this morning suggesting the parliamentary commissioner for standards should resign. (See 9.27am.) Hoyle told MPs: It’s not been a good period for the house, it’s been a very, very difficult time for all. What I would say is I do appeal to members - whether they are secretary of state or whoever - please, staff members of this house shouldn’t be named, they’ve not got the right of reply or the ability to defend themselves ... I’ve got to say please, rein in your thoughts, consider what you are doing to the individuals concerned, they also have to live through this like the rest of us. Please, consider inappropriate behaviour and start acting responsible to the position that you hold. Sir Roger Gale, a Conservative MP who voted for the amendment to shelve the suspension of Owen Paterson yesterday, has just told the World at One that, in the new vote on suspending Paterson, he will probably abstain. He said he was glad the government had taken the decision to decouple the proposal for reform of the system, which he favours, from the Paterson case. But he also said he was reluctant to vote for Paterson’s suspension because he did not believe his colleague had received a fair hearing. The Telegraph’s Tony Diver has a picture of the vandalism done to the office of the Tory MP Peter Bone overnight. Bone told MPs earlier that this was a result of his decision to vote to shelve the proposal to suspend Owen Paterson yesterday. (See 11am.) And here is a full summary of the Downing Street lobby briefing. No 10 has confirmed that another Commons vote will be held on the proposal to suspend Owen Paterson as an MP “as soon as possible”. (See 12.36pm.) The spokesman indicated government MPs would not be whipped on the new vote. Votes on standards committee recommendations are normally free votes, because they are seen as House of Commons business. The decision to whip the vote yesterday was an exception, not the norm. The spokesman was unable to say exactly when Boris Johnson changed his mind on this issue. But he said it was clear “there’s not cross-party consensus for the amendment that was voted through yesterday”. The spokesman refused to back Kwasi Kwarteng’s suggestion that Kathryn Stone should resign as parliamentary commissioner for standards. That was a matter for her, he said. He also disputed claims that Kwarteng had suggested she should resign, citing the proviso Kwarteng included in his interview (“But I’m not saying she should resign” - even though Kwarteng did seem to be saying that - see 9.27am). But the spokesman also refused to say Johnson had confidence in Stone. Asked if he did, the spokesman just said Johnson was focused on the need to include an appeals system in the process. The spokesman rejected Dominic Cummings’ claim that yesterday’s vote was intended to undermine Stone. (See 9.34am.) Asked if the vote was a pre-emptive strike against her, the spokesman said no. He also denied Cummings’ claims that Johnson had lied about the funding of his flat. The spokesman defended Johnson’s decision to take a private jet fro Glasgow to London on Tuesday night after attending the Cop26 climate conference. (See 10.13am.) The spokesman said the government was taking a lead in addressing climate change. He also said that the plane used sustainable aviation fuel, and that emissions were offset. The spokesman would not say if Johnson discussed the Owen Paterson case with Charles Moore at the dinner on Tuesday. (See 10.13am.) Moore and Paterson are very close friends, and Moore has been one of his strongest defenders in the media. The spokesman said it was a private dinner and he had not discussed it with the PM. The spokesman condemned the latest Insulate Britain protest (see 1.01pm), saying the group were causing “intolerable disruption”. Insulate Britain campaigners have been protesting outside the Houses of Parliament today. Some of them glued their hands to the road. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished, and the prime minister’s spokesman has confirmed that another Commons vote will be held on the proposal to suspend Owen Paterson as an MP “as soon as possible”. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, will give details of the vote in due course, the spokesman said. He said the government was decoupling the Paterson issue from the wider issue of reforming the way the Commons disciplinary process operates, and that at a later date proposals for reform would be put to a vote separately. Asked to explain the U-turn, the spokesman said the government was responding to “strong feeling” in the Commons. He went on: The amendment itself required cross-party consensus. Once it became clear that was not going to be achieved, it was necessary to look again at this and therefore separate out this individual case with a wider necessity to introduce an appeals process. Asked why No 10 did not decouple the two issues from the start, the spokesman said the government was trying to address both issues as soon as it could. I will post more from the lobby shortly. This is from Mark Harper, a former Tory chief whip. Harper was one of the 13 Tory rebels who defied the whip and voted against the Andrea Leadsom amendment yesterday. There were actually 14 full Tory rebels yesterday (if you define a full rebel as someone who votes against the whip, instead of just abstaining). Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the Commons, abstained on the Leadsom amendment, but in the second vote (on the main motion, as amended) he voted against. Sir Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of “leading his troops through the sewer”, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports. From the FT’s Robert Shrimsley David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, has said the government’s U-turn over Commons standards is too late. The Conservative MP Angela Richardson has been reinstated as PPS (parliamentary private secretary) to Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary. She was dismissed last night from the post after she abstained last night in the vote on the Owen Paterson motion, instead of voting for the Andrea Leadsom in line with the three-line whip. In the Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, has granted an application for an emergency debate on the parliamentary standards system that will take place on Monday. The application came from the Lib Dem chief whip, Wendy Chamberlain. She told MPs: The government’s decision not just to meddle in an independent process but then to whip Conservative members to get what they wanted is one of the worst over-reaches of executive power that this house has seen in its history. Social media executives could be held criminally liable for safety breaches on their platforms within months of the online safety bill coming into effect, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, has said. As PA Media reports, Dorries made the disclosure in evidence to the committee considering the draft bill this morning. PA reports Dorries told the committee that she wants to accelerate the introduction of personal liability sanctions for company managers to spark a faster response to the threat of online harms. The draft bill includes personal criminal liability sanctions for executives which can be introduced two years after the implementation of the bill. However, Dorries said it was “nonsense” to give firms two years to change, confirming she was looking at “three to six months” for criminal liability to be introduced. “So, to the platforms, take note now - it will not be two years,” she told the committee. “We are looking at truncating that to a very much shorter timeframe and that’s one of the areas as secretary of state I want to go further in this bill. “I think it’s just a nonsense that platforms have been given two years to make themselves ready for what would be criminal action. “They know what they’re doing now, they actually have the ability to put right what they’re doing wrong now, they have the ability now to abide by their own terms and conditions - they could remove harmful algorithms tomorrow.” Under the current proposals, tech firms that fail to protect their users from harmful content face fines of up to 10% of their global turnover - which could run into billions of pounds for the largest platforms - as well as having access to their sites blocked. During her evidence, Dorries also criticised Facebook’s recent company rebrand to Meta and its plans to work on the virtual world known as the metaverse, saying that while its boss Mark Zuckerberg and communications boss Nick Clegg want to “take off into the metaverse” they should instead “stay in the real world”. She said: “Now I believe we heard that they’re [Facebook] putting 10 or 20,000 engineers on to the metaverse - put those 10 or 20,000 engineers now on to abiding by your terms and conditions and to removing your harmful algorithms because if you don’t, this bill will be watertight.” Dorries also said the bill was “possibly the most important piece of legislation to pass through parliament” in her time as an MP, calling it a “novel” piece of legislations that was “groundbreaking” and “extremely important”. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, has issued a statement saying the government must schedule a vote on suspending Owen Paterson. She said: The government’s pathetic attempt to hide from their actions doesn’t fix anything. Last night, they voted to allow corruption to take place unimpeded at the heart of British politics. MPs must now vote to uphold the sanctions against Owen Paterson. Any other result will allow Boris Johnson to create one rule for Tory MPs, another for everyone else. Bryant says it was “completely inappropriate” for Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, to effectively call for the resignation of Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, this morning. (See 9.27am.) He says she is very fair and very robust, and that he supports her 100%. He says he expects her to stay in post until her contract ends, in December next year. Bryant says he has long been in favour of allowing MPs to make an appeal against the punishment proposed by the standards committee. But he says it is not clear who would hear that appeal. At the Institute for Government Chris Bryant, the chair of the Commons standards committee, is now taking part in a panel discussion, as part of its one-day conference on ethical standards in government. Asked what should happen next in the Owen Paterson case, Bryant says there should be a vote in the Commons on Monday on the proposal to suspend him. He says he thinks that may be what Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, was signalling in the Commons earlier, but he says he is not sure. (Rees-Mogg was being oblique on this issue.) And he says what Rees-Mogg was saying to MPs earlier was the opposite of what he said in the debate yesterday. Perhaps Rees-Mogg did not understand the motion, Bryant suggests. Here is my colleague Robert Booth’s story about the speech earlier by Lord Evans, chair of the committee on standards in public life. And here is the full text of the speech. On Sky News Sam Coates says he has been briefed that the government is now planning to get MPs to vote on a new motion on Owen Paterson, proposing that he should be suspended for 30 days (as the standards committee recommended). This time it would be expected to pass. According to the Telegraph’s Tony Diver, Paterson may have miscalculated with a hubristic media round yesterday. This seems to be a factor in No 10 deciding to cut him loose. That media round included an interview with the Daily Telegraph in which Paterson said that Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, and members of the standards committee should resign. He told the paper: Sadly they have not done a good job and come up with a rotten report which is full of inaccuracies. As far as I’m concerned, they all have to go. Chris Bryant, the Labour chair of the Commons standards committee, says parliament is in a “quagmire”. He suggests that one solutioin might be for his committee to produce a new report on Owen Paterson. He says he thinks it would say the same as the old one. He also stresses the importance of using moderate languate, and expresses his regret about what happened to Peter Bone’s office. (See 11am.) Rees-Mogg welcomes what Bryant said about the importance of using moderate language. But he suggests Bryant was not doing this himself in his Today interview this morning when he compared what happened in the Commons yesterday to something that might happen in Russia. Referring to what happened yesterday, Bryant told Today: “That is not what we do in this country, that is what they do in Russia,” he said. “It’s a perversion of justice.” Peter Bone (Con) says he is not clear what is happening to the Owen Paterson case. And he says this morning his office was vandalised because of his vote to support the government yesterday. Rees-Mogg says that, while there support in the Commons for reforming the system, there is a strong feeling in the Commons that “this should not be based on single case or applied retrospectively”. May I just reiterate what I said at the beginning of these proceedings, that while there are strong feelings on both sides of the house that there is a need for an appeal process, there is equally a strong feeling this should not be based on a single case or applied retrospectively. I fear last night’s debate conflated the individual case with the general concern, this link needs to be broken. That implies that government may revert to supporting Paterson’s suspension. Rees-Mogg says it would be “idle to pretend that there are not concerns about the [disciplinary system for MPs]”. But he says this must be done on a cross-party basis. From LBC’s Ben Kentish This is what Jacob Rees-Mogg told MPs about the partial U-turn in relation to the new committee being set up to consider reforms to the disciplinary process for MPs. I am aware that last night’s vote has created a certain amount of controversy. It is important that standards in this house are done on a cross-party basis. The house voted very clearly yesterday to show that it is worried about the process of handling these complaints and that we would like an appeals system, but the change would need to be on a cross-party basis and that is clearly not the case. While there is a very strong feeling on both sides of the house that there is a need for an appeals process, there is equally a strong feeling that this should not be based on a single case or apply retrospectively. I fear last night’s debate conflated an individual case with the general concern. This link needs to be broken. Therefore I and others will be looking to work on a cross-party basis to achieve improvements in our system for future cases. We will bring forward more detailed proposals once there have been cross-party discussions. In the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg is now responding to Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, who asked various questions about what is happening to the review of standards. He says a committee cannot work without opposition members. (Parliament voted yesterday to set up a new committee, chaired by John Whittingdale, to review the standards system. But Labour and the SNP said they would not take up their seats.) Rees-Mogg says he hopes the opposition parties will not join in trying to set up a new system. He cites the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, which was set up to consider complaints about MPs mistreating their staff, as a possible model. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has just told MPs that yesterday’s vote mistakenly confused an individual case with the general argument about the need for reform. And he also said reforms to the disciplinary process for MPs needed to proceed on a cross-party basis. He said the new committee being set up will not consider whether the Owen Paterson case needs to be reviewed. He said the government will be bringing forward more detailed plans in future. It is not clear yet what this means for Paterson. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, was asked by Nick Robinson if he could name a single thing that Boris Johnson has done to deliver higher integrity and probity in public life. Kwarteng replied: I could do lots of things. We had a manifesto commitment to deliver Brexit and we delivered Brexit. That was something which we promised to do and the prime minister led a government that delivered that. We’ve also made very explicit comments and commitments on climate change ... Holding yourself to manifesto commitments and delivering those commitments is, I think, a feature of integrity. Given the number of dubious promises made about Brexit, this was a reply that probably had remainers across the land hurling objects at the radio. The government won the first vote on Owen Paterson by just 18 votes yesterday. But 27 Labour MPs did not vote, and it has been said that if they had, the government would have lost. In an interview with Times Radio this morning Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, said that all the MPs who did not vote had been paired, meaning that by agreement their non-vote would be matched by a Tory non-vote. She said the system is used for MPs who are unable to attend votes because they are either ill, self-isolating or have a family emergency. She went on: That’s what happened with those Labour MPs. There’s not a single Labour MP who agrees with the course of action that this government is taking. Every single Labour MP voted against who was able to, and it was only those who were unable to vote who didn’t vote. Back at the IfG, Lord Evans is asked if there should be a ban on MPs having paid jobs outside parliament. Evans says the committee has not looked at this under his chairmanship. But it has looked at it in the past, and the committee decided there could be advantages in MPs having outside interests. He says he shares that view. But what is important is that being an MP should be their main job, and they should be transparent about their interests. The Daily Mirror did not splash on the Owen Paterson vote this morning, but it carried an alternative story damaging to the PM. It says that Boris Johnson returned from the Cop26 conference in Glasgow to London by private jet on Tuesday evening - so that he could attend a reunion dinner for Daily Telegraph journalists at the Garrick club. There may be a link to the Paterson case too. One of the other guests at the dinner was Charles Moore, the former Telegraph editor made a peer by Johnson, who is a close personal friend of Paterson and who has been one of the journalists complaining most vigorously about the treatment of the M MP by the standards committee. At the IfG Lord Evans is now taking questions. Q: How damaging is the Paterson affair? Evans says you only need to look at today’s front pages (see 9.27am) to see that it is damaging. He goes on: People recognise this as an attack on standards. It’s not been presented in that way, but I think you’d have to be extremely naive to imagine that this was not a politically motivated set of decisions. And on standards issues independence is key. Nobody should be able to make their their judgments on their own case. And this is a retrograde step in that regard. Ministers and Downing Street have, of course, repeatedly denied that there was any partisan element to the vote yesterday. They are said that they were motivated by a desire to improve the process by which complaints against MPs are investigated and they have implied that the fact that this also involved shelving the suspension of Tory former cabinet minister (which it did not have to - MPs could have approved his punishment, and reviewed the system seperately) was a mere coincidence. At the start of his speech Lord Evans, chair of the committee on standards in public life, described yesterday’s Commons vote to shelve the proposed suspension of Owen Paterson for breaking lobbying rules as a “very serious and damaging moment” for parliament. He said: Yesterday’s vote on the report of the Commons standards sommittee was a very serious and damaging moment for parliament and for public standards in this country. It cannot be right that MPs should reject after one short debate the conclusions of the independent commissioner for standards and the House of Commons committee on standards, conclusions that arose from an investigation lasting two years. It cannot be right to propose an overhaul of the entire regulatory system in order to postpone or prevent sanctions in a very serious case of paid lobbying by an MP. At the Institute for Government Lord Evans, the former MI5 boss who is now chair of the committee on standards in public life, has just started giving a speech at a one-day conference on ethical standards in government. There is a live stream here. Earlier this month the committee published a report calling for rules to be tightened in various areas, including in relation to the ministerial code. But Downing Street ruled out giving more power to adviser on ministerial standards, who investigates breaches of the code. Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson’s chief adviser at No 10 until November last year and who is now a vitriolic critic of his former boss, has tweeted this morning to say that he believes yesterday’s vote was intended to remove Kathryn Stone as parliamentary commissioner for standards, as Kwasi Kwarteng’s interview this morning implied. (See 9.27am.) Cummings claims that Johnson is worried that a Stone investigation into the way donations were used to fund the refurbishment of Johnson’s No 10 flat will show he broke the rules. Good morning. The news at Westminster is still dominated by the repurcussions from yesterday’s Tory vote that effectively shelved the anti-sleaze processes that have been in place for MPs since the cash-for-questions scandal in the 1990s, and the newspapers make grim reading for No 10. Here are some of the front pages. This morning Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, has been doing the broadcast interview round for Downing Street and he has taken the government’s offensive against the current standards regime one step further, suggesting that Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, should resign. Stone carried out the investigation that concluded that Owen Paterson broke lobbying rules. Her conclusions were backed up by the standards committee. She also earlier this year produced a report saying Boris Johnson broke the MPs’ code of conduct in relation to the way he registered his holiday in Mustique, although on that occasion the standards committee concluded, on the basis of supplementary evidence, that Johnson was in the clear. Given that she is now considering a further inquiry into the funding of Johnson’s flat refurbishment, it is not hard to see why No 10 would want her gone – although yesterday she indicated that she plans to remain in post until her term of office is up in December next year. Asked whether Stone should resign, Kwarteng told Sky News: I think it’s difficult to see what the future of the commissioner is, given the fact that we’re reviewing the process, and we’re overturning and trying to reform this whole process, but it’s up to the commissioner to decide her position. Asked what he meant by “decide her position”, Kwarteng said: It’s up to her to do that. I mean, it’s up to anyone where they’ve made a judgment and people have sought to change that, to consider their position, that’s a natural thing, but I’m not saying she should resign. “I’m not saying she should resign,” Kwarteng claimed. But it sounded very much as if he was, and that is how Labour interpreted his answers. After the interview, Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the Commons, said Kwarteng’s comment was “appalling” and further evidence of government corruption. She said: Having already ripped up the rules policing MP’s behaviour to protect one of their own, it is appalling that this corrupt government is now trying to bully the standards commissioner out of her job. Boris Johnson must immediately distance himself from these latest attempts to poison British politics. And all decent people of all political beliefs must stand against these naked attempts by Tory MPs to avoid scrutiny of their behaviour. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Lord Evans, the chair of the committee on standards in public life, gives a speech at an Institute for Government conference on ethical standards in government. At 10.30am Chris Bryant, chair of the Commons standards committee, and Lord Pickles, chair of the advisory committee on business appointments, take part in a panel discussion. 9.30am: Ministers at Cop26 make announcements on phasing out coal. There will be full coverage on our separate Cop26 live blog. 9.45am: Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, gives evidence to the committee on the draft online safety bill. 10am: Claudia Webbe MP is sentenced after being found guilty of harassment. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions in the chamber on next week’s business. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 12pm: Nicola Sturgeon takes first minister’s questions in the Scottish parliament. Also today Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, is in Paris for talks with the French Europe minister Clement Beaune. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"

          "headline": "Ghislaine Maxwell jail conditions rival Hannibal Lecter’s, lawyers say",
          "bodyText": "The British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is subjected to such invasive surveillance in jail that it “rivals scenes of Dr Hannibal Lecter’s incarceration” from The Silence of the Lambs, her lawyer has argued in making yet another request for bail pending her trial. Maxwell is charged in Manhattan federal court for allegedly procuring teenage girls for the disgraced wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. Opening arguments in Maxwell’s case are scheduled to begin on 29 November. “Maxwell’s conditions of detention for the past 16 months continue to be reprehensible and utterly inappropriate for [a] woman on the cusp of turning 60 with no criminal record or history of violence. It is unwarranted, unrelenting, and utterly inappropriate,” her lead attorney, Bobbi C Sternheim, wrote in court papers. “[She] has been subject to physical and emotional abuse by the correction officers, poor and unsanitary living conditions, insufficient nutrition, difficulties reviewing the millions of legal discovery documents in the case against her, and sleep deprivation.” The lawyer also complained about flashlight checks every 15 minutes at night that were preventing Maxwell from sleeping, hostility from guards and being tracked by surveillance cameras as she walked through the facility. Sternheim, who has discussed these alleged conditions in prior court papers, has also argued that Maxwell is “over-managed because of the intense criticism” that followed Epstein’s jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on sex trafficking charges. Sternheim has previously invoked The Silence of the Lambs – in which Anthony Hopkins plays an imprisoned serial killer – to describe Maxwell’s jail conditions. In April, Sternheim said in written arguments to a federal appeals court: “Though she is a model prisoner who poses no danger to society and has done literally nothing to prompt ‘special’ treatment, she is kept in isolation – conditions fitting for Hannibal Lecter but not a 59-year-old woman who poses no threat to anyone.” Asked for comment, the US Bureau of Prisons said in an email: “For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we decline to comment about the conditions of confinement for any particular inmate.” They did say that the bureau was “committed to ensuring the safety and security of all inmates in our population, our staff, and the public” and that “additionally, the BoP takes allegations of staff misconduct seriously and consistent with national policy, refers all allegations for investigation, if warranted. “Incidents of potential criminal activity or misconduct inside BoP facilities are thoroughly investigated for potential administrative discipline or criminal prosecution,” the email also said. The filings came just before the weeks-long process of selecting a jury began on Thursday in New York. Maxwell has said she is innocent of charges alleging that she recruited teenagers who were not yet adults for Epstein to sexually abuse from 1994 to 2004, Judge Alison Nathan told 132 prospective jurors. The judge warned prospective jurors not to discuss the case with anyone or research it, on the internet or anywhere else. She said the final jury of 12 jurors and six alternates will be asked to render a verdict after a trial expected to last about six weeks based only on evidence they learn about in the courtroom."

          "headline": "MP Claudia Webbe given suspended sentence for harassing woman",
          "bodyText": "The MP Claudia Webbe has been sentenced to 10 weeks in custody suspended for two years after being found guilty of a campaign of harassment, including threatening an acid attack, against a woman. Webbe was found guilty of harassing Michelle Merritt, a friend of her partner, with threatening phone calls. A trial was told she had called Merritt a slag, threatened to “use acid” and said she would distribute naked pictures of Merritt to her family. The 56-year-old has also been ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work after being found guilty of harassment. The sentencing of Webbe, who was elected as a Labour MP but now sits as an independent, represents a dramatic fall from grace. In 2019, she was one of the most powerful minority ethnic figures in UK politics, a key aide to Jeremy Corbyn and the chair of the party’s disputes panel. Webbe was elected with a majority of 6,019 but had the whip withdrawn last year after she was charged. She is expected to appeal against her conviction for harassment. But her sentence at Thursday’s hearing will prompt an automatic recall petition in Leicester East if her appeal fails. Both Labour and the Conservatives are preparing to battle over the seat if Webbe fails to turn over the court’s decision. Reacting to the sentence, Webbe continued to protest her innocence and said she had received numerous racist threats. “I am very disappointed by the decision of the magistrate and want to strongly reiterate that I am innocent. I am lodging an appeal and despite today’s sentence I fully expect the appeal to be granted and that ultimately it will be successful. “Throughout this process I have received numerous threats to my life and vile racist abuse. The cowards responsible for these attacks will not deter me from clearing my name. “I want to thank constituents, family, friends and my comrades in the Labour movement for their support and solidarity, and to my legal team for their professionalism during this process.“ In a victim impact statement to the court, Merritt said a “sad, distressing darkness” had enveloped her since the threats from Webbe began several years ago. She said it has affected her career, her friendships and her trust in other people and said she still fears if she might be attacked because of the MP’s political connections. “I am scared of Claudia Webbe … because of Claudia Webbe’s position in government I don’t know what she is capable of,” she said. “Since the end on 2018 and even more since the rescheduling of the March 2021 court case, I have had a foreboding sense that Ms Webbe, someone who has the wherewithal to follow through on her threats or via someone else, would seriously try to hurt or harm me. A sad, distressing darkness has cast a huge shadow across all areas of my life,” she said. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring described Webbe’s behaviour on Thursday as “callous and intimidatory”. “You were jealous of the relationship between [Webbe’s partner] Lester Thomas and Michelle Merritt, and probably felt in some way threatened by it.” He said Webbe “showed little remorse or contrition” and would have been jailed immediately were it not for her previous good character. Defence counsel Paul Hynes QC said his client had received threats of violence on social media, as well as racist comments. Webbe denied harassment between 1 September 2018 and 26 April 2020 but after a two-day trial last month, Goldspring found her guilty. “I found Ms Webbe’s evidence to be vague, inconsistent and at times to be illogical. It was shaped around the overwhelming evidence against her she could not innocently answer, but ultimately I found it to be untruthful.” He said her conduct towards Merritt was “oppressive and was designed to be so”. “In particular threatening to send intimate photographs to her family and to ‘use acid’ are in my view the best evidence of the intent.” Webbe is a former chair of Operation Trident, which was set up in response to shootings disproportionately affecting black people in London. She was a councillor in Islington between 2010 and 2018 and was a member of Labour’s national executive committee. She entered the House of Commons in December 2019, winning the seat formerly held by Keith Vaz, the former Labour minister who retired from parliament in the wake of a scandal involving cocaine and sex workers. In September an official report found Vaz had engaged in “sustained and unpleasant bullying” towards a member of parliamentary staff. Because Webbe received a custodial sentence of less than a year, if her appeal fails a recall petition would be triggered in her constituency. To prompt a by-election, 10% of the electorate within the constituency would need to sign the petition. While she appeals, she is allowed to continue to be paid as an independent MP and vote in parliament. In January 2019, Fiona Onasanya, the former Labour MP for Peterborough convicted for perverting the course of justice, was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. Her final appeal was refused in March, triggering the recall process and a by-election in June. Vaz told the Guardian last month that he would not stand again as a Labour candidate in Leicester East but he is known to still carry some support among the constituency party’s executive and voters. The new rule means by-election candidates will be chosen by a five-member panel, three of whom will be selected by the constituency party executive. Local Conservative sources said the party has already begun the interview process for a prospective candidate. The Conservatives’ vote share increased from 24.2% in 2017 to 38.6% in 2019."

          "bodyText": "And finally, stocks in New York have closed at fresh record highs, as investors take the Fed’s decision to slow its stimulus calmly. The Dow Jones industrial average, the broader S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq all hit new highs. Dow: up 105 points or 0.3% at 36,157.58 points S&amp;P 500: up 30 points or 0.65% at 4,660.57 Nasdaq Composite: up 162 points or 1% at 15,811.58 While investors expected the Fed to start tapering today, they may be reassured by Jerome Powell’s patient message that it’s not time to raise interest rates yet. The central bank has given itself some flexibility by not committing to a specific tapering timetable beyond December (although it may well continue cutting $15bn off its bond purchases each month). Anna Stupnytska, Global Economist, Fidelity International, explains: Not committing to a specific taper timeline has given the Fed some flexibility in adjusting the pace of purchases in 2022, allowing for an accelerated reduction if inflation proves to be stickier than expected, although the adjustment can occur in either direction.” “With the policy announcement meeting expectations, the focus now shifts to the question of what this means for policy rates. At the Jackson Hole Summit in August, Fed Chair Jerome Powell explicitly acknowledged two different tests for tapering and rate hikes, breaking the link between the two. But as inflation has continuously surprised on the upside since then, the Fed’s thinking must have shifted towards a higher likelihood of an earlier lift off, potentially starting as soon as QE ends.” “Powell - unsurprisingly - did not commit to any rate hiking timeline in the press conference, emphasising data dependency, the Fed’s focus on risk management and the need for optionality to address a range of possible outcomes. With inflation and labour market thresholds for tapering having been crossed, when it comes to raising interest rates the tolerance for progress in both areas under the FAIT remains uncertain. This leaves much room for interpretation, potentially allowing markets to run their own narratives until further clarification of the Fed’s reaction function emerges.” On that note, goodnight. GW A reminder of Powell’s key messages: Reaction to the US central bank’s decision to begin slowing its stimulus programme is flooding in. Seema Shah, Chief Global Strategist at Principal Global Investors, says Jerome Powell dodged questions about when interest rates might rise: “Powell was very careful not to make any mis-steps today, sticking carefully to his script that their focus is on tapering, not raising rates. That’s a shame, because interest rate hikes are all that markets want to talk about! Having started to probe whether central banks really can look through elevated pressures, today’s focus was always going to be on how much, if at all, Powell pushed back on market expectations for early and multiple hikes. In the event, Powell maintained some flexibility by emphasising the uncertain path for the economy - essentially sitting on both sides of the wall. “We can sympathise with that. Supply chain bottlenecks are not in the Fed’s control, and so inflation is not entirely in the Fed’s control. Yet, inflation will be elevated for longer, inflation expectations are creeping higher, and the deficit in employment is down to labour supply – not labour demand – and so there are limits to what the Fed can realistically achieve by keeping policy rates unchanged for so long. “The other question today is: will President Biden be impressed by Powell’s careful skirting around the issue at hand? At least we will get a clear answer to that soon enough.” Simon Harvey, Senior FX Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says Powell’s patient stance on tackling inflation pushed the US dollar lower: Once at the lectern, Chair Powell showed his experience by nullifying expectations, extending the theme initially displayed in the rate statement and the market reaction in doing so. By completely avoiding any discussion on the future pace of QE purchases and rates, whether that be the Fed’s view on lift-off or current market implied rates, Powell opened the door further to give policymakers greater optionality. While this is unlikely to bring money market expectations back that much as Powell is known to sit on the dovish side of the spectrum, it is weighing on the dollar and supporting risk in FX markets. Those pricing a more hawkish Fed in the coming months may have to wait until individual policymakers hit the wires in the coming weeks. But even then we expect hawkish members to err on the side of caution given the current level of uncertainty in the economic outlook Candice Bangsund, Vice President and Portfolio Manager of Global Asset Allocation at Fiera Capital, says the Fed telegraphed today’s tapering well: “As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve announced a taper to its quantitative easing program – though no new definitive rate liftoff signal was provided at this week’s gathering. Chair Powell has been adamant that there will be some time between the end of quantitative easing and lift-off, and this is expected to remain the case following today’s meeting.” “The markets have already fully discounted the QE taper since the Fed has been telegraphing that move for a while. However, the markets are now concerned that the current surge in inflation will force the Fed into raising interest rates sooner than expected and traders have rapidly ramped-up their wagers for Fed rate hikes. Leading up to the meeting, the markets were discounting a strong chance of two rate hikes by the end of 2022.” “Our sense is that these hawkish-leaning expectations on the trajectory for rates are overdone and that Chair Powell will continue to err on the side of caution – and a more pragmatic approach to policy normalisation is likely to see those aggressive expectations reigned-in somewhat.” Gurpreet Gill, Macro Strategist, Global Fixed Income, at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says the outlook remains uncertain: “The monthly pace announced today suggests the last taper will come in June 2022, but the range of possible outcomes is wide. Large surprises on the path of the pandemic, inflation, expectations for inflation, or wage growth could prompt a changed taper pace and impact the rate outlook. “Yields on short-dated US bonds have risen to a lesser degree than elsewhere during the recent bout of hawkish market action. We think this is due to FOMC’s guidance that even its first rate hike would require maximum employment. “If inflation stays far above target in 2022 however, we think the Fed may begin to say that remaining weakness in labour supply is structural and hint at rate hikes. If inflation begins to ease, the Fed may wait for a fuller labour market recovery before raising rates. The US Federal Reserve has announced it is winding down the massive stimulus programme it put in place at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic amid fears that the central bank may have to raise rates soon to control rising inflation. Fed officials have been debating for months over whether and when to taper the stimulus programmes that it set up to head off the economic headwinds caused by the pandemic. They announced on Wednesday that they would begin cutting that stimulus by $15bn a month but left interest rates unchanged. “With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen,” the Fed wrote in a statement. “The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the summer’s rise in Covid-19 cases has slowed their recovery. Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.” In March 2020 as the pandemic brought the global economy to a shuddering halt, the Fed moved to prop up the US economy by cutting interest rates to close to zero and started buying $120bn a month in Treasury- and mortgage-backed securities. The initiative appears to have helped the US bounce back from a potential economic catastrophe. The unemployment rate has dropped from a record high of 14.7% in April 2020 to 4.8% in September. But now the central bank is wrestling with concerns that its stimulus efforts, combined with cash injections from Washington, pent-up consumer demand and the unprecedented impact of the pandemic on the global supply chain, are driving up inflation. Annual inflation is at a rate unseen in 30 years, according to US government figures released last month. Prices for US goods climbed by 4.4% in the year through September, according to the department of commerce’s latest personal consumption expenditures report, the fastest increase since 1991. The rising cost of fuel is also adding to prices and causing misery for millions of Americans struggling to pay their utility bills. Here’s the full story: Jerome Powell is declining to comment on the issue of whether he will be nominated for a second term by president Joe Biden. Powell’s renomination (or otherwise) has been overshadowed by the ethics scandal over trading by top Fed officials. The Fed chair told today’s press conference that he has briefed Biden administration officials and lawmakers about the central banks response, but insists. “I’m not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process,” Jerome Powell says the Fed has acted ‘strongly and forcefully’ after an ethics scandal gripped the central bank this autumn. Asked whether the Fed need to do more to rebuild its credibility following revelations that two regional Fed bank presidents had traded investments such as stocks and real estate investment trusts in 2020, Powell says the Fed needs to have the ‘complete trust’ of the American people. The old ethics system had been in place for decades. By all accounts it had served us well, but that was no longer the case, Powell admits, so it has taken steps. Last month the Federal Reserve banned individual stock purchases by its top officials and unveiled a broad set of other restrictions on their investing activities, after Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both retired after their trading came to light. Q: Wwre any laws broken? Powell says he has asked the Inspector General to assess if any rules, or laws, were broken, so it’s out of his hands now. Quizzed about the labor market, Powell says it will take time to assess how employment dynamics have been affected by the pandemic. Some people are continuing to stay out of the job market due to Covid-19, he says, due to caring responsibilities or to avoid catching the virus. So with demand for employees strong, and vacancies high, the US is not yet at maximum employment. On wages, Powell says rising earnings are generally a good thing. It would be a concern if wages were rising persistently above inflation and productivity gains -- as that could force firms to raise prices, creating a ‘wage-price’ spiral. But at this stage, the Fed doesn’t see ‘troubling’ increases in wages, the Fed chair reassures. Onto questions... Q: The markets anticipate you will raise interest rates once or twice next year - are they wrong? Jerome Powell says the Fed’s focus at this month’s meeting was on tapering asset purchases, not on raising interest rates. It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further progress towards our goals. We don’t think it’s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and participation. And turning to the question.... Powell predicts that supply chain disruption, and elevated inflation, will persist well into next year. But we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter of 2022, he predicts. The timing of interest rate rises will depend on the path of the economy, so policymakers will be watching the data closely. We think we can be patient. If a response is called for, we will not hesitate. Q: So could maximum employment be achieved by the second half of next year? Yes, it’s possible, if the pace made over the last year were to continue, Powell replies. That’s significant, as “maximum employment” is a crucial target for the Fed before it starts to lift borrowing costs. Powell then explains that the Fed has decided to taper its $120bn stimulus programme by $15bn in November (to $105bn), and again in December (to $90bn). Similar reductions would likely continue in subsequent months, if the economy evolves as expected, implying that the bond-buying programme would cease by the middle of next year. But the Fed would adjust the pace if economic conditions warranted, he adds. Jerome Powell also predicts that inflation will decline back towards its 2% target as the economy adjusts. But he cautions that global supply chains are very complex, so it is highly uncertain exactly when they will return to normal. And he insists the Fed would use its tools to preserve price stability, if it saw signs that the path of inflation or longer-term expectations were moving materially and persistently beyond its goals. On inflation, Powell says imbalances between supply and demand, and the reopening of the economy, have led to ‘sizable’ price increases in some sectors. Bottlenecks and supply chain disruption are limiting how quickly demand can respond to supply, so inflation is running ‘well above’ the Fed’s 2% goal (indeed, it hit 5.4% last month). Powell also admits that supply constraints have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated, but insists the drivers of higher inflation are predominantly due to factors caused by the pandemic. And he acknowledges that poorer Americans will suffer most from the jump in prices of stable goods and services: We understand the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, particularly those with limited means to absorb higher prices for essentials, such as food and transportation. Turning to the economic outlook, Powell says that the economic recovery slowed notably in the third quarter of this year, after strong growth in the first half of the year. The increase in Covid-19 cases hit sectors such as travel and leisure, he points out. Supply chain problems have also hit the economy, notable in the auto sector (where carmakers have struggled to get hold of semiconductors) But aggregate demand has been strong. So with Covid cases falling, and progress in vaccinations, growth should pick up in the current quarter (October-December), Powell predicts. But he points out that job gains slowed in August and September, particularly in sectors most affected by the pandemic (leisure, hospitality and education). Labor force participation rates remain subdued, which means employers are having difficulties filling jobs. But Powell suggests this may improve (if falling Covid-19 outbreaks help people to return to the workplace). US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is holding a press conference now. He explains that the FOMC decided to leave interest rates near zero, and to start reducing the pace of its asset purchases “in light of the progress the economy has made” towards its goals. Monetary policy will continue to provide strong support to the economic recovery, Powell says. Powell adds that the Fed remains ‘attentive to the risks’, given the unprecedented disruption caused by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, and will ensure that policy is well-positioned to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. Oxford Economic’s Greg Daco has analysed the Fed’s statement: Richard Flynn, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says: “As expected, the Fed made no formal interest rate adjustment and announced it would begin to taper balance sheet purchases. In short, the Fed is reducing its stimulus of the US economy. Despite disappointing GDP figures last month, the economy has continued to recover output lost during the COVID-19 downturn. Inflation is well above the Fed’s 2% target and the unemployment rate has been falling amid a very tight labour market. Although the introduction of tapering is no surprise, the shift in tone will reassure markets that the Fed will keep inflation under control. “Tapering is not tightening – it’s just less stimulus. The Fed will hope that phasing-out its stimulus programme puts downward pressure on demand, encouraging supply to catch up. Yet neither tapering nor rate hikes are the elixir for the bottlenecks ailing global supply chains. As prices rise, we expect cooling consumer demand; hopefully before the Fed has the impulse to introduce tighter interest rates than markets are expecting in 2022.” Jeanna Smialek of the New York Times flags that the Fed sounds less certain that inflation will be transitory.... Despite taking the well-telegraphed plunge to start tapering, the Fed will still be supporting the US economy through bond purchases for several more months, just at a slower pace. The Fed also warns that there are risks to the US economic outlook, and that the Delta variant slowed the recovery this summer. With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months, but the summer’s rise in COVID-19 cases has slowed their recovery. The US central bank also argues that the factors pushing up inflation are expected to be transitory: Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remain. America’s central bank has decided to begin winding back the enormous stimulus programme it launched when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the US economy. The US Federal Reserve is taking its first step towards withdrawing its emergency aid, following the recent increase in inflation over its target to 13-year highs. Following its meeting this week, the Fed will start reducing its $120bn monthly bond purchases in the coming weeks, by $15bn a month. It will cut its purchases of US government bonds (which had been $80bn/month) by $10bn per month in November and December. It will also cut $5bn off its mortgage-backed securities spending (which had run at $40bn/month), this month and next. And looking further ahead, the Fed says: The Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. The US central bank also left interest rates unchanged at near zero after its latest meeting, where they have been since March 2020 as the US economy reeled from the impact of the pandemic. More to follow.... Stocks are subdued on Wall Street as investors await the Federal Reserve’s announcement, in around 15 minutes. The S&amp;P 500 index is flat, while the Dow is down 0.4%, away from last night’s record close over 36,000 points. Craig Erlam, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA, says investors are expecting the Fed to begin trimming its stimulus programme. But when might interest rates rise? A taper of their asset purchase program by $15 billion per month - $10 billion in Treasuries, $5 billion in mortgage-backed securities - would bring an end to the program in the middle of next year which takes us to the question we all want the answer to. What then? Despite Powell’s best efforts to convince everyone that tapering and interest rates aren’t linked, hikes are already being priced in for next year with the first expected almost immediately after tapering is anticipated to draw to a close. More rate hikes are expected to follow soon after. With that in mind, will Powell and his colleagues continue to cling to their belief that inflation is transitory? I think that will inevitably be dropped at this meeting or the next, when new projections will allow them to re-evaluate their position and communication. Their views won’t dramatically change, they’ll still insist that pressures are being driven by temporary factors and will pass naturally over time, but that it may take longer than initially believed. That will allow them the space to bring forward expectations for rate hikes to align more with the markets over the next couple of years. Whether investors will stay on board with that is another thing. US stock markets are trading around record highs going into the meeting as we’re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season. In the City, the FTSE 100 has ended the day down 26 points at 7249 points. Darktrace was the top faller, down 5.1%, after investor Vitruvian Partners sold a third of its stake last night. Oil stocks also fell, tracking the losses on crude oil today. European markets finished at a new record high, with France’s CAC up 0.34% and Germany’s DAX flat, as investors await the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision in an hour’s time. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says: Stocks are a touch lower as traders await the Federal Reserve meeting. There is growing speculation the US central bank will announce the tapering of its bond buying scheme, which currently stands at $120 billion per month. The minutes from the most recent Fed meeting indicated that tapering could begin as early as November, so if that is the case, the announcement could be made later. Inflation in the US is at a 13 year high, of 5.4%. The unemployment rate has fallen to 4.8%, the lowest mark since the pandemic kicked in, so it is clear the labour market is improving. With these stats in mind, there is an argument the Fed should pull the trigger and start tapering the asset purchase scheme. We’ll find out soon..... One of Daily Mail and General Trust’s largest shareholders has criticised the Rothermere family’s recommended offer to take the company private (see earlier post). Majedie Asset Management, which owns a 4.6% stake, argues that it undervalues the business. Chris Field, Fund Manager of UK Income Fund, co-manager of the UK Equity and UK Focus Funds Majedie Asset Management, says: It is our opinion that the offer for the residual businesses following the sale of RMS and listing of Cazoo, is substantially below what we believe is a fair and reasonable valuation. There is an inherent asymmetry of information working against non-family shareholders which we have urged the Non-Executives to address to allow shareholders to make an informed decision. Our appraised valuation estimate of only the largest businesses within DMGT materially exceeds double the current offer price of 255p. We strongly urge shareholders not to accept the offer.” Here’s our news story on the Rothermere offer, by my colleague Mark Sweney. Another UK energy company has collapsed - the sixth this week. Harrogate-based CNG Energy, which supplied energy to business customers, says it has become the latest casualty of the global energy crisis and extremely high wholesale energy costs. This follows the collapse of Zebra Power, Omni Energy, AmpowerUK and MA Energy on Tuesday, and Bluegreen on Monday. Two of the world’s biggest wind energy companies have warned of difficult conditions as slower-than-usual winds and supply chain difficulties delay manufacturing. Ørsted, a Danish company, said lower-than-normal wind speeds throughout the third quarter had affected its earnings. Across the first nine months of 2021 slow winds cost the company 2.5bn Danish kroner (£290m) compared with the previous year. Ørsted makes about two-thirds of its revenues from offshore wind including off the UK’s coasts. Vestas, the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturer, on Wednesday cut its profit guidance for the second time this year, citing supply chain instability and cost inflation that was hitting the wind power industry.....More here: Crude oil prices are falling, after US stockpiles of oil rose by more than expected. Crude stocks rose more by 3.3 million barrels last week, latest inventory figures show. However, gasoline stocks fell to their lowest level since November 2017. Brent crude is now down almost 3% today at $82.20 per barrel, a three-week low. US crude is down 3.4%. Interactive Investor’s Victoria Scholar points out that Opec+ is expected to resist pressure to speed up its production increases: Back in the US, the service sector has posted its strongest growth in three months. But, just like in the UK, firms hiked their prices at a record pace in October. Plus, worries about worker shortages and unstable supply chains knocked business confidence to an eight-month low. Purchasing managers surveyed by IHS Markit also reported a rise in new orders. But with parts, materials and staff in short supply, firms struggled to meet these orders -- with the fastest increase in backlogs of work since data collection began in October 2009. However, new business from abroad fell for the third successive month, seemingly due to “pandemic uncertainty in key export markets”. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says: “The final PMI data add to indications that the US economy has picked up speed again in the fourth quarter. After the Delta variant caused growth to slow in the third quarter, the easing of virus case numbers has been followed by a strong revival of economic activity, notably in the service sector, which looks set to be the driving force of the economy as we head towards the end of the year . “While the service sector is seeing a waning impact from the pandemic, it’s a different story in manufacturing, where the supply crisis continues to cause havoc and dampen production growth. Supply delays worsened in October, which has in turn fed through to a further intensification of inflationary pressures. Media News: The Rothermere family have agreed the terms of a deal to take the publisher of the Daily Mail private, after 90 years on the London stock market. Daily Mail and General Trust and the Rothermeres have agreed a recommended cash offer worth 255p from its founder and largest shareholder, along with a special dividend worth 991p a share. The Rothermere family announced in July that it was considering an £810m bid to take the group private - giving chairman Lord Rothermere full control of DMGT (they currently have about a 30% stake) That proposal was dependent on the sale of DMGT’s RMS insurance business and the flotation of online car seller Cazoo on the New York stock exchange, which have both now happened. Alongside the recommended cash offer, Rothermere Continuation Ltd (a Jersey-registered holding company) and DMGT have also agreed that shareholders should get 568p in cash plus 0.5749 Cazoo Shares for each DMGT Share, through the special dividend. DMGT, which also publishes Metro, the i and New Scientist, say an agreement has been reached with its pension trustees over the deal. A £412m cash payment will be made into the main DMGT pension scheme, along with restrictions on future debt levels and dividends. Press Gazette explains: It comes after DMGT said all pre-conditions of reaching a deal were satisfied, having come to an agreement with trustees of the group’s pension funds, which will see Lord Rothermere pay £412 million into the schemes. The pensions agreement had been the final sticking point holding up a final offer from Rothermere Continuation Limited (RCL) after it first made a takeover proposal in July. Here’s Viscount Rothermere on the offer: “The sale of RMS and the Cazoo IPO have delivered excellent shareholder returns, but inevitably DMGT is now a considerably smaller group of businesses, with significantly greater exposure to consumer media. This has led RCL and the DMGT Board to decide to implement a major reorganisation of the Group by distributing the value created by the RMS sale and the Cazoo IPO in conjunction with the Offer. RCL’s proposal will now have the effect of increasing the aggregate cash distribution by some £40 million, the cost of which will be borne by RCL if its Offer is accepted. We believe the terms of our Offer to be fair, particularly bearing in mind not only the existing level of debt within DMGT at a time of increasingly difficult market conditions, but also the restrictions imposed on the operation of the business as part of the settlement with the pension trustees.” Britain’s dominant services sector grew by more than expected last month despite a steep rise in inflationary pressures, according to a survey published as the Bank of England considers raising interest rates. The latest snapshot from the closely watched IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) report showed activity in the services sector, which contributes about 80% to economic growth, gained momentum in October. However, staff shortages and stretched supply chains contributed to a jump in inflationary pressures, with operating expenses and the prices charged by services firms rising at the steepest rate since records began in July 1996. The development comes as Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) wil consider raising interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the Covid pandemic began, amid growing concern over high levels of inflation. Economists said the decision to raise rates from a record low of 0.1% was “on a knife-edge”, with the rate-setting panel likely to take the latest snapshot from the service sector into account....More here. The online casino Sky Vegas offered free “spins” to recovering addicts during the industry’s annual Safer Gambling Week, prompting concern that the messages could trigger relapses. The UK’s Gambling Commission is investigating the incident, which has emerged in the same week that Sky Vegas’s parent company, Flutter, boasted of its improved safer gambling measures. It comes as the UK government finalises proposals to reform the way the industry is regulated, which could include a crackdown on advertising and marketing. The incident, for which Sky Betting and Gaming has apologised, meant people who had voluntarily barred themselves from playing slots and online games such as roulette received promotional emails. One email, sent on Tuesday, carried the subject line: “Take a peek at what your mystery bonus is.” It read: “Here at Sky Vegas, we love the unexpected. That’s right. Simply opt in, spend £5 and claim your 100 free spins. The best part? Whatever you win is yours to keep – that’s the fun in fair!” The promotional message featured graphics of slot machines and the slogan: “Entertainment like no other”. Here’s the full story: BMW earned bigger profits than expected in the third quarter of 2021 after a focus on more expensive cars and electric vehicles helped the German premium carmaker to ride out a global shortage of computer chips. Profits before tax rose to €3.4bn (£2.9bn) between July and September, a 38% increase compared with 2020 and a 52% increase on 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, BMW said on Wednesday. BMW achieved the profit rise in spite of a 12% year-on-year decline in overall vehicle sales to 593,000, as it switched production to higher-margin cars such as the x7 sport utility vehicle. Revenues rose by 4.5% to €27bn. Carmakers have been caught out during the global shortages of computer chips, which are made from semiconductors, as demand for electronics soared after the short-lived plunge as the coronavirus first hit. Carmakers rely increasingly on computer chips to control everything from air conditioning to electric car batteries but they cut orders in anticipation of lower sales, leaving them exposed when sales recovered. Oliver Zipse, BMW’s chief executive, said the company was “overcoming difficult situations”, including the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic and the situation with semiconductor supplies. More here: Here’s more reaction to the rise in US private payrolls, from Oxford Economics’ Greg Daco. This encouraging economic news comes a day after Joe Biden’s Democrats lost the race for the governorship of Virginia. Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory has highlighted unhappiness over the pace of the US recovery, which has slowed this autumn, with hiring weak in recent months. Michael Pearce, Senior US Economist at Capital Economics, says the easing of Delta wave infections lifted job creation, including the 185,000 rise in leisure and hospitality payrolls. The ADP report also only captures private payrolls, so it tells us little about what happened to public education payrolls in October following the more than 150,000 decline in September in seasonally adjusted terms. Even so, the data do suggest some upside risk to our below-consensus forecast that the official figures will show a 300,000 gain in non-farm payrolls [on Friday]. Either way, the big story in the labour market is the worsening shortages that are pushing up wage growth. All the evidence suggests those shortages are worsening thanks to the imposition of vaccine mandates, with 9,000 New York City workers (around 2.5% of the total) being put on unpaid leave this week. In the US, companies added more jobs than expected last month. Private payroll operator ADP reports that employment rose by 571,000 in October, ahead of forecasts for a 400,000 gain. Services firms across the United States hired 458,000 more workers, while goods producers took on 113,000 more staff. Leisure &amp; Hospitality drove the hiring, with 185,000 new jobs. Trade, Transportation &amp; Utilities added 78,000 employees, while Professional &amp; Business payrolls expanded by 88,000 That could indicate that Friday’s non-farm payroll (the official employment report) will be strong, except the two surveys don’t always align very well. Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment at interactive investor, explains: Friday’s non-farm payrolls report is expected to see 450,000 jobs added in October, a sharp increase from last month’s meagre 194,000 gain, which was the lowest reading of the year and sharply below market consensus for a gain of 500,000. September’s figure was weighed down by a sharp drop in public sector employment, with private payrolls actually increasing 317,000. Although the Fed will no doubt be paying close attention to this week’s labour market figures, a single data point is unlikely to change the central bank’s course of action, with the likelihood remaining for the Fed to cut its Treasury bond buying by $10bn per month and downsize its mortgage-backed security purchases by $5bn a month, starting this month and winding up the entire stimulus programme by June. There’s a sense of ebullience in the markets this week with the Dow topping 36,000 for the first time driven by strong corporate earnings and a feeling that the economic recovery is strong enough to warrant tapering from the Fed. US futures are pointing to a flat open with the Nasdaq poised for some slight outperformance while the Dow looks set for some profit taking after yesterday’s record high. Reminder, we get the Federal Reserve’s decision at 6pm UK time... Online ticketing platform Trainline has seen passenger bookings bounce back after the easing of lockdown rules and today announced plans to hire 150 staff to fuel its growth in Europe. Despite reporting a sales recovery, its shares are down by 10% – the biggest FTSE 250 faller so far today. There may be a tough climb ahead after the government’s announcement in May that a new state-owned body called Great British Railways will sell tickets in England, a railway shakeup that could threaten Trainline’s dominance in the booking arena. The group’s net ticket sales have jumped to £1bn, reaching 54% of its pre-Covid levels in the six months to September. Trainline posted revenues of £78m, up from £31m a year earlier, with leisure travel and the recovery of commuter journeys leading the surge. The firm, which sells about 70% of its digital train tickets in the UK, narrowed its interim pre-tax losses to £10.3m from £44.7m a year ago. Chief executive Jody Ford said: “Our consumer business returned to growth in August versus pre-Covid levels, with train travellers increasingly opting for digital tickets.” The company has invested in two-click commuter bookings and integration into Google Maps. The share of e-ticket sales as a proportion of total UK consumer sales have doubled in the last 18 months to 40%, reported Trainline. Ford said the firm sees a “significant growth opportunity” in Europe, as ticket demand in its top four domestic markets – France, Italy, Germany, Spain – returns to growth. The owner of the IKEA furniture brand has warned it will raise prices due to the supply chain crisis and higher raw material costs, after rising costs hit its profits. Pretax profit at Inter IKEA Group - which owns the brand and supplies products to its franchises - fell 16% in the 12 months to August. Earnings were 4% below 2019 levels, despite strong demand as people spend more time at home due to the pandemic. Privately-held Inter IKEA said in its annual summary that: “The global pandemic affected our operating income in FY21. The biggest cause was the steep increase in transport and raw material prices in the second half of the financial year,” Inter IKEA also warned that supply chain problems will also hit operations in the current financial year (to August 2022): Keeping IKEA stores and warehouses stocked has been a challenge. Supply chain disruptions led to a substantial drop in the availability of products that we have yet to recover from. We expect this will continue far into FY22,” Reuters has more details here: IKEA owner sees cost pressures rising after hit to profits There’s stronger demand for workers across the eurozone too, where unemployment has hit a pandemic low. The euro area jobless rate dropped to 7.4% in September, down from 7.5% in August 2021 and 8.6% a year ago. That’s the lowest since the first wave of Covid-19 led to lockdowns last spring. Unemployment in the eurozone dropped by 255,000 during the month, and by 1.9m over the last year, as the reopening of economies thanks to vaccine rollouts boosted growth. However, Eurostat estimates that 14.324 million men and women in the EU, including 12.079 million in the euro area, were unemployed in September 2021. Youth unemployment across the eurozone also fell to a pandemic low, but remained high at 16% with 2.3 million under-25s in the euro area out of work. Staff shortages are also forcing meat processors in Great Britain to export carcasses destined for domestic consumption to the EU for butchering. Beef producers are exporting carcasses to Ireland for butchering and packing, says Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, before the products are brought back to Great Britain to be sold in supermarkets. Meanwhile, pork processors are looking into shipping pig carcasses to the Netherlands to be butchered, as first reported by the Financial Times. This is despite the government announcing a post-Brexit immigration policy U-turn last month that would temporarily extend the seasonal worker visa scheme to include pork butchers.... More here: Although demand did pick up in October, UK service sector firms face ‘burgeoning cost pressures’, says Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. Costs were pushed up by supply-chain challenges and higher wages as companies responded to a shortage of staff, he points out: October’s services PMI rose to a three-month high, providing some reassurance that the economic recovery is far from out of steam. But a record rise in cost pressures pointed to a supply-side still trying to keep pace with demand. More evidence of inflationary impulses building may bolster those MPC members on the verge of voting for higher interest rates in November’s meeting. But tomorrow’s decision still looks to be on a knife-edge. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says rise in activity was partly due to a boom in export orders -- as pandemic savings were spent on holidays and hospitality. But firms are worried that they can’t attract workers, he adds: Escalating business costs remain deeply concerning as salaries rocketed along with fuel and energy costs and material shortages as a result of supply chain disorder. A third of supply chain managers reported stronger job creation as vacancies grew to meet fresh demand, but many struggled to find the right staff from ever-decreasing numbers of job seekers. The seemingly likely rise in interest rates this week may take some of the heat out of the overinflating UK economy but will also result in additional pressure on some household budgets, threatening to cut off this stream of good fortune early next year.” Growth across the UK’s service sector accelerated last month, as a rise in new business boosted companies - and forced some firms to hike wages to attract staff from their rivals. The latest survey of purchasing managers from IHS Markit has found a “sharp and accelerated rise” in business activity at service firms during October. This was driven by the strongest increase in new work since June. Markit’s PMI survey found: The fastest rise in business activity for three months Cost inflation accelerates to its strongest in over 25 years Average prices charged by firms also increased at survey-record pace Service PMI rose to 59.1 in October, up from 55.4 in September, showing the fastest recovery since July The reopening of the economy and looser international travel restrictions helped to boost demand, with new export sales rising at the fastest pace for just over three years. But inflationary pressures kept mounting - which will concern the Bank of England as it deliberates whether to raise UK interest rates tomorrow. Firms tried to juggle strong demand, shortages of staff and stretched supply chains last month -- which drove up their costs, and their own prices, at the fastest rates since the survey began in July 1996. Around 30% of firms reported an increase in employment numbers during October, while only 13% signalled a reduction - which suggests the second-fastest rise in workforce levels since June 2014. There was exceptionally strong demand in the hospitality, leisure and transportation sectors, following the relaxation of pandemic restrictions this year. And some firms blamed a decline in employment on “unusually high staff turnover due to higher wages on offer from competitors”. Some bosses also said it was extremely hard to find candidates to fill vacancies, despite efforts to boost starting salaries and conditions. A survey earlier this week found that almost a quarter of workers are actively planning to change employers in the next few months, in a “great resignation” prompted by a high number of vacancies and pandemic burnout. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says the UK service sector emerged from its recent malaise, but staff shortages remain a challenge - as workers quit for higher pay elsewhere. Many consumer service providers commented on unfilled vacancies after staff departures for higher wages, despite efforts to boost pay and conditions. The impact of staff shortages was another rise in backlogs of work and greater willingness to pass on higher costs to new customers. Business confidence fell to its lowest since July, as inflation hit optimism, Moore adds: Comments from survey respondents also cited worries about prolonged staff shortages and constraints on growth due to the supply chain crisis. In other property news, Land Securities has taken a 75% stake in MediaCity, the biggest tech and media hub outside London. The 37-acre mixed-use site in Greater Manchester houses BBC North and ITV, alongside companies including Kellogg’s and Ericsson, with around 8,000 residents and workers at MediaCity. Landsec is paying £425.6m (£207.6m cash, plus taking on existing debt) for the three-quarter share. MediaCity’s ‘Phase one’ development was completed 10 years ago, and LandSec says it will invest in the site’s Phase 2 expansion. Although the deal isn’t huge, it’s interesting to see a commercial landlord focusing on mixed-use developments, and regions outside London, as the UK economy rebalances post-pandemic. Earlier this week, Landsec announced it’s buying urban regeneration specialist U + I for around £190m. Oli Creasey, head of property fund research at Quilter Cheviot, says: Historically, LandSec has been known as a London Office &amp; UK retail REIT, but new CEO Mark Allan has already outlined a change in strategic direction for the business, further shrinking the retail portfolio and investing more into mixed use development projects. “LandSec already has a number of these projects on the books, but both of the REIT’s acquisitions this week come with further opportunities: the £750m second phase of development at MediaCity, plus a number of sites in the U and I portfolio. “Of further interest is the spotlight on Greater Manchester. As well as MediaCity, one of the largest and most progressed sites in the U and I portfolio is Mayfield in Manchester, which has an estimated value of £1.5bn once completed. Both are mixed use – largely office and residential – and represent a departure from the company’s London focus. All five of their existing urban development opportunities are based in London. “It remains to be seen whether the move North is specifically targeting Manchester, or other major cities generally, or indeed whether it is purely a coincidence. But we are encouraged to see that the company is putting its money to work and putting the new strategy into action. We acknowledge that both acquisitions will take time to bear fruit, but the gains could be significant for the patient investor.” Here’s our news story on how average UK house prices defied expectations and continued to climb last month... despite the phasing out of the government’s stamp duty holiday. But as Nationwide points out, the outlook is unclear, with the path of interest rates, consumer confidence and employment levels all likely to influence the market... Over in Glasgow, UK chancellor Rishi Sunak has been outlining his plans to “rewire the entire financial system” to help protect the climate. He told the Cop26 conference that the UK will become the world’s first ever net zero aligned financial centre. Under the proposals, UK financial institutions and listed companies must publish their net zero transition plans, showing how they will adapt and decarbonise as the UK moves towards to a net zero economy by 2050. United States Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has told Cop that the US is joining the UK in backing a new capital market mechanism that will issue investment-grade green bonds to support clean energy and sustainable infrastructure in emerging markets. Our liveblog has more details: The UK has also announced that over $130 trillion – 40% of the world’s financial assets – will now be aligned with the climate goals in the Paris Agreement, thanks to climate commitments from financial services firms. Pets at Home is looking for someone new to hold the reins, after CEO Peter Pritchard announced he’ll step down next summer. Pritchard, 51, has led the business since 2018 and been with Pets at Home since 2011. He says it’s time for a change: “Having completed everything that I set out to achieve in 2018, next summer is the right time to take well-earned rest and to hand over the reins to a new leader who will continue this journey in becoming the best petcare business in the world.” Pets at Home have benefitted from the surge in interest in furry, feathered and scaly friends in the pandemic. Annual sales broke through the £1bn barrier for the first time in the year to the end of March. And today, it reports that the UK pet market “remains robust”, with continued strong trading in the last six months despite the easing of lockdown restrictions. It now predicts underlying pre-tax profit for the 53 weeks to 31 March 2022 will be at the top end of the current range of analyst expectations, ahead of its previous guidance. Shares are down 2%, away from the record highs seen in September. Shares in cyber-defence firm Darktrade have dropped by over 5%, extending their recent slump, after one of its largest shareholders sold a third of their stake. Vitruvian Partners, the London-based private-equity firm, sold around 11m Darktrace shares last night - trimming its stake from 4.5% to 3%. The move came as the lock-up preventing insiders selling their stakes in the recently floated company lifted. Vitruvian sold its stake for 580p each. This morning, Darktrace shares are trading around £6, the lowest since late August. The Cambridge-based firm, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically detect, investigate and respond to cyberthreats in real time, floated at 250p at the end of April: They briefly hit £10 in September, but slumped last month after City firm Peel Hunt questioned its sky-high valuation. Peel Hunt rated Darktrace as a ‘sell’, with a target price of 473p, citing the “potential market size, the intensifying competition, and Darktrace’s limited R&amp;D spend”. Retail chain Next has beaten expectations again, thanks to strong demand from online shoppers. But the company also warns that rising inflation and supply chain disruption will weigh on sales growth. Full price sales in the last three months (to 30th October) jumped by 17% compared with two years ago, Next reports. That includes a 14% rise in the last five weeks - ahead of its forecast of 10% growth. This puts Next on track to hit its target of £800m profits this year. Internet shopping continued to drive sales growth - up 40% in August-October compared with two years ago. But, the retailer also predicts that sales growth in the current quarter will slow, because: The effects of pent-up demand are likely to continue to diminish. Stock availability has improved but remains challenging, with delays in our international supply chain being compounded by labour shortages in the UK transport and warehousing networks. However, to date, stock limitations appear to be offset by strong underlying demand. Although consumer finances are in good shape, price increases in essential goods (such as fuel) may moderate demand for more discretionary purchases. So it’s sticking with its forecast of 10.2% full-price sales growth in Q4. The £14m of extra sales in the last five weeks generated an extra £4m of profit. However, it will be largely swallowed up by further digital marketing spending, and extra distribution costs. That will include more inbound air freight (as retailers try to cope with the delays and transport problems at the ports). Shares in Next have dropped 3% in early trading (but are still up 15% this year, having ridden out the pandemic relatively well). Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd says Next faces a dilemma: Next beat its sales forecast by £14m, but was quick to bring investor hopes back down to earth. It won’t be hiking up profit guidance, pointing some fingers at increased costs for digital marketing, air freight and online distribution. Herein lies its double-edged sword: the better Next does at selling the products its customers love, the messier things get. Next shoppers prefer its website to the store, but scattered warehouses render that a costlier supply chain to manage. Transporting those goods is putting a dent in Next’s bottom line too, and there’s hardly enough labour to move those products to begin with. So as Next gears up for the holiday season, it’s got a decision on its hands. Should it ease up on marketing pushes to let stock issues iron themselves out? Or should it push full steam ahead and kick the snarled supply chain can down the line? Guy Gittins, CEO of estate agent Chestertons, reports that last month was busy: In October we witnessed a 22% uplift in the number of offers being made and a 26% increase in agreed sales compared to September. The sustained demand is reducing the supply of properties for sale, which in turn is driving prices higher. This is providing further motivation for people to move before the house they want to buy becomes more expensive. “Generally, at this point of year, we expect buyer enquiries to tail off but we are seeing the opposite. At the end of last month, we recorded our highest ever number of new buyer enquiries registering with Chestertons at this time of year, which was 18% higher than this time last year when, we already had the added urgency and incentive of the Stamp Duty Holiday. We saw demand being driven by buyers who didn’t manage to agree a deal within that timeframe and those who put their search on hold during the summer break. “Looking ahead, we expect the anticipated small increase in interest rates (likely to be announced tomorrow), to spur more buyers to finalise their property search sooner rather than later in order to benefit from the currently more favourable rates.” An interest rate rise would hit borrowers once their current fixed-term mortgages end. Our Money editor Hilary Osborne explained last week, the era of record low mortgage rates could be over, with the government’s independent forecasters predicting costs will rise rapidly over the next two years. Inflation predictions from the Office for Budget Responsibility released alongside Wednesday’s budget, suggest that the cost of servicing a mortgage could grow by 5.6% next year and 13.1% the year after, as increases in the Bank of England base rate are passed on to borrowers. According to financial firm AJ Bell, if the predictions are correct, someone who borrowed £250,000 on a two-year fixed-rate mortgage at 2.06% earlier this year could see their annual payments jump by £600 when they go to remortgage in 2023. Someone with £450,000 of borrowing, on the same terms, would see their costs rise by £1,068 a year. Here’s Bloomberg’s Lizzy Burden on Nationwide’s house price data: Some buyers have been rushing to secure a house purchase, and a fixed-rate mortgage, before interest rates start to rise, says Lucy Pendleton, property expert at independent estate agents James Pendleton: “The market remains solid because there are still plenty of reasons to buy now rather than wait. “We may be a month on from the end of the stamp duty tax break but a near-certain string of interest rate rises over the next 18 months is proving to be a far more powerful motivation to transact than the stamp duty holiday ever was. “Concerns over rising inflation have eclipsed the handout as a key driver of demand and you don’t have to be a genius to figure out that locking in an attractive 10-year mortgage rate now may be the best financial decision you ever make. First-time buyers are particularly eager to do so. Having only ever known rock-bottom interest rates, there’s a little fear of the unknown incentivising them to act quickly now. “Buyers are also always reluctant to hold out for a softening in prices that may never appear and that’s shining through in behaviour on the doorstep at the moment. Even if wider economic conditions continue to improve, a rise in UK interest rates may cool the market, Nationwide suggests. However, the building society argues the impact on existing borrowers is likely to be modest, as the “vast majority of new mortgages” have been extended on fixed interest rates in recent years. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, says: The share of outstanding mortgages on variable interest rates (and which are therefore likely to see an increase in payments if Bank Rate is increased) has fallen to its lowest level on record, at c20%, down from a peak of 70% in 2001 and c60% in 2011. Moreover, even a 0.4% increase in rates (to 0.5%) is likely to have a modest impact on most borrowers who are on variable rates. For example, on the average mortgage, an interest rate increase of 0.4% would raise monthly payments by £28 to £625 (equivalent to c£335 extra per year), though a rise of Bank Rate by 0.9% (to 1%) would see typical payments go up by a more substantial £64 to £660 (an extra c£765 per year). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK house price have hit fresh record highs, despite the prospect of the Bank of England raising interest rates in response to rising inflation. Lender Nationwide reports that the price of the average house rose by 0.7% in October, up from 0.2% in September, extending the surge in prices since the first Covid-19 lockdowns ended last year. The annual growth rate remained elevated at 9.9% in October, slightly lower than 10% a month earlier. It means the average property price has risen by more than £30k since the pandemic hit early in 2020. That lifts the price of a typical UK home over the £250,000 mark for the first time on Nationwide’s index (although the broader Land Registry data showed the average UK house price was £264,000 in August). Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said demand for homes remained strong, despite the stamp duty holiday finishing at the end of September. Indeed, mortgage applications remained robust at 72,645 in September, more than 10% above the monthly average recorded in 2019. Combined with a lack of homes on the market, this helps to explain why price growth has remained robust. Gardner warns, though that the outlook remains “extremely uncertain”, as the government withdraws some of the pandemic support such as the job retention scheme (which ended a month ago). If the labour market remains resilient, conditions may stay fairly buoyant in the coming months – especially as the market continues to have momentum and there is scope for ongoing shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic to continue to support activity. “However, a number of factors suggest the pace of activity may slow. It is still unclear how the wider economy will respond to the withdrawal of government support measures. Consumer confidence has weakened in recent months, partly as a result of a sharp increase in the cost of living. The Bank of England will announce tomorrow whether it is lifting UK interest rates from their current record low of 0.1%, with some policymakers concerned that inflation is heading over 4% (twice its target), in the coming months. Also coming up today Investors around the world are bracing for tonight’s Federal Reserve meeting. America’s central bank is expected to lay out the timetable to slow the pace of its bond-buying stimulus programme, in response to the jump in inflation and the recovery in the jobs market. The Fed is currently pumping $120bn a month into the US economy by buying government bonds (Treasury bills) and mortgage-backed securities; and could start to ‘taper’ those purchases by buying less each month. Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, says: In what may be the best (and longest) advertised meaningful policy shift, the FOMC will announce tapering at the coming meeting. Our economists expect the Committee to start with a reduction of $10bn in Treasuries and $5bn in MBS. As the Fed has been suggesting, at this pace it would finish right around midyear. Of course, the taper will come with all of the caveats one would expect: the Fed reserves the right to adjust the pace given economic conditions, etc. But we also note this flexibility can work both ways, with the flexibility to taper more quickly to an earlier end if data point that way. Don’t be surprised to hear Powell say during the presser (if it’s not inserted into the statement) that while “substantial further progress” has been achieved for taper, there is a different set of criteria for the nebulous terms to be achieved as it relates to hiking. We also find out how services companies across the UK, eurozone and US fared last month.

          "headline": "Senate Republicans again block key voting rights bill ",
          "bodyText": "Republicans in the US Senate again blocked a significant voting rights bill from advancing on Wednesday, a move many see as a breaking point in the push to get rid of the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. The bill – the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – is one of two major pieces of voting rights legislation Democrats are championing in Congress in an effort to fend off attempts across the US by Republicans to erode easy access to the vote. Those efforts often most affect communities of color. The measure, approved by the US House in August, would have implemented a formula at the heart of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required certain places, where there was repeated evidence of voting discrimination over the last 25 years, to get any voting changes pre-cleared by the federal government. The US supreme court struck down a previous version of the formula in 2013, saying it was outdated, a widely criticized ruling that civil rights groups say opened the door to voting discrimination. There was never any serious prospect of the bill passing – only one Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, supported it. The vote in the Senate was 50-49 in favor of advancing the bill. But Wednesday’s vote was targeted towards Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who supports the filibuster, showing him that passing voting rights legislation is not possible while the filibuster remains in place. Many Democrats hope it will be the final straw for Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, who is also a staunch defender of the filibuster. Republicans have successfully filibustered voting rights bill three times already this year, including once just two weeks ago. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said Wednesday’s filibuster was a “low, low point in the history of this body”. He continued to suggest Democrats would consider options for getting rid of the filibuster, saying they would “explore whatever path” was needed to restore the Senate to its status as a deliberative body. He said the gears of Congress’s upper chamber had “ossified” and that Democrats were committed to continuing to push forward on voting rights “even if it means going at it alone”. Nineteen states enacted nearly three dozen laws that make it harder to vote between January and the end of September, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice. While the John Lewis bill would not necessarily have blocked all of them, it would have required some states, including Florida, Georgia and Texas, to get their policies reviewed before they were implemented. “For the fourth time this year, Republicans have filibustered federal voting rights legislation. Whether it’s the original version of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, the substitute amendment backed by Senator Murkowski, or other good faith legislative efforts to forge compromise and deliver on federal voting rights legislation, it’s crystal clear that Senator Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans will weaponize the filibuster to block progress,” said Eli Zupnik, a spokesman for Fix Our Senate, which supports getting rid of the filibuster. “Our question now to President Biden and Senate Democrats is this: what are you going to do about it?” . There is increasing urgency for Democrats to pass both the John Lewis measure and the Freedom to Vote Act, the other major voting rights legislation that aims to outlaw excessive partisan gerrymandering and would require early voting, no-excuse mail-in voting, as well as automatic and same-day registration. State lawmakers are quickly passing new electoral districts that weaken the votes of minority voters and are distorted to lock in partisan advantages for the next decade. Democrats are also largely expected to lose control of the US House of Representatives next November. Democrats have already started to escalate the pressure. Joe Biden gave a strong public endorsement of changing the rule last month for voting rights legislation “and maybe more”. But it’s unclear whether Manchin and Sinema, who have largely stymied Democratic ambitions in Congress so far, will budge. Manchin has indicated he does not support a filibuster carve out for voting rights legislation. Civil rights groups have been pressing Democrats for months to get rid of the filibuster to pass voting reforms, publicly voicing their frustration that the White House isn’t putting enough political muscle behind the issue. Dozens of activists, including the son of Martin Luther King Jr were arrested outside the White House demonstrating ahead of the vote on Wednesday. “Don’t take the Black vote for granted. Don’t torpedo our democracy. Our future depends on the restoration of voting rights for all,” said Derrick Johnson, the president and CEO of the NAACP. “Those who made campaign promises to the Black community must use any means possible to ensure that this Congress gets it done. The urgency of this issue cannot be overstated. We are watching.” “We have had moments of bipartisanship on voting rights in our nation’s history, but sadly, this is not one of them. The only way to protect the freedom to vote is to end the filibuster,” said Sean Eldridge, the president of Stand Up America, and one of the people arrested on Wednesday. “The King family and civil rights leaders from across the country came to the White House today because President Biden has the largest soapbox on the planet, and we’re asking him to use it to protect voting rights before it’s too late.”"

          "headline": "Javid’s hard line on making NHS staff in England get jabbed may pay off",
          "bodyText": "Forcing NHS staff in England by law to get vaccinated against Covid-19 if they want to keep their jobs is another example of the sometimes radical approach being taken by a health secretary who appears not to be scared of upsetting workers on the frontline with a notably muscular insistence on pushing through policies they oppose. GPs have already discovered this with Sajid Javid’s edict that they have to see in person any patient who wants a face-to-face appointment. Ministers have been discussing the pros and cons of compulsory Covid jabs for health staff since the spring. The proposal has triggered everything from unease to alarm to outright condemnation among organisations representing NHS personnel. Many, though not all, have opposed it. The Royal College of Nursing has “significant concerns”. The GMB has decried it as “an incredibly bad idea”. The British Medical Association has warned of the potential minefield of “legal, ethical and practical” issues involved. Hospital bosses and others have warned that the exodus of frontline workers the forced jabs could trigger would be “devastating for patient services”, especially given the health service is already short of 93,000 doctors, nurses and other staff – and especially if compulsion were to be introduced before winter, when the NHS comes under its most intense strain. However, while controversial, the principle of compulsion is not new or unique to Britain. Other countries such as France, Italy and Greece are already telling health workers to get jabbed or risk losing their jobs, as are some hospitals in the US. Why is Javid taking such a tough approach? People in organisations and staff groups that have discussed the proposal with the Department of Health do not sense that Javid is motivated by what they characterise as his hardman approach to the NHS, which has included threatening to sack bosses of hospitals that fail to cut the backlog of elective operations and “name and shame” GP practices that see too few patients face to face. When in September he announced a public consultation on the plan, he stressed one guiding principle: patient safety – to “do what we can” to protect patients in hospital from getting infected with Covid by anyone treating them. “It’s so clear to see the impact vaccines have against respiratory viruses which can be fatal to the vulnerable,” he said. The many thousands of patients who have died after succumbing to hospital-acquired Covid illustrate the risks involved in staff remaining unvaccinated. It was likely even in September that mandatory jabs would be brought in, and Javid himself said only last week that compulsion remained the “direction of travel”. About 58% of hospital chiefs support compulsion, according to a recent survey of 172 NHS trust leaders by NHS Providers. However, it also found that 90% feared it could lead to staff quitting, thereby exacerbating widespread rota gaps. If the health secretary has indeed listened carefully to the pleas from NHS Providers and the NHS Confederation, which also represents trusts, and as a result decided to delay implementation until April 2022, that would help the health service get through the winter and also give time for the policy to settle in, and potentially change the minds of NHS staff who have so far not got vaccinated. When mandatory jabs for care home workers were unveiled in June, trade unions and other voices in the social care sector said it could prompt many staff to leave. Almost 13,000 have. But over the same five months the proportion of care home personnel who have been double-vaccinated has risen significantly, from 71.4% to 88.5%. So compulsion works – maybe. In an opinion piece on Tuesday in the BMJ, Daniel Sokol, a barrister and expert in medical ethics, pointed out that in France “the new law on mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers led to a massive boost in vaccination rates, from 60% in July (when the new requirement was announced) to over 99% in October”. Might the same big rise in take-up be seen among NHS staff? Javid, whose stance is backed by public opinion, seems to be gambling that it will, that the sceptics will be proved wrong and that patients will be safer as a result."

          "bodyText": "“Progress in AI is something that will take a while to happen, but [that] doesn’t make it science fiction.” So Stuart Russell, the University of California computing professor, told the Guardian at the weekend. The scientist said researchers had been “spooked” by their own success in the field. Prof Russell, the co-author of the top artificial intelligence (AI) textbook, is giving this year’s BBC’s Reith lectures – which have just begun – and his doubts appear increasingly relevant. With little debate about its downsides, AI is becoming embedded in society. Machines now recommend online videos to watch, perform surgery and send people to jail. The science of AI is a human enterprise that requires social limitations. The risks, however, are not being properly weighed. There are two emerging approaches to AI. The first is to view it in engineering terms, where algorithms are trained on specific tasks. The second presents deeper philosophical questions about the nature of human knowledge. Prof Russell engages with both these perspectives. The former is very much pushed by Silicon Valley, where AI is deployed to get products quickly to market and problems dealt with later. This has led to AI “succeeding” even when the goals aren’t socially acceptable and they are pursued with little accountability. The pitfalls of this approach are highlighted by the role YouTube’s algorithm plays in radicalising people, given that there is no public understanding of how it works. Prof Russell argues, reasonably, for a system of checks where machines can pause and “ask” for human guidance, and for regulations to deal with systemic biases. The academic also backs global adoption of EU legislation that would ban impersonation of humans by machines. Computers are getting closer to passing, in a superficial way, the Turing test – where machines attempt to trick people into believing they are communicating with other humans. Yet human knowledge is collective: to truly fool humans a computer would have to be able to grasp mutual understandings. OpenAI’s GPT-3, probably the best non-human writer ever, cannot comprehend what it spews. When Oxford scientists put it – and similar AIs – to the test this year, they found the machines produced false answers to questions that “mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive”. It so troubled one of OpenAI’s own researchers that no one knew how such language is being made that he left to set up an AI safety lab. Some argue that AI can already produce new insights that humans have missed. But human intelligence is much more than an algorithm. Inspiration strikes when a brilliant thought arises that can’t be explained as a logical consequence of preceding steps. Einstein’s theory of general relativity cannot be derived from observations of that age – it was experimentally proven only decades later. Human beings can also learn a new task by being shown how to do it only a few times. Machines, so far, cannot. Currently, AI can be prompted – but not prompt itself – into action. Ajeya Cotra, a tech analyst with the US-based Open Philanthropy Project, reckoned a computer that could match the human brain might arrive by 2052 (and come with a $1tn price tag). We need to find better ways to build it. Humans are stumbling into an era when the more powerful the AI system, the harder it is to explain its actions. How can we tell if a machine is acting on our behalf and not acting contrary to our interests? Such questions ought to give us all pause for thought."

          "bodyText": "Cop26 is “the last chance saloon” to save the world from runaway climate change, Prince Charles has told world leaders in Rome ahead of the crucial climate summit in Glasgow. Speaking to an audience including Boris Johnson on the sidelines of the gathering of the G20 group of industrialised nations, Charles said it was the moment to begin a green-led economic turnaround. “Ladies and gentlemen, Cop26 begins in Glasgow tomorrow,” Charles said. “Quite literally, it is the last chance saloon. We must now translate fine words into still finer actions. “And as the enormity of the climate challenge dominates people’s conversations, from newsrooms to living rooms, and as the future of humanity and nature herself are at stake, it is surely time to set aside our differences and grasp this unique opportunity to launch a substantial green recovery by putting the global economy on a confident, sustainable trajectory and, thus, save our planet. “And, from what they tell me, the private sector is already there, eager to work with you and ready to play a hugely significant and gamechanging role. This is why I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you here today, and to shine a light not just on how far we’ve come, but also on how far we still need to go.” Charles’s intervention came as Johnson prepared to greet more than 120 world leaders at the start of the two-week Cop gathering on Monday, with the UK prime minister using much of his time at the G20 event to push home a similar message that concerted global action is required. On his way to Rome on Friday, Johnson told reporters that the success of Cop remained in the balance, likening the world’s struggle against the climate emergency to a football team losing 5-1 at half-time. In comments on Saturday, Johnson said a lack of progress in Glasgow could prompt “very difficult geopolitical events” including mass migration and global competition for food and water. In his speech, Charles stressed what he called “our overwhelming responsibility to generations yet unborn”, saying he detected a change in attitudes and “the buildup of positive momentum”. Highlighting the need for the private sector to also tackle the issue, Charles said it would need trillions of dollars of investment every year to limit warming to the target maximum of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “No government has those sorts of sums, which is why I have spent so much time over the past 19 months trying to form a global alliance amongst the private sector, as I have long believed it holds the ultimate key to the solutions we seek,” he said. Governments in turn needed to provide long-term leadership on the issue, as well as regulatory and financial support, he added."

          "bodyText": "The Coalition’s “technology not taxes” plan for net zero emissions by 2050 could cost taxpayers much more than the $20bn allocated by the Morrison government. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday that more will need to be spent beyond 2030 to reach the target. He confirmed the “run rate of the money we are spending over the next decade is what we would expect into the future”, as further spending on research, development and carbon credits would probably be needed. The comments come as Scott Morrison defended Australia’s opposition to language in a draft G20 communique committing nations to “phase out and rationalise” fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and to curb coal power. As the G20 summit moves into its final day, some countries are seeking strong language around combating the threat of global heating in the final communique of the Rome summit as a positive harbinger for the Cop26 in Glasgow. The United Nations-led climate summit begins in Scotland on Monday. The British prime minister Boris Johnson, who is the host of the gathering, has urged leaders to come to Glasgow with serious commitments. On the eve of the summit, Johnson warned that a failure to act could prompt “very difficult geopolitical events”, including mass migration and global competition for food and water. According to an early draft copy of the G20 communique obtained by the Reuters news agency, leaders were working towards a statement at the conclusion of the summit that will reaffirm a commitment to “phase out and rationalise” fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 and to curb coal power. The draft communique said leaders will “do their utmost” to avoid building new unabated coal plants. But it adds the phrase “taking national circumstances into account”. It also characterised achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 as an issue of “key relevance”. Morrison signalled on his arrival in Rome that Australia would have a significant problem with communique language hastening the demise of the coal industry. China and India are also among the countries said to be opposed. The prime minister was asked whether Australia’s resistance to the G20 communique language would make life more difficult for his friend Johnson, who has campaigned to make Cop26 a success. Without engaging on the detail, which he said was “being worked through by the sherpas”, Morrison declared individual countries were entitled to pursue their own interests. “There is quite a large group of nations that hold similar concerns about this and we will see where this lands in the next few days,” Morrison told reporters. Asked whether the G20 communique should state that achieving net zero emissions by 2050 should be a common aspiration, Morrison said: “We’ll speak for ourselves.” Morrison said Johnson had welcomed Australia’s commitment to net zero emissions, and he said Australia’s technology driven approach to emissions reduction was gaining traction, particularly in developing countries. Taylor won’t detail full cost of net zero plan Taylor said that “the whole purpose of the plan is to avoid imposing costs on Australians” by spending $20bn by 2030 on technologies including clean hydrogen, low-emissions steel and aluminium, soil carbon and carbon capture and storage. Asked for the full cost to 2050, Taylor said that “future governments will allocate as they see fit into the 2030s and 2040s” but the government expects that the same “run rate” of spending is “what we would expect into the future”. Despite the cost of at least $20bn, or up to $60bn implied by his answer, Taylor claimed that “taxpayers are not paying anything, we are not raising taxes”. Taylor confirmed the plan includes an extra $2bn to be spent on carbon offsets through the rebadged emissions reduction fund, citing the “potential for high-integrity offsets with our neighbours in the Pacific”. Taylor confirmed he had spoken in Rome to Mathias Cormann, the former finance minister who in his new role as head of the OECD has called for Australia and others to adopt a carbon price. He said there was “absolutely no plan” to change Australia’s 2030 target, as voters had endorsed the 26-28% reduction at the last election. Officials say Morrison will use Cop26 to pursue new measures ensuring that developing nations have the opportunity to reduce their emissions through technology. Meanwhile, acting prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, confirmed elements of the Nationals net zero deal including: counting carbon credits as farm income for improved tax treatment; a regional future fund of unknown size; and excluding scope three emissions from the target. Joyce told Sky News scope three emissions – which could count coal burned overseas to the Australian target – were “basically double counting”. He said the future fund was intended to create a “parallel income that is growing” as thermal coal exports are “toning down or fading off”, ensuring “people … can go from one mining job to another mining job”. Morrison has signed Australia up to a net zero target, and that commitment will be expressed in the current nationally determined contribution under the Paris agreement. But the focus of the Glasgow summit is ambition in the short and medium term, with a number of countries upgrading their 2030 targets. Under pressure from the UK and the US, the prime minister explored upgrading the Abbott-era 2030 target, but the Nationals vetoed that proposition. Morrison has ruled out taking a new 2030 target to voters at the next federal election."

          "bodyText": "Vera Ryan doesn’t know much about her uncle Jack. Petty officer Jack Messenger was one of 35 men who were on the HMAS AE1 submarine when it sank in the early days of the first world war. But she knows the site of the wreck is an important place, a place of memories for her and the hundred-odd other descendants and families of the Australian and British sailors who died. The location, off the coast of Papua New Guinea, is a secret. But it might not be secret enough to be protected from marauding metal thieves. There are concerns that rising metal prices will prompt more illegal scavenging of Australia’s shipwrecks. For years people have been pillaging wrecks, including those that sank with sailors on board, for metal. Some are worried that trophy hunters will target the AE1, which was found in 2017 after it disappeared in 1914. Australia is struggling to protect wrecks, especially those in foreign territories. “You can’t have a war grave that’s under water,” Ryan says. “But not having that respect for it is very upsetting.” Ryan is the convenor of the AE1 descendant families’ association, which comprises about 100 people related to the 35 men who died when the AE1 went down. Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, who led the search for AE1, says he is concerned the boat will be targeted by trophy hunters. “The families hate the thought of that … to see that there are people who are quite prepared to desecrate the wrecks,” Ryan said. So-called metal pirates are looking for high-value metals (such as bronze propellers or low background steel), souvenirs or just scrap metal. Metal prices are volatile but currently on the rise for a range of reasons. The British naval historian Phil Weir pointed out the connection on Twitter this week. When investigators discovered entire ships had vanished in 2016, it was described as a “perfect storm” of high metal prices and a lack of enforcement of existing rules. Shipwreck expert Ian Macleod says high prices are likely to tempt more people to steal from war sites. People “will do anything for money”, the WA Museum fellow and authority on maritime corrosion and conservation says. “Greed is what motivates people and it’s the job of government to control that greed within their capacity as being responsible for caring for Australian sites.” Macleod points out that Australia has not ratified a Unesco treaty to preserve underwater cultural heritage. “Why can’t you make that commitment? Why don’t you care?” he says. A spokesperson for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the commonwealth was working on ratifying the Unesco convention and that Ley was “due to be briefed on this in the very near future”. “[She] remains mindful of doing what we can to protect underwater cultural heritage,” they said. Macleod says the AE1 is “out of sight, out of mind”, but that there are also wrecks closer to home at risk, such as HMAS Voyager. His brother witnessed the devastating collision between Voyager and HMAS Melbourne off Jervis Bay in 1964, and developed post-traumatic stress disorder in the aftermath. “That’s in Australian territorial waters and essentially there is nothing under the current legislation that protects it,” Macleod says. Macleod says there are a range of ways Australia could better protect shipwrecks, including those outside its territory, with treaties or other coordinated programs. “It’s the least we can do to give peace to the minds of the descendants and direct families of people lost,” he says. The Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018 protects ships and aircraft that were sunk 75 or more years ago, and there are various state laws as well. Ley’s spokesperson said the act protected craft in Australian waters, and allowed the minister to declare shipwrecks outside Australian waters protected from other Australian vessels, when supported by the nearest coastal state. They said the department was consulting PNG about declaring a marine protected zone around the site of AE1. The wreck of second world war cruiser HMAS Perth, which is in Indonesian waters, has already been heavily ransacked. Dr James Hunter, the curator of naval heritage and archaeology at the Australian National Maritime Museum, says that even with legislation, local support is needed to protect sites. “You have to have someone on the ground,” he says. “You need someone at the provincial level, someone who’s right there, who can respond. “And you have to have a good relationship with the foreign government you’re dealing with.” But everything takes money. If that was unlimited, Hunter says, you could use satellites, or cameras attached to buoys, to monitor sites. Ryan’s father was 20 years younger than Jack, the brother who died at sea. Her dad only met Jack a few times before he died, aged 27. She says that for the families of AE1, it seems that the story of the submarine “just disappeared”, lost in the fog of war. But when searches for its final resting place kept going, she says, they all became part of a “submarine family”. “They weren’t lost, they were waiting to be found,” she says. Ryan says it’s not the bodies that are the important part about recognising and protecting the wreck. “It’s important for [the families] to feel that there is a recognition of the place that holds the memory,” she said."

          "bodyText": "As the director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the USDA Nutrition Center Tufts University, Massachusetts, Susan Roberts has spent much of the past two decades studying ways to fight the obesity epidemic that continues to plague much of the western world. But time and again, Roberts and other obesity experts around the globe have found themselves faced with a recurring problem. While getting overweight individuals to commit to shedding pounds is often relatively straightforward in the short term, preventing them from regaining the lost weight is much more challenging. According to the University of Michigan, about 90% of people who lose significant amounts of weight, whether through diets, structured programmes or even drastic steps such as gastric surgery, ultimately regain just about all of it. Why is this? Scientists believe that the answer lies in the workings of our metabolism, the complex set of chemical reactions in our cells, which convert the calories we eat into the energy our body requires for breathing, maintaining organ functions, and generally keeping us alive. When someone begins a new diet, we know that metabolism initially drops – because we are suddenly consuming fewer calories, the body responds by burning them at a slower pace, perhaps an evolutionary response to prevent starvation – but what then happens over the following weeks, months, and years, is less clear. “Does metabolism continue to go down, more than it should,” asks Roberts, “or does it initially go down, and then bounce back? This is an enormously controversial topic, and one that we’re looking to address.” Over the next three to four years, we may get some answers. Roberts is co-leading a new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health in the US, which will follow 100 individuals over the course of many months as they first lose and then regain weight, measuring everything from energy expenditure to changes in the blood, brain and muscle physiology, to try to see what happens. The implications for how we tackle obesity could be enormous. If metabolism drops and continues to stay low during weight loss, it could imply that dieting triggers innate biological changes that eventually compel us to eat more. If it rebounds to normal levels, this suggests that weight regain is due to the recurrence of past bad habits, with social and cultural factors tempting us to go back to overeating. “If someone’s metabolism really drops during weight loss and doesn’t recover, it shows we have to put all of our money on preventing weight gain in the first place,” says Roberts. “Because once it’s happened, you’re doomed. If metabolism rebounds, it means that the lessons about eating less because you’ve now got a smaller body haven’t been learned effectively. So we might need to encourage people who have lost weight to see psychologists to work on habit formation. These are such different conclusions that we really need to get it right.” This is just one of many ways in which our understanding of metabolism is evolving. In recent years, many of the traditional assumptions, which had long been accepted as truth – that exercise can ramp up metabolism, that metabolism follows a steady decline from your 20s onwards – have been challenged. For scientists at the forefront of this field, these answers could go on to change many aspects of public health. The age myth In mid-August, a paper emerged in the journal Science that appeared to challenge one of metabolism’s universal truths. For decades, scientists have accepted that metabolism begins to slow down in early adulthood, initiating a steady descent that continues through middle age and later life, inevitably resulting in the phenomenon known as “middle-aged spread”. But this may not actually be true. Over the past few years, Herman Pontzer, an associate professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke University, North Carolina, and more than 80 other scientists have compiled data from more than 6,400 individuals – from eight days to 95 years old – that shows something very different. It appears that between the ages of 20 and 60 our metabolism stays almost completely stable, even during major hormonal shifts such as pregnancy and menopause. Based on the new data, a woman of 50 will burn calories just as effectively as a woman of 20. Instead, there are just two major life shifts in our metabolism, with the first occurring between one and 15 months old. The Science study showed that infants burn energy at such a rate to support their development that their metabolism at one year old is more than 50% higher than an adult’s. The second transition takes place at about the age of 60, when our metabolism begins to drop again, continuing to do so until we die. “For much of your life, your body’s kind of chugging along on a trajectory for how busy your cells are going to be,” says Pontzer. “Your cells are following a roadmap, and it’s very hard to bump them off that roadmap.” So what does this mean? Much of the ageing process, and the commonly observed middle-aged weight gain, is not because of declining metabolism but genetics, hormone changes and lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep, smoking and, perhaps most crucially, diet. Pontzer argues that if the calories we burn stay largely the same throughout life, then the real source of obesity has to be the amount we’re eating, and particularly the heavy consumption of highly processed foods. Over the years, one of the main marketing tools used to promote different exercise regimes and wellness supplements has been claims that they boost your metabolism. Pontzer says that this is mostly nonsense. Studies that have compared indigenous tribes of hunter-gatherers in northern Tanzania – who walk an average of 19,000 steps a day – with sedentary populations in Europe and the US have found that their total number of calories burned is largely the same. Other studies looking at whether metabolism changes if you put a mouse on an exercise regime, or comparing non-human primates living in a zoo or the rainforest, have found a similar pattern. Some scientists believe that this is because the body is programmed to keep its average daily energy expenditure within a defined range. While there are day-to-day fluctuations, the body still burns the same number of calories overall, but it adjusts how they are used, depending on our lifestyle. To explain the theory, Pontzer gives the example of a keen amateur cyclist who takes part in 100km bike rides at weekends. Overall, that individual still won’t burn more calories on average than a sedentary person, but their average energy expenditure will be skewed towards providing fuel for the muscles. The sedentary person will burn a similar number of calories, but on background bodily functions which we do not notice, including less healthy outlets such as producing inflammation and stress. “I think there is a deep evolutionary reason to this,” says Pontzer. “In the industrialised world, burning more energy than you eat would be great, but in the wild, that’s a bad strategy. The reason we’re gaining weight is not only because there’s more food available than we have evolved to expect, but because they’re modern, industrialised foods, designed to be overeaten. So you’ve got this perfect storm for making people obese.” But these new findings on metabolism are not only changing our understanding of how to tackle obesity: they have ramifications across the world of medicine. Given that metabolism slows markedly beyond the age of 60, doctors now need to know whether older adults should receive slightly different medicinal doses, while the research will prompt questions about the connection between a slower metabolism and the onset of chronic disease in older adults. Individual differences While the Science paper illustrated general population trends for metabolism across the age spectrum, we still know relatively little about individual differences, and what they might represent. Do babies with a particularly rapid metabolism develop quicker and in a better way? And do variations in the environment in which they grow up, such as social deprivation, mean that they have a slightly slower metabolism than their peers? This is all speculation for now, but scientists know that metabolism can still vary significantly from one person to another, even after you account for factors such as size and body composition. We still don’t know exactly why this variation occurs, but there are thought to be a whole range of factors, from genetics to organ sizes, the immune system, and even the species of bacteria in their gut microbiome. Even with the latest digital technologies, it is very difficult for people to track their own metabolic rate. Pontzer says this is because none of the current apps on the market can account for individual differences in resting metabolic rate. However, one of the key questions is whether these variations can confer susceptibility to disease, especially illnesses linked to metabolic dysfunction such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. “There are so many metabolic health conditions,” says Eric Ravussin, director of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at the Pennington Biomedical Research Centre in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. “These are influenced by your diet and your weight. As you gain weight, you’re more likely to have hypertension, you’re more likely to have inflammation.” A whole variety of startups around the world are now investigating ways of using our knowledge of metabolism to assist with developing personalised treatment programmes. Because our gut microbes play such a crucial role in energy metabolism, by breaking down the food we eat, dysfunctional imbalances in the gut microbiome have been linked to the development of a number of metabolic illnesses. Oslo-based Bio-Me is profiling the gut microbiomes of patients with type 2 diabetes, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and certain types of cancer, using DNA sequencing of faecal samples to identify the exact species of bacteria present in their intestines. It can then compare that information with existing microbiome data on that group of patients, available in population biobanks, and use this to predict dietary regimes or treatment interventions that could be particularly beneficial for those individuals. Bio-Me CEO Morten Isaksen says that this can be used to predict whether common medications, such as the diabetes drug metformin, will work well for that particular patient. “It was discovered that metformin only works because the gut bacteria change the medicine into its active form,” says Isaksen. “So if you don’t have the right bacteria in the gut, the medicine won’t work. So knowing which bacteria are present is really important for identifying the right treatments.” Because dysfunctional cell metabolism is central to cancer, determining how tumours form, as well as how fast they grow and spread, indications of metabolic dysfunction could be used for early diagnosis of certain cancers. The Stockholm-based biotech firm Elypta is trialling a system that detects small molecules, known as metabolites, which are produced by kidney cancer cells. In future, this could be used as part of a liquid biopsy for the disease. “Once cancer cells begin to proliferate, what really changes is the metabolic requirements, compared with healthy cells,” says Francesco Gatto, co-founder of Elypta. “So we think we can use this layer of information from metabolism, to help identify multiple types of cancer early in a non-invasive manner.” Pontzer is now planning to follow up the Science study by delving further into the extremes of metabolism, both in the young and the old. “We’re going to try to look at that variability both in very young children and the over-60s,” he says. “We want to try to understand whether in people whose metabolism is changing more or less, or faster or slower, does that predict anything about their health or how their bodies develop? Or maybe it’s not related at all. So we’re going to try to find out these things.”"

          "headline": "Cop26 failure could mean mass migration and food shortages, says Boris Johnson ",
          "bodyText": "A failure by world leaders to commit to tackling the climate emergency at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow could prompt “very difficult geopolitical events” including mass migration and global competition for food and water, Boris Johnson has said. Speaking before the start of a gathering of leaders from the G20 industrialised nations in Rome, where he will push for countries to arrive in Glasgow with fixed plans to cut emissions, Johnson said the chances of success hung in the balance. In a round of broadcast interviews in Rome, he was reminded that he had said in September that there was a six out of 10 probability of the Cop summit producing the necessary action, and asked what he now thought. “I’d say they’re about the same,” he told the BBC. “I think that everybody needs to focus. What the UK has been trying to do is take the abstract concepts of net zero that we talked about in Paris six years ago, and to turn them into hard, sharp deliverables in terms of reducing coal use, reducing the use of internal combustion engines, planting millions of trees and getting the cash that the world needs to finance green technology.’’ Speaking to reporters on the way to Rome on Friday, Johnson used the example of the collapse of the Roman empire to highlight what he said was the possibility of runaway climate change bringing a decline in civilisation. Questioned about the stakes for Cop26 in Rome, where he was interviewed next to the Coliseum, Johnson reiterated his warnings about the consequences for the globe. “If you increase the temperatures of the planet by four degrees or more, as they are predicted to do remorselessly, you’ll have seen the graphs, then you produce these really very difficult geopolitical events,” he told Channel 4 News. “You produce shortages, you produce desertification, habitat loss, movements, contests for water, for food, huge movements of peoples. Those are things that are going to be politically very, very difficult to control. “When the Roman empire fell, it was largely as a result of uncontrolled immigration. The empire could no longer control its borders, people came in from the east, all over the place, and we went into a dark ages, Europe went into a dark ages that lasted a very long time. The point of that is to say it can happen again. People should not be so conceited as to imagine that history is a one-way ratchet. “Unless you can make sure next week at Cop in Glasgow that we keep alive this prospect of restricting the growth in the temperature of the planet then we really face a real problem for humanity.” Johnson has faced criticism this week for his own inaction over tackling emissions, with Wednesday’s autumn budget again froze fuel duty, and cut levies on shorter, domestic flights, but he arrived in Rome bearing a blunt message for fellow G20 leaders. “Too many countries are still doing too little,” the prime minister’s spokesperson said, setting out the message that will be delivered. “As the countries with the greatest historic and modern contributions to global warming, who have built their economies on the backs of burning dirty fossil fuels, the G20 holds the key to unlocking global action and making the progress we so badly need to live up to our commitments.” Asked on Saturday whether the cut to passenger duty had undermined his message, Johnson rejected this. “We increased air passenger duty for long-haul flights, 96% of CO2 emissions come from long haul flights,” he told Channel 4 News. “What we will do is ensuring we have proper connectivity in the islands of the United Kingdom, which is an entirely sensible thing to do.” In Rome, Johnson will hold bilateral talks with Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, whose own record on reducing emissions has been heavily criticised, as well as Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Italy’s Mario Draghi. Johnson is not due to hold a one-on-one meeting with Joe Biden, the US president, who will be at the G20 and Cop26, although the pair will attend a meeting in Rome about the Iran nuclear deal. Also attending this meeting will be the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is expected to bring along her likely successor, Olaf Scholz, currently the finance minister."

          "headline": "Penelope Jackson jailed for minimum of 18 years for husband’s murder",
          "bodyText": "A retired accountant has been jailed for at least 18 years after being convicted of murdering her husband, a former army lieutenant colonel whom she accused of decades of emotional and physical abuse. Penelope Jackson, 66, was found guilty at Bristol crown court of the murder of David Jackson, 78, whom she stabbed three times at their home in Somerset before telling a 999 operator: “I thought I’d get his heart but he hasn’t got one.” Imposing a life sentence with an 18-year minimum term after a 10-2 majority verdict from a jury of eight women and four men, the judge Martin Picton said: “I have no doubt you intended to kill your husband and it was a premeditated murder. Your behaviour shows a shocking level of callousness. During the four days of giving evidence I did not detect a shred of genuine remorse on your part for the crime you have committed.” He said he had given a higher sentence than the 15-year minimum outlined in sentencing guidance owing to the physical harm inflicted on David Jackson, to whom she had been married for 24 years. During the high-profile two-week trial, the defence lawyer, Clare Wade QC, sought to persuade the jury that Penelope Jackson had a “loss of control” after being pushed to the edge by longterm intermittent abuse. However, jurors decided that despite the allegations of abuse, Jackson was in control of her actions on the evening she killed her husband, and that her behaviour was not consistent with that of a person with a “normal degree of tolerance and self-restraint”. Picton said: “There were no doubt tensions in the marriage, points of friction the lockdown will have accentuated, but I’m quite sure he was nothing like the person you claimed.” The case is likely to prompt debate over abuse allegations. Some domestic violence experts believe juries often do not understand the concept of coercive control and are given no guidance to help them. Speaking generally, the domestic abuse commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, said: “I have been concerned about some of the sentencing of domestic homicides for some time, which is why the victims commissioner and I called on the government to conduct an independent review. It is time that we ensured that the nature of domestic abuse is fully understood in these cases and that sentencing truly reflects the reality and gravity of domestic homicide crimes which often follow prolonged periods of domestic abuse.” But addressing the court, David Jackson’s estranged daughter from a former marriage, Jane Calverley, accused Penelope Jackson of being the abuser in the relationship and suggested she had “taken advantage” of a culture that does not support male victims of domestic abuse. “My father was a proud man and this consequently cost him his life. He would not seek help from someone bullying, berating and psychologically controlling him because he would have viewed that as a man he should not be experiencing this and felt shame,” she said. Jackson stabbed her husband after sharing a birthday meal with him and their daughter via Zoom. The couple had argued over a bubble and squeak side dish, and then over the location of an iPad charger, before Jackson retreated to the main bedroom carrying a kitchen knife. She told the jury she had planned to use it for self-defence and later considered suicide. Jackson said she had entered a bedroom at home seeking an apology for the events of the evening. When he failed to say sorry, she said, she informed him of her intention to take her own life. She said he goaded her, suggesting she “get on with it”. Jackson told the court this was the moment when she “lost it”. She said: “I just thought: I cannot do this. It is not fair and I lost control.” Jackson slashed him across the chest in the bedroom and went downstairs to write a note of confession. Her husband emerged to call 999, and during the course of that call – in which she reported him telling her that she “couldn’t even do [the stabbing] right”, she fatally stabbed him two further times in the abdomen. In an 18-minute phone call to emergency services, Jackson told the call handler her husband was “bleeding to death with any luck” on their kitchen floor, adding: “I thought I’d get his heart but he hasn’t got one.” She repeatedly refused to help the victim when the operator asked her to take steps such as apply pressure to the wound or throw him a towel to try to stem the bleeding. Jackson confessed in the 999 call to killing her husband and claimed she was “compos mentis” but in a later statement she said she remembered little of the evening’s events and had been in a state of traumatised shock. Isabelle Potterton, Jackson’s daughter from a previous marriage who was raised by David Jackson as his own, told the court: “From the moment the PC knocked on our door and told us what had happened, I had not only lost my dad but I lost my mum too. Our life was changed for ever.” Calverley said her father’s death was especially painful given the family had already struggled to process the suicide of his son, Gavin. “Traumatic death results in a complex bereavement process and for me has brought back a lot of pain and significant trauma.”"

          "headline": "Nama, Liverpool: ‘I was offered an edible balloon before the sashimi’ – restaurant review",
          "bodyText": "At the GPO in Liverpool, a man on stilts clomps and sways approximately a metre from my table, banging a huge drum in time to a chaotic, brass ensemble version of Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) by Eurythmics. Are these, I wonder, optimum conditions to appreciate delicate stone bass sashimi by some of the north-west’s top restaurateurs? It’s Friday night in the repurposed general post office building, which is now a large, bustling food hall featuring many vendors, different cuisines and communal eating. Each of these halls across Britain has its own rules and quirks, and the GPO is one of the better, sleeker operations, because it allows table-booking and ordering by app, and also employs lots of affable, prompt staff to whisk plates of Jailbird’s Nashville-style fried chicken and Ferrero Rocher sundaes to your booth. There’s also Carousel Cheese, which serves baron bigod, sparkenhoe blue and yorkshire fettle (yes, that’s a feta-like cheese from North Yorkshire) Yo! Sushi-style. The bar is lively with what are called in news-speak “numerous revellers”, as well as that six-piece, brass-parping, stilt-walking gang who thunder their way through Nena’s 99 Red Balloons as my sumac and za’atar halloumi fries turn up from MorMor, one of the GPO’s Levantine-influenced traders. Liverpool is never dull – I knew that already – but this is the first time I’ve been offered an edible helium balloon while waiting for a plate of Sicilian red shrimp sashimi. That said, Nama taking root in the GPO is surprising to me, but then we do live in interesting times. This kiosk, which specialises in raw salmon, wagyu, yellowfin tuna and other small plate offerings, is the baby of Luke French and Stacey Sherwood-French, who own Sheffield’s Jöro, an elegant, modern Michelin Bib Gourmand holder made entirely of shipping containers. Jöro serves Highland wagyu knuckle with wasabi mustard and squab with fermented blackcurrant; after dinner, you can stay the night in one of their four boutique hotel rooms at House of Jöro, to rest your distended belly, enjoy its botanical toiletries and hand-tufted pillow tops and peruse the carefully strewn copies of The Noma Guide to Fermentation and Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck cookbook. I can’t think of many better mini-breaks in this country for the ardent food fan. After Jöro’s success, a casual dining Scandi-Japanese spin-off called Konjö appeared in Sheffield’s own food hall, the Cutlery Works. And now both it and Nama are here in Liverpool, with the latter looking from a distance more like a Morrisons fish counter than an izakaya-inspired restaurant. Still, something about the mood of ornate, Japanese-inspired, small plates was possibly lost by the time my yellowfin tartare cured in koji-soy oil with koshihikari rice, salmon roe, egg yolk, chives and furikake arrived 45 minutes after I’d ordered it on the app, and during you-know-who’s spirited rendition of Corona’s Rhythm of the Night. Ah yes, the rhythm of the night. I need to ask a very honest question here: are food halls ever a truly satisfying dining experience? I’ve no doubt they seem so on paper and in the marketing meetings, they’re fantastic for filling old, unloved but historically important spaces and they’re good news for downward-spiralling city centres. Yet in reality they’re noisy, unrelaxing and the food is often patchy, with the occasional gem hidden among the colossal choice of menus. While waiting for Nama’s Cornish stone bass, which came abundantly titivated with truffle, lemongrass, yuzu, ponzu, English wasabi and nori, we picked at Konjö’s Korean-style cauliflower, which was squishily soft and claggy, and came with an almost inedible, one-note chilli jam. How could this basket of mush possibly have any connection to Jöro in Sheffield? Konjö’s Korean chicken was simply more of the same abrasive taste. By far the loveliest thing I ate that evening were those Sicilian prawns: light, sweet and ever so slightly fiery, with a lime, ginger, ponzu and jalapeño dressing. But, to tell the truth, several of the dishes we grazed on at the GPO, across the many vendors, were not quite wonderful, the overplay of raw red onion and lack of heat or herb at MorMor being especially noteworthy. What the GPO lacks in deliciousness, however, it makes up for at 9pm on a Friday in atmospheric oomph and hi-octane 1990s house covers, plus the majestic sight of full-glam Liverpool ladies in the bar area setting off on a night on the tiles, which, as a north-western woman myself, will always make my heart soar. As a meeting spot, drinking hole or place to eat chicken on waffles, the GPO is a definite success, but as a centre of culinary excellence, I’d be more likely to return to Duke Street Market, where you can get a more comfortable, sit-down experience. It wasn’t by any means a good evening for a food fan, but it’s safe to say that Friday-night Liverpool is still absolutely thriving. • Nama The GPO, Metquarter, 35 Whitechapel, Liverpool L1. Open all week, 8.30am-11pm (midnight Fri &amp; Sat). About £25 a head plus drinks and service. • Episode two of the second series of Grace’s Comfort Eating podcast is released on 2 November.

          "headline": "France to use ‘language of force’ in post-Brexit fishing rights row",
          "bodyText": "France will “now use the language of force” in an escalation of a row over post-Brexit fishing rights, France’s EU affairs minister has said, as French maritime police seized a British trawler found in its territorial waters without a licence. One vessel was stopped off Le Havre in the early hours of Thursday morning, then rerouted to the quay and “handed over to the judicial authority”, while a second was given a verbal warning. In a statement, the French government said the checks had been routine but admitted they were conducted “in the context of the discussion on licences with the UK and the European Commission”. The seized trawler was later identified as the Cornelis Gert Jan by a spokesperson for the South Western Fish Producers Organisation. The owners of the boat at the centre of the dispute told the Guardian that their vessel was properly registered with the UK authorities to fish in French or EU waters, but their vessel’s name was not included on the official register that was shared with the French government. Paris has been infuriated in recent months by the response of the authorities in the UK and Jersey to post-Brexit applications from French fishing vessels for permits to its waters, which are regulated by the EU-UK trade deal agreed on Christmas Eve last year. The row blew up on Wednesday when Paris said it would ban British fishing boats landing seafood in key ports from Tuesday next week unless it received further licences for French vessels, and vowed to impose onerous checks on cross-Channel trade. There was also a threat issued to the UK’s energy supply if those initial sanctions from Paris did not prompt the issuing of extra permits. Answering an urgent question in the Commons on Thursday, the UK environment secretary, George Eustice, condemned the comments as “not what we would expect from a close ally and partner” and warned of possible retaliation. Sources in Brussels confirmed there was not yet support among the other 26 member states for EU action against the UK through the dispute resolution mechanism in the trade and cooperation deal. Later on Thursday morning, France’s EU affairs minister, Clément Beaune, doubled down, however, on the threat of unilateral French action, saying the situation was “not acceptable”, and that the restricted number of permits was a “political choice” by Downing Street. “So now, we need to speak the language of force since that seems to be the only thing this British government understands,” he said. “We have been extremely patient, our fishing boats have been extremely responsible, because it’s a major loss of their activity. From November, it’s over. We’ll open dialogue if the British want dialogue – it’s up to them – but we’ll put in place retaliation measures because there is no reason we shouldn’t have access to their waters when they have access to our ports.” Speaking at the annual conference of the European Policy Centre thinktank in Brussels, Beaune also linked the row over access to British waters with the UK’s refusal to fully implement the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. The risk is also now high that fishers from Normandy and Brittany will decide to blockade UK or Jersey ports. The Royal Navy has patrol ships “at high readiness” to help Jersey enforce fishing rights and maritime security over its waters, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Thursday. Insiders said Jersey would have to request the deployment of the armed “river class” offshore patrol vessels, although no such request had been received from the government of the crown dependency. British naval planners have shaken up their fishing defence plans over the last few months as tensions in the Channel have flared since Brexit. In May HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, both river class vessels, were deployed to Jersey to prevent a feared blockade by French fishing trawlers of the island’s main port. The UK has said 1,700 EU vessels have been licensed to fish in UK waters and that 98% of applications for fishing licences had been granted. Eustice repeated this statistic in the Commons on Thursday, saying the UK “stands by its commitments in the trade and cooperation agreement”. He said: “It is very disappointing to see the comments that came from France yesterday. We believe these are disappointing, disproportionate and not what we would expect from a close ally and partner.” The French maritime minister, Annick Girardin, accused Britain of spreading misinformation. “The figure of 98% of licences granted by the United Kingdom to Europeans is false,” she said. “Only 90.3% were. Obviously, the missing 10% are for the French … It has been nine months since French fishermen have no longer been able to work. It is a breach of their signature by the British. That’s enough.” The main differences between the two sides centre on rights within the six- to 12-mile zone from the British coast. Earlier this week, the European Commission said the UK government had approved 15 out of 47 applications for French boats to operate in those coastal waters. A further 15 applications were being considered where evidence of activity in those waters was limited, but 17 applications had been withdrawn by French applicants because of “poor evidence”. Of greater concern to the French authorities is that one-third of boats applying to fish in the waters off Jersey, a British crown dependency, have been turned down by the island’s government. Barrie Deas, from the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations, the body representing fishers in England, said the descent into a “tit for tat” relationship was unhelpful."

          "headline": "Tax cuts before next election will require sacrifices elsewhere, Sunak told",
          "bodyText": "Plans for tax cuts before the next election will need to come from reductions in public spending or from extra borrowing, the government’s independent forecasting unit has told the chancellor. With Britain’s growth rate expected to decline to below 2% a year from 2023, hitting government income, Rishi Sunak will face voters without the spare cash needed for tax cuts – unless sacrifices are made in other areas. In his budget speech, Sunak told the Commons on Wednesday: “As we look towards the future, I want to say this simple thing to the House and the British people. My goal is to reduce taxes. By the end of this parliament, I want taxes to be going down not up.” The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the UK economy would revert to its 1.5% pre-pandemic average growth rate during the last three years of the forecast to 2026 as the scarring effects of Brexit and the 2008 financial crash reasserted their influence on the economy. The government must hold a general election by May 2024, although there is speculation Johnson is preparing to go to the country in 2023. Richard Hughes, the chair of the OBR, said that based on current forecasts, the chancellor would need to answer “which responsibilities that the state has now taken would it then retreat from to accommodate these tax cuts? “If the answer is none, then would we be content to see our debt continue to rise in normal times, given what we now know about how much the next crisis might cost us?” Brexit had cost the UK 4% of national income, or GDP, and was continuing to damage the economy, Hughes said. He blamed a decline in trade with Europe and beyond, saying: “Trade has fallen as the UK has become less connected with the outside world.” In a further warning, the OBR outlined a bleak outlook should inflation take off in the next year. A central forecast of a peak of 4.4% could prove to be optimistic, it said, adding that a more pessimistic scenario would prompt the Bank of England to take action. The OBR said inflation could soar above 5% if energy and food costs continued to rise, forcing Threadneedle Street to push its base rate from 0.1% to above 3% next year before bringing it back down to below 1% in 2024. Charlie Bean, an OBR economic adviser and a former deputy governor for monetary policy at the Bank, said that there were signs of higher wage rises in response to rising prices, but so far these were only in pockets of the labour market where staff shortages were acute. The forecaster was more optimistic about the outlook for this year as it predicted lower government spending and higher tax receipts. Economic growth will be 6.5% this year, up from the 4% rate forecast at the last budget in March and completing the return of UK GDP to its previous peak by Christmas. However, the OBR’s economic health check brought forward 1.3 percentage points of growth from its forecast for 2022, which was revised down from 7.3% to 6%. That meant the increase in predicted GDP growth for this year from 4% to 6.5% only added 1.5% to the total gain over two years. An estimate of the long-term damage from the pandemic over the next five years was reduced, but the forecaster failed to follow the prediction of the Bank of England that scarring from unemployment and business insolvencies would knock 1% from the trajectory of GDP growth seen before 2020. The OBR said the scarring would leave the UK economy permanently 2% below its previous trade growth rate. At the last budget, the OBR predicted unemployment would peak at 7.5%, but instead it reached 5.2% in December 2020 and has been falling since. The OBR said it could nudge higher to 5.4% as workers on furlough failed to find a job. Tax receipts have stayed well ahead of previous OBR forecasts during the spring and summer this year, handing the chancellor four-fifths of the £51bn reduction in the deficit since the forecast in March. Sunak banked a third of the funds, most of it next year when his increase in national insurance and freeze on income tax thresholds will lead to a tightening of the public finances by the equivalent of 4.4% of GDP. The latest forecasts show the deficit falling to £183bn, or 7.9% this year, and to 1.7% in 2025-26. In March, the OBR said borrowing this year would hit £355bn, or 9.7% of GDP, before falling to £74bn in 2025-26, or 2.7% of GDP. The OBR said: “The improvement in the fiscal outlook is sufficient to enable the chancellor to meet his fiscal target of getting underlying debt falling as a share of GDP by the third year of our forecast.” However, the forecaster said the margin for error was slim and it would take only a small downturn to throw the government’s deficit reduction plan off course."

          "headline": "First Thing: Hillary Clinton aide describes sexual assault by a senator",
          "bodyText": "Good morning. Huma Abedin, a longtime close aide to Hillary Clinton, has written in a new book that she was sexually assaulted by a US senator, an incident she says she “buried” until allegations against the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh triggered her memory years later. Abedin makes the shocking claim in a memoir, Both/And: A Life in Many Worlds, which will be published next week. She writes that after a dinner attended by some senators and their aides, a senator invited her into his apartment for coffee. “Then, in an instant, it all changed. He plopped down to my right, put his left arm around my shoulder, and kissed me, pushing his tongue into my mouth, pressing me back on the sofa,” she describes. “I was so utterly shocked, I pushed him away.” Abedin writes that the senator seemed surprised, apologized and said he had “misread” her “all this time”. She considered how to leave “without this ending badly”, she writes, and apologised and left. What happened after? Abedin writes that she stayed friendly with the senator and soon “buried the incident”, which she wanted to forget, succeeding in erasing it from her mind “entirely”. Who was the senator? Abedin does not name the senator or his party or give any other clues as to his identity. Why is this coming out now? Abedin’s memory of her experience on the unnamed senator’s couch, she writes, was triggered when she read about Christine Blasey Ford “being accused of ‘conveniently’ remembering” her alleged assault by Kavanaugh. Pair arrested over death of child found in Texas apartment with siblings A woman and her boyfriend have been arrested and charged over the death of a nine-year-old child whose skeletal remains were found at a Houston apartment along with three surviving siblings who appeared to have been abandoned. Bryan W Coulter, the 32-year-old boyfriend of the dead child’s mother, was charged on Tuesday with murder. The mother, Gloria Y Williams, 36, was charged with felony injury to a child by omission, failure to provide medical care and failure to provide adequate supervision, authorities said. The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences in Houston, which conducts all autopsies in the county, listed the child’s primary cause of death as homicidal violence with multiple blunt force injuries. What is the background to this? One of the surviving siblings, a 15-year-old, called the sheriff’s department on Sunday and told authorities that his nine-year-old brother had died a year ago and the body was in the apartment, according to the law enforcement agency. How did the other children survive? Their apartment did not have any power and a neighbor had helped the children by charging a cellphone and buying them food, police said. It appeared that the surviving children were “fending for each other”, with the oldest sibling caring for the younger two. These Trump fans were at the Capitol on 6 January. Now they are running for office Of the thousands of diehard Trump supporters who gathered in Washington on 6 January, some are emerging as Republican candidates for national and local office. The electoral chances of each person vary, but they add to the extremist political landscape before midterm elections in 2022 in which the Democrats could lose the House of Representatives. Who are they? Perhaps the most credible is Teddy Daniels, who posted a video from the Capitol as people surged into the building. He is running for congress in Pennsylvania and is one of the more sophisticated candidates, having appeared on Fox News and met Trump. In New York, Tina Forte is running an extremely long-shot bid to unseat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A Snopes investigation found that Forte attended the Capitol riot, where she livestreamed videos from outside. Derrick Van Orden, from Wisconsin, has been endorsed by Trump and the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy. He was also at the Capitol on 6 January, and has been called an “insurrectionist” by the Democratic congressional campaign committee. In New Hampshire, Jason Riddle is running for the state’s second congressional district, despite pleading guilty in September to five charges arising from him entering the Capitol during the riot. Once in the Capitol, Riddle took – and drank from – a bottle of wine he found in a lawmaker’s office. Weather whiplash: California’s historic downpour interrupts historic drought In two days the dramatic scenes of dried landscapes and wildfires that have defined California’s summer were replaced with surging rivers, floods and mudflows as a historic rainstorm – deemed a category 5 atmospheric river – pummeled the state. For scientists, the storm – though shocking in its magnitude – was not a surprise. It has been clear that the climate crisis would intensify the extremes between wet and dry seasons, but many wonder whether this weather whiplash is a preview of catastrophes to come. Steven Ostoja, the director of the US Department of Agriculture’s California Climate Hub, said that even though climate scientists expected shifts of this intensity, it was nonetheless startling to witness. “All of a sudden it’s just like, my God. I have never seen it rain this hard outside of being in the Belizean rainforest,” he said. How bad was the drought? Days before the storm, the state’s capital of Sacramento, where Ostoja is based, set a record of more than 200 days without measurable rain. Is the rain good news? It has brought some gains, adding a few percentage points to the volume of water in lakes and reservoirs and extinguishing wildfires that have been ravaging the state. Should we be concerned? The state is widening its weather extremes, experiencing stronger storms interspersed with intense dry spells. Historic droughts are being followed by the wettest years on record. So, yes. In other news… Prince Andrew’s lawyer has asked a New York judge to keep sealed a 2009 legal agreement that he says can protect the prince against a lawsuit’s claims that he sexually assaulted an American woman when she was under 18. He denies the allegations. Criminal charges have not been ruled out in the fatal accidental shooting by Alec Baldwin on the Rust film set, the local district attorney handling the case has said in an interview. Police are investigating the shooting that killed the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded the director Joel Souza. A failure to take action on methane emissions by the world’s biggest meat and dairy companies is fueling the climate crisis, say campaigners. Livestock generates about 32% of human-generated methane, with the worst performers two French companies – Groupe Bigard and Lactalis – and the Japanese company Itoham. While the climate crisis batters West Virginia, its conservative Democrat senator is doing everything he can to strip out many of the policies that would help his home state. Joe Manchin owns a coal company and green measures would affect his bottom line. Stat of the day: six in 10 Americans (both with religious affiliations and not) hold at least one new-age belief Perhaps this is the reason for the rise in tarot, which is becoming a self-care phenomenon and is among a range of mystic practices to have had a mainstream resurgence in recent years. Most obvious is astrology but there are also psychics, reincarnation, supportive spiritual energies (such as with manifesting) and witchcraft. Jessica Dore, who started pulling tarot cards after work, said: “The cards made me feel seen and understood in a way that I wasn’t used to.” More than 130,000 people on Twitter and 52,000 on Instagram follow Dore’s daily draw of a card, which she then connects to psychological concepts, legends, myths and miscellanea as a prompt for introspection. Don’t miss this: Abba on their extraordinary reunion – ‘We are confronted by our younger selves all the time’ It started with a mysterious image on billboards all over the world and the internet. The sun rising above four dark planets, the only words Abba: Voyage. By the time an announcement was made on 2 September, it had fair claim to call itself the most anticipated comeback in pop history. And the details exceeded expectations. Not only was there a new album, Voyage, the first in 40 years: 10 new songs that brought the original band together in the studio for the first time since a split that had been precipitated by the couples in the band divorcing. “We decided early on that we’re not going to look at anything else,” Björn Ulvaeus says of the current charts. “We’re just going to do the songs, the best songs we can right now.” Or this: Learning the ropes – why Germany is building risk into its playgrounds If scaling the Triitopia looks risky, that is the point: built in 2018, the climbing tower in Berlin-Frohnau’s Ludwig Lesser Park is emblematic of a trend that has accelerated in Germany over the past five years. A growing number of educators, manufacturers and town planners argue that playgrounds must stop striving for absolute safety and instead create challenging microcosms that teach children to navigate difficult situations, even if the consequence is the odd broken bone. One influential 2004 study found that children who had improved their motor skills in playgrounds at an early age were less likely to have accidents as they got older. With young people spending an increasing amount of time at home, the umbrella association of statutory accident insurers in Germany last year called for more playgrounds that teach children to develop “risk competence”. Climate check: The dirty dozen – meet the US’s top climate villains For too long, Americans were fed a false narrative that they should feel individually guilty about the climate crisis. The reality is that only a handful of powerful people bear personal responsibility, write Georgia Wright, Liat Olenick and Amy Westervelt. The country’s worst polluters managed to evade accountability and scrutiny for decades as they helped the fossil fuel industry destroy our planet. The actions of these climate supervillains have affected millions of people, disproportionately hurting vulnerable people who have done the least to contribute to global emissions. Working- and middle-class people must stop blaming themselves for the climate crisis. Instead, it is time to band together to seek justice and hold these profiteers accountable. Only in calling out their power and culpability is it possible to reclaim the world that belongs to all of us, together. Want more environmental stories delivered to your inbox?

          "headline": "When the mystical goes mainstream: how tarot became a self-care phenomenon",
          "bodyText": "When Jessica Dore was growing up, her mother had a tarot deck from which she’d pull cards – much to the mounting mortification of her daughter. As a child, Dore went along with it as fortune-telling fun. But “as an adolescent, it was sort of like ‘Mind your own business’”, she says wryly. It meant Dore was at least familiar with tarot. The deck of 78 cards, split between major arcana and minor arcana (“greater” and “lesser secrets”), is used with varying degrees of sincerity to divine past, present and future. “But I never had any sense that it could be something that would be of value for me in my life,” Dore says. Then, a decade later, Dore threw a dinner party to which two friends brought along a tarot deck. They gave her an “amazing” reading, she says, that cast new light on a hard time she was going through. “The cards made me feel seen and understood in a way that I wasn’t used to.” The experience opened her mind to the potential of tarot to shift perspectives and illuminate possibility. She acquired a deck of her own, and started pulling cards after work each night. At the time Dore was in her early 20s, a poet with a communications degree working as a publicist at a publisher of self-help and psychology textbooks. She had been struck by how the research she encountered through her job could help people to gain new insight into their thoughts, feelings and behaviours – if only they knew to seek it out. Tarot, she thought, could be a similar conduit to awareness and introspection. These two strands – barriers to self-help, and tarot as a path to it – travelled together in Dore’s mind, culminating in a “strange and unlikely marriage”: she became a licensed social worker and full-time tarot reader. On Twitter, more than 130,000 people (along with 52,000 on Instagram) follow Dore’s daily draw of a card, which she then connects to psychological concepts, legends, myths and miscellanea as a prompt for introspection. She links the five of cups, for example, to cognitive flexibility training, proposing expanding one’s thinking as a path away from triggering thoughts; while the sun card could illuminate healthy responses to rejection. Now Dore has expanded on her cerebral writing on “the human experience through tarot” in a book, Tarot For Change: Using the Cards for Self-Care, Acceptance and Growth. With this practical, carefully referenced guide, Dore brings together the scientific and the arcane, two spheres long believed to be antithetical – but increasingly less so. Tarot is among a range of mystic practices to have seen a mainstream resurgence in recent years. Most obvious is astrology, now almost adjacent to psychoanalysis in our shared lexicon – but there’s also psychics, reincarnation, supportive spiritual energies (such as with manifesting), and even witchcraft. In 2018, the Pew Research Centre found that six in 10 Americans (both with religious affiliations and not) held at least one new age belief. Among the explanations given have been the internet connecting subcultures and people with alternative views, fashion houses bringing their imagery to the fore, and the decline in Christianity and community in the west. Above all, this new dawn of the new age has been framed as a response to widespread anxiety and sociopolitical instability; as an attempt to find meaning in an impervious, chaotic world. It is now possible to book tarot readings directly over Instagram – @thehoodwitch Bri Luna (who has 470,000 followers) and @thelionnessoracle Alejandra Luisa León each charge around $140 an hour – or learn to read the cards yourself, with free resources such as Brigit Esselmont’s @biddytarot community, or the Labyrinthos online school and app. On TikTok, tarot cards are drawn by algorithms. Even the Sun newspaper recently published its own guide to major and minor arcana, a surefire sign of steady online search traffic for spiritual guidance. But tarot as practiced by Dore does not so much provide answers as it generates more questions. “You’re not predicting the future – you’re really just exploring, looking at the images and activating the imagination,” she says over Zoom from her home in Philadelphia. Dore likens drawing cards to yoga: a daily discipline of self-care, containing “profound spiritual data” to be experienced rather than intellectualised. “I came to tarot needing to figure out how to take better care of myself, how to check in with myself, to show up for myself,” she says. (Indeed, Dore does two hours of Ashtanga yoga each morning, after 45 minutes’ journalling – if the unexamined life is not worth living, hers is hard-won.) When she started her nightly ritual of drawing cards, Dore found that what emerged gave shape to her thoughts and feelings in the same way as a writing prompt might. The eight of swords – communicating a sense of feeling victimised, or trapped – for instance, might cause Dore to reflect on whether she was avoiding any difficult emotions. As well as serving as a prompt for introspection, the cards’ storied past made Dore think of history repeating – circular narratives and mirror images through literature, folklore and legends. “It felt very nourishing for me, just to be like: ‘Someone drew this illustration; someone created these various interpretations – that means that I’m not alone.’” Considered in this light, tarot has more in common than one might think with therapy. As Dore points out, Carl Jung studied archetypes, symbols and synchronicity in seeking to understand the human psyche. Today, cognitive behavioural therapy – widely used as a treatment for depression and anxiety – focuses on changing the way you think in order to support your wellbeing. And other evidence-based models lean heavily on metaphors to bring about change (acceptance and commitment therapy). As a set of images and ideas derived from ancient wisdom, tarot has similar potential for transformation and growth, says Dore. She refers to the American psychologist James Hillman’s definition of “psychologizing: whenever reflection takes place in terms other than those presented”. Dore is clear about the limits to this: tarot is not therapy, just as she is not a therapist (though she received clinical training as part of her master’s degree). But that is not to say there is no therapeutic benefit to projecting our inner lives on to a card. “Language can get you stuck, and it can get you unstuck,” says Dore. “Tarot is a set of metaphors that can help somebody understand something: I could just say it to you, or you could look at an image and it might really sink in.” After nearly 100 years of work to ground psychology in evidence and empirical studies, we might see such idiosyncratic influences as outside the scientific scope. But all through human history, spirituality has factored into concepts of mental health and wellbeing – not necessarily reductively. One upshot of the 21st-century embrace of “wellness” is mounting awareness and acceptance of the real benefits of non-clinical practices such as meditation, yoga, spending time in nature, journalling and mind-altering drugs. Tarot might be seen in kind, says Dore – as an intervention rooted in a mystic tradition, like mindfulness. It is possible to accept “other ways of knowing”, she suggests, without denying or undermining science. Certainly, the care and palpable sense of responsibility with which Dore approaches her work might surprise those who see tarot as essentially exploitative, the pastime of the cretinous and the credulous. The dismissal of tarot – and likewise astrology, another interest popular among young women – is often suggestive of whose suffering is taken seriously. Dore does not see herself as working within an explicitly feminist context. But she suggests that people who don’t feel represented in accepted paradigms, or included in clinical settings, could benefit the most from alternative approaches to healing. (Dore completed a year-long internship at an eating disorder clinic, where the cards were used to “amazing” effect.) “For those people who don’t feel spoken to by some of the interventions that are evidenced-based, tarot makes a doorway for people to show up and say: ‘Here’s what I need’, instead of telling them: ‘Here’s what you need’,” she says. The goal is not to throw out facts, truth or science, says Dore – but to make room for magic, long “relegated to the edges”. Her preferred definition is from the anonymous Christian author of the Meditations on the Tarot: using the subtle to influence the dense. In psychological terms, that could simply mean greater awareness of how our thoughts and emotions (the subtle) shape our actions and behaviours (the dense). In a world that did not draw so hard a line between science and spirituality, Dore suggests, “maybe we would better understand our behaviours as consumers, as activists; the jobs that we choose, the things that we spend our time doing. What are these things serving? At what altars are we worshipping? It seems very idealistic – but that’s the way I think about it.” As it is, the current trend for tarot has seen it absorbed and repackaged by the mindless forces of capitalism it aims to counter. Where Pamela Colman Smith – the illustrator of the ubiquitous Rider-Waite tarot deck – died penniless and uncelebrated, there are now tarot decks themed from everything from cats to Disney villains. Urban Outfitters sells a tarot-themed colouring book (or “personal growth colouring journey”), and a “spiritually uplifting” cocktail set, with “tequila-inspired meanings for all 78 cards”. At the higher end, Dior debuted “tarot dresses” for its spring 2021 couture line. You can even have your cards read at Selfridges of London. As the German philosopher Theodor Adorno wrote in 1953, of the popularity of astrology: “the kind of retrogression highly characteristic of persons who do not any longer feel to be the self-determining subjects of their fate, is concomitant with a fetishistic attitude towards the very same conditions which tend to be dehumanizing them”. Dore, too, writes of the chariot card and the limits to willpower: “Capitalism isn’t built to teach pathfinding; it’s built to teach compliance within a preset path.” But she suggests that tarot could reveal another way – as stories and symbols have always done, separate from any question of whether they are rooted in fact. “I would challenge you to consider that this set of images – that are derived straight from mythology and folktales and fairytales in many cases, and even religion and spirituality – might also have meaning too, if you can step out of the rigid mindset.” Even if magic is a leap too far, in “reclaiming the imagination from the grips of doubt and rationalism”, tarot may at least allow us to imagine a better world: the first step to creating it. An ideal of tarot is to experience the “totality of things”, says Dore: where nothing is black and white, even seeming opposites are identical in nature, and “all things, no matter how seemingly conflicted, can exist together”. This bears striking resemblance to many Indigenous world-views – increasingly being recognised as vital in the fight against the climate crisis. The Extinction Rebellion co-founder Gail Bradbrook and feminist scholar Angela Davis have likewise spoken of something akin to Dore’s definition of magic in their activism: the possibility of achieving what seems impossible now. Tarot simply asks that we hold ourselves open to it, says Dore. “The beautiful thing about tarot is that you will meet the card where you’re ready to go.” Tarot for Change: Using the Cards for Self-Care, Acceptance and Growth by Jessica Dore is published by Penguin Life/Viking for $27.00 US / £14.99 from October 26, 2021"

          "headline": "Inflation is back in the news – so should Australians be worried?",
          "bodyText": "Inflation is back in the news, or at least the looming threat of its revival. Australians are already enduring higher petrol prices and reports mount by the day about disruptions to trade caused by the Covid pandemic. Carmakers are struggling to secure computer chips for the cars, restaurant owners say the cost of food imports is soaring, and local farmers say the cost of inputs is doubling in price if not more. But is the inflationary dragon really stirring and should we fret that central banks including Australia’s may soon follow New Zealand’s move this month and lift official interest rates? And is inflation such a bad thing, especially if wages rise faster? Australia’s consumer price index for the September quarter, due out tomorrow at 11.30 AEDT, should provide the clearest signal yet of whether price rises are gathering pace. The consumer price index – what is it? As the name suggests, the CPI tracks the average change over time in prices paid by households for a set basket of goods and services. Statisticians have been tracking national price changes since federation in 1901, adding the innovation of specific weights based on the proportion of goods bought in 1948. Since 2018, the basket has been adjusted annually to reflect consumer changes. Perhaps not surprisingly, housing makes up the largest overall weighting on the index, at about one-quarter. The CPI, though, does not include changes in land prices, so the soaring price of housing – 25% in the past year in Sydney alone – is ignored unless the home being bought is a new one. That’s one key reason why the CPI is not the same thing as a cost of living index, of which the Australian Bureau of Statistics has several. (The index also excludes changes in the value of other assets, such as superannuation and cryptocurrencies.) Why does the CPI matter? The CPI is right up there among the mostly closely examined economic gauges, along with gross domestic product growth and unemployment rates. Central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, base their interest rates specifically on how inflation is faring, and that directly influences the cost of borrowing for mortgages and other loans. Indeed, interest rates have long been the RBA’s main tool to steer the wider economy. Since the 1990s, the central bank has attempted to keep inflation within a 2-3% annual range. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It deems the target to be the “appropriate” annual rate “over time” to ensure CPI is “sufficiently low that it does not materially distort economic decisions in the community”. More on these distortions later. Since the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, though, the CPI has remained below the low end of that target. Or at least until the June quarter of this year, when it jumped to 3.8%. That June quarter figure included some distortions, such as the return of costs for childcare after the same period a year ago when the federal government temporarily made services free to assist families coping with the first Covid lockdowns. The RBA and others zeroed in on the so-called trimmed mean measure of the CPI, which stripped out short-term distortions. That figure came in at 1.6%, or less than that 2% end of the range. Over time, the general CPI and its trimmed mean or weighted median – another inflation measure – typically converge, says John Hawkins, a former RBA forecaster now at the University of Canberra. Is this week’s CPI figure particularly interesting? Yes. Since the June figures were released, a range of trading partners have reported higher inflation rates, with more likely if consumers and companies continue to scramble to secure access to goods perceived to be in short supply. According to Katrina Ell, a senior economist with Moody’s Analytics in Sydney, Wednesday’s number stands to be “an incredibly important inflation print”. Our neighbours across the ditch in New Zealand just posted their fastest rise in inflation, at least on quarterly basis, since 1987. Australia and New Zealand share many market similarities, not least looming construction bottlenecks and a reliance on imports for many finished goods, Ell says. Australia’s September CPI is unlikely to approach the Kiwis’ 4.9% annualised reading for that period. Still, Ell predicts Australia’s CPI will be 2.4% – compared with a market consensus closer to 3% – but even that rate is notable since half of the economy was mostly in Covid-induced hibernation. “That’s really significant because, obviously, Victoria and New South Wales were in extended lockdowns through part or all of the September quarter,” Ell says. “So we would have expected to see a slowdown” in inflation if not for those global disruptions. “We’re seeing severe global supply chain disruptions and that’s causing prices to increase, not just in Australia but also, you know, across the globe,” Ell says. Other countries reporting higher inflation readings above 4% include the normally inflation-allergic Germany, while others such as the US and the UK are in the 5% range or soon will be. Higher energy prices are one propellant of those higher inflation rates because of gas and other fuel shortages. In Australia, though, electricity prices have been falling sharply in part because of the advance of renewable energy. Is it time to panic? No. Short of an inflation spike come Wednesday, most economists are sanguine about the near-term prospects for prices. Hawkins, who also worked as a forecaster for the commonwealth Treasury, says the RBA is showing no signs of getting twitchy about a rise. He highlights a speech by the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, in July that sums up how the central bank planned to “look through” the many short-term distortions created by the pandemic. Lowe noted how the RBA was watching if wages were starting to pick up, one sign that higher inflation too might not be far behind. That prospect is made more likely the longer international borders remained largely closed to labour. “Some workers have received sizeable wage increases. However, the spillover effects to the broader labour market have been limited to date, and wage increases remain modest for most workers,” Lowe said. “Most firms retain their strong focus on cost control, with many preferring to wait things out until the borders open, and ration output in the meantime.” Hawkins says, “if wages start growing faster, then that probably would translate into a bit higher inflation, but that just takes inflation from something under 2 to somewhere between 2-3 [%]. “And that’s only getting back into the target range [for the RBA] so it wouldn’t be anything to be particularly concerned about” he added. “It would only be if it looked like inflation was heading to 3% then 4% then 5%, then that obviously would be a concern.” Meanwhile, there are other signs that industries, such as tourism, are struggling to find workers as economies reopen. Anecdotally at least, staff have more power to bargain for fatter pay packets. Hawkins, though, says there is little reason at this point to worry about a period of slow growth and high inflation, dubbed “stagflation” after an extended period during the 1970s. “There’s a question about whether the economy will recover and we will have strong activity and strong inflation,” he says. “But it’s even harder to see a scenario where the economy stays really weak, and wages take off and inflation goes up.” Any dragons here? Richard Denniss, the chief economist of the Australia Institute, doesn’t view inflation as such a dragon to be fought off anyway. “The sort of inflation bogeyman has been used for decades to kind of, you know, scare us away from asking for nice things,” Denniss says. These include higher wages. “The RBA has spectacularly failed in targeting inflation of 2-3%” for many years. “No one wants high inflation, but also no one wants higher unemployment, and also no one wants low wages,” Denniss says. To his thinking, it’s no accident that employers have stoked an inflationary scare campaign to keep salary growth at the slowest pace in history. “It’s very profitable to jump at some shadows, especially for people that are trying to keep wages down,” Denniss says. The unemployment rate remains about 10% if those who recently dropped out of the jobs market return, and the hours worked in the economy remains well down because the pandemic. As a result, Denniss predicts it will take more than a couple of blips in the CPI to prompt the RBA – which he calls the most “conservative, inflation-obsessed institution in Australia” – to lift its current record-low official interest rates."

          "headline": "Sewage vote outcry prompts Tory MPs to defend decision on social media",
          "bodyText": "The government has launched a defensive social media campaign after MPs faced anger from their constituents over last week’s sewage vote, in which an amendment to the environment bill that would have placed a legal duty on water companies not to pump waste into rivers was voted down. Many Conservative MPs posted almost identical statements on Monday morning after a weekend of anger over the vote. Government sources confirmed to the Guardian that the information in these posts had been supplied by No 10. MPs including Steve Brine, Ben Everitt, Michael Fabricant, Anne Marie Morris and Sally-Ann Hart published similar “explainers” about the vote on their websites. They argue that the amendment did not include an impact assessment, and the costs incurred by immediately banning sewage spills would be too great. The statement reads: “To eliminate storm overflows means transforming the entire Victorian sewage system to a whole new sewage system. It would be irresponsible for any government to spend an estimated preliminary cost of anywhere between £150bn to £650bn to transform the entire sewage system. This is a huge amount to spend in an ordinary time, let alone at a time of a continuing health pandemic. “To give some perspective, £150bn is more than the entire schools, policing and defence budget put together and £650bn is billions more than we have spent on supporting livelihoods and jobs throughout the health pandemic.” Only 22 Conservatives rebelled against the government last week, after the environment secretary, George Eustice, recommended that MPs vote against the amendment. Martin Salter, the chief policy adviser of the Angling Trust, said: “We know from the unconvincing, identikit replies received by our members that government MPs had been instructed to issue with a standard response to constituents which avoided the question of taking action to combat sewage pollution in favour of yet more endless monitoring. “There is clearly going to be a battle between the Lords and Commons on this important issue and we intend to keep up the pressure for as long as we can. “Our rivers are badly polluted and cannot wait for more plans and reports. It seriously questions the government’s commitments to leaving the environment in a better state than when they took office.” A widespread social media campaign involved constituents posting photographs of their MPs online and asking why they voted against the amendment. The former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey, who has been a driving force behind the campaign, was vying for a rather different number one as he rallied his fans on Twitter to keep putting pressure on their MPs. He said: “Currently trending at Number 3 in the UK is #Sewage. Let’s make it Number 1.” Joan Edwards, the director of policy and public affairs for the Wildlife Trusts, said: “Our rivers and seas are the bedrock of our biodiversity. But, chemicals, sewage and manure continue to pour almost unabated into our already polluted waterways. It is disappointing therefore that the government removed an amendment to the environment bill that would have placed a legal duty on water companies to reduce harm caused by sewage discharges.” There has been consternation inside government at the way the vote on the amendment last week has been portrayed, with insiders insisting that if the measures had been adopted they would have added a huge cost to water companies that would then have seen them write a “blank cheque” to pass on to consumers. One Tory MP said the size of the rebellion last week had also caused concern, and the government was – ironically – “shitting themselves”. The rebellion could grow further if Conservative backbenchers who abstained last time switched to supporting the amendment when it is likely to be reintroduced by the Lords on Tuesday. A government source said they would not accept the same amendment because it would have huge implications – including potentially digging up people’s homes and businesses – but signalled they were open to further compromise. They said: “Our door is very much open. We’re willing and ready to engage and are doing a lot of work in this area.” The health minister Maria Caulfield criticised those who were lobbying their MPs on social media. She said: “None of us voted to discharge sewage into the sea and those of who have spread lies and misinformation should hang their heads in shame. Don’t ask why MPs get death threats if you have been part of this today #toxic.” The vote came seven weeks after wastewater plants were given permission by the government to dispose of sewage not fully treated because of a shortage of chemicals resulting from a lack of HGV drivers. The sewage measure, introduced in the Lords by the Duke of Wellington, is due to return to the upper house on Tuesday, where it is expected to be sent back to the Commons for another vote by MPs. There were 403,171 spills of sewage into England’s rivers and seas in 2020, according to the Environment Agency, adding up to over 3.1m hours of spillages."

          "bodyText": "The megacity of São Paulo is home to more than 22 million people, most of whom must endure its notorious traffic to get anywhere. For decades, however, corporate executives and the super-rich have soared above these congested streets in one of the world’s largest fleets of urban helicopters, which make as many as 1,300 flights every day. While the choppers may be – as one businesswoman declared – “a necessary tool” for some, others argue they are little more than a carbon-belching nuisance. “Helicopters are a massively noisy, polluting form of transportation,” said Marc Tembleque Vilalta, a vice-president at Avolon, a Dublin-based aircraft leasing company that sees the São Paulo helicopter scene as ripe for disruption. Last month, the company signed a deal to begin supplying a Brazilian airline with electric air taxis, or eVTOLs (short for “electric vertical takeoff and landing”) by 2025. The aircraft at the center of the deal is the VA-X4, a zero-emission five-seater manufactured by the UK company Vertical Aerospace. With a battery only 20% to 50% larger than an electric sedan’s and a range of 100 miles, it claims to have a lighter environmental impact than any existing form of air travel. Rides will also be accessible even to people who don’t count themselves among the business elite, according to Avolon, which says that initial pricing will be on par with land-based ride-hailing services, with a target of about $1 a passenger mile. “We will see helicopters being the first disrupted market, but longer term we see eVTOLs disrupting automobiles,” Tembleque Vilalta predicts. “These trips will be a fraction of the cost of a helicopter at a fraction of the time of a taxi.” It’s an optimistic claim, one that might conjure thoughts of flying cars, that perennial cliche of science fiction. But Avolon, which followed its São Paulo deal by announcing a partnership with Japan Airlines, is only one of several companies now in a very real race to meet the demand for quieter, safer and less-polluting urban air travel. They include international names like Honda and Airbus as well as startups such as the German firm Volocopter, which has agreements to bring eVTOLs to Paris and Singapore in the next few years, and to supply Japan Airlines with air taxis and cargo drones. Vertical, maker of the VA-X4, has received millions in grant funding from the British government and plans to float on the New York Stock Exchange this year. Put it all together and, according to Morgan Stanley, eVTOLs represent a global market that could be worth up to $1tn by 2040. The coming eVTOL revolution is partly premised on environmental friendliness: if its battery is charged with renewable power, an eVTOL’s operation will be carbon-neutral. Even if the grid is supplied by coal, Avolon has calculated that charging a VA-X4 would still generate no more than a fifth the emissions of a comparable helicopter. There is research that backs up claims that electric air taxis may sometimes be greener than ground-based automobiles. A team at the University of Michigan recently calculated that a fully loaded eVTOL with three passengers would have 52% lower emissions than a gas-powered car and 6% lower than an electric car, given the cars’ average occupancy of 1.5 people. The vehicles “offer fast, predictable transportation and could have a niche role in sustainable mobility”, according to the study. But the buzz around eVTOLs has also stirred up concerns that so-called “urban air mobility” may be just the latest distraction from cities’ real problems and that, despite promises that this new mode of transportation will be both accessible and climate-friendly, eVTOLs may actually contribute to the inequities and environmental ills plaguing urban areas around the world. “There are all kinds of problems right now that we need to figure out, before we start fussing around with this,” said Geoff Boeing, a professor of urban planning at the University of Southern California, who argues that cities should focus on expanding and improving public transit and pedestrian and bike infrastructure before they open their skies to “transportation segregation, where if you can pay for it, you can skip the line”. Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal thinktank, went further in a 2020 report that came out strongly against the “techno-utopian” dream that eVTOLs represent. “Unfortunately, flying cars represent the technological apotheosis of sprawl,” he wrote, arguing that their adoption “will unleash development of pristine lands heretofore unattractive because of the limitations of distance and travel time”. The idea that transportation advances exacerbate sprawl is backed up by research. As speedier modes have been introduced over the centuries – from trains to streetcars to personal automobiles – workers’ typical commute times tend to remain stable, at about 30 minutes. That’s because faster options prompt people to move further from city centers. The principle, known as Marchetti’s Constant, has shaped the development of cities around the world for thousands of years. It’s what makes the modern suburbs possible. But suburbanites have a greater impact on the environment than city-dwellers in a dense urban core, and the difference is even greater for distant exurbs. “You’re now living in a place that probably doesn’t have as good public transit, and you probably need to drive to most places,” said Elizabeth Irvin, a transportation analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a left-leaning science advocacy group. “There might be a need to build more roads, and it all has a greater impact on land that was previously natural areas.” Beyond land use, mass adoption of this new technology could have unintended consequences for overall fossil fuel consumption even if it does lure drivers off the road. Reducing congestion can paradoxically increase traffic, if it makes driving more attractive to people who would have previously chosen other modes – a phenomenon known as induced demand. “Certainly looking to replace combustion engines with electric vehicles is a positive,” Irvin said. “But from an environmental perspective, it’s just not the whole picture.” Still, city leaders around the world see an advantage in preparing for the apparently inevitable arrival of eVTOLs and for whatever unintended consequences might come along with them. Like São Paulo, Los Angeles is a sprawling megalopolis known for its monumental traffic jams, which celebrities and business tycoons have long avoided with helicopters. That makes it a prime target for eVTOL developers, a fate that Mayor Eric Garcetti has embraced. Last year, LA teamed up with the World Economic Forum to produce a report called Principles of the Urban Sky, laying out guidelines and goals for urban air policy and regulations. And last December, Garcetti announced the creation of a local initiative to prepare for an eVTOL introduction as soon as 2023. Los Angeles learned hard lessons from the sudden appearance of other new transport modes, said Sam Morrissey, executive director of the non-profit Urban Movement Labs, which Garcetti created in 2019 and spun off from City Hall last year. Studies have shown that ride-hailing services draw riders from transit and make automobile traffic worse, as drivers cruise around waiting for fares. Meanwhile, e-scooters stirred up concerns about safety and confusion over whether they belonged on the sidewalk or the street. Creating an eVTOL policy in advance could help the city avoid those pitfalls and take advantage of opportunities to improve overall transportation equity and sustainability. “We have an opportunity to plan for this, so we’re exploring the best way to integrate this new technology into the existing transportation fabric,” said Clint Harper, the non-profit’s urban air mobility fellow. “We have gaps in the current transportation system that maybe we can be of service in trying to close.” That could mean requiring vertiports at train stations, or using eVTOLs to alleviate freeway traffic by combining air mobility with a congestion pricing scheme for cars. New revenues could even fund fare-free buses or trains. “If we do this in the right way, we can actually increase transit ridership and keep people from reverting to personal automobile travel.” Morrissey said. “The state and the county and the city all have very aggressive and very clear climate sustainability goals. And we’re trying to think of that complete transportation experience, end to end.”"

          "bodyText": "The Strand is a swathe of grassland made famous by Seamus Heaney’s poetry. It’s part of the floodplain of Lough Beg, the “little lake” pinched off from its much larger neighbour, Lough Neagh. At the end of the soggy Strand is Church Island – they became attached about 80 years ago when the River Bann was dredged. Hidden among the island’s trees is the remnant of a pre-Viking monastic settlement. People have been seeking this significant backwater for escape or restoration for a long time. But it’s not just people who flee here. Wildfowl come to escape harsher winters elsewhere. I head to Longpoint Wood at the edge of the Strand. Through the wood, I hear the waough-waough of buffeting wings. Those are mute swans, a resident species. Whooper swans, which overwinter in large numbers, have softer wingbeats with a barely-there echo of hiss. More tellingly, they whoop and whoop as they fly. Calling to each other holds the family group tight as they migrate from Iceland. The trees thin. The open water is rafted with silhouettes of mallard and coot. Among them, throngs of mute swans process with raised wings, irritated. I hear wigeon – so some migrants have arrived; but there’s no sign of the erect neck and sleek form that suggests whooper swan. Then, as I scan along an inlet, I find them. Two adults with yolk-yellow bills, and a brownish-grey juvenile. Was that juvenile hatched here? The question arises because small numbers of whooper swans have bred at Lough Beg for more than 20 years. Why it should forgo its urge to migrate is unclear. Injury can prompt the behaviour. The Icelandic population is increasing, which could lead to more intense competition for breeding territory. Improved foraging opportunities at wintering sites from changing agricultural practices could reinforce the benefits of range expansion by staying put. However, migrant whoopers have already reached Lough Foyle, 30 miles north-west. That youngster may have just got here. Alternatively, it may be about to encounter more of its kind than it ever has before. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

          "headline": "US public health in crisis as Covid prompts curbs on officials’ powers",
          "bodyText": "More than half of US states have introduced new laws to restrict public health actions, including policies requiring quarantine or isolation and mandating vaccines or masks. Between the new laws and the massive workforce departures during the pandemic, public health in America is now in crisis, experts say. The new restrictions and shortages not only affect responses to the coronavirus but also make it harder to contain outbreaks of the flu, measles and other health crises, and they put the US in a weaker position to combat future pandemics. “We’re very, very concerned about the rolling back of public health powers,” Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, told the Guardian. “We thought there was going to be a renaissance for public health, and we may be at the cusp of a major decline.” Separate investigations by Kaiser Health News and the New York Times found that at least 32 states have introduced about 100 new laws to restrict state and local authorities from addressing health crises. “It’s a pretty grim future,” David Rosner, a public health and social historian at Columbia University, told the Guardian. “This is an eye-opening moment in American history, where we see all of these traditions and ideas being mobilized to basically create discord rather than harmony around disease. I’ve just never seen this before.” Legislators in every US state have proposed bills to permanently limit officials’ ability to protect the public’s health. Some did not make it through the legislature or were vetoed by governors, while others are mired in legal battles. These measures include banning mask and vaccine mandates, overturning public health orders, curbing emergency powers and wresting control over school, church and business closures, among others. Local health officials are particularly worried about not being able to impose quarantines for those who have been exposed or isolation for those who test positive for the coronavirus or other infectious diseases, which allow them to spread unchecked. “Isolation and quarantine are really, really important steps that a public health department will take when there’s any kind of infectious disease outbreak,” Plescia said. “These are the kinds of powers that allow us to act very quickly and resolve infectious disease threats before they become more widespread.” Montana, for instance, has seen some of the greatest restrictions, with limits on quarantine and isolation requirements, new control from elected officials over health boards, and a ban on requiring vaccinations in workplaces – even in health systems. The new laws make it harder to isolate or quarantine patients with the flu or measles, and they could contribute to the spread of many vaccine-preventable illnesses. Montana is now experiencing one of the biggest surges of the pandemic, with the highest rate of new cases and the second-highest rates of hospitalizations and deaths at this time. Health systems across the state have enacted crisis of care standards. While some US states are seeing declines in cases, others are recording surges. New Mexico on Monday also cleared health systems to implement crisis of care standards as patients continue filling beds and worker shortages persist. Covid was still the leading cause of death in the US this week, according to a scientific model. Local leaders need to be able to make decisions that will help the communities in which they live and work, Blair Bryant, associate legislative director for health at the National Association of Counties, told the Guardian. “We never want to take away local control from any county official, much less a local public health official, in a pandemic. “There’s going to be a tremendous impact on how we’re able to respond to this pandemic, the next epidemic, as well as other infectious disease outbreaks,” Bryant said. Public health in the US was already poorly funded and understaffed before Covid hit. Many public health workers have faced long hours and short budgets while carrying out historically wide-scale campaigns around contact tracing, testing and vaccinating – all while seeing precipitous drops in public support and facing threats and harassment. More than 500 health officials have left the field through resignation, retirement or termination since the beginning of the pandemic. More than one in five Americans have seen a local health official depart during the biggest health crisis in a century, taking with them decades of invaluable experience. In North Dakota, three consecutive state health officers resigned in 2020. Overstretched health departments have also led to a surge in overdoses and a rise in sexually transmitted diseases, lead poisoning and more. About 80,000 more health workers – an 80% increase – are needed to continue providing basic health services, one report concluded. But little of the funding offered by the federal government has gone toward long-term public health planning, and it’s not clear if health departments will continue to have enough funding after the pandemic. And there’s the issue of finding people who want to work in the field at all, after witnessing the long hours and threats against health officials. “A lot of the really capable and talented people that you’d like to be able to have in these jobs are probably going to think twice about whether they would want to take the job,” Plescia said. “Some professionals are going to see these jobs as too risky.” Despite its troubled present, public health can still turn a corner and come out of the pandemic stronger, experts said. “The Covid-19 pandemic shed a light on the importance of public health,” Bryant said. Despite resistance, the measures and precautions that were implemented “are really making an impact on the spread of the virus”. “We have an opportunity to really make the system better,” Plescia said. But if restrictions and shortages are not reversed, “we’re going to be in trouble when the next pandemic comes along – much worse trouble than we were in this time.” Public health measures have been in effect in the US since the country’s founding, and Americans have long had an attitude of individualism that permeates health as well, Rosner said. But “emphasizing personal rights over collective responsibility” is a new phenomenon. “Health has always been something that we basically unite around. It’s the one function of government that usually is not questioned in any great degree – the right of the government to protect the health of its people,” Rosner said. Now, that’s changing – and the repercussions will reverberate. “It’s not just that public health has failed. It’s that the crisis of public health is a signal of a coming crisis in political culture,” Rosner said. “Ultimately, we’re dependent on all of us acting in a certain way, especially with infectious diseases. And if you have a lot of distrust – of the government, of authorities, if you have politicians mobilizing to engender that distrust – you’re in trouble. Which is what we are.”"

          "bodyText": "The British Medical Association’s GPs committee (GPC) has voted to reject an attempt by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, to force family doctors in England to see any patient who seeks an in-person appointment. Significantly, the GPC, which negotiates family doctors’ conditions with the Department of Health and NHS England, has also decided to move towards holding a ballot on industrial action. How did we get here? A key part of the motion that the 57 members of the GPC agreed as their response to the government’s plan made clear that they were “outraged by the deliberate, relentless denigration of GPs by government, NHS England … and certain quarters of the media”. The BMA and the Royal College of GPs are furious because they believe that recent statements by Javid, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, and the prime minister’s official spokesperson wrongly give the impression that family doctors are not working hard enough and are penalising patients and risking missing the chance to diagnose illness by not seeing them face to face. What happens next? The BMA’s ruling council has to rubberstamp the GPC’s decision. But the union hopes its move will prompt Javid to abandon the plan before any industrial action occurs. It is urging him to instead negotiate a new contract for GPs that would significantly reduce their workloads, which have been rising in recent years for various reasons, including the ageing and growing population, hospitals asking GPs and their teams to take over the care of discharged patients, and the shrinking number of full-time GPs. Can GPs take industrial action? They could, subject to the result of a ballot. But it is unclear what form that would take because family doctors are unlikely to stop seeing patients, given their key role as the initial way people with symptoms are assessed, diagnosed and treated, and as gatekeepers to wider NHS care in hospitals. How might industrial action affect patients? Minimally. The motion that the GPC passed would limit industrial action to just two areas. Family doctors would not agree to release details of their earnings (NHS England wants to force anyone earning at least £150,000 a year to declare it from next month) and they would not get involved in the issuing of Covid medical exemption certificates, which people who remain unvaccinated on medical grounds will need in order to work in social care, and potentially the NHS too. What will the practical impact of the BMA’s move be? England’s 6,600 GP surgeries could refuse to abide by Javid’s order on in-person consultations, which means patients would not get the right to be seen that way. They could also refuse to hand over details of how many patients were seen in person, to thwart Javid’s plan for what the BMA fears will be “a league table of shame” for doctors who see too few. It could also lead to practices halting the recruitment of the 26,000 allied health professionals – pharmacists, physiotherapists and mental health workers – that ministers want to see hired by 2024 to help take the pressure off GPs. So far about 10,000 such posts have been filled. Practices could resign from their local primary care network (PCN). That would then free them of contractual obligations to, for example, visit care homes at agreed intervals to check on residents’ health or undertake patients’ medication reviews. What does the BMA want? For Javid to drop his plan and enter talks on a new strategy that would reduce the growing pressure on GPs. The Department of Health did not immediately respond to the BMA’s move."

          "headline": "Biden’s pick for China ambassador says ‘we cannot trust the Chinese’ on Taiwan",
          "bodyText": "US president Joe Biden’s nominee to be ambassador to Beijing said on Wednesday that China was aggressive and untrustworthy, insisting that boosting Taiwan’s defences against the threat of Chinese invasion should be a US priority. Speaking to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which is due to confirm his appointment, Nicholas Burns denounced recent Chinese warplane incursions into Taiwan’s air defence zone, calling them “especially objectionable”. “We certainly cannot trust the Chinese” on the issue of Taiwan, Burns said. “Our responsibility is to make Taiwan a tough nut to crack.” The comments come amid increasing international pushback on Beijing’s actions towards Taiwan. On Thursday, the European parliament adopted a report calling on the EU to ramp up relations with Taiwan. Since 1979 the US has recognised the People’s Republic of China, but the US Congress simultaneously requires Washington to provide Taiwan with means of self-defence. The island has had its own government since the communist takeover of mainland China in 1949, but Beijing considers Taiwan a part of its territory to be assimilated one day, by force if necessary. However, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, recently urged a “peaceful reunification”. Burns – a career diplomat who has worked in a number of US administrations, under Democrats and Republicans – did not mince his words on Wednesday. He accused the Chinese government of being “an aggressor against India along their long Himalayan border, against Vietnam, the Philippines and others in the South China Sea, against Japan, in the East China Sea”. “Beijing has launched an intimidation campaign against Australia, and even more recently Lithuania,” he said. “The PRC’s genocide in Xinjiang, its abuses in Tibet, its smothering of Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms and its bullying of Taiwan are unjust and must stop.” But Burns stressed that China’s power should not be overestimated: “They have very few friends. They have no real allies.” “We ought not to exaggerate their strengths or underestimate the strengths of the United States,” he told the committee. “What we need is self confidence that the United States is a strong country.” On Thursday, an overwhelming majority of the European parliament voted for a report supporting an increase in EU-Taiwan relations, guided by the EU’s one-China policy. In a statement, the parliament hailed Taiwan as “a key EU partner and democratic ally in the Indo-Pacific,” and called for closer relations. It issued a warning over tensions in the Taiwan Strait, urged the scoping of a bilateral trade agreement, and expressed “deep concerns” over China’s military pressure against Taiwan. The text was approved with 580 votes in favour, 26 against, and 66 abstentions. “The European parliament’s first report on EU-Taiwan relations demonstrates that the EU is ready to upgrade its relationship with our key partner Taiwan,” said Charlie Weimers, the rapporteur on EU-Taiwan relations. The adopted report also proposed changing the name of the EU’s de facto diplomatic presence in Taiwan from the “European Economic and Trade Office” to “European Union Office in Taiwan”. Such a move is likely to prompt a rebuke from Beijing, which is hypersensitive to any move that suggests recognition of Taiwan’s sovereignty. In August, plans by Lithuania and Taiwan to open mutual offices with the name of Lithuania’s including “Taiwan” sparked a row in which China recalled its ambassador from Vilnius."

          "headline": "Barclays profits double as CEO brushes off inflation and supply chain fears",
          "bodyText": "Barclays almost doubled its third-quarter profit to £2bn as it benefited from strong mortgage lending in the UK and a boom in investment banking. The British bank’s profit before tax in the three months to September rose from £1.1bn a year ago, taking its year-to-date profit to an all-time high of £6.9bn. Barclays said a consumer recovery had contributed to the stronger performance, as well as higher investment banking fees. Jes Staley, the chief executive, said: “While the corporate and investment bank performance continues to be an area of strength for the group, we are also seeing evidence of a consumer recovery and the early signs of a more favourable rate environment.” He brushed off concerns over rising inflation and the supply chain crisis, saying the UK economy was on track to grow by 7% this year, its best performance since 1948. “The recovery from the pandemic has been quite robust,” Staley said, adding that annual inflation running at up to 4% would be manageable. “If it’s driven by economic growth that could be positive. A level of inflation driving a response from the bond market and interest rates moving up would be quite positive for Barclays.” He was also sanguine about the impact of supply chain shortages, which have left some supermarket shelves in Britain empty. “The supply chain disruptions are there. It’s not holding back an economy that’s going to grow at 7%. Its long-term impact will be quite modest.” Staley, along with 200 other business leaders, attended a global investment summit held in London this week. “There was a reasonable degree of optimism coming out of that summit,” he said. Barclays has released bad debt provisions of £622m so far this year as the economy recovers from the pandemic and it reckons it will need less to cover bad debts. This is in stark contrast with this time last year when Barclays had set aside £4.3bn to cover bad debts, but government support measures propped up businesses. Barclays said it was “well positioned for a rising rate environment”, as expectations mount that inflation pressures will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Personal banking income in the UK climbed 10% to £2.9bn in the first nine months of the year, reflecting strong growth in mortgages and deposits, and boosted by the end of Covid-related customer support measures. Tushar Morzaria, the bank’s finance director, said UK banks “will be very focused on reviewing their pricing” on mortgage deals as interest rates go up. But he insisted that mortgage rates were still “extremely low” by historical standards and that the market was “very, very competitive”. Barclays plans further cost-cutting measures before the end of the year including in the UK, but did not give details on potential branch closures or job cuts. Barclays’ investment bank had a bumper quarter, similar to its Wall Street rivals which beat profit forecasts last week. Investment banking fees and equity trading income posted their best nine-month performances on record. This resulted in a return on equity for the overall investment bank of 16.4%, up from 10.5% in the same period last year. Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “A record profit for Barclays in the third quarter is illustrative of the turnaround in fortunes the UK’s major banks have had compared to where they were this time last year. Barclays has delivered a strong set of numbers and is striking a good balance between reinvesting in its businesses and delivering returns to shareholders.”"

          "headline": "The great betrayal: how the Hillsborough families were failed by the justice system",
          "bodyText": "On a grey morning in May this year, the English legal system’s epic failure to secure justice for the families devastated by the Hillsborough disaster finally ground to its dismal conclusion. Ninety-seven people were killed due to a terrible crush on an overcrowded terrace at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough football stadium on 15 April 1989. Since then, the families have endured a 32-year fight for the truth to be accepted – that the main cause of the disaster was police negligence, and for those responsible to be held accountable. The first bereaved parents I met when I began reporting on the disaster and the families’ implacable campaign for justice, in 1996, were Phil and Hilda Hammond, whose son, Philip, had died at Hillsborough, aged 14. Hilda, who worked as a senior intensive care nurse at Liverpool’s Walton hospital, told me that, unbearable as their loss was, she had still been able to understand that disasters can happen. She expected that the authorities would hold prompt and rigorous proceedings. “I thought they would find the truth of how Philip died, how they all died, and if anybody was found to be to blame they would be punished,” she said. “I was so naive.” Instead of committing to a process that would lead to justice for the people who had died, their families and those who were injured, South Yorkshire police mounted a campaign of lies, and the courts, through a series of proceedings, piled on more trauma. The people who died at Hillsborough were trapped against a high metal fence at the front of the Leppings Lane terrace, the kind built at many grounds to prevent people invading the pitch, in an era when hooliganism by a minority of thugs led to the demonisation of all football supporters. Behind the fence, railings divided the terrace into a series of “pens”. Built to enable greater police control of supporters, when the pens were overcrowded they became iron cages from which there was no escape. When Lee Nicol, 14, died two days later, 95 people had been killed. Then in 1993, Tony Bland, 18 when he went to the match, became the 96th when his life support was turned off. In July 2021, Andrew Devine, who was 22 at Hillsborough, died 32 years after suffering brain damage in the crush, and was certified to be the 97th fatality. The lies began even as people were dying. The police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield, failed to take control of the chaos and organise a concerted rescue operation, but he started the false narrative that would form the foundation of enduring injustice. In an episode still profoundly shocking decades on, at 3.15pm Duckenfield lied to the Football Association official, Graham Kelly, telling him that Liverpool supporters had forced open a gate, and rushed into the Leppings Lane end of the ground. That story was given to the media and at 3.25pm, John Motson reported in a live BBC broadcast that a gate was said to have been broken down, and that non-ticket holders had forced their way in. Right away, the victims were being blamed for their own deaths and injuries. The South Yorkshire police chief constable, Peter Wright, admitted hours later that the gate had not been forced open – Duckenfield himself had given the order for it to be opened. The police had failed to organise a safe way for the 24,000 Liverpool supporters to access the stadium, through the nasty, obstacle-strewn bottleneck approach to the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end. Congestion built up at those entrances, then at 2.52pm Duckenfield ordered a wide exit gate to be opened, to relieve the pressure by allowing many people into the ground at once. About 2,000 people then came in together, and most headed down a tunnel facing them that led straight into the already packed central pens. If Duckenfield had ordered officers to close access to the tunnel and direct people to the side pens where there was still room, the crush would have been avoided. Yet despite Duckenfield’s original story being exposed as a lie, the police nevertheless constructed a case that Liverpool supporters caused the dangerous situation outside the ground, by arriving without tickets, late, drunk and misbehaving. The essential truth was established by Lord Taylor just four months after the disaster, in his report after the official inquiry. He concluded that the main cause of the disaster was “the failure of police control”, and described Duckenfield neglecting to close off the tunnel after ordering the exit gate to be opened as “a blunder of the first magnitude”. Taylor severely criticised the South Yorkshire police for failing to accept responsibility and pressing a false case against the victims. Yet even then, the police advanced the same allegations at the inquest the following year, and all the legal proceedings that followed, in which the families sought the truth and justice for their loved ones. The legal system that dragged bereaved families through 32 years of adversarial battles finally concluded its work in May. The result is that nobody has been held accountable for 97 people dying, nor for the police campaign of lies designed to shift blame on to the victims. The families and their advocates are now calling for reform, for a “Hillsborough law” and a public advocate to repair some of the system’s worst injustices. Valuable as that will be, when you consider the whole ordeal, it makes the case for a complete overhaul. * * * On the weekday night 25 years ago that I first met Phil and Hilda Hammond, Hilda just back from work in her nurse’s uniform, we sat around the kitchen table for hours at their immaculate semi-detached home in Aigburth, south Liverpool. Their younger son Graeme, still a teenager, popped in and out, as his parents related the events that devastated their family. Phil, a post office manager, was vice-chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG), at the forefront of the struggle for justice. When I asked what their son Philip was like, Phil grimaced, his face reddened; he said he struggled to talk about him. Then they did tell me about Philip’s talents, his leadership qualities, enthusiasm for sport, how well he was growing up. Eventually Phil said simply: “He was a great lad, a great person to know.” They talked about the unbelievable shock of his death, the pain of the police lies, the poison published by the Sun under the headline “The Truth”, the betrayal by the West Midlands police, which was appointed by South Yorkshire police to investigate the disaster. They recalled the nightmare daily slog to Sheffield for the inquest – the legal process to determine how, when and where a person has died where there is some doubt or issue of public concern. The South Yorkshire coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, gave serious credence to the police allegations against the victims. Bereaved families had no right to legal aid funding and could afford only a single barrister, who was outnumbered by those representing the police, who were paid for using public money. In March 1991, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The Hammonds, and all the families, felt it was a grievous miscarriage of justice. I wrote about these travesties in a 1997 book, The Football Business, contrasting football’s escalating fortunes after the disaster with the families’ abandonment to a terrible fight that prevented them from rebuilding their lives. In the same year, Prof Phil Scraton, the principal academic expert on the Hillsborough injustice, exposed that South Yorkshire police had an operation to amend officers’ accounts of the day to minimise criticism of senior officers. Yet despite that scandal and more revelations, years passed, into the bleak 00s, with the justice campaign building strongly in Liverpool but too little media coverage, and nothing solid moving for the families. The 20th anniversary wasn’t news, it was just a dreadful landmark, but one the media would cover. I was working for the Guardian by then, and was determined that we would use the moment to highlight the enduring injustice. My article, published on 13 April 2009, focused on the issues the Hammonds had outlined 13 years earlier, the amendments to South Yorkshire police officers’ statements, and deepening concerns about the role of West Midlands police. I went to see Anne Williams, whose son Kevin, 15, died in the crush, and who pursued repeated challenges to the Popper inquest. Maria Eagle, the Merseyside MP who had made an excoriating speech in parliament in 1998, accusing South Yorkshire police of running a “black propaganda unit” to shift blame on to the innocent victims, stood by this view, and we ran that on the front page. On the morning we published, Andy Burnham, then Labour’s culture secretary, called me to say he had read it, and had resolved to do something to address the injustice. He had formed the view that if the South Yorkshire police and other authorities published all the documents they held in their files, it could break the legal deadlock. Two days later, he addressed the memorial service at Anfield, attended by 30,000 people. As Burnham read a statement from the prime minister, Gordon Brown, that expressed sympathy but did not address the injustice, he was interrupted by calls from the crowd, for justice. Confronted with that strength of feeling, Brown’s government finally understood that this was an unresolved scandal, and gave Burnham support for his initiative. The Hillsborough Independent Panel was formed, tasked with producing a report, for publication, that would set out what the documents added to public understanding of the disaster and its aftermath. South Yorkshire police and the families agreed to participate with the panel as constituted, after the families had held out for Scraton to be on it. Paul Leighton, recently retired as deputy chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, was appointed as the police expert, Dr Bill Kirkup as the medical expert, and James Jones, the bishop of Liverpool, as chair. The panel presented its report, after two and a half years’ work, on 12 September 2012, beneath the soaring vaults and gleaming light of Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral. The families were given the report first, with an explanation from Scraton and Jones of how completely the evidence had vindicated their struggle. Then the prime minister, David Cameron, made a double apology in parliament: for the police failings that caused the deaths, and “the injustice of the denigration of the deceased”. It was a momentous breakthrough. Many people affected still refer to it as “truth day”. Walking through Liverpool that night, I met survivors hugging one another in disbelief, cradling the 395-page report as if it were a holy book. The Independent Office for Police Conduct launched its biggest investigation, in October 2012, into the campaign of victim blaming and alleged cover-up. A new police investigation, Operation Resolve, was also mounted into how the disaster had happened, and whether any criminal charges should be brought. In December 2012, three high court judges took just an hour to quash the verdict of the inquest the families had campaigned against to no avail for 21 years. In a dark, cramped, wood-panelled courtroom in the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand, the lord chief justice, Igor Judge, lamented the “falsity” of the South Yorkshire police campaign to blame the victims and how “disappointingly tenacious” it had been. He criticised Popper’s conduct of the inquest, and stated that, after Taylor’s August 1989 conclusions that failure of police control had been the main reason for the disaster, “That should have been that”. Judge said the changing of the police statements seemed “reprehensible” and referred to them as “efforts made by some of the authorities to conceal evidence”. He ordered a new inquest to be held, in effect calling for the truths established by Taylor, and now by the panel, to be accepted. “We should deprecate this new inquest degenerating into the kind of adversarial battle which … scarred the original inquest,” he stated, in his written legal judgment. It was a great landmark, an extraordinary victory for the families. But in that courtroom, it all still felt a very long way from good enough. There was a self-satisfied air around the room and among the judges, in their wigs and gowns on the raised platform. But this represented a monumental failure of their system. The families, bereft, had been forced to fight this unequal battle that had robbed them of so many years. In that long span of time, family members had suffered, many had become ill, some had died. Phil Hammond, HFSG chair by then, had banged his head on a shelf in the group’s office in 2008, and suffered a near fatal brain haemorrhage. Hilda had had to give up her job to help nurse him. Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, had died at Hillsborough, had taken over as the chair. Anne Williams had been one of the family members who had applied for the inquest to be quashed in 1993. Now she was brought to the Strand by her brother in a wheelchair, having been diagnosed with cancer just after the panel reported. She had promised herself that when she eventually won her fight, she would live a little, but she died four months later, never seeing the new inquest for Kevin that she had sought for all that time. * * * Even before the new inquest fully started in March 2014, the families were made to understand that lord chief justice, Lord Judge’s comment, that it should not become another adversarial battle, had no legal power. Duckenfield’s barrister, John Beggs QC, and lawyers for other former senior police officers and junior officers in the Police Federation, stated at a preliminary hearing their intention to argue yet again that Liverpool supporters’ drinking was a factor in causing the disaster. The law had no mechanism to enable the call by Judge, the head of the judiciary, to be heeded. Court proceedings start with the illusion, for a new jury, that no facts or conclusions have ever been established before. South Yorkshire police officers and their lawyers came to the new inquest and rolled out the same discredited case against the victims. Adversarial battle, and the hurt and scars it inflicts, are what the English legal system provides. It has a chance of working only if there are equal forces doing battle. This time, the families had their own battalions of lawyers to fight back. The new inquest, presided over by Sir John Goldring, was held under article 2, the right to life, of the European convention on human rights. Incorporated into British law as the Human Rights Act 1998 by the Labour government, its more enlightened provisions allow for bereaved families to have “exceptional funding” for lawyers at an inquest, if the state may have been at fault for the deaths. The families, for the first time, had enough committed solicitors from some leading law firms specialising in human rights, including Birnberg Peirce and Bindmans. In Liverpool, solicitor Elkan Abrahamson, of Broudie Jackson Canter, had represented some families for years, including Williams, for no payment. Now his firm was funded to steward 22 families through this next battle. The barristers, led by Michael Mansfield QC and Pete Weatherby QC, were rigorous, experienced at fighting miscarriages of justice, and not shy of accusing police officers of lying. They argued successfully that the families had to be at the heart of the process this time, so the inquest opened with bereaved relatives making personal statements about their loved ones, telling the court about the people whose deaths were the subject of the evidence. This has since become a humanising force in our system, with family statements made at inquests and inquiries, including those for the victims of the Grenfell fire, and the Manchester Arena bombing. The families’ loving, detailed reminiscences were shattering. They recalled the men, women and many children whose disastrous misfortune it was to be in those vile pens. They remembered their characters, sense of humour, friendships, schooling, careers, interests, religious observance, how much they loved them, how much they missed them. Steve Kelly, speaking about his older brother Michael, 38, set the tone. In a deep, controlled voice, he told the silent room that his brother was “our Mike”, not just a number, one of the 96. “I have come here to reclaim him,” he said. Mary Corrigan said of her son Keith McGrath, 17, that when he was born “a love I had never experienced before surged out of me for him”. When Keith died, she said, “a part of me died”. They told some funny stories too. Brenda Fox recalled that on her son Steve’s 21st birthday his colleagues at the chocolate factory had chucked him in a vat of the stuff. The next day, she brought a picture in to show everyone, of Steve standing dripping in the chocolate, with a rueful smile on his face. Jenni and Trevor Hicks talked about their teenage daughters, Sarah, 19, and Vicki, 15, and the total impact of their loss. Three sets of brothers also died: Nick and Carl Hewitt, Kevin and Christopher Traynor, Stephen and Gary Harrison. A father and son, Thomas Howard and Tommy Jr, died next to each other. The contours of the loss were mapped: the youngest to die was Jon-Paul Gilhooley, 10. The oldest was Gerard Baron, 67, a war veteran then a Royal Mail employee. Thirty-seven teenagers had died. Twenty-five of those who died were fathers; 58 people lost a parent. Three babies were born after their fathers died at Hillsborough. One woman, Inger Shah, was the single mother of two teenagers, Becky and Daniel. After she died, they had to be taken into care. Then, after all these cherished memories of the 96 were heard, the police and their lawyers reheated the long-discredited allegations against the victims, and adversarial battle commenced. The families’ lawyers fiercely challenged every allegation, depicting the false narrative as a cover-up orchestrated from the top of the South Yorkshire police. A very obvious feature of the disaster became steadily apparent: the police had told their stories, but the whole day had been filmed and photographed. Hundreds of photographs of the crowd were shown on the court screens, and BBC and CCTV footage played repeatedly. It showed congestion at the too-few Leppings Lane turnstiles started at 2.15pm, 45 minutes before the scheduled kick-off, not “late”, the police doing nothing effective to address it until the panicked opening of the exit gate, the people walking through, the open tunnel straight ahead. The inquest addressed in unbearable detail the horrific crush that followed, the piles of bodies at the front of pen 3, how people died, of compression asphyxia. The chaos of the police response was clear, and the heroic efforts of supporters who emerged from the pens then did their best to help, running with dead and injured people placed on advertising hoardings because only two ambulances came on to the pitch. In all the film and photographs, Liverpool supporters were not misbehaving, and nobody was carrying a drink. Many survivors came as witnesses; they included off-duty police officers, doctors and nurses, and the humanity of the people who suffered made the police portrayal of them as an out-of-control mob look cruel, and evidently false. Then Duckenfield crumbled as a witness. He admitted he had not done sufficient preparation, did not know the basic layout of the ground, did not take effective action to enable 24,000 people to get through that bottleneck in time and ultimately, that in the crucial moments after ordering the gate open, he “froze”. He admitted when questioned by his own barrister, that his “serious professional failures” had caused the deaths of the 96. The jury returned their verdict on 26 April 2016. They determined that the 96 were unlawfully killed, due to gross negligence manslaughter by Duckenfield, to a criminal standard of proof – beyond reasonable doubt. And they concluded, having been explicitly asked the question, that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters had contributed to the dangerous situation at the ground. The truth was accepted, and the families, their loved ones, survivors, all the victims, were finally vindicated. The Guardian’s front page the following morning had a picture of some family members – Brenda Fox, mother of Steve, in the centre – standing in the sunshine outside the court building, arms aloft, singing You’ll Never Walk Alone, Liverpool’s anthem of hope and endurance. Above was the headline: “After 27 years, justice.” * * * Many families have since lamented how much better it would have been if that could have stood as the end of the ordeal. Yet if 96 people have been unlawfully killed, and the accounts given by a police force and its officers wholly disbelieved by a jury, the system has to provide some accountability. But the system is not coherent. It does not adopt the conclusions and facts as established by one legal process, and determine how to hold accountable the people and organisations whose fault has been proved. Every stage is entirely separate. To seek accountability, the law moved to criminal prosecutions – a wholly new set of proceedings. The Crown Prosecution Service, the public authority responsible for bringing criminal cases, charged Duckenfield in June 2017 with gross negligence manslaughter. The former Sheffield Wednesday secretary and safety officer, Graham Mackrell, was charged with safety offences. Sir Norman Bettison, a South Yorkshire police inspector at the time, who later became chief constable of Merseyside police, was charged with misconduct in a public office, but that prosecution collapsed in 2018. Two other former South Yorkshire police officers, Ch Supt Donald Denton and Det Ch Insp Alan Foster, and the force’s then solicitor, Peter Metcalf, were charged with perverting the course of justice, by having the officers’ accounts amended. The facts of how the 96 were killed were, by definition, exactly the same as those the inquest jury had heard. But Duckenfield’s trial, which began in January 2019 at Preston crown court, would be conducted in front of a new jury, with the facts up for grabs again. The families found themselves on the sidelines again, spectators to an English court and its ceremonials: wigs and gowns, the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, in red robe, the royal coat of arms, dating back to 1399, on the wall behind him. Victims and their families in a criminal trial have no right to legal representation, and very limited participation in the process. “The Crown” is still the prosecutor. The family members who did regularly attend in the downstairs gloom of court No 1 at Preston – Jenni Hicks, Christine Burke, whose father, Henry, 46, was killed at Hillsborough, and Louise Brookes, who lost her older brother Andrew, 26, were regulars – sat in seats for the public, separated from the main court area by glass screens. Margaret Aspinall described it as “horrible, like we families were in the dock, not Duckenfield”. Like many, she chose mostly to attend a live broadcast in Liverpool, at the council’s Cunard building. An effort was made there to make the families comfortable, with a small room where they could sit, and have tea and biscuits. The CPS had appointed Richard Matthews QC, an expert on health and safety and gross negligence manslaughter, to lead the prosecution. Very quickly, families became alarmed by the way he presented the case, and the direction it took. Despite a 30-year fight for justice, Duckenfield’s barrister, Ben Myers QC, was able to advance the same case the inquest jury had rejected three years earlier, that supporters created the dangerous situation outside the ground because many arrived without tickets, late, had been drinking, and did not comply with police orders. The families’ lawyers had successfully challenged it all at the inquest, but now, Matthews barely contested it at all. The families had to watch as the conclusions of the inquest were ignored. On 13 February 2019, a former South Yorkshire police officer, Insp Stephen Ellis, broke down while recalling people heading down the tunnel to the central pens after the exit gate was opened. The court took a break, during which Matthews and Myers agreed to have some of Ellis’s 1989 statement read, instead of him having to continue giving evidence. This meant whatever was read would stand as evidence, unchallenged by the prosecution. But the sections agreed included severe allegations against supporters; Ellis had stated that supporters had been drinking, were pushing, that they were “gripped by a mania” to get into the ground at any cost, that fans had dived over turnstiles to get in. There was a great deal of similar police evidence, not borne out by the video footage, and the families’ lawyers at the inquest had challenged every officer who made such claims, including Ellis. In response to my questions after the trial, the CPS explained that it couldn’t challenge the evidence due to the rules of court. The Crown had a duty to “prosecute the case fairly and call a cross section of witnesses”, the CPS said, which included calling police officers to give their account of what happened. According to the rules: “The prosecution is not permitted to ‘challenge’ the evidence of its own witnesses.” So a series of police officers, called by the prosecution, gave evidence that had been discredited at the inquest, and the prosecution allowed it to stand. The families, having fought 30 years against this narrative, made their views known very directly, urging Matthews to fight harder, and the atmosphere became fraught. Stephanie Conning, a regular attender in Preston, is a survivor, having been at Hillsborough aged 18 with her older brother Rick Jones, 25, and his partner, Tracey Cox, 23, who both died in the crush. They were among those who were outside the ground at 2.52pm and came through the exit gate when the police opened it. She told me: “It has always been traumatic to have these accusations made against us, against our loved ones, and it has taken a great toll on the families to have to fight this, for so long. But we’ve also seen this can work on a jury, and it’s maddening that the CPS won’t challenge it.” The families also had concerns that Openshaw was sympathetic to Duckenfield. The judge allowed him to sit in the court with his lawyers, rather than in the dock, where accused people routinely sit, isolated, to be studied by a jury. Openshaw later explained in a ruling that this was part of making allowances for Duckenfield’s mental health, including post-traumatic stress disorder. But such a concession to a defendant is rare. Sitting next to his solicitors, wearing his dark suit, made Duckenfield appear less like the accused, more like a victim himself. Myers played hard on that impression, portraying Duckenfield as a pitiful old man who had been “hounded” for 30 years, and was being made a scapegoat for wider failings. “Just look at him!” Myers pleaded with the jury during his closing speech. In his summing up, which began on 21 March 2019, Openshaw solemnly recited as credible evidence all the allegations of supporters drinking, not having tickets and being late, including Ellis’s evidence of supporters’ “mania”. But the judge also added his own explanation about Duckenfield’s lie. He suggested to the jury that it had not been a lie at all. As the crisis at Hillsborough was developing, before Duckenfield ordered the exit gate open, two other police officers had briefly said in Duckenfield’s hearing, mistakenly, that a gate had been forced. The judge told the jury that Duckenfield may have genuinely formed that impression himself, and it was “not at all surprising”. It was, after everything, still a shocking experience to hear Openshaw say that. Everybody in the courtroom – except the jury – knew that Duckenfield himself had always admitted that he lied, as far back as the Taylor inquiry, where he had apologised for it. Yet in that Preston courtroom, everybody was powerless to say anything. Journalists are prohibited, while a trial is proceeding, from commenting or writing anything other than reporting what is said in court that day. My work on the disaster had always involved investigating the past miscarriage of justice, the first inquest, but this was a new feeling, of being trapped in a miscarriage of justice as it was happening. The families had to endure it, silently, in the public seats. I saw Jenni Hicks during a break, near the top of the dark curved steps up to ground level. She said listening to Openshaw’s summing up was rolling the years back, like sitting through Popper’s travesty all over again. “I feel like I’m back in 1991,” she said. After eight days considering their verdict, the jury returned to say they could not reach the required minimum majority of 10-2. Matthews immediately told Openshaw he would be applying for a retrial. Over the summer, some families held a heated meeting with senior CPS officials, protesting at Matthews’s handling of the case, and saying Openshaw should be asked to withdraw. The CPS say they took advice about the judge and decided not to make such an application. They told families they were making improvements to their case, and urged them to remain positive. So the retrial began on 7 October, in the same court, with the same barristers, and Openshaw still presiding. Everybody had to stand again and bow when he walked in. Some differences were made in the CPS presentation of the case, but broadly it followed the same pattern: Myers and individual police officers alleged yet again that supporters misbehaved outside the ground, Matthews barely challenging that narrative. This time, on 28 November 2019, the jury, having done their civic duty of assessing what was presented to them, acquitted Duckenfield. Perhaps as they left the court the jury members saw the incensed reaction of the families, finally released from their enforced silence, Jenni Hicks, Christine Burke and Louise Brookes raging in interviews under TV lights. Only then could the previous findings be reported again, so perhaps the jury members learned for the first time about the inquest determinations, and the new legal position their verdict had established. Ninety-six people had been unlawfully killed due to Duckenfield’s gross negligence manslaughter, and the victims, Liverpool supporters, were fully vindicated. But now, Duckenfield was not guilty of the criminal offence of gross negligence manslaughter, and the police accusations against the victims had been reinstated. * * * The venue for the last act in the legal system’s Hillsborough saga could look like a cruel, knowing joke. Hilda Hammond told me years before that the stage-managed moves of the Popper inquest were “like going to the theatre”. Now, due to Covid requirements, the concluding trial, of Metcalf, Denton and Foster, charged with perverting the course of public justice, started on 20 April in an actual theatre: the Lowry in Salford. The families who attended – Jenni Hicks and Christine Burke, with her daughter Cherine, were regulars – were given seats in the upper circle. The judge, Mr Justice William Davis, was up on stage in his wig and crimson robe, the coat of arms behind him. The barristers, in wigs and gowns, were arranged in rows on the floor of the theatre, under lights. As they stood to make their speeches, the unavoidable illusion was created that this was a scripted drama, conceived by a playwright as an indictment of England’s archaic legal system. Given the national outcry that the changing of statements had always caused, the prosecution seemed strangely lame. The opening speech by CPS barrister, Sarah Whitehouse QC, was restrained, and seemed to minimise the families’ outrage that the police had perpetrated a cover-up. She said the trial “is not about the causes of the disaster” or whose fault it was, but this was confusing, given her own allegation that the statements were changed to “mask the failings” of the police. It meant that original police allegations against supporters were read out in court without context or challenge. Steve Kelly, who watched the live broadcast in Liverpool with dismay, wrote to Max Hill, the director of public prosecutions, after the trial. He described the prosecution as “a feeble effort,” saying he was “constantly in a state of shock” hearing the allegations, which he considered to be direct accusations against his brother Mike. Hill has fully defended the CPS’s work, telling the House of Commons justice committee in June 2021: “I maintain that we did everything we could, and we applied all of the vigour that we could.” The case did not even make it as far as being decided by the jury. The curtain came down on 26 May when Davis stopped the trial. He cleared Denton, saying that the chief superintendent had only been following advice from Metcalf, the solicitor, about having the police officers’ statements amended. The judge’s wider reasoning makes for a seriously concerning set of assertions about the law itself. The criminal offence of “perverting the course of public justice” could not have been committed by any of the three defendants, he ruled, because the Taylor inquiry, to which the amended statements were sent, was not a “course of public justice”, like a court case. But Popper’s inquest could not have been perverted either, because its scope was narrower before the Human Rights Act, Davis said. That appears deeply questionable, because Popper’s inquest did consider the circumstances of the disaster, dwelt on the police allegations particularly the claims about drinking, and the lord chief justice had quashed it in 2012 partly on the basis that the police case was false. Davis also decided that the South Yorkshire police and Metcalf, as the force’s lawyer, had no legal “duty of candour” to the inquest, meaning they were not required to be fully open and truthful. So the legal findings delivered as the final scene of the Hillsborough tragedy were these: police and their solicitor can falsify evidence to a public inquiry without committing a criminal offence, and they did not have to be wholly truthful to an inquest. Also, there was a section about a solicitor’s duties under English law, in which Davis noted that if a solicitor “realises that the court is acting on a false basis”, there is “no duty to correct the court or to draw the court’s attention to the true position”. So, a solicitor can be aware that a miscarriage of justice is being perpetrated, and has no duty to correct it. Whitehouse rose and, to the families’ surprise, said the CPS was not going to appeal this ruling. Up in the circle, Burke stood up, as she had in Preston when Duckenfield was acquitted, and in front of the jury, she said calmly again, that her father had been killed at Hillsborough, and that nobody had ever been held to account for it. Davis told her to sit down and be quiet. The judge told the jury foreman to state formally that Metcalf, Denton and Foster were not guilty. And that was it. Thirty-two years of legal proceedings were over. After 97 people were unlawfully killed at an FA Cup semi final, and a major police force constructed a false case to blame the victims, nobody had been held to account. Only Mackrell, the former Sheffield Wednesday secretary, has been convicted, of a safety offence related to allocating only seven turnstiles for the 10,100 people with tickets to stand on the Leppings Lane terrace. He had been fined £6,500. In the grey and unseasonal cold on the forecourt outside the Lowry, Burke, Hicks and the family of Brian Matthews, a married financial consultant who died at Hillsborough aged 38, stood and talked to the media, lambasting the ruling and the process. At a press conference outside Liverpool’s Anfield stadium, Aspinall, standing alongside Burnham, raged at what the families had been put through, calling it “a complete and utter disgrace”, and said the whole system needed to change. Like many family members, Hicks reflects now that after so long a fight, she must now try to live her life. “Who knows what was lost that day when my daughters didn’t come home? There may have been grandchildren, and their children. My daughters went to watch a football match and I feel like their lives were just ripped away, through the lack of police control. “And these 32 years, what they put us through: I feel betrayed, by judges and by police. It has been a betrayal of everything I was brought up to believe about my own country. Your brain can’t compute why it’s acceptable in a British court to bring back evidence that was dismissed years earlier. The injustice and grief run alongside each other; it’s like a knife in your heart. “We’ve fought for our own loved ones, but there has been a strong feeling of responsibility, too: that if there is no accountability, this can happen to other people.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

          "headline": "Egypt detains artist robot Ai-Da before historic pyramid show",
          "bodyText": "She has been described as “a vision of the future” who is every bit as good as other abstract artists today, but Ai-Da – the world’s first ultra-realistic robot artist – hit a temporary snag before her latest exhibition when Egyptian security forces detained her at customs. Ai-Da is due to open and present her work at the Great Pyramid of Giza on Thursday, the first time contemporary art has been allowed next to the pyramid in thousands of years. But because of security issues over the cameras in Ai-Da’s eyes, both Ai-Da and her sculpture were held in Egyptian customs for 10 days, sparking a diplomatic fracas and prompting her creator to deny that she was a spy. “The British ambassador has been working through the night to get Ai-Da released, but we’re right up to the wire now,” said Aidan Meller, the human force behind Ai-Da, shortly before her release. “It’s really stressful.” According to Meller, border guards detained Ai-Da at first because she had a modem, and then because she had cameras in her eyes (which she uses to draw and paint). “I can ditch the modems, but I can’t really gouge her eyes out,” he said. She was finally cleared through customs on Wednesday evening, hours before the exhibition was due to start, with the British embassy in Cairo saying they were “glad” the case had been resolved. Both Ai-Da and her sculpture had been sent in specialised flight cases by air cargo to Cairo before the Forever Is Now exhibition, which runs until 7 November and is presented by the consultancy firm Art D’Égypte in partnership with the Egyptian ministry of antiquities and tourism and the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs. The exhibition will showcase works by leading Egyptian and international artists including Stephen Cox, Lorenzo Quinn, Moataz Nasr and Alexander Ponomarev. Ai-Da’s 2 x 2.5-metre sculpture is a play on the riddle of the sphinx – “What goes on four feet in the morning, two feet at noon, and three feet in the evening?” – the answer to which is a human. “Four legs is when you’re a toddler, two legs is when you’re an adult, and three is when you’re elderly and need a walking stick,” Meller said. “So Ai-Da produced an enormous version of herself with three legs. We’re saying that actually, with the new Crispr technology coming through, and the way we can do gene-editing today, life extension is actually very likely. The ancient Egyptians were doing exactly the same thing with mummification. Humans haven’t changed: we still have the desire to live for ever. But all of that comes to nought if we can’t get her released.” Named after the computing pioneer Ada Lovelace, Ai-Da was built by a team of programmers, roboticists, art experts and psychologists. The multimillion-pound project was completed in 2019 and is updated as AI technology improves. The robot’s artwork, including “the first self-portrait with no self” has been displayed at the Design Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, and she has previously spoken to the Guardian about her own inspirations. Meller, an Oxford gallerist, said he always hoped his project would prompt debate about the rapid rise of AI technology. “She is an artist robot, let’s be really clear about this. She is not a spy. People fear robots, I understand that. But the whole situation is ironic, because the goal of Ai-Da was to highlight and warn of the abuse of technological development, and she’s being held because she is technology. Ai-Da would appreciate that irony, I think.” He added: “We’re well aware that the fictions of 1984 and Brave New World are now facts. AI is developing rapidly. For the first time tens of thousands of graduates will have degrees in machine learning. The supercomputer can use vast data and process extraordinary algorithms. We predict by 2025 there will be big disruption with technology, and Ai-Da is trying to use art to bring attention to that.” Meller thanked the British embassy and Art d’Égypte their “amazing work” in trying to get her released. Other artworks seized or impounded by authorities An artwork by the British artist and war veteran Bran Symondson was seized at Houston airport and banned from entering the US in 2016. The work – three decommissioned, non-working AK-47s embellished with dollar bills and butterflies – was to have been shown at a pop-up exhibition at La Colombe d’Or gallery. “All the paperwork needed was in order, but they still refused to release his art,” the gallery director said at the time. In 2018, Belgian authorities seized more than £12m worth of art by the British graffiti artist Banksy over claims it was being displayed illegally. Bailiffs took 58 pieces, including Girl With Balloon and Kissing Coppers, from the Strokar Inside art gallery in Brussels. The work was loaned from a German company called On Entertainment, but Banksy’s former manager said it should never have been transported. A lawyer for Strokar Inside said his clients had been caught up in a “crazy story”. Earlier this year, a statue looted from Libya in 2011 was seized by border officials at Heathrow. The second-century BC statue, which depicts the goddess Demeter or her daughter Persephone, was illicitly excavated from an underground site in Cyrene. Also this year, German custom authorities seized a Roman bronze bust of Hercules on the grounds that it did not have an export licence from the country of origin, a requirement for all archaeological treasures imported to Germany. The Viennese antiquities dealer who bought the bust from a US dealer and was taking it to Austria only retrieved it after taking legal action. Last year, a painting by the French surrealist artist Yves Tanguy, reportedly worth more than €250,000 ($340,000), was thrown away by crew at Düsseldorf airport after the owner forgot the painting at a check-in counter. It was recovered by German police at the bottom of a recycling bin. • This article was amended on 25 October 2021 to clarify text related to the circumstances of Ai-Da’s detention by Egyptian customs."

          "headline": "Premier League clubs v Newcastle: inside the stunning emergency vote",
          "bodyText": "Why did all 20 clubs get together? It was the follow-up to a special meeting that 19 of the clubs had last Tuesday, which was to discuss their concerns about the Saudi-led £305m takeover of Newcastle and its implications for them. Newcastle were excluded from that meeting, which was extraordinary in itself. How often do 19 clubs convene to talk strategically about just one? The other clubs have worried about the potential for Newcastle’s uber-rich owners to strike commercial deals with companies in Saudi Arabia that could give them an advantage. And so, as the Guardian revealed, the clubs proposed the draft of a rule change that would temporarily ban what are called related party transactions – in other words, arrangements with businesses with which club owners are associated. Monday’s meeting, which mainly involved participants dialling in via conferencing software, was to review and vote on the amendment. What was Newcastle’s response? They had been notified of the regulatory change, allowing them to run it through their lawyers. Representing Newcastle at the meeting was not Amanda Staveley, the director and minority stakeholder responsible for running the club on a day-to-day basis. It was the first shareholders’ get-together to which she was invited and there was surprise in some quarters that she declined to attend. Newcastle instead sent Lee Charnley, the managing director, and he made it clear that his club, acting on legal advice, believed the rule change to be anti-competitive and unlawful. The threat was that voting it through could leave those who did so open to legal redress. But the vote still happened? Yes, it did. Eighteen clubs voted in favour of the new rule, with Newcastle against and Manchester City abstaining. A two-thirds majority is needed to effect change – which is 14 votes. City acted on legal advice that the vote was unlawful and would see the league acting as a cartel. The ban on related party transactions will be in force for the next month and applies to all 20 clubs. What was the legal issue with the process? On the face of it, the clubs can do whatever they like if they have the needed 14 votes but, of course, if it was something open to legal challenge, it would be problematic. What a rule cannot be is discriminatory; seeming as though it were designed to attack one club. Newcastle’s complaint could rest in this area. But the league may say that it has been looking into tighter financial controls and checks for some time – and certainly before the Newcastle takeover was completed. The league remains involved in a long-running investigation into whether City have broken financial fair play regulations. City deny wrongdoing. The rule change under discussion, although temporary, is an aggressive move and not without risks. The clubs seem to have taken a safety-in-numbers approach. It is unlikely that Newcastle would have concluded any major commercial deals inside the next month but their rivals wanted to make their point, to indicate a direction of travel. What will happen when the month is up? There is the potential for a vote on a permanent rule change – surely not a ban on related party transactions but legislation to ensure they would be transparent and paid at fair market value. The league will set up a working party – comprising a cross-section of clubs – to shape a consensus view. Newcastle have been invited to join. The worst-case scenario would be if Newcastle, or any other club, ended up on the wrong side of a further vote. Would it be the prompt for a legal challenge? Why are the clubs so worried about Newcastle and related party transactions? Because some of them, to put it bluntly, are paranoid about the success that City have enjoyed since being bought by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour in 2008. They have watched City strike deals with companies linked to the emirate and have decided that they have offered the springboard to glory – and not the many football decisions the club have got right. There is an undeniable feeling that some clubs do not want Newcastle to “do a City”. It should be noted that City were cleared last year at the court of arbitration for sport of “disguising equity funds as sponsorship contributions”. City maintain that related party or otherwise, their sponsorships have been of fair value. What are the prospects of Newcastle spending heavily straight away? It is permissible within the league’s profit and sustainability rules that Newcastle could invest more than £150m on signings in the next year, beginning in January (with the usual caveats about that being a difficult window). This is because the club spent little under the previous owner, Mike Ashley, which has given them a credit within the rules of at least £45m. In addition, clubs are allowed to make losses of £105m over a rolling three-year period. It would be a risky strategy to effectively spend it all at once and it would mean they would have to be certain of being able to break even in years two and three."

          "bodyText": "More than 14,000 species of invertebrate lost habitat during Australia’s 2019-20 bushfires, according to a post-fire analysis that has recommended a doubling of the number of species listed as threatened. The research, prepared for the federal government by scientists with the national environmental science program (NESP), found the number of insects, spiders, worms and other invertebrates affected by the disaster was much greater than the tally of vertebrates impacted. But that fact was largely overlooked due to a focus on more popular animals such as the koala. The NESP study warns the true figure is likely to be far higher than 14,000 because so many Australian invertebrates are either undescribed or have no data available through which to measure declines. At least one animal, the Banksia montana mealybug in Western Australia, is considered likely extinct as a result of Black Summer fires in that state. “If you look at the most affected animals by the fires, about 95% of them are invertebrates,” said John Woinarski, a professor at Charles Darwin University and one of the authors of the research. “And it has had very little public attention.” Australia has 111,233 described terrestrial and freshwater invertebrate species. Though they receive less attention than Australia’s unique mammals and birds, they perform important roles in the ecosystem, such as pollination or as a food source for larger animals. Others are detritivores that break down ecosystem debris – such as leaf litter – which cycles nutrients back into the soil, fostering plant growth and reducing fuel loads for fire. The scientists were able to use existing records and fire maps to compile enough data for 32,164 invertebrates, while noting that for some species they were working with, there were only one or two known records of their existence. The scientists found that 14,159 – roughly half of those species - had at least some habitat burnt by the fires, with 1,209 having had either 50% of their known range burnt by fires of any severity or 30% by fires of high severity. Of those 1,209, the scientists had enough data to recommend the government add 60 species to Australia’s list of nationally threatened invertebrates, which currently totals 63. Jess Marsh, a scientist on Kangaroo Island and co-author of the research, said the 60 they had recommended for listing were “just the ones we know about” – meaning there was enough data available to make them eligible for an assessment by the threatened species scientific committee. It is up to the committee to consider those species before making a recommendation to the federal government as to whether they should be listed as threatened under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. “A lot of species that are likely the most vulnerable wouldn’t be eligible because there’s not enough data,” Marsh said. Among the invertebrates the scientists recommended for listing were the Kangaroo Island assassin spider, millipedes of the genus Atelomastix in Western Australia, and a type of caddisfly found in New South Wales and Victoria whose larvae live in water and are sensitive to chemical changes caused by fire. Marsh has researched the Kangaroo Island assassin spider for several years. It is one of several ancient species of assassin spider found around Australia, so-named because they eat other spiders. They are sometimes referred to as pelican spiders for their unusual appearance that resembles the shape of the water bird. They are considered vulnerable to fire because they live in leaf litter found in low-lying vegetation that is more likely to burn when bushfires hit. Before the fires on Kangaroo Island, the island’s assassin spider was known from only one location, which was completely destroyed in the 2019-20 disaster. Marsh said two specimens had since been discovered at another location 4km away. She said it highlighted a problem that was common for many invertebrates – that their habitat ranges are sometimes so small a single fire could be enough to affect the entire species. Libby Rumpff, another co-author based at the University of Melbourne, said the work also underlined the conservation difficulty for so-called “data deficient” species that attracted little attention or funding. “If you’re labelled as data deficient, you get put in a box and just have to hope someone does something about it,” she said. “Many invertebrates are poorly known because they’re rare, or have restricted distributions, and because there’s bias towards vertebrates and the more charismatic groups.” Marsh said she hoped the analysis would prompt a rethinking of conservation approaches for Australia’s invertebrates. That could include conservation planning at a landscape level that protected entire habitat areas with high levels of endemic invertebrates, she said. Such an approach could mean “we can protect species we know about but also the ones we don’t know about”. “Invertebrates have been overlooked and have not been valued from public opinion all the way up to decision-makers. That needs to change,” Marsh said. “We need to find a way forward for including invertebrates in conservation planning.” Woinarski said that if even the 60 species they had recommended were listed as threatened, it would represent a profound change in the conservation status of Australia’s invertebrates. He said there were other species Australia could be losing while being unaware of it. “Invertebrates are the stuff of life. They are the fulcrum of much of the food webs in Australia. If you stuff up the invertebrate community, then inevitably there will be consequences for things other than those species alone.”"

          "bodyText": "The New South Wales economy could be facing a “vicious cycle of spending and debt” with taxpayers having to spend potentially billions more on interest payments to bondholders, according to a new report. NSW’s newly minted treasurer, Matt Kean, who presides over a third of the Australian economy, is expected to release a post-lockdown recovery package within days as Covid-imposed curbs are lifted. But according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, NSW’s finances also face gathering threats not least from the need to end the state’s dependence on coal exports to meet its climate pledges. Its own Treasury also forecasts the bill from global heating impacts will triple by mid-century. Trista Rose, author of the IEEFA paper and a former trader with global banks in London, New York and Sydney, says some recent quirky behaviour in bond markets suggests investors are becoming more twitchy about investing in debt from a state normally considered to be the engine of Australia’s economy. For a few months earlier this year, at the time of NSW’s latest budget, the NSW government had to pay investors more to buy its debt than any other big state, including Queensland. “This is unprecedented in my understanding,” Rose said of the widening of the so-called spread between the yield paid on NSW bonds versus other states’ debt. “It was the markets’ kind of expectations of how indebted New South Wales was.” That spread has lately narrowed in part because of the NSW government’s sale of the rest of its giant WestConnex venture, the country’s biggest toll road project, for $11.1bn to pay down debt. The higher debt costs could add in the order of $200m-$300m in annual repayments for NSW taxpayers, Rose said. They also serve as a reminder that, according to the state’s own Treasury estimates, NSW faces rising debt loads for decades to come. By 2060, that net debt will climb to the equivalent of NSW’s annual economic activity, known as gross state product. If anything, though, the outlook could deteriorate faster than Treasury expects. “The combined effect of drought, bushfires, floods and the first round of Covid-19 lockdowns have taken debt in NSW to unprecedented levels,” Rose says. “NSW could wind up in a vicious cycle of spending and debt related to environmental costs and interest expenditure, rather than a virtuous cycle of spending which results in broader economic gain which benefits the residents of NSW.” For now, the rating agencies are taking a more sanguine approach. Moody’s has retained NSW’s top-notch “triple A” rating, but has noted concerns about plans to lift state debt to $171bn by 2025. “While record-low interest rates will enable NSW to absorb such a sharp rise in borrowing, the rapid and sustained increase in the debt burden will significantly constrain its operating profile over time and test institutional capacity as the state targets fiscal repair, which includes asset sales, over the next ten years where material execution risks are at play,” Moody’s said in a recent note. Rival agency S&amp;P cuts NSW’s debt rating one notch to AA+ last December and has a stable outlook for now. “I would emphasise that it’s still very very strong on a global basis,” Martin Foo, an associate director of S&amp;P, says. “[NSW is] still rated on par with the US, and other big countries.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Longer term, increased investor concern over environment, social and governance issues, particularly climate change, could prompt a review of NSW – and Australia’s – exposure, Foo says. “We are looking at things like exposure to physical risks as well as, particularly for Australia, for transition risks [as fossil fuel industries decline],” he says adding that those threats include “the world might move ahead on climate and Australia will left with stranded assets”. Independent economist Saul Eslake said that most people would view NSW as being in a “pretty strong financial position”. Still, “New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have by comparison to the other states, a more difficult task in reducing the carbon dioxide intensity of their electricity generation, because they are far more dependant on coal.” “The issue for New South Wales and Queensland about coal in particular, is that either Australia decides how quickly we get out of the business of thermal coal exports [used in power plants], or our customers will decide for us,” Eslake says. “It’s likely to be much more abrupt and disruptive if we choose the latter path, which we will by default if we don’t consciously choose the first one.” Treasurer Kean said NSW “has a AAA credit rating [with Moody’s] with record levels of business confidence underpinning what we expect to be a strong recovery from the Covid pandemic”. “The world’s move to decarbonise is a massive opportunity for our state,” Kean says. “We have some of the best renewable energy resources on the planet and a world-class heavy industry infrastructure.” “NSW has recently legislated the nation’s largest renewable energy plan which has since been backed by record levels of investor interest in our renewable energy zones. We have also just announced the most ambitious hydrogen strategy in the country,” he says. His Labor counterpart, Daniel Mookhey, said the NSW budget was under pressure before lockdown and that rebuilding afterwards won’t be cheap. The treasurer, he said, should reverse “crazy schemes” such as borrowing for the new NSW Generations Fund, which contributed to the blowout in spreads. “Matt Kean should abandon Dominic Perrottet’s plan to borrow $20bn to gamble through the NSW Generations Fund,” Mookhey says. “Then he should rule out spending $10bn on Mr Perrottet’s plan for a massive new toll road on Sydney’s Northern Beaches.”"

          "bodyText": "Authorities in the Chinese region of Xinjiang are using predictive policing and human surveillance to gather “micro clues” about Uyghurs and empower neighbourhood informants to ensure compliance at every level of society, according to a report. The research by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) thinktank detailed Xinjiang authorities’ expansive use of grassroots committees, integrated with China’s extensive surveillance technology, to police their Uyghur neighbours’ movements – and emotions. The findings shed further light on the extraordinary scope of the Chinese Communist party’s grip on the largely Muslim and purportedly autonomous region, going beyond police crackdowns and mass arrests to ensure total control. The report also revealed the identities of officials – including two former visiting fellows at Harvard University – and the organisations that make up the political architecture of the years-long crackdown by Beijing on Uyghurs, which rights organisations say has included the detention of an estimated 1 million people in re-education camps. The report said the nominally voluntary local committees mirrored the Mao-era “revolutionary neighbourhood committees”, with daily meetings delegating home visits and investigations and assessing whether any individuals require “re-education”. However, according to ASPI, leaked police records showed the modern-day committees also received “micro clues’’ from China’s predictive policing system, the integrated joint operations platform (IJOP). Such clues could include someone having an unexpected visitor or receiving an overseas phone call, and would prompt inspection visits modelled on neighbourly interactions. Instruction manuals cited by ASPI showed committee workers in the city of Kashgar were advised to “show warmth to their Uyghur ‘relatives’ and give kids candy” while observing the Uyghur targets. “Xinjiang’s community-based control mechanisms are part of a national push to enhance grassroots governance, which seeks to mobilise the masses to help stamp out dissent and instability and to increase the party’s domination in the lowest reaches of society,” the report said. It detailed the case of an 18-year-old Uyghur man, Anayit Abliz, in Ürümqi, who was sentenced to three years in a re-education camp after he was caught using a filesharing app that is used widely in China to share movies, music and other censored content. “While he was detained, officials from the neighbourhood committee visited his family members six times in a single week, scrutinising the family’s behaviours and observing whether they were emotionally stable,” the report said. The thinktank said the IJOP was managed by the political and legal affairs commission (PLAC). The PLAC, which the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has called the party’s “knife handle”, is China’s overseer of the national law and order system reporting directly to the CCP’s central committee. The report found it wielded vastly expanded operational and budgetary control in Xinjiang, an expansion seen before in mass political campaigns. “Xinjiang’s bureaucratic inner workings in the last seven years fit a wider pattern of authoritarian rule in China,” wrote the report’s lead author, Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, saying some tactics used in the campaign were conceived elsewhere, while others used in Xinjiang were being replicated in other regions including Hong Kong. ASPI also collected basic information of more than 440 principal and deputy county party secretaries in the Chinese region since 2014, unmasking the individual officials implementing the CCP’s crackdown, including at least two who had been educated at Harvard as visiting fellows. The report said the vast majority of county party secretaries – the most senior local officials – over the last seven years were of Han ethnicity. It said not a single Uyghur could be identified among secretaries in September, but they often served as a “ceremonial” second-in-command figure. ASPI said its findings showed the CCP promise of “ethnic self-rule” for the nominally autonomous region were a “fig leaf”. The report also alleged that, in addition to mass internment and coercive labour assignments, residents in China’s far-west Xinjiang region were also compelled to participate in Mao-era mass political campaigns. Responding to the report, China’s embassy in London denied the allegations and accused the ASPI of being an “anti-China rumour-maker”. It claimed its re-education centres were vocational training schools operating as part of its anti-terrorism efforts “no different from the desistance and disengagement programme (DDP) of the UK or the deradicalisation centres in France.” The ASPI report – funded partly by the UK, Australian and US governments – adds to a growing body of evidence of Beijing’s crackdown in Xinjiang. China’s government has been accused by Human Rights Watch and legal groups of committing “crimes against humanity”, while some western governments have formally declared the government to be conducting a “genocide”. China has denied all these accusations. The report said Xinjiang authorities expected “extreme and repressive practices of the 2017 re-education campaign to become the norm by the end of 2021, a stage the party state calls ‘comprehensive stability’”. A recent media report from Xinjiang by Associated Press revealed a reduction in visible means of control and repression, but “a continuing sense of fear” among the population and ongoing surveillance."

          "bodyText": "It is time for morning coffee and Richard Norton-Taylor and I are discussing secrecy, deception and brown envelopes, which comes naturally to the pair of us, as past and present defence and security correspondents of the Guardian. Norton-Taylor joined the paper in January 1973 (when, incidentally, this writer was not yet two), starting in Brussels and switching to security a few years later. The first part of his career was dominated by a series of landmark official secrecy battles. “Brussels was great for spy-watching: Nato was there, as well as the youngish EEC,” he recalls, indicating there was no shortage of Russians in town. Returning to the UK in 1975, and armed with that experience, a job was defined for him by the Guardian’s then editor, Peter Preston, initially covering “official secrecy and Whitehall”. At that time, the British state made what turned out to be the mistake of trying to stop leakers through the courts. “There were tremendous cases, and the government’s behaviour was so counterproductive,” he says; the scenario all reporters covering state secrecy thrive on. Such trials are less frequent today, and often more of the action takes place in parliament, little engaged in intelligence matters 30-plus years ago. These days, I tell Norton-Taylor, it is critical to remain plugged in to the gossipy world of Westminster, from which so many stories emerge over coffee, WhatsApp and drinks. There no shortage of high points during my predecessor’s heyday. “There was the Clive Ponting trial,” he says, referring to the sensational 1985 acquittal by a jury of the civil servant accused of breaching the Official Secrets Act by leaking documents relating to the sinking of the Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands war. “But the glorious thing about that was that the day Ponting was acquitted, the Guardian went on strike. So it wasn’t until the day after that we could report on it – two whole broadsheet pages on the Belgrano case.” Was that frustrating? “Well, you have a few more drinks – it was classic Guardian.” Shortly after came the Spycatcher affair – the British government’s repeated and increasingly embarrassing attempts to prevent the publication of the memoirs of the former MI5 officer Peter Wright. Norton-Taylor recalls publishing a summary of the contents of the book, which led to an injunction. The battle then moved to Australia, where the book’s publishers hoped to release Wright’s account. So did Norton-Taylor. “The trial was in Sydney for six weeks,” he recalls, which required the Guardian’s reporter to stay in the Sheraton at a time when expense accounts may have been a little more generous. Malcolm Turnbull, who later became Australia’s prime minister, acted for the publisher “putting the boot in to the uptight British establishment”, while Robert Armstrong, the cabinet secretary, gave evidence in which, rather than admit to lying, he used the phrase “economical with the truth”. The British government lost, Spycatcher was published in Australia, and copies immediately made their way to the UK. “The Australian judges loved putting the boot into the Poms, I loved it, and I think the Guardian readership loved it,” Norton-Taylor says enthusiastically. The Sarah Tisdall affair was one of the most difficult situations ever faced by the Guardian – one that strained relations between the paper and the authorities. It started with a brown envelope delivered anonymously one Friday evening in 1983, which contained the secret timing of US cruise missile deployments at Greenham Common – an extraordinary scoop. But under huge pressure and after an adverse court ruling that raised the threat of heavy fines, the documents were returned and the leaker, Tisdall, was jailed for six months. Norton-Taylor was peripherally involved in the story, but recalls the pressures facing the editor, Preston, who said he feared that mounting fines might ultimately sink the Guardian. The Ponting and Spycatcher episodes prompted a modest opening-up among the security establishment, and here it is possible to compare notes. Today, MI5 and MI6 have something approximating press contacts – people that correspondents can contact (although they cannot be named or, normally, quoted). Norton-Taylor says that, back in the late 1980s, this was an innovation – with the Guardian and the Times being first provided with authorised numbers to ring. “Ken Clarke, when he was home secretary, said it would be like the dance of the seven veils: give them a little bit and they will want more and more. So, sometimes, ministers are opposed to answering more questions,” Norton-Tayor adds. Who gains from these exchanges, though? There is a risk reporters become too dependent on their contacts and the meetings that take place on park benches where passersby cannot easily listen in. The way to deal with that is to read widely, cultivate a variety of independent sources, and step back and always be prepared to evaluate critically what you are being told. It is not a job for the credulous or unsceptical. Norton-Taylor argues “they need us as much as we need them” – and adds: “If they say they have a good story and it turns out to be wrong or exaggerated, you will lose trust in them and they don’t want that. In a sense, it’s not that difficult.” Nevertheless, relationships like this can easily become complex. I tell my predecessor that a spy helped on a recent story – it is not possible to say which – only to subsequently warn that, if it got out that they had helped, then not only would they deny assisting, but they would suggest I had drawn the wrong conclusions. What had been presented with conviction would suddenly become grey. This prompts Norton-Taylor to tell an anecdote relating to the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war. An MI6 officer had told him, he says, that the reason why some MI6 people were against the invasion of Iraq was that “some of the stuff floating around about Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida being allies was ridiculous. Saddam Hussein was a secular dictator, wasn’t exactly in love with Islamic extremism.” A particular concern was that “the Foreign Office and the British government were accepting everything the CIA and the Americans were saying” – and even some parts of MI6 were willing to go along with that, because a war in Iraq was what the US president, George Bush, and his British counterpart, Tony Blair, wanted. Shortly after, a piece appeared in the Guardian, summarising the information contained in the conversation – only to prompt a complaint from the source a day later. A somewhat bemused Norton-Taylor recalls asking: “Was the piece accurate?” To which he was told: “Yes, it was accurate, it just shouldn’t have been in the public domain.” That is a surprisingly common response from Britain’s security establishment, who seem surprised when reporters write up stories based on information they have gleaned. It’s a reminder, too, why it can often be best to write a story and deal with any consequences later: it pays to follow your judgment – and hold your nerve."

          "headline": "Billy Connolly: ‘It might be lovely on the other side’",
          "bodyText": "A fostered-off schoolboy going nowhere fast, turned apprentice welder on the Clyde. A welder turned regionally popular musician. A musician turned nationally popular comic. A comic turned Hollywood actor and an actor turned New York artist, then a retiree who’s recently been muttering his memoirs into a recording device in the Florida Keys… Billy Connolly has already been through one or two big transitions in his life. Perhaps it’s no surprise that the 78-year-old, who has been ill with Parkinson’s for some time, can face up to the next transition (the last one) with such a playful disposition. If he ever finds himself brooding on death, Connolly confesses, when we chat one autumn morning, he will shake along his wrist a little bracelet made out of small, plastic skulls. He wears the bracelet most days now. And in his mind, Connolly says, the skulls represent death. But (twist!) they have all been cast in bright, jolly colours. “I find that takes the scare away.” It has just turned 11.30am in the Keys. Connolly says that he wasn’t very long out of bed when he left the home he shares with his wife, Pamela Stephenson, and walked to a neighbouring house belonging to one of their daughters. There, in a quiet and well-lit room that he uses as an art studio, he plugged his hearing aids into a specially equipped computer and logged on to Zoom for our chat. He sits forward in an easy chair now, explaining that it will take some getting out of, this chair, when he’s done. Lots of rocking and jerking, he guesses, until he’s upright. But he’ll face that problem when he gets to it. “What works on a Monday, to get you out of a chair, doesn’t always work by Wednesday. It can be a cruel disease.” Connolly has long white hair that he’s tied back. The famous beard, striped with grey, has been shaped into a sort of dangling sporran over his mouth, chin and throat. He wears black circular specs and black clothes, quite a forbidding look; but his is one of those warm, confessional personalities, and quickly you feel you can ask him anything, just so long as questions come from a place of honest curiosity about the human experience. It’s something he’s very curious about himself. I want to know, if he’s not scared of death, then does he resent it as a moment when the busy ride of life has to stop? Does he think about all the events and funny-anecdotes-in-the-making that will go on taking place without him, afterwards? Connolly chuckles softly. “I do feel that. Cheated, in a way? But it hasn’t happened yet. So how can I have been cheated? And who knows? It might be so lovely on the other side that you don’t ever think about that.” There’ll be another side, you think? “I’m sure there’s something. I’m sure there’s something.” Why? “I don’t know, in recent years, I’ve just got a feeling that there is. That we don’t just turn to shite. Mebbe this is my refusal to accept something so mundane.” You mean: that after an extraordinary life, the most ordinary thing will happen to you, too? “Yes. That I’ll be squashed, like any other garden mite, and that’ll be the end. Well that can’t be what happens, can it?” At least in our conversation, Connolly does not refer to Parkinson’s by name. Instead he calls it “it”, part of a deliberate strategy, is my guess, to belittle the illness and diminish its hold over him. “I’m still quite ignorant about it,” Connolly smiles. “There are lengths I choose not to go to, in terms of information about it. And that works for me. Once, I was invited to a meeting of people that had it, in a hotel here in Florida, and I went with my son. I couldn’t wait to leave. Place was full of people who thought about it all the time. They had obviously surrendered themselves to it. I haven’t.” He runs his hands into his hair, making the skull bracelet clack. “Though sometimes I think of it like a strange animal. One that sits beside you and says, ‘How will you get on without this?’ – before it takes away something else. I can’t play the banjo any more. My handwriting’s gone. My yodelling’s gone… Y’know,” he says, “I fly a lot in my dreams. I fly in an upright position, with a power that comes out the soles of my feet.” Just like Iron Man, I say. “Yes! And I have another dream. It happens regularly. I’m on a high plane. There are people who want me to come to them, but they’re on a low plane, down a cliff. I have to get down there, too, so I step off. I fall, vertically. And I land on my feet.” Connolly holds out his hands. “I have no idea what that’s about.” Having just read his new book of memoirs, Windswept &amp; Interesting, I think I might have some idea what that’s about. Connolly suffered through some exceptional and appalling things in his youth, especially as a very young child in Glasgow. He and his sister, Florence, were abandoned by their teenage mother in the 1940s. They were cared for (barely) by aunts. Later, at the hands of his father, Connolly suffered sexual abuse. In his 20s and 30s, even while he rose to prominence as a banjo player and a comedian, he was a functioning alcoholic. Still, he survived all this. And at a certain point, the story of Connolly’s life became one of somebody landing on their feet, over and over, just like that tumbling vision of himself in the dream. Take as one example his startling track record with traffic accidents. He once escaped an exploding Morris Minor (he was 20ish) and later fell asleep at the wheel of a speeding Beetle and crashed off a motorway into a field (40ish). He barrel-rolled in a lemon yellow Land Rover off a winding Highlands road (60ish). Casually recounting all of this in his book, Connolly sounds surprised, amused, even mildly outraged that he should have lived long enough to hit old age and disability. He was once described by a friend as “a welder who got away with it” and Connolly puts a lot of store by that appraisal. After all, he rose from a crappy childhood and a youth as a labourer to become a sir, an honorary doctor (four times over), a close friend to Pythons, Beatles and Stones, a king in one of the Hobbit movies, a co-star of Cruise and Dench. He owns three houses on the same street in Florida, in order that his grown-up children can be his neighbours if they wish to be. Instead of walking the 100 yards to see each other, his wife and kids can swim along a river that connects the properties, dodging manatees and domesticated alligators. He mostly enjoyed dictating his memoirs over the past year, Connolly says, and little wonder: “Looking at it all from a distance, when you’re comfortable, when you don’t have any of the younger person’s horrors for your aspirations – it all feels behind you, in a good way. You’re a successful guy. You live in Key West. You’re telling the whole story.” He can no longer write prose himself. He gave up performing standup comedy years ago. But this new book was put together using the remains of those two lost skills. Ahead of a “writing” session, Connolly would sit with one or more of his daughters, who volunteered to help craft the book. He geed himself up with cups of tea and then he gave them a show, his last, most likely – a freewheeling monologue of memories and stories that they listened to, laughed at, cried at, jotted down, and slowly started to shape into a 400-page narrative. If his daughters weren’t around to dictate to, he says, he sometimes picked up his smartphone and spoke into a digital dictation app called Otter. Boy, though, did Otter know how to make a mess of his accent. Otter has never been to Glasgow in its fucking life, Connolly chunters. Stephenson, his wife of 32 years, puts her head around the door to tell Connolly she’s off in the car to run an errand. “OK!” says Connolly, turning to me to add, “Wait a minute till she’s out the door.” “Why?” asks Stephenson, smiling. “You gonna talk about me?” Connolly, without any malice, simply as if it’s the only subject he ever has in mind, says: “Yeah.” They met on the set of Not the Nine O’Clock News, the 1980s sketch show, when Stephenson was a regular cast member and Connolly a guest. He saw her whizzing down a studio corridor in a shopping trolley and was greatly charmed. Both were married at the time. After the episode was filmed they didn’t see each other again for a year. In that time Connolly separated from Iris Pressagh, his first wife and the mother of his oldest two children, Cara and Jamie. In the memoirs he blames his travelling for work, his drinking and his general wildness. He was on another long comedy tour, gigging in Brighton, when Stephenson came to see him backstage. She sat on the sink in his changing room and admitted that her marriage was over, too. They slept together that night. In the morning, when a roadie coolly walked into Connolly’s hotel room to pack his stuff (as if the fact of there being a new woman in the bed was such a common occurrence it didn’t warrant basic politeness), Stephenson challenged the men’s boorish behaviour. This would become a theme of the relationship to come. She was the first person to tell Connolly directly, no messing, “You’re drinking too much.” He promised her he would stop, and tried to several times. His fear of her leaving him spurred him on. Sometimes, he says, he has dreams where he’s drunk again. “I’m always on the way home, after, thinking, ‘Oh God, what will I say to Pamela? How will I explain this?’ In the dreams I think, ‘She’ll never forgive me.’ But actually I think she would forgive me.” Throwing in his lot with expensive cigars instead of booze as a principal vice, Connolly had his last ever drink in December 1985. By now he and Stephenson had had the first of their three daughters, Daisy, later followed by Amy and Scarlett. When Stephenson got a job as a sketch performer on Saturday Night Live, the family moved to New York. He had long been notorious in the UK, ever since a 1970s appearance on Michael Parkinson’s talkshow, when, against orders from his own manager, Connolly told a favourite joke about burying his wife bottom-up in the garden. (“I needed somewhere to park ma bike.”) It wasn’t until he did some standup on Whoopi Goldberg’s HBO special in 1989 that he made a name for himself in the US. Soon after that he got a part in a sitcom, Head of the Class, and the family moved again to LA. When Stephenson became a US citizen, via green-card lottery, it was prompt enough for them to marry. They did so on a beach in Fiji, bagpipes playing, the theme from The Archers sung by a choir as Stephenson came down the aisle. There were well-known guests aplenty. Ringo Starr was almost bitten by a snake. In what sounds like a reasonably blissful marriage that followed, there were many more celeb-fest parties (either in the States or in the family’s summer-holiday pile in the Cairngorns), even as Stephenson left showbiz and retrained as a therapist. As for Connolly, he spent his 40s, 50s and 60s fashioning a pretty decent movie career, appearing in a Pixar movie (Brave), a Tom Cruise blockbuster (The Last Samurai), one of Peter Jackson’s Middle-earth sagas (The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies) and – best – in Mrs Brown, as the kilted boyf of a widowed Queen Victoria. Judi Dench played the Queen. The two of them used to lay £50 bets with each other, about how long scenes would take to wrap. Dench, the veteran, always won. The biggest surprise in his life, Connolly writes in his new book, was not that he blagged it as far as he did in Hollywood (after the Hobbit film, he recalls with hilarity, “I was a wee plastic toy in a breakfast cereal… I was even in a McDonald’s Happy Meal”), but that he became an artist in middle age, and a reasonably successful one. The family had moved to New York. His daughters were starting to leave home for college. Bored, one day, he bought some art supplies and began drawing peculiar figures. There are examples of his work on the walls of the room he’s sitting in today. Connolly cranes around, carefully, to describe them. “That’s a guy fishing with an angel. That’s a little man on stilts.” His work has collectors. It gets exhibited. “Still can’t get my head around it.” In the early 2010s, he was back in Los Angeles to make a guest appearance on Conan O’Brien’s talkshow, and walking back from one of his beloved cigar shops, when a random doctor he passed gave him a quick, blunt, street-diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, based entirely on Connolly’s gait. It was a shock, of course. (And an unbelievable bit of cheek on the part of the doctor, I suggest.) After formal tests confirmed the diagnosis, the family moved once more, this time to Florida. “Pamela had already bought the house when she told me we were going,” Connolly says. “Off we went. The whole idea was to get me away from the slippery sidewalks. I was starting to fall.” He misses the shoe shops of New York. The cigar shops, too. Not so long ago, he tells me, he was searching for something in his study and he found one unsmoked cigar in a case. He’d given them up. Due to complications from his illness, the tobacco had started to make him feel dizzy and drunk: not a welcome sensation for a recovering alcoholic. But now Connolly took the stray cigar out to his decking, sat in front of the river, lit up, and tried a puff. He tried one more. “And it was brilliant. I sat there for about 10 minutes, until the wobblies came on.” Connolly stubbed out his final cigar unfinished, and threw it away. He has lost a lot of people close to him in recent years, including his manager Steve Brown and various actor friends, including Sean Connery and Robin Williams. When his sister Florence died six years ago, Connolly tells me, he experienced an unsettling season of paranoia. “She used to beat people up at school who were picking on me. She ended up being a school teacher. When Flo died I got an irrational terror that I was gonna be picked on again. A wave would come over me, that I was unsafe, that I was exposed. Then it would go away again.” Years earlier he had been unable to visit either his father or his mother on their deathbeds, despite, in both cases, getting all the way to the hospital car park. The mixture of sadness, love, resentment and pity was always too much. Given that he discovered a way to write about his life that was effective, with his children taking dictation and shaping it into paragraphs, I ask if Connolly envisages writing more books. “No,” he says, “too hard, too many painful bits. And, of course, I had to explain it to my daughters, away from the book, what had gone on.” What about books on other subjects, away from his own story? “It is tempting. But my daughters have their lives to lead.” He can still draw, though. And he can fish, he says, sometimes getting out on the Florida water with his son. “Can you go fishing for ever?” he wonders. “Maybe you can.” Before we say goodbye, Stephenson checks in by phone from her driving errand. She wants to make sure that Connolly is all right and that he’ll be able to get back along the road to their neighbouring home once our conversation ends. It’s normally best if he has a family member around to haul him upright. In restaurants, he teases me, he is always careful to choose a table served by “some real beefy waiter, who can lift me at the end”. “Is everything OK, Billy?” Stephenson asks, over the phone. He throws a mischievous look my way and says to her, “This bad man’s been making me cry.” “Billy, will you be OK walking home afterwards?” “Yeah,” he sighs. “I remember how it’s done.” Windswept &amp; Interesting: My Autobiography by Billy Connolly is published by Two Roads at £25.

          "headline": "The Observer view on the killing of Sir David Amess",
          "bodyText": "When he was fatally stabbed while holding a constituency surgery, Sir David Amess became the second MP to have been killed in the line of duty in just five years. A veteran parliamentarian who commanded immense respect and affection from colleagues of all parties, Amess’s death serves as a tragic reminder of the unreasonable risks our elected representatives are expected to bear in the course of their public service. Amess was killed while undertaking one of the aspects of his role he saw as most important: during a drop-in surgery at which his constituents could come and raise their concerns. Every Friday, MPs like Amess hold these sessions at libraries, church halls and constituency offices. They have none of the fortress-like protection that surrounds parliament; it is where they are most vulnerable to those who would do them harm. Yet parliamentarians did not abandon them even after Jo Cox MP was brutally murdered by a far-right terrorist in her Yorkshire constituency in 2016. Amess’s relationships with his constituents informed his work as an MP; after meeting a woman with endometriosis, he spent years trying to raise awareness of the often-debilitating condition that affects women. Over the past 20 years, he has campaigned against fuel poverty, after a constituent died of hypothermia. We know little about the circumstances surrounding the fatal attack on Amess, beyond the fact that the police are treating it as a terrorist incident and are investigating a “potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism”. There will be those who seek to deploy these scant details in service of their political agendas; to politicise this tragedy in such a way is abhorrent. But Amess’s killing has rightly raised the same questions asked after Andrew Pennington was killed trying to protect the MP Nigel Jones in 2000, after Stephen Timms was stabbed during a constituency surgery in 2010, and after the murder of Jo Cox. Do we do enough to protect our MPs from harm given their profile, the fact that they can become a target for protracted hate and the threats they face as a result? It is wrong that these questions only really get asked after someone has been killed or seriously wounded. In the five years since Jo Cox was assassinated, the Metropolitan police report that the number of threats against MPs has been rising, with female MPs and those of colour particularly targeted. Many have seen those who have made violent threats against them convicted and sent to prison: the man charged with sending Jess Phillips and Rosie Cooper death threats in 2019; the member of a neo-Nazi group found guilty of plotting to kill Cooper with a machete in 2018; the man found guilty of harassing Luciana Berger in 2016; the SNP member with a prior conviction of carrying a knife who was found guilty of threatening sexual violence against Joanna Cherry earlier this year; the man jailed last year for threatening Yvette Cooper. The black MP Diane Abbott has spoken of the hundreds of racist messages she has received every day; the Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has 24-hour police protection as a result of the volume of death threats he receives because of his skin colour and faith; a Labour investigation found that the lesbian MP Angela Eagle received hundreds of “abusive, homophobic and frightening” messages from party members. The safety of those in public life may only pierce the public consciousness after someone has been killed. But this is something that will continuously weigh on the minds not just of MPs, but of their families and staff. It is too much to ask of any parent, partner or child. The informality with which constituents can seek support from and petition their MPs in person is a prized aspect of British democracy. But Amess’s killing must prompt a reassessment of what can be done to reduce the risks of violence towards MPs in their own constituencies, whether through a greater police presence or advance security checks. It is extremely worrying that some MPs report that the threats they receive are not taken seriously by the police: that must change. But this goes beyond physical security. MPs have to put up with a shocking amount of social media abuse threatening violence, some of which comes from their own party members. The terrorism that motivated Jo Cox’s murderer is not just aimed at mortally wounding our elected representatives, it is about striking fear into them in a way that interferes with their ability to do their jobs and making citizens scared to put themselves forward for office in the first place. A lot of social media abuse will not tip over into real-world violence, but it can contribute to the online radicalisation of individuals with a propensity towards violence. Our political discourse has coarsened. There are more who try to win debates by dehumanising opponents and launching ad hominem attacks rather than relying on the strength of their arguments. Social media platforms reward the adoption of ever-more radical and uncompromising positions; this level of polarisation does not reflect real-world public opinion yet it cannot but infect our politics as a result of the threats it produces and the activism it encourages. Individuals engaging in public debate have a responsibility to think about the consequences of behaviour that tips into the bullying and harassment of public figures; social media companies have a duty to reconfigure their platforms so they do not incentivise spiteful speech and hateful sentiment. Something that stands out from David Amess’s obituaries this weekend was his embrace of civility in politics and the deep friendships he cultivated with politicians across the aisle. It would be a fitting legacy if his tragic, senseless killing prompted a re-evaluation of the immense sacrifice all MPs make in serving the public and a recalibration of our overly toxic political discourse."

          "headline": "Victoria and NSW schools are reopening amid Covid outbreaks – what can be learned from overseas?",
          "bodyText": "As Victoria and New South Wales prepare to reopen schools for face-to-face learning, experts who have studied the experiences of other countries are warning that not all lessons have been learned, particularly on mask-wearing and ventilation. NSW, which has about 5,500 active cases of the virus, and where 75% of the eligible population over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated, is preparing for students in kindergarten, years 1 and 12 to return to school on Monday. The remaining grades will return the week beginning 25 October. Only fully vaccinated teachers will be allowed back. Only high school students will be required to wear masks. In Victoria, once the lockdown is lifted, all children in year 3 and above will be required to wear masks indoors. This is already in place for regional schools that have returned to face-to-face learning. Masks indoors at school are strongly recommended but not compulsory for children in prep to year 2. Victoria’s more stringent rules for children prompted the NSW deputy premier, Paul Toole, to tell Sky News on 9 October that the decision was “crazy”. “I don’t really see the point of that – it’s really going to be constricting those children in that state,” he said. But a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which studied the impact of US school reopenings on Covid cases, found widespread mask-use mitigated risk of community spread. The case for masks The study analysed a year of data in nearly 15,000 school districts before the Delta variant emerged and found that, even then, reopening schools with in-person learning was associated with increased cases and death rates, particularly in counties that did not require staff or children to wear masks. It is difficult to compare countries due to differences in vaccination rates, public health measures, virus case numbers and populations, but a co-author of the study, Prof Hiroyuki Kasahara from the Vancouver School of Economics, says there are important lessons for Australia. “With the Delta variant, mitigation measures are even more important for safe school openings, not only for stopping community transmission but also for stopping children from being hospitalised,” Kasahara says. “With the Delta variant, more and more children are hospitalised in the US and elsewhere after school opening. “Many adults think that putting masks on five-year-olds is difficult but, in many countries, five-year-olds put their masks on without any problems. Some argue that putting masks on such a young child may have a negative psychological impact or prevent them from learning languages, but think about the fact that 140,000 US children lost their parents or caregivers because of Covid. “The cost of implementing mask mandates on young children is low relative to its benefits, or the alternative cost of risking parents or children themselves getting hospitalised.” In the Canadian province of British Columbia, the government put mask mandates in place for grades 4-12 when schools reopened, but not for kindergarten to grade 3. “Now, because the cases among schoolchildren are rapidly rising, the British Columbia government decided to implement mask mandates on K to grade 3,” Kasahara said. “Many governments use this ‘wait and see’ approach before implementing mask mandates on young children, but fewer people would have been hospitalised or died if they had implemented it from the start.” Ventilation and vaccinations Vaccinating all staff is also critical to mitigating spread, Kasahara says. In Victoria, vaccinations are required for education workers, while in NSW, school-based education staff have been given priority access to vaccinations. There is also accumulating evidence that good ventilation with high efficiency Hepa-filters helps prevent Covid-19 spread. A UK study found airborne spread of the virus was detected in a hospital ward on all five days before activation of air filtration, but on none of the five days when the air filter was in operation. From the start of term four, 51,000 air purification devices are due to be rolled out to all government and low-fee non-government schools in Victoria. In NSW, a petition has been launched calling on the state government “to take immediate action to ensure adequate ventilation is installed and maintained in primary schools”. OzSAGE, a multi-disciplinary network of health and scientific experts, has urged the NSW education department to follow Victoria’s lead and “learn from the successes and failures” overseas. In a statement, OzSAGE said: “In San Francisco, through near universal mask use in schools and by providing safe indoor air, there have been very few instances of in-school transmission this year. On the other hand, in England, where neither masks nor safe air are routine in schools, and where vaccination was not recommended for 12-15 year olds until September and then limited to only one dose, 8% of school children were infected with Covid-19 within two weeks of the start of term.” Kasahara says schools must also maintain good hygiene and physical distancing, and health departments should not abandon contact tracing efforts when a case emerges in a school. “The risk of getting Covid differs across individuals,” he says. “Some are living with the elderly and others are immune compromised. Prompt exposure notice allows each parent to make their own decisions on sending their kids to school. Related to this is to make it easy for children to miss their classes, so no penalty [should be] associated with missing classes and [they should be offered] possible online options.” Making testing easier would reduce risk further, Kasahara says. “If parents have easy access to rapid antigen tests, then they can test their children when they have symptoms and may prevent them from transmitting to others when they are positive.” In Victoria, rapid antigen testing will be rolled out across the healthcare system first, before other high risk settings, such as schools, childcare and corrections, are added to the program. The tests will be trialled in some Sydney schools. Rapid antigen testing will be available for home use from November, though experts warn they are sometimes not as accurate as the traditional PCR nasal and throat swab tests. The rise in cases Dr Nusrat Homaira, a senior lecturer and paediatric respiratory epidemiologist at the University of NSW, says Australian schools and health systems have adopted many of the strategies found to be most useful overseas. She points out that NSW is reopening schools with a much higher background vaccination rate and lower overall number of cases than most other countries. Israel, for example, reopened schools while still reporting more than 10,000 cases a day, but did not open high schools where fewer than 70% of students were vaccinated. About 250,000 children were kept home on the first day of reopening in September due to being infected with the virus. In the US, the number of paediatric cases in hospital has hit new highs. But public health measures differ greatly between states, and there is a higher background rate of cases than in Australia. In the US 57% of those age 12 and above are fully vaccinated, but this varies widely between states. Even with rising cases in the US, hospitalisation rates among children with Covid have remained steady at about 2%. Most children diagnosed with Delta in New South Wales experienced mild or no symptoms, with similar numbers – about 2% – requiring hospital treatment, the latest report from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance says. But not all of those in hospital had a serious illness, Homaira says. “At Liverpool Hospital, we converted hospital wards into home units for children with Covid to stay in if their parents were in hospital with Covid, because there was no one else to take care of the child,” she says. “That happened a lot, it wasn’t necessarily that the child was severely unwell.” Homaira says it is important for vulnerable and high-risk caregivers of children to get vaccinated, but that “children are more likely to pick up the infection from adults than the other way around”. “I think we do anticipate as the vaccinated population come in contact with the unvaccinated population as we open up our schools, there’s going to be a rise in cases. “But we are opening up at a much better stage than most other countries, with 76% of the eligible population fully vaccinated in New South Wales [78% as of Friday]. That’s a very impressive number. So I wouldn’t say that any rise in cases from schools opening is going to be as alarming as elsewhere.”"

          "headline": "Chelsea stay top after Ben Chilwell’s superb strike keeps Brentford at bay",
          "bodyText": "It was no exaggeration to describe it as a siege. Chelsea had led through Ben Chilwell’s lovely finish on the stroke of half-time but it was Brentford who asked all the questions – with increasing urgency – as a pulsating game entered its closing stages. How did Thomas Frank’s team not find an equaliser to celebrate his third anniversary as the club’s manager? They absolutely deserved one. The answer lay somewhere between bad luck, poor finishing and the excellence of Édouard Mendy in the Chelsea goal, who simply refused to be beaten. When Ivan Toney was denied by Mendy on 73 minutes, it was the prompt for a slow-burning game to ignite. Brentford pushed, loading numbers into the Chelsea box and throwing everything at them. The visitors gasped for breath. “It was pretty much hell on earth the last 20 minutes,” Chilwell said. Bryan Mbeumo, played in by the substitute Marcus Forss – who made a difference – dragged a shot against the post, as he had done in the first half. And, thereafter, as Chelsea panicked, their famed defensive structure in tatters, with Thomas Tuchel admitting that it looked as though Brentford had an extra man, it was over to Mendy. He made a one-on-one save to deny another substitute, Saman Ghoddos, before Brentford went close on the second phase, Christian Nørgaard working a shot towards goal only for Trevoh Chalobah to clear off the line. Mendy’s best was still to come. He charged off his line to make himself big when Pontus Jansson threatened, the shot smacking him in the face and flying to safety, and at the end, when the outstanding Nørgaard finessed an acrobatic effort, Mendy threw up a hand to tip over. “We’re gonna score in a minute,” the home crowd chanted. It was gripping stuff, a demonstration of Brentford’s drive and belief. Chelsea had conceded only three goals in the Premier League all season and in many of their games they had given up barely any chances. Not here. Yet Brentford could not score, they could not follow their home win over Arsenal and the high-intensity draw with Liverpool with another memorable result. Chelsea suffered and, thanks to Mendy, they survived. It was a game when Romelu Lukaku struggled to make an impact – he touched the ball only 18 times before his substitution on 77 minutes – while, alongside him, Timo Werner looked as though he could have played all night and not scored. Both of them were too isolated, particularly as Chelsea dropped deeper and deeper towards the end, desperate to protect what they had. And yet Chelsea squirmed to the result they wanted, one that saw them leapfrog back over Liverpool and to the top of the table. It was streaky. It was ugly. It made the points feel somehow sweeter. Frank was proud. He had to be. He highlighted how Brentford had restricted the European champions to five shots – only one of which was on target. He talked about those five “100% chances” that went begging towards the end. How had his team been better than opponents with five Ballon d’Or nominations in their ranks? “Just crazy,” Frank said. But it did not erase the frustration. “There should only be one winner in the game and that is us,” Frank said. “It’s so painful. It burns in your body. Mendy was absolutely world class. He has been crazy good for Chelsea.” Chelsea controlled the majority of the first 70 minutes but without creating too much of clearcut note. The most interesting aspects of their performance were provided by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, whom Tuchel used in front of a back three that featured Malang Sarr making his league debut. He emerged with credit. Loftus-Cheek brings physicality but it is the finesse that draws the eye; the bursts past opponents, the quickness of his feet, particularly when he has men around him. There were times when he was almost mesmerising. The game might have been shaped differently had Mbeumo’s shot on 22 minutes gone in rather than hit a post. Moments earlier, Toney had gone close with a header. Now, Ethan Pinnock rose to meet a Sergi Canós cross and, when Nørgaard headed back for Mbeumo, the chance was on. He went close but not close enough. Chelsea flickered as an attacking force from that point until half-time. Lukaku turned home from a Werner cross only to be flagged offside; Mateo Kovacic’s deflected free-kick looped over and there were a couple of flashes from Werner when he ought to have done better. First he sidefooted high after a Lukaku lay-off and then he tried to pass to his strike partner when well-placed rather than shoot. The execution was poor. The goal came when César Azpilicueta crossed, Lukaku tussled with Jansson and Chilwell cut across a first-time effort, sending the ball screaming past David Raya. The howls thereafter would belong to Brentford."

          "headline": "How Covid spread fear of globalisation and threatens a new world order",
          "bodyText": "When Xi Jinping promised the world’s movers and shakers in January 2017 that China would champion globalisation, it looked as if the baton of global economic leadership was being picked up seamlessly by Beijing as Donald Trump prepared to usher in an era of American isolationism. Almost five years later a new world order has emerged, but it is not the one China’s president and others gathered in Davos that day seemed to have in mind. Instead of a continuation of the post-cold war era of growth underpinned by free trade, the world faces a fractured economic system where the post-pandemic supply shock and mistrust bred by the virus pushes countries towards an autarkist impulse for self-sufficiency. Autarky is a Greek word meaning “self-reliance” and was popularised as shorthand for economic nationalism in the 19th century. It gained some credence as an economic model when the young Soviet Union in effect shut itself off from world trade, and the nationalist impulse towards self-sufficiency appealed to Hitler. It also flourished in the postwar world, especially in Africa, though the creed of globalisation has left few examples outside North Korea. There were already some signs of nationalist-driven challenges to the prevailing system exemplified by Brexit, the rise of Trump, and a growing suspicion that China was not prepared to play by the rules set by the US and its proxies. The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated these trends, experts believe. Evgeny Postnikov, a senior lecturer in international relations at the University of Melbourne, says the pressures of the pandemic have delivered a stark realisation about how much countries rely on imports and products enmeshed in the global supply chain. From the initial scramble to protect production of face masks in France, to the careful control of vaccine technology, the pandemic has thrown up countless examples of how quickly the existing world order began to buckle under the domino effect of nationalistic urges. “Governments can’t be relying on strategic competitors to supply crucial goods and services,” Postnikov says. “Trade and security were seen differently but now both are treated as high politics. That is why autarkist push is not going away. If anything it will get stronger, and that is quite worrying.” The power cuts across northern China in recent weeks have led Beijing to accelerate its drive to become more self-sufficient. After hopeful signs that China would wean itself off fossil fuels by shutting hundreds of coal-fired power stations, the hint this week from Beijing of a rethink on slashing emissions is a crushing blow to global cooperation on the climate crisis. Under the “Made in China” policy launched in 2018, China is already trying to develop more capacity in semiconductors, the lifeblood of consumer goods ranging from Teslas to toasters, and PlayStations to printers, as well as other strategic products. The country’s belt and road initiative is binding dozens of nations in Asia, Africa and Europe into Beijing’s economic orbit. India, which was slow to begin dumping its corporatist economic model in favour of a more global-facing one, has also given a name for its plan to head back in the opposite direction: Atmanirbhar Bharat. This translates as “self-reliant India” and is designed, in the words of the foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, to extricate the country from “global commitments not to our advantage”. Hence India’s withdrawal last year from the pan-Asian Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation pact (Rcep) over concerns that its huge agricultural sector would be sacrificed on the altar of free trade. In Britain the sudden loss of cheap migrant labour means employers are looking again at their business models. On Wednesday Britain’s “chicken king”, the head of the country’s largest poultry producer, called for a total rethink of how food is produced. “Three months ago I was vocal about the government needing to help with labour issues,” said Ranjit Singh Boparan, the owner of 2 Sisters Food Group, which processes 10 million chickens a week. “I’ve now come to the conclusion that in reality it can’t fix all the problems.” He says he no longer believes the solution is more visas for foreign workers: instead, the price of food will have to rise in line with the cost of producing it. “We need to work with our supply chains and customers to solve these issues. But it will come at a cost. I need to invest, increase automation and make our factories more welcoming for new recruits,” he said. The supply shock has “thrown sand in the gears of the world economy”, according to George Magnus, an independent economist and associate at the China Centre, at Oxford University. “It is hard to disentangle structural issues around the supply chain with the process of globalisation. Everything is more complicated and more expensive. It looks like a symptom of a decomposing global economy.” He says the world economy should begin to realign by next year but that the current crisis could have a “corrosive impact in the medium term” as companies seek to diversify from sole-source supply and secure strategically important products such as semiconductors, batteries and energy. More than 80% of industries have experienced supply chain disruptions because of the pandemic, according to a report by the consultancy Deloitte, and about 75% of companies have brought forward plans to repatriate manufacturing from overseas by building smart factories closer to home. A study by the Reshoring Initiative, in the US, has forecast that the country will add 224,213 jobs from abroad in 2021, an increase of 38% on 2020. Investment in strategic products such as semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries and pharmaceuticals are driving the changes, the report says. There are similar moves in the UK, where a report predicts factories could make almost £5bn more goods in 2021 as the pandemic and Brexit prompt businesses to bring home production. The rising cost of labour in countries such as China have added pressure on corporations for a rethink of the way their products are made. For example, labour costs are now cheaper in Mexico than in China and short-circuiting the economic model of the latter as the workshop of the world while providing a powerful incentive for American producers to set up shop closer to home. Another problem undermining the global system is that the controversy over the origins of coronavirus has poisoned relations already struggling with battles over tariffs, Hong Kong, and alleged Chinese infiltration of foreign communications networks through the state champion Huawei. “The virus has bred mistrust,” says Magnus, “and the division sown by this has been a shock for China. It’s not going to be easy to make good because public attitudes in the west now show a high level of antagonism towards China. I don’t know what it would take to come back from that.” Britain’s withdrawal from the EU was a shock to the world’s trading system, and when Trump took power days after that Xi speech at Davos one of his first acts was to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. It could be a sign of things to come as countries “decouple” from the globalised system. “We’re not going to end up with lots of North Koreas – the autarkist state par excellence,” says Postnikov. “But what we will see I think is a world of smaller regional blocs where there are shorter supply chains. The TPP, Rcep, Brexit – it’s all unilateralist, whereas before these problems were viewed through a multilateral lens.”"

          "headline": "Klopp hits out at Newcastle takeover and calls for Premier League response",
          "bodyText": "Jürgen Klopp has said the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, should explain why the controversial takeover of Newcastle was allowed given Saudi Arabia’s record on human rights. Premier League clubs called an emergency meeting to discuss the takeover by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the speed at which it was agreed. Amnesty International, which described Saudi Arabia’s human rights record as “atrocious”, has urged the MP Tracey Crouch to make owners’ and directors’ rules “human rights-compliant” in her review of football governance. The Liverpool manager compared the Newcastle deal to the thwarted Super League attempt by 12 European clubs – including his own – and insisted Masters had a responsibility to break his silence on the takeover. Klopp said: “I was waiting for some official statements about it from Richard Masters or someone. We all know there are obviously some concerns over human rights issues. That’s clear. We all think the same there. It [a statement] didn’t happen. “What will it mean for football? A few months ago we had a massive argument – issue – the whole football world, with 12 clubs trying to build a Super League. Rightly so. It didn’t happen, but this is kind of creating a super team if you want. It’s pretty much the same; guaranteed spots in the Champions League in a few years time. Financial fair play nowadays, nobody knows exactly if it still exists or not. “Newcastle fans will love it but for the rest of us it just means there is a new superpower in Newcastle. We cannot avoid that. Money cannot buy everything but over time they will have enough money to make a few wrong decisions, then make the right decisions, and then they will be where they want to be in the long term. Everybody knows that, and obviously the Premier League, Richard Masters, thought: ‘Yeah, let’s give it a go.’” Referring to Abu Dhabi with Manchester City and Qatar with Paris Saint-German, he added: “As far as I know it’s the third club that is owned by a country. I’m not sure how many countries are still out there who have the financial power and interest to do so, but this is how it is, and what we have to deal with.” Masters remained in Klopp’s sights when the manager was asked whether Saudi investment would cause further damage to the reputation of England’s top flight. “Don’t ask me about the reputation of the Premier League,” he responded. “If you think there is damage to the reputation then write it. Without my saying, please. And if you do get in contact with Richard Masters send him my regards because I have never had contact with him. Never is not right, maybe once or twice, but he is the only person who could explain how it could happen. And in the end we will see what it will damage or not. It’s not really about me to say that – it is for other people.” Amnesty has also requested a meeting with Masters over the takeover and, before the first game of the Saudi-led era against Tottenham on Sunday, repeated its call for the Newcastle deal to prompt a strengthening of ownership rules. Klopp, meanwhile, has criticised the Football Association over its handling of Curtis Jones, who suffered an injury on England Under-21 duty and will miss Saturday’s visit to Watford. Klopp will also be without Jones’s fellow midfielder Fabinho, who is to quarantine after international duty with Brazil along with the goalkeeper Alisson, and Thiago Alcântara is again expected to be sidelined with a calf problem. “Curtis Jones came back injured from the under-21s. Great,” said Klopp. “It is really difficult to get in proper contact even with the English federation because they do what they want. He didn’t train, wasn’t involved in the first game and then he played a few minutes in the second game against Andorra. Very important he played there. These are the situations we have to deal with and this is why we have these massive squads because we use players like machines. I’ve talked about it for six or seven years but no one is listening.”"

          "bodyText": "Time to wrap up... Here’s today’s main stories: Goodnight. GW Britain’s blue-chip stock index has closed at a 20-month high tonight, rounding off its best week in five months. The FTSE 100 closed 26 points higher at 7,234, up 0.37% today. That takes its gains this week to around 2%, the best since the first week of May. The index has now recovered most, but not all, of the losses since the pandemic hit Europe in February 2020: Online grocery firm Ocado (+3.8%) finished as top riser, followed by steelmaker Evraz (+3.75). British Airways parent company IAG (+3.2%) and Intercontinental Hotels (+2.6%) also rallied, as England’s move to allow fully vaccinated international passengers from non-red list companies to take a lateral flow test rather than a PCR boosted travel and hospitality stocks. Property firms, banks and oil companies also rallied. So far this year, the FTSE 100 is up almost 12%, as it clambers back towards its pre-pandemic levels. Russ Mould, investment director of AJ Bell, says: “It is interesting to see markets continue to press ahead despite the whirlwind of pressures from supply chain disruption, higher energy prices, rising wages and the threat of rising interest rates. “Investors seem to be taking the view that central bank monetary stimulus will remain in play and that we aren’t going to be punished by sharp inflation for a long time and interest rates reaching punchy levels. “Yes, the cost of living has gone up, but rates are coming from such a low base than it would take a very overheated economy to warrant central banks putting the cost of borrowing at such a level that becomes uncomfortable. “Equally, investors might actually be too complacent. It wouldn’t take much to cause a shock across markets and equity valuations are looking very rich in many places. Bad news and high ratings tend to result in sharp share price declines. “For now, strong results from banks, a decline in new jobless claims and lower than expected producer price inflation all from the US have served to put investors in a more positive mood. European markets also ended higher with the Stoxx 600 up 0.7%. For the week, European markets gained 2.6%, the best week since March. The energy crisis has driven the zinc price soaring. Bloomberg says that zinc jumped the most in six years today, after major producer Glencore cut production at its three European plants because of surging power prices. Zinc spiked as much as 12% on the London Metal Exchange in response, the biggest increase since October 2015. Yesterday Nyrstar, one of the world’s biggest smelters of the metal said that it would cut 50 per cent of its output in Europe due to rising energy prices. Rishi Sunak is set to confirm that the “pause” on public sector pay that affected 2.6 million teachers, police and civil servants will be lifted in April, as the economy bounces back from Covid. The chancellor imposed the freeze last November and it came into force in April. At the time, he said it was unfair for public sector workers to get a rise while many of their private sector counterparts were being furloughed or losing their jobs. With wages in many sectors rising, and the prime minister using his party conference speech to highlight the prospects for a “high-wage economy”, Treasury sources said that argument no longer applied. However, each Whitehall department will have to fund any pay increases from within its own budget, and TUC analysis shows that the pay of many public sector workers has fallen significantly in real terms after years of tight settlements. Sunak will set out the funding for each individual department as part of a three-year spending review, which he will deliver alongside the budget on 27 October. Here’s the full story: US consumer sentiment has dipped to its second-lowest level since 2011. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer morale has fallen to 71.4 this month, from 72.8 in September, as Americans grew more concerned about both current conditions and the economic outlook. Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, says: Consumer sentiment has remained for the past three months at the lows first recorded in response to last year’s shutdown of the economy. The Delta variant, supply chain shortages, and reduced labor force participation rates will continue to dim the pace of consumer spending into 2022. There is another, less tangible factor that has contributed to the slump in optimism: confidence in government economic policies has significantly declined during the past six months. When asked about their confidence in economic policies, favorable evaluations fell to 19% in early October from Biden’s honeymoon high of 31% in April, while unfavorable policy evaluations rose to 48% in early October from 32% in April. The price of petrol at UK pumps has passed £1.40 a litre, its highest point in almost a decade, increasing the pressure on consumers as inflation bites. Average forecourt prices were last this high in September 2012, and are 2.5p a litre from the all-time high in April of that year when global oil prices soared. Rapidly rising wholesale oil prices have compounded the supply chain problems hitting forecourts. After the queues for fuel and shortages of the past few weeks, petrol is once again largely freely available – but costing an average 5p a litre more than in September. According to AA figures, the average price of unleaded petrol is now 140.22p a litre, with diesel at 143.42p. Wall Street has opened higher, after the better-than-expected retail sales figures. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 271 points, or 0.78%, to 35,184 points. Industrials and financials are the best-performing sectors, after Goldman Sachs beat forecasts with a 63% rise in quarterly profits and a 23% increase in revenues. Real estate and energy are also performing well. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with ThinkMarkets, says investors are less anxious about the impact of supply chain disruption: US indices extended their gains on Friday as Goldman Sachs became the latest Wall Street giant to beat earnings estimates, while retail sales at the world’s largest economy also surprised to the upside with a gain of 0.7% despite concerns about inflation chippy away at consumers’ disposable incomes. Calm had actually returned to the markets in the middle of the week, when we saw global indices recover sharply – especially on Thursday. Investors decided enough was enough and bought the latest dip as they presumably figured that all the talks surrounding inflation and supply-chain issues were overblown. Judging by the bank earnings and the latest retail sales data, they may have a point. US retail sales have risen unexpectedly, despite the supply chain holdups which are hitting the economy. Retail sales rose by 0.7% last month, beating expectations of a 0.2% fall, and were 13.9% stronger than a year ago. Stripping out car sales, retail sales were up 0.8% during the month, and 15.6% up year-on-year, as consumers shrugged off signs that the US recovery might be slowing. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says there are some signs that the Delta variant had a lingering impact, with spending on food &amp; drink services up by a modest 0.3% m/m, following a 0.2% gain in August. Rising car prices also boosted retail spending, Hunter flags: Despite reports of increasingly widespread shortages, spending on goods apparently held up relatively well, with furniture sales edging up by 0.2%, sporting &amp; leisure goods sales jumping by 3.7%, clothing sales up by 1.1%. The latter may have been boosted by the reopening of most schools and some offices, however, which is probably a one-off. The 0.5% m/m rise in autos spending is, at face value, hard to square with the further 6.4% plunge in unit sales reported by manufacturers last month. But part of that gap is explained by the continued surge in vehicle prices and the bottom line is that real spending on autos is falling sharply. UK petrol prices have risen to their highest level in nine years, as rising crude prices feed through to the pumps. New data from the AA shows that petrol hit 140.22p per litre yesterday, the highest since September 2012, while diesel touched 143.42p. The rise follows the recent jump in oil prices (Brent crude hit $85/barrel today for the first time since 2018), as the energy crunch feeds through to motorists and transport firms. Higher fuel prices will add to the cost of living squeeze facing households, and the inflation pressures which could lead to higher interest rates. Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokesman, says: “We are particularly concerned about where diesel is going.” The wholesale price of diesel has gone up by 10p per litre since mid-September, Bosdet explained. That’s partly driven by demand for heating oil (as a substitute for gas which has soared in price) which comes from the same part of the oil barrel as diesel. Pump prices for diesel (which lag wholesale prices) have only risen by 5p per litre since the end of September, which suggests diesel prices could continue to rise, Bosdet says. Rising fuel costs, and the recent petrol shortages, could encourage consumers to shift to electric cars, as some electricity suppliers such as Octopus Energy and EDF offer specialist tariffs aimed at electric car drivers. Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, has made some interesting comments about the need to reshape supply chains following the semiconductor shortages that have hit industry.... .... and how Brexit exacerbated the impact of the supply chain crisis on the UK: The BBC’s Faisal Islam has the details: One of Britain’s most important electricity import cables will not return to full service for another two years after a fire forced it to shut, compounding the UK’s energy woes ahead of a looming winter crunch. The blaze at the Sellindge converter station in Kent forced a shutdown of the high-voltage cable that brings electricity from France to the UK last month as energy markets rocketed to all-time highs amid global energy supply difficulties. National Grid, which owns the 2,000 megawatt cable, expects half of its capacity to return to service on Wednesday but said “extensive work” would be needed to bring the power link back to full service. The FTSE 100 energy company hopes to bring another 500MW of capacity back to service between October 2022 and May 2023, meaning the cable will be running at three-quarters of its capacity through that winter. The cable, known as the IFA Interconnector, will finally return to full service after further work, which National Grid hopes to complete by October 2023. “We are completely focused on getting IFA safely returned to service as soon as possible and ensuring we are able to support security of supply.” Disruption at ports and in the supply chain, and combined with shortages of lorry drivers and other staff is going to lead to rising costs for consumers, according to trade body, the British Retail Consortium. It is warning that three out of five retail bosses expect prices to go up by the end of the year. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC, says: “There are clear signs that the cost pressures from rising transport costs, higher energy and commodity prices, and ongoing labour shortages, all of which are starting to filter through to consumer prices,” Opie added that the government’s allocation of temporary visas for foreign workers including HGV drivers would help to reduce some cost pressures, but it would take time for British employees to be trained up to work in the supply chain. Consumer confidence has already been hit by the cost-of-living squeeze: Soaring energy costs have taken a bite out of the eurozone’s trade surplus. The euro area’s trade in goods surplus dropped to €4.8bn in August, down from €14.0bn in August 2020. While goods exports rose 18.2% year-on-year, that was more than countered by a 26.6% jump in imports. The wider European Union racked up a €5.0bn trade deficit in August, down from a surplus of €10.8bn in August 2020. Eurostat’s data shows that the EU’s trade deficit in energy has swelled notably -- to €151.9bn in January-August, up from €108.7bn in the first eight months of 2020. Total EU goods imports from Russia, a major supplier of oil and gas to Europe, have jumped almost 50% so far this year. That has widened Europe’s trade deficit with Russia, to €37bn in January-August from €12.9bn. Trade with Norway, which also supplies the EU with energy, swung to a deficit of €2.4bn from a €3.6bn surplus. The report also shows that trade with the United Kingdom is much more subdued than with other major partners, in the first eight months since the Brexit free trade deal came in. EU exports to the UK have risen just 5.7% year-on-year, compared to 11.9% to the United States and 15.3% to China. Imports of UK goods are down -16.7% in January-August compared to the previous year, according to Eurostat’s data, while US imports are up 7.1% and imports from China have swelled 15.2%. Netflix paid just £4m in UK corporation tax in 2020 despite having the best year in its history, as a pandemic-fuelled viewing boom generated an estimated £1.15bn from its British subscribers. The streaming company, whose tax bill has risen 33% year-on-year to the highest level since it launched in the UK in 2012, added a record 36.6 million new subscribers globally, taking its total past 200 million. In the UK, it added about 2 million subscribers, making its British customer base an estimated 13 million people. Netflix UK reported a 43% increase in revenues to £172m, with pre-tax profits increasing by 50% to £19.4m across the three businesses the US company has registered at Companies House. However, the £1bn-plus Netflix makes annually from the monthly fees paid by its British fans is funnelled through separate accounts at its European headquarters in the Netherlands. Here’s the full story: Back in the energy world, Bloomberg has spotted that UK coal-fired power generation jumped to the highest in a month today. Coal picked up the slack as wind generation slumped in unusually calm weather, just as morning demand picked up. Here’s the details: Coal units run by Drax Group Plc, Uniper SE and Electricite de France SA all started up this morning, bringing total coal-fired output to 1,493 megawatts, or about 3% of demand. With natural gas costs still high and wind waning, peak power prices for Friday settled above 1,000 pounds a megawatt-hour in an auction Thursday, potentially boosting coal-fed production further. “The U.K. may further rely on coal output over the near term amidst rising gas prices, making coal economically viable over the short term,” RBC Europe said in an emailed note. RWE AG’s gas-fired plant in Pembroke, Wales, suffered an unplanned outage, reducing that fuel’s share of demand to 49% on Friday morning, while wind fell to 20%. Wind generation is forecast to rise near record levels next week. The chair of Britain’s financial watchdog is leaving early. Charles Randell has decided to step down as chair of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Payment Systems Regulator next spring, a year before his term expires. Randell took up his role as Chair of the FCA and PSR Boards in April 2018, for a five-year term. He says today that it’s time for a new chair. “As the FCA prepares to implement its new wholesale, retail and data strategies under an established new executive [Nikhil Rathi], now is the right time for a new Chair to carry on the close and continuous oversight of our transformation. “During the pandemic, the FCA stood up for consumers and businesses, while the markets we oversee proved resilient, laying the foundations for record capital raising to support the recovery. “The PSR has been working to ensure payment systems – the lifeblood of the economy – work well for all. “Being Chair of the FCA and PSR has been a great privilege.” The FCA is going through a turbulent time, as Financial News’ Lucy McNulty explains: Under the leadership of Rathi since October 2020, the FCA has been grappling with mounting workloads as Brexit gives more powers to UK regulators. It is also tasked with restarting initiatives derailed by the pandemic, all while undergoing significant structural changes, as well as changes to its top ranks, as part of the new chief’s ambitious transformation agenda. Here’s some reaction, from consumer finance campaigner Mark Taber: And Simon Harrington of the Personal Investment Management &amp; Financial Advice Association: Earlier this week, the Unite union launched a staff petition to secure the right to be formally recognised to represent workers across the organisation. Unite said FCA employees were “demoralised”, and unhappy with chief executive Nikhil Rathi’s transformation plans, which they believe will see their wages cut but are unlikely to affect the FCA’s leadership team. The UK’s energy crisis will cause more companies to collapse, warns Claire Burden, Partner in the Advisory Consulting team at wealth management and professional services group Tilney Smith &amp; Williamson. Here’s her take on this morning’s insolvency figures: The monthly insolvency statistics published by The Insolvency Service for the month of September 2021 shows the number of registered company insolvencies were at their highest since the start of the first UK lockdown in March 2020. This is effectively a rebalancing back to normalised insolvency levels across the economy, after the government support measures during the Covid pandemic. Total company insolvencies in England &amp; Wales in September 2021 were 56% higher than September 2020 and overall are now close to pre-pandemic levels (September 2021 numbers were 4% lower than the numbers registered in September 2019). The statistics will include some high profile energy businesses, due to the high cost of gas. We expect this energy cost issue to reverberate into additional sectors (manufacturing, consumer products and others) and cause further failures when combined with existing pressures of increased transport costs and supply issues. The number of Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs) in England &amp; Wales were 80% higher than in September 2020 and 21% higher than in September 2019. This is mainly driven by the large number of small businesses that are going insolvent, where directors are instigating CVLs and there are limited options to sell as a going concern. SMEs need to focus on cash flow plans, Burden adds, including repayment of Covid loans, HMRC arrears and rising operating and product costs alongside repaying debt that was in place pre-pandemic. As always, businesses can avoid insolvency if they seek advice early enough. The number of companies in England and Wales choosing to be liquidated has risen to its highest in over two and half years. The Insolvency Service reports that there were 1,328 Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations (CVLs) in September, filed by companies who couldn’t repay their debts. That’s the highest level since January 2019 -- up from 1,256 CVLs in August. HMRC says: The number of registered company insolvencies was similar to pre-pandemic levels, driven by this higher number of CVLs, although other types of company insolvencies, such as compulsory liquidations, remained lower. Companies can choose to enter a CVL if they cannot repay their borrowing, rather than being being forced to do so by a winding-up petition filed by a creditor. In total, there were 1,446 registered company insolvencies in England and Wales during September, up from 1,348 in August: That is: 56% higher than the number registered in the same month in the previous year (928 in September 2020), but 4% lower than the number registered two years previously (pre-pandemic; 1,510 in September 2019). John Bell, senior partner at Clarke Bell Insolvency Practitioners in Manchester, fears that more companies will collapse in the coming months -- especially if Christmas is tough: “As we head towards the Budget it is interesting to see that the number of company insolvency procedures have increased again - with the number of Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidations at the highest level since January 2019. I wonder if this will influence any of the government’s plans. “Business owners have been hit by a range of additional problems recently – including the end of furlough and the temporary restrictions relating to winding-up petitions and statutory demands. I think we are going to see the number of company liquidations increase in the coming months, as the burdens on some companies just become unbearable. “March 2022 sees the end of the ban on landlords evicting firms for unpaid commercial rent, which I think is really going to shake things up for a lot of companies. Many businesses will be relying on a profitable Christmas period to enable them to pay all the historic debt they have built up – including all their rent arrears. However, I’m not confident that this is going to be a bountiful Christmas for everyone.” Private taxi giant Addison Lee is to recruit 1,000 drivers in London amid growing demand for its services as the capital recovers from the virus crisis, PA Media reports. The company said it is offering drivers a “market-leading” package, with a guarantee of £5,000 for the first month of employment, a pension and holiday pay. Between August and September, Addison Lee said its passenger car journeys in London increased by more than 40%, and the company expects to see continued growth throughout the Christmas period. Chief executive Liam Griffin said: “Throughout the pandemic, we have put drivers first, and as London recovers, we’re delighted to be able to grow the driver community with market-leading rates of pay and benefits. “It’s encouraging to see London reopening and the city coming back to life. Drivers will have a huge role to play in helping people getting around the city as safely and reliably as possible. “Our latest recruitment drive is designed to ensure we continue to support existing drivers and meet future demand.” The news follows Addison Lee’s announcement last month to transition its standard fleet to fully electric by 2023. The pound has hit a three-week high against the US dollar today, despite some Bank of England policymakers trying to calm expectations of an early interest rate rise. Sterling has gained half a cent to $1.3725, the highest since late September. Against the euro, it’s close to Thursday’s two-month high (around €1.182). The market is pricing in a 72.4% chance of a rate hike at the BoE’s December 2021 meeting, up from a 45.6% chance a week ago, according to CME data (via Reuters). But yesterday, two of the Bank of England’s nine-strong monetary policy committee pushed back against calls to raise borrowing costs. Silvana Tenreyro argued that a rate rise would be “self-defeating” if inflationary pressures turn out to be temporary. Catherine Mann pointed out that the anticipation of a rate rise means financial conditions were already tightening, reducing the pressure to actually hike Bank rate. They see that monetary policy normalisation is the direction of travel … and so they are doing their homework and they are starting to price in that direction of travel,” Here’s our full story on the cabotage changes to allow overseas lorry drivers to make more deliveries in the UK: Sales of new cars across Europe slumped by a quarter last month, as shortages of semiconductors hit the industry. New passenger car registrations fell 25.2% in the European Union, Britain and the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) compared to last year, figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed. ACEA said the global chip shortage left dealers with fewer cars to sell: “This decrease in sales was largely caused by a lack of supply of vehicles due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage.” Within the EU, registrations shrank by 23.1% - the worst September since 1995. All major EU markets recording double-digit declines: Italy (-32.7%), Germany (-25.7%), France (-20.5%) and Spain (-15.7%). Figures this month showed UK car sales plunged by 34% in September, the worst since 1998. The energy crisis, the easing of travel restrictions, and the prospect of rising interest rates all helped drive up the London stock market to 20-month highs today. Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Key is energy – BP and Shell among the top performers of the last month and have a big index weighting. That’s BP and Shell, which are both up more than 20% in the last month as oil and natural gas prices have soared. Next is the two big reopening stories – IAG and Rolls Royce, they are the best performers of the last month among the blue chips. Reopening of travel has been a major factor and we see more good news today with the move to lateral flow tests for international arrivals. Then third we have the big banks – HSBC, Lloyds, StanChart and NatWest have all rallied over 10% in the last month as rates have risen and the macro environment has held up pretty well. Bets the Bank of England is far closer to raising rates have helped, but global bond yields have also been moving higher. The FTSE is exposed to the winds of the global economy and trade, which despite it all are holding up well, and UK shares remain heavily discounted to peers. The FTSE 250, a better gauge of the UK economy, has ticked higher in the last few sessions but is down by around 5% from its Sep high. European bourses are also higher today, as investors regain their nerves after some choppy sessions earlier this month. This optimism may be surprising, given growing worries that the energy shock will weigh on economic growth, eat into company profits and squeeze households. Jeffrey Halley of OANDA says good results from US banks this week have boosted the mood, as did a drop in American unemployment claims and factory gate inflation (as blogged yesterday). Market risk sentiment improved noticeably as US banking heavyweights rolled out a procession of strong earnings prints, weekly Initial Jobless Claims fell by much more than expected and US YoY and MoM headline and Core PPI rose by less than expected. Steelmaker Evraz (+2.6%) has climbed to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, followed by hotel operator Whitbread (+2%), airline group IAG (+1.9%), mining and commodities player Glencore (+1.5%) oil major BP (+1.5%) and banking group HSBC (+1.5%). There’s no let up in the energy crunch, as oil prices climb again. Brent crude has just struck a new three-year high this morning, jumping 1% to hit $85 per barrel, as rising demand and surging gas prices drive up oil. US crude also touched a new seven-year high, around $82.20 per barrel. These rollicking energy prices are adding to the inflationary pressures hitting households and businesses. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank told clients: Inflation concerns are still very much with us...yesterday saw Bloomberg’s Commodity Spot Index (+1.16%) advance to yet another record high, exceeding the previous peak from early last week. That was partly down to the continued rise in oil prices. The FTSE 100 has gained 1.75% this week -- putting it on track for its best week since May (if it holds today’s gains...). Precious and industrial miners have been the biggest gainers this week on rising metal prices, reports Reuters. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level since the market crashed almost 20 months ago. The index of blue-chip stocks jumped to 7242.73 in early trading, up 35 points, above the previous pandemic high set in August. Oil stocks are driving the rally, as crude prices continue to be driven up in the energy crunch. BP has gained 1.7%, with Royal Dutch Shell up 1.3%. Banks, airlines, and hospitality companies are also among the risers. That’s the FTSE 100’s highest level since late February 2020, when global markets began to plunge as coronavirus cases and deaths rose in Europe, and Italy’s Lombardy region imposed a lockdown. Despite today’s gains, the FTSE 100 has still not recovered to its pre-pandemic levels yet, unlike the US and European markets which have hit a series of record highs this year. Grant Shapps has also been speaking to LBC, and admitted that the government’s offer of emergency visas to overseas lorry drivers hasn’t been a success. Shapps says the offer attracted “very, very few” overseas drivers, despite the strong interest in attracting more drivers for fuel tankers in particular. However, Shapps says the offer had a limited impact in adding drivers to the UK’s fleet. Just dozens, not hundreds, not thousands. In a brisk exchange with LBC’s Nick Ferrari, Shapps says the government always said it wasn’t the answer (before pulling a u-turn after a week of petrol station chaos). Q: So why did you do it then, if it wasn’t the answer? Shapps says the haulage association were insisting it was the answer. Q: The haulage association tells the government what to do? “Far from it”, insists Shapps, arguing it was right to ‘test every avenue’, and not to leave any stone unturned. We’ve turned that stone. It’s not the solution that some in haulage thought it was. Training more UK drivers is the answer, Shapps insists, so the government has streamlined the process and added more testing capacity. Earlier this week, Oliver Dowden, the Conservative party chair, revealed that just 20 UK emergency visas have been issued to HGV drivers from abroad so far, and that around 300 applications had been received. Transport minister Grant Shapps says he’s confident people would be able to buy gifts at Christmas, despite problems at the ports. Fears about Christmas stock shortages grew this week after Felixstowe, the UK’s biggest container port, was forced to turn away ships from Asia because of a backlog of containers caused by the HGV driver shortage. That fueled concerns that toys and electrical goods diverted from Felixstowe wouldn’t reach the shops in time. But Shapps told Sky News that “People will be able to get things for Christmas,” adding: “When I talk to the ports they said it is a busy picture, but if you compared us with lots of other ports around the world, we need to keep this in proportion, things are flowing.” Shapps also points to the queues of ships off the Port of Los Angeles in California, which is moving to 24-hour operations to clear the backlog, as evidence that the supply chain crisis is a global one. Shapps also pledged that there will be “no issues” seeing family and loved ones this Christmas -- and that the cabotage changes will support supply chains. Britain’s haulage industry has heavily criticised the government’s plan to relax cabotage rules for overseas drivers. Rod McKenzie, managing director of Policy and Public Affairs at the Road Haulage Association, has told the Today Programme that his members are appalled by the plan to allow foreign drivers make unlimited deliveries within the UK during a fortnight. “Ridiculous, pathetic, gobsmacked” were some of their more broadcast-able comments, McKenzie says (with an eye on the early morning audience): The government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy, and not pulling the lever marked ‘uncontrolled immigration’, and to them [RHA members], this is exactly what it looks like. The plan would allow overseas haulage firms to undercut UK hauliers, McKenzie fears, at a time when they face ‘acute driver shortages’, rising costs and staff wages, as well as poor roadside facilities. This is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving to Europeans who don’t pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers. Q: But this is trying to address those driver shortages, and it’s temporary - isn’t it a neat solution to the supply chain crisis? McKenzie replies that the government wants to save Christmas, and to be seen to be saving Christmas. Extra drivers will clearly help with Christmas deliveries. So from a “simple populist point of view”, you can see what the government is doing... but it doesn’t help hard-working UK hauliers, McKenzie says. We don’t want cabotage to sabotage our industry. The government, though, says the plan will bolster the UK’s supply chain. Under the proposals released last night: thousands more HGV deliveries could be made each month thanks to temporary changes to ‘cabotage’ to help ensure resilience of country’s supply chains consultation launching today would allow foreign transport operators to make unlimited journeys for 2 weeks before returning home More here: Government set to bolster supply chains by extending cabotage rights Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain’s stock market is heading for a pandemic high today, as investors shrug off worries that the global energy crunch will slow the recovery. The FTSE 100, which has lagged other major markets since the pandemic, is on track to open at its highest level since the crash of February 2020. That would take it closer to its levels before Covid-19 hit. The Footsie has been lifted by heavyweight oil and mining stocks in recent sessions, as the prices of oil, gas, and a range of other commodities have surged to multiyear highs. Surging energy prices and supply chain tensions are eating into corporate earnings, and already forcing some factories around the world to suspend production. But the mood today seems brighter. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: There still seems to be an element of complacency amongst investors that rising energy prices won’t prompt a wave of demand destruction, especially if supply chain snarl-ups also feed into higher prices, which consumers then can’t absorb. Yesterday’s US PPI prices [factory gate prices] for September still came in at a record high, but there was evidence that the trend was starting to slow, however in recent months we have seen evidence that US retail sales, has been slowing, while consumer confidence has also fallen sharply from the peaks we saw at the start of, and during Q2. With that in mind today’s US retail sales numbers for September and University of Michigan confidence numbers could be key indicators as to whether we’ve seen a trough after the Delta related slowdowns seen during Q3. Meanwhile, UK businesses are digesting two more government u-turns on overseas workers yesterday. Faced with the prospect of a mass pig cull, it gave the go-ahead for 800 foreign butchers to come and work in Britain on seasonal visas. And with Britain’s supply chains badly stretched, foreign lorry drivers could soon be allowed to make more deliveries in the UK. Ministers have launched a consultation on extending cabotage rights, allowing foreign HGV drivers to make unlimited journeys for two weeks within the UK before returning home. Under the current rules drivers can only make two trips within seven days. If approved after the one-week consultation, the proposals would come into force before the end of the year and last for six months. Will that be in time to address pre-Christmas shortages?...

          "headline": "UK petrol price passes £1.40 a litre, highest in almost a decade",
          "bodyText": "The price of petrol at UK pumps has passed £1.40 a litre, its highest point in almost a decade, increasing the pressure on consumers as inflation bites. Average forecourt prices were last this high in September 2012, and are 2.5p a litre from the all-time high in April of that year when global oil prices soared. Rapidly rising wholesale oil prices have compounded the supply chain problems hitting forecourts. After the queues for fuel and shortages of the past few weeks, petrol is once again largely freely available – but costing an average 5p a litre more than in September. According to AA figures, the average price of unleaded petrol is 140.22p a litre, with diesel at 143.42p. Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokesman, said the organisation was “particularly concerned about where diesel is going” after the wholesale price rose by 10p a litre since mid-September. Pump prices for diesel have risen by 5p a litre since September, suggesting further increases lie ahead given that they lag the wholesale cost, Bosdet said. The Petrol Retailers Association had warned that higher prices at the pumps would quickly ensue after motorists emptied many stations, leaving stocks low or non-existent. The body, which represents independent forecourts, stressed that price rises were not down to any “profiteering” by retailers during the panic-buying crisis but were because of global factors. Brent crude oil has doubled in price over the last 12 months, from $42 (£30.50) in October 2020 to $84, as demand has soared while Russia and the Opec countries cut output. The pound has weakened slightly against the dollar in recent months, making it more expensive again for UK retailers. The cost of filling the tank has grown by more than a quarter in a year in Britain, compounding misery for consumers facing higher energy bills and food price increases, and adding to inflationary pressures that could in turn prompt higher interest rates. Spiralling petrol costs may increase the appeal of electric vehicles, whose running costs are minimal, although the purchase price of new battery electric cars is higher. A record 33,000 EV cars were sold last month, 15% of all new vehicles registered. Record prices will likely further remove any possibility of the chancellor increasing fuel duty, which has been frozen since 2012."

          "bodyText": "Canberra’s emergency services say a “pungent smell” that resulted in people being warned to avoid a local shopping centre amid fears of a gas leak was actually caused by a piece of fruit. On Friday, the ACT’s Fire and Rescue department confirmed a shopping centre in the suburb of Dickson was cleared due to fears of a gas leak. After an hour spent searching for the leak, firefighters confirmed the source of the smell was “in fact a durian fruit”. “The fruit gives off a very pungent smell and can waft some distance,” the fire agency said in a statement. “After an hour on scene, as firefighters were searching for the source, the owners of a tenancy above the shops advised of the potential source of the incident. After a short investigation, crews confirmed this was the origin of the incident. Crews have now departed.” Earlier the ACT’s Emergency Services Agency had issued a “hazardous materials – gas leak” warning asking people to “avoid the area” of the Dickson shops. Durian-related incidents have become relatively common in Australia in recent years. The Malaysian fruit is extremely popular across south-east Asia but has an extremely pungent odour and is banned from some hotels and public transport. It is the second durian-related evacuation in the ACT in the past two years. In 2019, a University of Canberra library was evacuated due to “a strong smell of gas” which also turned out to be coming from the fruit. It was later found near an air vent on the library’s second level and was eventually removed in a sealed bag. A year before that, in 2018, about 600 staff and students at the RMIT campus in Melbourne’s CBD had to be evacuated as almost 40 firefighters, including specialist crews, searched the building for a feared gas leak."

          "headline": "GPs have become the new fall guys for government failures",
          "bodyText": "The corridors of my once bustling GP’s surgery were eerily quiet, the waiting room deserted. The new routine too was disconcerting; wait in the car park, phone to announce your arrival, and only then will someone in full PPE collect you, as gingerly as if they were handling a suspect parcel. But arguably that’s what we all are now, at least to the kind of clinically vulnerable people often found in doctors’ waiting rooms. The cheerful nurse who did my smear test a few weeks ago – sorry if that’s too much information, but take this as a friendly reminder that too many people put off life-saving screening appointments during the pandemic – confided that, days earlier, someone had pitched up for a routine non-urgent test maskless, coughing and with a temperature. Despite the risk of infecting the whole building, they had still been startled to be sent home. This nervous arm’s-length handling of patients – fending some off with telephone or video consultations, staggering appointments for the rest so that the unknowingly infected don’t mingle with the frail or immunologically compromised – exists for good reason. But it also means distressed people wait longer to see a doctor, while fuelling understandable fears of something being missed over Zoom. A GP interviewed on Radio 4’s Today programme on Thursday morning talked of receptionists quitting, sick of being screamed at by frustrated patients. Why, she asked, weren’t ministers defending doctors against what the chair of the Royal College of GPs, Martin Marshall, calls “malicious criticism” from some press and politicians who have effectively branded them shirkers? But, faced with the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail on the warpath, the new health secretary, Sajid Javid, is no mood for subtlety. Two weeks ago he told social care workers, already in desperately short supply, to “get out and go and get another job” if they didn’t want the Covid vaccine (compulsory from 11 November for working in a care home in England). Now it’s GPs’ turn to take some medicine. The spoonful of sugar is an extra £250m in funding for GPs in England – not enough, according to the Royal College, holding its annual conference this week – but there will also be rights for patients to insist on seeing a doctor in person, the publishing of data allowing lagging surgeries to be named and shamed, and the scrapping of social-distancing rules in surgeries. The days of clapping for carers suddenly feel a long time ago. People will always seek more from their NHS: who doesn’t want appointments on the day of our choice, the reassurance of being whisked through to a specialist for anything dubious, or prompt surgery if it’s needed? But that costs billions, opening up hard choices that neither politicians nor voters particularly want to face. Whenever a gap yawns between aspiration and reality, it’s tempting for politicians just to spray the blame around, even if that risks tarnishing people who have risked their working lives on the Covid frontline and spent their days off volunteering at vaccination centres. Take enough potshots at lazy, overpaid GPs – and of course there will be some, as in any profession – and maybe people won’t ask too many awkward questions about what was happening to the NHS in the decade of Conservative rule leading up to “one of the worst public health failures” in British history, as this week’s joint select committee inquiry described the handling of the pandemic. There has been much public huffing and puffing about the number of GPs going part-time – the slackers! – yet arguably that’s what has allowed many doctors to absorb the ever-intensifying pressures on them without feeling driven to hang up their stethoscopes. Five years ago, researchers for health charity the King’s Fund were surprised by how few GPs seemed to be working full-time. Contrary to popular belief, they found that it wasn’t simply down to mothers cutting back after having children; older men too were increasingly shortening their hours, most likely as an alternative to retiring early. Doctors seemed to be trying to avoid burnout, or the deadly mistakes too easily made when you’re tired. Some were using their supposed “days off” for paperwork. Yet the fewer hours that GPs want to work, the more GPs we need. The result of a previous Conservative government’s failure to respond quickly enough to this potential crunch is a system in England with 1,900 fewer doctors than it had in 2015, yet still cramming in record numbers of appointments. An unusually despairing British Medical Association report this summer warned that “we’re working too hard, we’re burning out and we’re terrified of making mistakes”. Patients feel short-changed and doctors demoralised, especially in parts of the country where new housing estates have mushroomed faster than new surgeries meant to serve them. What Javid risks squandering is the goodwill holding things together, which perhaps explains the more emollient tone he took in Thursday’s Daily Mail, writing that his mum always hoped he’d become a doctor. Javid wouldn’t be the first health secretary to learn that doctors aren’t easily browbeaten into submission – not least because, once they leave, their replacements take so long to train. At the height of the last major attempt to cut NHS waiting lists, under Tony Blair, the Department of Health spent months soothing ruffled feathers after a briefing suggesting consultants were spending too much time treating lucrative private patients (or playing golf). Javid will only get through a potentially difficult winter by working with doctors, not berating them. And, while it’s obvious that many patients (and, indeed, doctors) just want to go back to the good old days of “the doctor will see you now”, stuffing the telemedicine genie back into its bottle may prove just as hard as nagging born-again home-workers back into the office. Talk to GPs and they’ll tell you that, now there’s the option of a phone consultation, some patients are more likely to call the doctor with things that didn’t seem worth it before. Expectations of what they exist to do may be expanding, not shrinking, especially among the so-called “worried well”. A hybrid system of seeing some people face to face and some remotely may mean fitting more patients in than a complete return to the old normal – although crucially that will only work if the triage systems used to decide who should and shouldn’t be physically examined are good enough. But wasn’t the whole point of “building back better” to extract any useful lessons from this strangest of years and develop them, rather than just defaulting back to a flawed norm? Given the daunting challenge now facing the NHS as it struggles to get waiting lists down, Javid may well need to push health professionals far from their comfort zones in the coming months. But if he wants their co-operation in doing so, he’ll have to show he can be flexible too. To mangle an old saying: politician, heal thyself. Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "1) Last hurrah for Bruce on Tyneside? It feels trivial discussing mere football matters when set against the ethical concerns arising from Newcastle’s Saudi takeover, but it feels as if whatever happens on the pitch against Tottenham will accelerate Steve Bruce’s departure. He is unlikely to get much credit if his side record a first league win of the season; instead it will only heighten the sense of “new broom” momentum that would require a bigger-name manager as soon as possible, while defeat would only serve to demonstrate the immediate need for change. It helps Bruce that Newcastle’s first opponents of the new era are a side who have been desperately unconvincing for at least a month, and who could be there for the taking if the hosts get on the front foot early. Defeat for Spurs would intensify the early pressure on Bruce’s counterpart, Nuno Espírito Santo, and heighten the focus on the various aspects of Tottenham’s game that aren’t functioning properly, particularly if Harry Kane remains goalless. It will be a morally queasy occasion but the party atmosphere might just work in Newcastle’s favour, for all the good it will do Bruce. TD • Newcastle v Tottenham, Sunday 4.30pm (all times BST) 2) Burnley will test City’s lack of pace Manchester City lack a bit of pace, a strange thing to write about a Pep Guardiola side but true nevertheless. This is partly because, by signing Jack Grealish and playing him on the left, they have removed it from an area of the pitch in which it is generally found, but also because they have no centre-forward and have a panoply of beautiful midfielders who – apart from Kevin De Bruyne – lack the legs to run beyond the strikers. In some games, most recently against Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool, this doesn’t matter much, because the desire of such teams to attack means they can be passed and run around. But Burnley will stick eight men behind the ball, so the ability to beat then escape them could be crucial in preventing the kind of draw foisted upon City when Southampton visited. As such, perhaps it’s time for Guardiola to restore Raheem Sterling to his league starting XI, because though he is out of form, his ability to manufacture space and time back-post arrivals could be important against a well-organised defence. DH • Manchester City v Burnley, Saturday 3pm 3) Solskjær needs more than a good result Neither Leicester nor Manchester United have made auspicious starts to the season, but though United are still handily placed, it is they who come into this game under more pressure; where Leicester need a result, their opponents need a result and a performance. In their quest to achieve this, they will be without Raphäel Varane and perhaps Harry Maguire, but if they fail, those absences will not be the reason. First of all, Leicester will be missing Wesley Fofana, Wilfred Ndidi and James Justin and cannot spend as much as United on mitigating such misfortune. But beyond that, Victor Lindelöf is a decent defender who should be experienced enough to stop Eric Bailly, his likely partner, going off on crazy adventures, and Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side have attackers good enough to score goals quicker than their defenders can give them away. The question – this weekend and for the remainder of the season – is whether their midfield can feed the former while protecting the latter. DH • Leicester v Manchester United, Saturday 3pm 4) Will Ranieri conjure spirit and coherence? Quite why Watford appoint managers on contracts longer than a year remains a mystery, and Claudio Ranieri’s first game under his two-year deal could scarcely be tougher, Liverpool at home kickstarting a gruelling eight-game run that also includes both Manchester clubs and Chelsea. Ranieri will not be judged – you’d hope – on results in those games but performances will need to be more coherent and spirited than most this term under Xisco Muñoz. The Tinkerman’s ability to get the best out of limited resources will be tested to the full given Watford’s current injury problems. Ranieri’s attitude and experience mean he won’t feel the pressure as much as some – “I maintain my spirit, no one can kill me,” he said at his unveiling – so Liverpool might have a tougher afternoon than might have been anticipated had Xisco remained in post at a venue where they suffered an emphatic first defeat of their title-winning campaign two seasons ago. TD • Watford v Liverpool, Saturday 12.30pm 5) Frank v Tuchel adds intrigue to derby Chelsea at home will have been among the games Brentford fans most eagerly looked for when the fixtures came out. The west London sides have not met in the league since a crowd of 33,000 shoehorned into Griffin Park to watch a Chelsea side spearheaded by Tommy Lawton win a top-flight match 2-0 in 1947. And though Thomas Frank’s side are firm underdogs, they might go into it in better spirits than their opponents. Brentford’s win at West Ham felt like the most significant of their three wins to date, demonstrating an ability to absorb pressure and grab victory on the break that has often eluded other easy-on-the-eye promoted sides in recent seasons (notably neighbouring Fulham). Chelsea haven’t hit top gear for a while but N’Golo Kanté’s likely return from injury may give Thomas Tuchel’s team the industry and nous to edge a meeting of two of the top flight’s cannier and more interesting coaches. TD • Brentford v Chelsea, Saturday 5.30pm 6) Benítez and Moyes to deliver match of the weekend? Rafael Benítez versus David Moyes sounds like a battle from another decade, two footballing dinosaurs struggling to stay relevant. But the reality is very different and proves, yet again, that much as some like to obfuscate and complicate, football remains a simple game; whether you call “sitting midfielders” a “double pivot” or “putting them under” a “high press”, quality is quality. Everton arrive at this game in decent spirits, thanks to a point earned at Old Trafford before the break. Crucial to that was Benítez’s decision to play three wingers; the speed, flexibility and creativity of Anthony Gordon, Andros Townsend and Demarai Gray asked questions United struggled to answer, and with Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin still injured, that looks a sensible way to pick through and around the two banks of four Moyes will almost definitely deploy. West Ham, though, will be far less open in transition and look nicely grooved going forward, so this should be a terrific contest and might well be the match of the weekend. DH • Everton v West Ham, Sunday 2pm 7) Villa needing spot of creativity On the face of things, 10th isn’t a bad spot for Aston Villa to be in; they finished 11th last season, then lost their best player and talisman Jack Grealish. But though they’ve pulled off a couple of decent results, they’ve not been great overall, Dean Smith tinkering with formation and personnel in search of his best starting XI. As such, Emi Buendía – at £38m a club record signing – has begun the last four league games on the bench, to facilitate a solid but stolid midfield of Douglas Luiz, Jacob Ramsey and John McGinn. It may be that Buendía’s best position is on the right of an attacking trio, a position that, given Villa’s 3-5-2 setup, does not currently exist – a situation that looks unlikely to change, given the presence in the squad of Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins. However, both those players need service and, already deprived of wingers and overlaps, would benefit from Smith sacrificing a holder in order to reintroduce the creativity that Buendía brings. DH • Aston Villa v Wolves, Saturday 3pm 8) Will Arsenal develop a natural game? When Mikel Arteta took over at Arsenal he inherited a bloated squad lacking quality and requisite mentality for a top Premier League club. Since then, he has done a decent job of replacing those he didn’t fancy, to such an extent that his first XI now has a player he likes in every position, but with that comes pressure, especially as Arsenal, though capable of performing well, struggle to score – only Norwich have managed fewer than their five league goals. Whether Arteta can solve that problem is unclear, because while cohesion will improve as familiarity increases, there is a general lack of imagination, freedom and competitive charisma in the way Arsenal attack that does not fit with the personality their manager projects. He may find Crystal Palace to his liking, because Patrick Vieira played under Arsène Wenger in his golden age so his side get the ball forward quickly, leaving space in behind. But until Arteta finds a way to get his team playing naturally, it’ll continue to be less good than the players in it. DH • Arsenal v Crystal Palace, Monday 8pm 9) Leeds look to find ruthless side For fans of a certain vintage, meetings of Leeds and Southampton will always prompt memories of Don Revie’s team’s 7-0 romp in 1972. The famous, almost cruel passing sequence at the end was regarded as other-worldly in a way Marcelo Bielsa’s football often has. But Bielsa could do with some of the ruthlessness of 50 years ago, Leeds’ recent defeat by West Ham typifying a failure to make flair count. The unavailability of Patrick Bamford, who has an ankle problem, and possible absence of Raphinha, a late returner from international duty with Brazil, will blunt that flair further, and Bielsa will hope Kalvin Phillips has recovered from injury sufficiently to bring some much-needed steel and reliability to the side. Southampton played reasonably well in their last outing, a defeat at Chelsea, and Leeds could find their failings exploited again. TD 10) Hanley offers hope for toiling Canaries There is much Norwich could learn from Brighton, a similar-sized club from a one-team city who have learned how to adapt and survive in the top flight following promotion in 2017, while the Canaries have yo-yoed between the top two divisions. Daniel Farke’s side looked to be reprising their hapless 2019-20 campaign in the early weeks, but there were more hopeful signs in the admittedly dour goalless draw at Burnley before the break that yielded Norwich’s first point. The form of Grant Hanley, offering a tenacity and leadership at the back that has been too often missing, and the increasing promise further forward of the likes of Mathias Normann give Farke hope that Groundhog Day may yet be avoided, and – despite Brighton’s current seventh place – a Seagulls side that still don’t score as many goals as their attacking play merits could yet be susceptible. Norwich have to go for it. TD"

          "bodyText": "Amazon has urged owners of its Ring security cameras and doorbells – which come with a camera and microphone – to respect neighbours’ privacy after a court ruled their use broke data laws. A neighbour complained about use of the devices, which can be remotely accessed by homeowners via an app, by Jon Woodard, a plumber from Oxfordshire. A judge at Oxford county court said the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation had been breached and Woodard now faces a substantial fine. The court also upheld the claim that the devices contributed to harassment. Judge Melissa Clarke said the video images and audio files that the Ring doorbell and cameras captured of the neighbour, Dr Mary Fairhurst, were her personal data. The ruling stated that the devices’ ability to capture conversations at ranges of between 40ft and 68ft (12m-20m) away was excessive. “The extent of range to which these devices can capture audio is well beyond the range of video that they capture, and in my view cannot be said to be reasonable for the purpose for which the devices are used by the defendant, since the legitimate aim for which they are said to be used, namely crime prevention, could surely be achieved by something less,” said Clarke. The judgment records that Fairhurst was “alarmed and appalled” to see that Woodard had a camera on his shed, with footage sent to his smartphone. A series of disputes about the cameras between the neighbours, in Thame, led Fairhurst to move out of her home, the court heard. The Ring device captured images of the claimant’s house and garden, while the shed camera covered most of her garden and her parking space, the judgment found. Woodard, who said he installed the devices in good faith to deter burglars, told the Sun he feared bankruptcy. ‘This court ruling means I am probably going to have to go bankrupt and close the business down because I can’t afford £100,000, I can’t even afford £5,000. How is that fair?” In a statement Amazon said: “We strongly encourage our customers to respect their neighbours’ privacy and comply with any applicable laws when using their Ring product.” The tech company said there were privacy settings on its devices including an “audio toggle” to turn sound recording on and off. ProPrivacy, the digital rights group, said the ruling did not create a legal precedent in the UK but should prompt people to consider “whether we’re comfortable decorating our neighbourhoods with powerful CCTV gadgets”. “The fact remains that anyone with a Ring Doorbell can turn their area of the neighbourhood into a surveilled space due to its video recording functionality and audio processors, which are able to pick up sound 40ft away,” said Hannah Hart, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. “This means a small number of residents can effectively transform public spaces into surveillance hotbeds, and even share their recordings with police.” • This article was amended on 15 October 2021. An earlier version stated in a quote that the Ring Doorbell could pick up sound “40 metres away”; the intended distance was 40ft."

          "bodyText": "Concern has been growing for years that GPs are burning out, and sometimes dropping out, in the face of increasingly heavy and complex workloads that many have described as being already unsustainable, if not impossible. In a tweet in September, Dr Laura Mount, a GP in Warrington, offered an insight into just how relentlessly busy family doctors were day in, day out, in a way that few other staff in the public or private sector experienced. Mount, who stressed that she “loved seeing patients”, related how in her first hour at work she saw three patients face to face, booked to see another one at 7am the day after, talked to two more patients in person with a trainee doctor present, dealt with 16 queries, 30 prescriptions, 34 emails and five referral letters from hospitals, each containing instructions about what they needed to do – all in 60 minutes. “Nine more hours to go. Also my daughter’s first day at high school,” she added. In May another GP, Dr Danielle Eaton, tweeted about leaving. “I handed my notice in Friday. I am a GP and love the NHS and what it stands for, both patients and professionals. However, primary care is unsustainable currently. It is with a heavy heart that I leave.” She was moving to a job that involved less pressure and a better work/life balance, she said. Jeremy Hunt, the UK health secretary between 2012 and 2018, said on Thursday that despite success in increasing the number of trainee GPs in England to record levels, the overall number of full-timers continued to drop “because experienced GPs were retiring/going part-time faster than new trainees arrived”. Official figures collated by NHS Digital show that the number of full-time GPs fell from 29,403 in September 2015 – the month in which Hunt pledged to expand the GP workforce by 5,000 by 2020 – to 28,023 in August this year, a drop of 1,380 at a time when numbers should have been rising. Hunt said, in effect, that forces beyond his control – how GPs felt about their work, their intense frustration at the growing demands on them and fear that rapid-turnover medicine could lead to mistakes – had wiped out what would otherwise have been laudable progress. In addition, the 4% rise in England’s population since 2015 means there is now one full-time-equivalent GP for every 2,045 patients, an increase of 182 patients (9.7%) in six years. The ageing population – the numbers of over-65s have increased 10% in that time – is also adding to the volume and complexity of care GPs are expected to deliver. The 27% of patients who have what doctors call “multi-morbidities” account for 53% of patient consultations. Those statistics help to explain why, faced with a declining workforce but growing demand for care, GPs often describe general practice as “in crisis” or “on its knees”. The government has made two key pledges to try to tackle this mismatch of supply and demand: hiring 6,000 extra GPs and, second, by 2024, recruiting 26,000 practice support staff such as pharmacists, physiotherapists, mental health workers and social prescribers, who could see some patients. Few think the first plan will happen but progress towards the second goal is going better, with 8,400 of the promised 26,000 already in place. Despite that glimmer of hope, this remains a fragile and overburdened workforce, with no prospect that real relief – in the shape of the thousands of extra GPs the profession and ministers agree are needed – is arriving any time soon. The insistence this week by Sajid Javid, the health secretary, that from now on every patient wanting a face-to-face appointment should get one risks worsening a serious situation by prompting already overworked, disillusioned family doctors to quit. Hefty pensions and good career earnings make leaving an easy option for those doctors in their 50s. Prof Martin Marshall, head of the Royal College of GPs, who has just turned 60, related at its annual conference on Thursday how many of the GPs he had trained with had already retired. So while the health secretary may be pleasing backbench MPs and government-friendly newspapers with his tough new approach, there must be a risk that it will prompt even greater numbers of people whose role and dedication is so vital to the smooth functioning of the NHS to quit – and so leave his pledge, for patients’ automatic “see the doctor” right, as just another broken promise on GPs. • This article was amended on 22 October 2021 to fix a chart that showed incorrect information for the fall in the number of GPs since 2015."

          "headline": "Coldplay: Music of the Spheres review – slipping status prompts a desperate pop pivot",
          "bodyText": "In 2004, Chris Martin wrote a brief essay about U2 for Rolling Stone magazine. They were, he said, “the only band whose entire catalogue I know by heart”, although you didn’t need him to tell you that Coldplay were a band created in U2’s image. Like U2, who spent their early years being sneered at by the post-punk cognoscenti, Coldplay were never fashionable. As with U2, that quickly ceased to matter: huge, biggest-band-in the-world success being a fairly powerful riposte to tastemakers crowing that you’re a bit naff. And like U2, Coldplay only really make sense on a large scale. You don’t have to be a Coldplay fan to think they’re exceptionally good at headlining Glastonbury, just as even Bono’s loudest naysayer might be forced to concede that they’re uniquely skilled at playing stadiums. Grand gestures and vast audiences are a large part of both bands’ raison d’être. In recent years, that’s started to look like a problem. Coldplay’s last album, 2019’s Everyday Life, was their only one in the last 20 years not to go multi-platinum. In America it sold barely a tenth of its predecessor, A Head Full of Dreams. It dabbled in African music, doo-wop and gospel and included what appeared to be an unfinished demo – yet it was far from the kind of up-yours gesture to which artists who have tired of adulation are often prone. It still clearly wanted to be loved by a mass audience. There was a lot of straightforward Coldplay-ing among the experiments, including Orphans, a song so keen to attract thousands of people bellowing along that it borrowed the “woo-woo” vocals from Sympathy for the Devil. Fear that their place at the top might be slipping after 20 years has evidently rattled the band. In contrast to the understated release of Everyday Life, Music of the Spheres arrives with an all-guns-blazing promotional campaign. You literally couldn’t escape it even by leaving the planet: lead single Higher Power was beamed into the International Space Station. Everyday Life’s esoteric collaborators – Femi Kuti, Belgian rapper Stromae, whoever suggested they sample Alice Coltrane – have been politely shown the door. Swedish pop super-producer Max Martin is fully in charge, and this time the guest list includes singer and actor Selena Gomez, the fifth most-followed person on Instagram, and K-pop superstars BTS. Leaving aside the NME’s game suggestion that BTS and Coldplay represent an obvious match because “they are two of modern pop’s deepest thinkers”, the charitable interpretation of what’s going on here is that Coldplay realise rock music has been in a moribund artistic state for some time now and the real action is in pop. The less charitable interpretation is that these are collaborations that have been actioned with one eye on the Spotify stats. In fairness, Coldplay have pivoted towards pop before – on their Stargate-produced, EDM-infused 2015 album A Head Full of Dreams – but it has rarely sounded as deliberate or as non-organic as this. Higher Power audibly takes the Weeknd’s Blinding Lights as its inspiration but works on the principle that the biggest-selling single of 2020 was perhaps too understated. So the synths are cranked up until they blare – which turns out to be the album’s default setting. They blare at you throughout My Universe, which is the BTS feature, a song that proves Coldplay are perfectly adept at churning out boilerplate pop, as well as the more reliably Coldplay-esque Humankind, which is decorated with a motif that sounds like Van Halen’s Jump. Even the guitar-heavy People of the Pride blares: it’s based around an ungainly, glam-by-way-of-Muse riff, and is evidence – should you have needed it – that rocking out in the fingers-making-devil-horns sense is not Coldplay’s forte. The intensity is weirdly claustrophobic, so eager to please that it’s off-putting. It’s a relief when the ballads arrive, even when they’re as syrupy as the Selena Gomez duet Let Somebody Go, or the a capella Human Heart, a nice idea that underuses R&amp;B duo We Are King by submerging their voices in Auto-Tune. The best thing here, as far as songwriting goes, is Biutyful, which has a genuinely lovely melody: you wonder how it might have sounded had Coldplay not taken it upon themselves to turn it into a peculiar bit of ersatz K-pop. Perhaps realising that all this might look craven, the brazen lunges for the top of the charts are welded to a concept – something about an alternate universe. The album is interspersed with ambient electronic interludes with titles such as Alien Choir, while the closing Coloratura takes a relatively straightforward Coldplay stadium-rouser and expands it to 10 minutes using moody, beat-less synthesiser passages and dramatic string and harp-bedecked interludes. Rather than tie the album together, this stuff jars against Music of the Spheres’ evident commercial aims. The overall effect is odd, as if Pink Floyd had decided to extend their reach circa Wish You Were Here by getting the New Seekers and Little Jimmy Osmond involved. Who knows: it might work, at least commercially. But there must be more dignified ways to stay at the top. This week Alexis listened to Michael Kiwanuka: Beautiful Life From the soundtrack to a forthcoming documentary, the first release since Michael Kiwanuka’s Mercury prize-winning third album continues down a masterful, idiosyncratic psych-soul path."

Here’s what we learned today: Severe thunderstorms have swept Sydney and parts of NSW, causing lightning strikes and power outages. The Bureau of Meteorology initially warned tornadoes may hit western Sydney, but the alert was later downgraded. Andrew Forrest delivered a National Press Club address lashing out at “rare, fear-mongering” politicians who were resisting net zero targets by 2050. He said Scott Morrison should split from the Nationals if he faced continued opposition. Australia’s unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in September as a further 138,000 jobs were lost due to lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. Victoria reported a national record of 2,297 Covid-19 new cases overnight, and 11 deaths, but is still on track to reopen at 70% double dose targets. It downgraded the ACT from a ‘red’ zone to an ‘orange’ zone from midnight. NSW recorded 406 new cases and six further deaths. The ACT recorded 46 new local cases and one death as Territorians emerge from lockdown from midnight. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, has confirmed Pfizer will be allowed to make its case to the TGA for five-to 11-year-olds to be vaccinated with its Covid-19 vaccine. It came as the TGA approved rapid antigen tests for home use. Bruce Lehrmann’s criminal case for the alleged rape of former Morrison government staffer Brittany Higgins has been adjourned until 5 November. And the Labor member for Holt, Anthony Byrne, has resigned his position as deputy chair of the federal parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. Thunderstorms lashing NSW have seen hailstones larger than five centimetres fall and even a tornado warning issued, AAP reports. The storms were most intense over Sydney and the Lower Hunter, but hail was reported all the way between Sydney and Cowra in the state’s central west. Those stones mostly measured between three and five centimetres, but some were even larger. The conditions over western Sydney were particularly serious, with meteorologists seeing all the ingredients for a “very, very dangerous supercell”, said the Bureau of Meteorology’s Gabrielle Woodhouse. About 4.30pm, the bureau issued a warning for a possible tornado over western Sydney. It’s not yet known whether an apparent funnel cloud touched the ground or not. Woodhouse said the storm was really dangerous. Some 33mm of rain fell at Woodville golf course at Canterbury in about a quarter of an hour. By Saturday evening, the most dangerous storm had passed out to sea, but the bureau is still warning of threatening storms in the Sydney area and advises residents to monitor the radar on its website. Early-morning thunderstorms deposited up to 30mm of rain on parts of Canberra, with more likely on Thursday evening. More on the power outages following the NSW storms. And the Guardian’s Ben Doherty has found his pot of gold. In April, Guardian Australia first reported that Bunnings Warehouse was willing to host mass vaccination hubs at its stores. At the time, epidemiologists told Guardian Australia the idea could nudge people who did not consider vaccination as a matter of urgency into getting the jab – noting researchers had separately found that Bunnings is considered Australia’s most trusted brand. They also said the spread of stores across suburbs, and carpark facilities, meant the hubs would complement state health offerings. Bunnings’ offer has now been taken up by the Queensland government, as that state’s health authorities seek out ways to ramp up local vaccination rates that are trailing other jurisdictions. You can read our initial report from April here. Federal deputy Labor leader Richard Marles won’t be attending parliament next week. This evening, he released a statement confirming he had been at a Tier 1 exposure site last Thursday 7 October: As a result, I have followed the health advice, have been tested and am now isolating until further notice. Unfortunately this means I will not be able to attend parliament next week. We are so close to getting to the other side of this and it is still as important as ever we are listening to and continue to follow the health advice and play our part in keeping our community safe. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the contact tracers and health care workers at Barwon Health. Their work makes our community safer. Panel beaters are going to have a huge Friday, by any estimates. Nationals MP David Gillespie has spoken to ABC TV about the emissions reduction negotiations in the Coalition, arguing that the Nationals aren’t putting a “pricetag” on net zero but ensuring the policy “won’t disadvantage the whole nation”. He said: Some people have said they are just worried about regional Australia, I have some concerns about unintended consequences of this target which could destroy the livelihoods of many industries, including our energy system, reduce agriculture, mining. Gillespie then labelled net zero by 2050 a “catchphrase”. Host Patricia Karvelas noted, no, it describes what will hopefully become a physical reality that we are not adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Gillespie explained that he meant that there would need to be a “replacement source of energy” for fossil fuels, such as high efficiency coal power stations with carbon capture and storage. Oh, but those are still fossil fuels, and that isn’t net zero. The clue is in the catchphrase, I would’ve thought. Asked if the Coalition could split over the issue, Gillespie replied that “I don’t think that is being countenanced”. He said: We will sort it out. We have to see what is on offer first. If you remember, we went to an election last election, 2019. Yes, a lot of changes in a week in politics let alone three years. The analysis then was that it would cost several hundred thousand jobs and $350 billion in taxes. Good point - at least someone remembers when emissions reduction was job destroying and terrible (when Labor proposed it). Gillespie then spoke about the need for technology like carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen, but they were out of time so the segment ended. Check out this time lapse of the NSW storms from Guardian Australia’s Blake Sharp-Wiggins. Severe thunderstorm warnings have just been listed for parts of Queensland. Meanwhile, the tornado warning has been downgraded in NSW. What a whirlwind! A Senate committee chaired by Liberal Claire Chandler has rejected One Nation’s bill proposing introduction of voter identification laws. In December 2018, the government backed voter ID laws in a review of the 2016 election. One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts tried to take that proposal of the joint standing committee on electoral matters and turn it into a private senator’s bill. In a report released on Thursday the Senate finance and public administration committee recommended the bill not be passed. It said: While the committee acknowledges that the bill is seeking to strengthen the integrity of elections, and notes the Jscem’s support for voter identification laws in principle, there remain a number of administrative issues which are raised by the bill but not properly addressed by its provisions or explanatory material. So, no backdown from the Coalition on voter ID laws, just: this isn’t the way to do it. In additional comments both Labor and the Greens set out their opposition to voter ID laws on the basis they would disenfranchise vulnerable voters. Labor senators said: As the majority of submitters to this inquiry have pointed out, there is no culture of voter fraud in Australia and without further evidence, there is no justification for voter identification laws. The NSW rural fire service is reporting hundreds of lightning strikes as a result of the storms sweeping the state. Power outages have been reported in Bensville, Blackwall, Booker Bay and surrounding suburbs following the storms. #SydneyStorm is now trending on Twitter, though the chance of a tornado has been downgraded. For more details head to the Bureau of Meteorology’s website. It is not yet clear whether this is storm related. On Tuesday, Guardian Australia published a story on the increased likelihood of a wet and windy summer as a result of La Niña event. A serious amount of hail falling in Sydney right now. The Bureau of Meteorology is now reporting there are risks of “tornado activity” added to the current storm in western Sydney. There is currently a “detailed severe thunderstorm” warning of possible tornadoes, destructive winds, giant hailstones and heavy rainfall listed for parts of Blue Mountains/Hawkesbury, Greater Newcastle, Gosford/Wyong, Sydney and Greater Wollongong areas: Multiple #thunderstorms are currently, or about to, impact major population centres, including #Sydney. A Very Dangerous storm currently tracking towards Fairfield. People should immediately check their local radars. The Royal Commission into the casino operator licence will hand its final report to the governor of Victoria tomorrow after months of public hearings examining whether Crown Melbourne is suitable to hold a casino licence. The Victorian government says the final report and the government’s response will be released prior to the end of this month, an approach “similar to that taken by the NSW Independent Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority to the final report of the Bergin inquiry earlier this year”. Minister for consumer affairs, gaming and liquor regulation Melissa Horne: An incredible amount of work has gone into the Royal Commission into the casino operator licence and we thank Raymond Finkelstein for his report. We’ll consider the findings and recommendations from the Royal Commission in detail and take whatever action is necessary to strengthen casino oversight in Victoria and ensure this never happens again. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has released a statement on Anthony Byrne resigning from the PJCIS, noting his service on the committee since 2005. He said: I thank Mr Byrne for his important contributions to this committee in Australia’s national interest. On Tuesday Byrne, the federal MP for the south-east Melbourne seat of Holt, gave evidence to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, revealing he authorised taxpayer-funded office staff to complete political work, and used a “kitty” to pay for memberships in breach of party rules. Byrne also admitted to employing two “Turkish” men as electorate office staff as part of a deal with factional powerbroker – and then-ally – Adem Somyurek, despite one of the men never showing up for work while drawing a taxpayer-funded salary. Despite that evidence, Albanese had said earlier in the week it was “not appropriate” to pre-empt Ibac findings, effectively backing Byrne to stay.Albanese also revealed he will recommend that Jenny McAllister now become the committee’s deputy chair and that Peter Khalil join the PJCIS, suggesting both would make “outstanding contributions” to its work. Member for Holt Anthony Byrne, under pressure for alleged branch stacking being investigated by Ibac has just resigned his position as deputy chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. His full statement: I have today offered my resignation as deputy chair and committee member of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security (PJCIS) to Anthony Albanese, the leader of the Australian Labor Party. Mr Albanese has accepted my resignation from the committee. I will be resigning from the PJCIS today. The work of the PJCIS is crucial to Australia’s national security and its integrity should never be questioned. I have always put the work of this bipartisan committee first and have always served in its best interests. I would like to thank my colleagues on the committee for the work we have done to protect Australia’s national security. I will continue to fully cooperate with the Ibac inquiry and will not be making further comment while proceedings are underway. Sydneysiders won’t be able to travel to regional NSW when 80% double dose targets are met, Nine News is reporting. The Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) has approved three Covid-19 rapid antigen self tests for home use in Australia from 1 November. It includes two oral fluid tests and one nasal swab test. Results of the rapid tests are expected within 15 minutes. Rapid antigen testing is expected to become a key additional layer in community protection from Covid-19 once states open up. The tests are already being used in some quarantine facilities and aged care homes. Mining company Kepco has sought special leave in the high court to appeal a decision by the NSW independent planning commission (IPC) to reject its proposed coalmine in the Bylong valley. The special leave application was lodged this week and comes after the company lost earlier appeals in the NSW land and environment court and the court of appeal. The NSW IPC rejected the mine in 2019 citing the unacceptable impact the mine would have on farming land and the environment – including through greenhouse gas emissions – as well as the costs to future generations. The Bylong Valley Protection Alliancee, which joined the previous to defend the IPC’s ruling, says it “will once again join the legal fight to stop the mine, more than two years after it was first rejected”. Environmental Defenders Office managing lawyer Rana Koroglu is representing the alliance: We’re disappointed that Kepco has chosen to force the Bylong community back to court to defend their beautiful valley once again. This marks Kepco’s fourth attempt at getting approval for their coal mine, after failing before the NSW independent planning commission, the land and environment court and the court of appeal. Koroglu said it was astounding South Korean mining company Kepco was still pursuing the proposal on the eve of the Glasgow climate summit and when South Korea had recently made strong commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emission. EDO will once again stand with our clients the Bylong Valley Protection Alliance to defend the refusal of this climate-wrecking coal mine. Phillip Kennedy, the president of the Bylong Valley Protection Alliance said: It’s bloody devastating that a multinational coal company can continue putting a small farming community like ours through the wringer after its mine has been rejected three times. We can’t believe Kepco is still trying to build this polluting coalmine after the IPC clearly explained it posed too great a threat to the soils and water we rely on. Comment was sought from Kepco. The NSW IPC declined to comment while legal proceedings continue. If you missed this story this morning, it makes for alarming reading. Australia has 200 fewer intensive care beds than at the start of the pandemic. In regional areas, where vaccination rates are lagging, the number of available intensive care beds has dropped by 18% over the same period to just 262. We’ve been reporting in recent weeks on a push by the federal government to exempt the Future Fund from freedom of information laws. The government is proposing to shield the Future Fund from any FOI that asks for material relating to its investment activities. Given the Future Fund’s core purpose is investing as Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, that’s quite a broad exemption. The stated purpose of the changes is to give external investment managers, who the Future Fund works with regularly, confidence that sensitive commercial information won’t be made public. Critics say the changes were triggered by an FOI that revealed the Future Fund was investing in an Adani company linked to the Myanmar military. A parliamentary inquiry has just finished considering the bill and has recommended that it be passed, saying it was “persuaded that the Future Fund would remain subject to a sufficient level of scrutiny and oversight through a number of other robust transparency and accountability arrangements”. In a separate report, Labor said the FOI exemptions were too broad, hypocritical, and at odds with disclosure requirements on other institutional investors, like superannuation funds. Greens senator Nick McKim said the rationale for the FOI exemption was “bunkum” and accused the government of engaging in a cover up of the Future Fund’s controversial investments. It’s one of the hallmarks of this government: whenever they’re caught out, whenever they come under public scrutiny, their first reaction is to cover up. Centre for Independent Studies executive director Tom Switzer has become a member of the Liberal Democrats. The party has espoused controversial views on Covid-19 restrictions, calling for the removal of QR codes and mask wearing by Christmas, as well as the end of lockdowns. They are currently seeking to launch a high court challenge against new laws which could force the party to change its name less than 12 months out from the next federal election. In NSW, opposition leader Chris Minns has questioned premier Dominic Perrottet on the resignation of MP Melanie Gibbons yesterday. Minns: Premier, more than 6,000 people in Holsworthy lost their job during the Delta outbreak. Is mid-term and mid-pandemic the right time for the member for Holsworthy to cause a by-election? Perrottet: Obviously it’s disappointing that the member for Holsworthy is seeking to seek pre selection...but our loss maybe is their gain...she’s been a fighter for Southwest Sydney and I’m sure she’s successful. That’s why it’s hard when you lead a team...there’s always going to be demand for our talents...but it’s a good sign. It’s a good sign that federal politics knows that our members here and the Liberals and Nationals in New South Wales are such strong fighters for their communities that they want to pick that talent up and take it to Canberra. Australia and more than 100 other countries have pledged to work toward a post 2020 global deal for nature that aims to reverse losses of biodiversity. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, signed the Kunming Declaration overnight, which is something of a statement of intent by countries as they work towards a major new agreement for nature. The talks are happening as part of a United Nations conference - known as Cop15 or “the other Cop” - as part of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It doesn’t get nearly the same level of attention as global climate talks but these are the most significant nature talks in a decade. Countries are negotiating a new framework to try to halt the decline of ecosystems worldwide and put nature on the path to recovery by 2030. After this week’s virtual meeting, there will be further meetings in the new year before countries meet in Kunming in China in April 2022 to hopefully reach a new agreement. The Kunming Declaration signed overnight is basically a signal that countries hope to reach a significant deal. It calls for “urgent and significant action” across all sectors of the economy and society to preserve nature and use it sustainably. It pledges countries to increase the area of protected land and sea and ensure that nature is factored into policy and economic decision making. Countries have not yet signed on to any targets but it is hoped the final deal will see countries agree to protecting 30% of land and of sea areas globally. Australia supports the global target but has not said if it will make such a commitment domestically. Ley: As one of only seventeen ‘megadiverse’ countries in the world, and the only megadiverse developed country that is a party to the CBD, Australia understands the value of biodiversity with our unique native plants, animals and landscapes central to our national identity. Australia is well placed to make a substantial contribution to a global target and will work with other nations to see it adopted as part of a Global Biodiversity Framework in 2022. The greens environment spokeswoman Sarah-Hanson Young has called on the government to commit to a domestic target. Australia’s environment minister needs to commit to protecting 30% of land and 30% of sea by 2030 - in this country. The minister is spinning the government’s commitment to a global target trying to cover up her failure to make a specific commitment for Australia. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a warning severe thunderstorms were detected on the weather radar near the area west of Picton, the Lithgow district and the southern reaches of Lake Burragorang this afternoon: These thunderstorms are moving towards the southeast. They are forecast to affect Blackheath, Bargo and the Nattai Tablelands by 2:45 pm and Wollongong, Katoomba and Penrith by 3:15 pm. Damaging winds and large hailstones are likely. The Northern Territory government has provided some more detail on the co-investment of $5 million in Equatorial Launch Australia, which is constructing an Arnhem Space Centre near Nhulunbuy. Equatorial Launch Australia are working with 27 personnel from NASA to prepare the site for the historic launch of three sounding rockets mid next year. It’ll be the first time NASA lifts-off outside of a USA commercial launch facility. The sounding rockets will carry scientific instruments into space to conduct research and provide scientists with the opportunity to observe objects that can’t be seen from rocket ranges in the Northern Hemisphere. Though a part of me wishes they would launch me into space at this point in the pandemic. NASA sounding rockets program office operations manager Scott Bissett: As of today we officially have our Medium Mobile Launcher (MML) installed on the Equatorial Launch Australia launch pad! In mid-2022 NASA will return to Nhulunbuy for the launching of three suborbital sounding rockets. During this site setup trip, the NASA team has been preparing the rocket launcher, tracking systems and other support systems that will be needed when we return next year. The BOM is expecting severe thunderstorms across eastern NSW as the day progresses, with a dynamic cold front tracking east across the state: Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds and large hailstones over the next several hours. Locations which may be affected include Port Macquarie, Taree, Newcastle, Gosford, Sydney, Wollongong, Nowra, Armidale, Orange, Goulburn and Tamworth. Frydenberg says he’d like to see Victoria, which just reported more than 2,000 cases in a single day, following the New South Wales roadmap - which goes significantly further than Victoria - when it emerges from restrictions. It was very pleasing to see those restrictions being eased in NSW. I would hope Victoria follow suit. Because Victoria and its restrictions being eased at 70% and 80% don’t replicate NSW. NSW has gone further than Victoria. I would like Victoria to follow NSW. I would like Victoria and the Victorian government to provide their citizens with the same freedoms that the people in NSW have received. Frydenberg is asked about the emergency disaster payments, which are due to end when state’s reach 80% double dose targets. He says emergency payments, like lockdowns, can’t last forever: What we have said is that at 70% double dose vaccination, people will need to reapply on a weekly basis for the Covid disaster payment. And we’re already seeing a boost to activity across New South Wales as they have reached the target and are starting to open in a CovidSafe way. We have also said, once you get to 80% double dose vaccination rates, but there will be a tapering down and we have already made announcements in that particular regard. But the cheapest form of stimulus for the economy is vaccination. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is up in Melbourne now commenting on the latest unemployment figures: The unemployment rate is at 4.6%, slightly better than what the market was expecting. Although the headline unemployment rate doesn’t tell the full story of the impact on the labour market of the lockdowns in our two largest states of New South Wales and Victoria. The participation rate was down and there are still many Australians who are doing it tough and who indeed have been stood down on zero hours. 90% of the jobs that were lost in the month of September were in Victoria...this is a telling reminder of why we must stick to our plan agreed at National Cabinet, to reopen our economy safely. A specialist robotic camera will be used to search for the body of an eight year old boy who is believed to have drowned while kayaking in Western Australia’s south, AAP’s Michael Ramsey reports. The boy had been camping with family at Fernhook Falls near Walpole, about 400km southeast of Perth. He was reported missing from the campsite on Sunday morning, with police later saying he had been involved in a boating incident on the river. A land search that spanned several days and involved more than 60 State Emergency Service volunteers has been suspended, and police are now focusing on recovering his body from the river. Superintendent Kim Travers said the boy had ventured off alone near the top of the falls on Sunday morning. He had earlier told his older brother he wanted to paddle through foam on the surface of the water but was told it was too dangerous: The brother has heard him call out for help and immediately rushed down the little track ... but he couldn’t see his brother. What he did see was the little blue plastic kayak lodged in the tree that his brother had [carried] across. A short time later, his father located the boy’s jumper jammed underneath a rock. The family had been staying in a cabin at the Mount Frankland national park and had been kayaking over the weekend without any issues. A Swiss National daily news journalist asks Forrest about Australia’s image overseas. She says it is poor, in Europe particularly. I probably needed you to point out that Australia is really unpopular overseas because people need to understand that that is the truth, you know? We are all cosy here in Australia – the sun is shining the wind is blowing but we are not taking advantage of those huge, permanent, everlasting natural resources to help both global warming and and our own economy to rise. But don’t judge us for yesterday. Judge us for tomorrow. If we go hard and commit to global warming neutrality by 2050, Cop26, I do not think you will see a country who will perform as quickly, who will turn the J curve faster than Australia, and I really do – I am immensely proud of my fellow Australians and my country once we finally decide, ‘oh, my god. Crack on’, you will see a nation which is the most responsible, the most powerful and the most committed to ending global warming through economic hard rationalism. The Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein is providing a Covid-19 update following the escape of a quarantined traveller who later tested positive to the virus. Gutwein says the man has not been particularly forthcoming with authorities. Forrest is asked about Australia’s trade and diplomatic relationship with China, particularly in the wake of the new Aukus pact: I think both countries need to realise they need each other. They have been good mates for a long time. What I have always found with China is that you sort things out behind closed doors. You go and see them, they come and see you. You can slam your fist on the board room table but you don’t do it while the camera is filming, and I think – the Chinese do the same thing. They get really historic – I would say take it behind closed doors, with all sorted out as adults and let’s remove the seemingly unproductive issues between us, and I think that is going to happen. I think there is a will in Australia and China. We just have to determine that will and I do think that in the end we will sort this out because the alternative is unthinkable. A reminder CovidBaseAU is run by teens who got vaccinated at their first opportunity. Forrest is asked what medium term 2030 targets need to be set by the federal government to give industry “confidence and clarity”. Forrest can’t really hear him, though: Look, you were breaking up a little bit, mate – we should have a beer over this, like I did with Barnaby, so we can really look each other in the eye so I get it. But all I can see is I do think that we’ve gotta crack on here, we’ve gotta make the decisions. We need to. We’ve gotta bring in the regulations and policies that we must do to ensure that we go carbon-free by 2050. 2030 is that all-critical milestone. Are you all talk or are you action? That’s what 2030 means. Forrest is asked whether it’s appropriate for Australia to continue to sell thermal while there’s an international market for it. He says it doesn’t matter much what the government thinks, or what he thinks, but what customers think, particularly big financiers: They want to see us move to renewable electricity, renewable hydrogen, they want solutions for coal, they want us to provide them with green hydrogen so they have the choice ... but also why I think we don’t matter that much, as governments, entrepreneurs, is because the big financiers are also saying, ‘Hey, we’re pulling out.’ We’re getting out because Australia’s not gonna be a great investment, because they’re not doing something about getting real with their own carbon emissions. For the responsibility of every kid in Australia who’s gonna inherit a global warming world, if we do nothing, then I think we need to take into account carbon emissions in everything we do. If you think, ‘oh, no, we shouldn’t do that. You know, oh, that’s terrible. That’s uneconomic’, mate, pick up the phone or walk into your kids’ room and say, ‘What do you think, darling?’ And they’ll say, ‘This is what I think! Fix it, Mum. Fix it, Dad. Take it into account.’ Katharine Murphy: If, in fact, the Nationals refuse to adopt a net zero target over the coming days – and that is a possibility – what would your advice to Scott Morrison be? Should he proceed with that agreement, even if it means splitting the Coalition? Andrew Forrest: Look, my advice to our prime minister is to proceed. I do believe that, if there’s holdouts in the National party, that the truth of my investment, other people’s investment, and what the world is doing and how the world is moving, will become increasingly clear. And there’s nothing like a politician to react to what their voters think. They might not be leading them now, they might be just politicking now, but people and Aussies will see through it. And when the cop-out politicians, when they see that their votes are declining, hmm, you’ll see them change pretty quick too. Independent member for Indi Helen Haines has weighed in on debates on the transition to net zero. The electorate has been held by an independent since Cathy McGowan beat Liberal incumbent Sophie Mirabella in 2013. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) has recommended the government consider listing Hamas in its entirety as a terrorist organisation. The PJCIS today tabled a report reviewing the relisting of five terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code: al-Shabaab, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas’ Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). While the committee supported the relisting of all these organisations under the Criminal Code it has gone a step further, recommending the government expand the listing of Hamas’ Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades to include the whole organisation of Hamas. The committee made a similar recommendation in June 2021 in its report on the review of the relisting of Hizballah’s External Security Organisation as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code that the listing of Hezbollah’s External Security Organisation be expanded to the whole organisation of Hezbollah. Committee chair senator James Paterson said it was clear from evidence received during the review that the whole organisation of Hamas met the definition of a terrorist organisation: Currently, the US, Canada and the EU list the whole organisation of Hamas as a terrorist organisation under their respective proscription regimes. The expert evidence provided to the committee overwhelmingly rejected the idea that Hamas’ Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades operates independently from the rest of the organisation. There was agreement that Hamas operates as a singular entity with overlapping personnel, finances and structure. In addition, leaders of Hamas have repeatedly made statements which meet the advocacy test for terrorist listing, including direct incitement of acts of violence against Jewish people. End Covid For All’s Tim Costello has addressed Australia’s decision to end local manufacturing of AstraZeneca once the current contract is met. Forrest says the fact the federal government still hasn’t set an official net zero by 2050 target is an “enormous concern”: I’m delighted that all states and territories in Australia have a net zero target, every one of us, every state and every territory, by 2050. But Australia as a nation still does not. And that, for me, is an enormous concern. Today, if I have one message, it’s that a national target of carbon neutrality is regional Australia’s jobs and economic opportunity, but only if Australians trust the good politicians not holding them back and move. Back in the ACT, Andrew Barr addresses the vaccination mandates that were introduced yesterday for the education sector. He says mandates have always been used as the “absolute last measure”. Forrest turns to “increasingly rare, fear-mongering politicians” who have been pushing back against net zero by 2050 targets: I see affordability increasing. I see affordability to light up your homes and highways, power our factories and farms, our schools, tech schools and universities, all over Australia. And I see it all being done while growing our economy, and while leaving your environment green and kind for your kids and grandkids. This is hard-edged economic choice, but it’s also social and environmental rationalism. To the increasingly rare, thankfully, historical politicians fear-mongering against choice, pretending to represent us, I just want to remind you – it’s taken 50 years for fossil fuel to get the power bills down, and, mate, they’re still going up. In five years, not 50, you’ve seen the cost of green hydrogen halve ... there are none so blind, as those who will not see. Forrest: Let’s clear that up – green hydrogen. We hear a lot about so-called “clean hydrogen”. It’s a sound bite covering the fact it’s made from carbon-emitting fossil fuel. It has carbon all through its supply chain. Sure, it’s clean once it’s hydrogen, but to get it there, it’s dirty. Very dirty, with heaps of carbon dioxide emitted in the process. But there is that other dirty little secret – the gas, which is invisible to the naked eye, but at least 80 times more dangerous as a global warming agent than even carbon dioxide. Methane. The basis of natural gas, which is not adequately, nor independently, measured as fugitive emissions in fossil fuel. This sector is better off simply burning the coal, burning the oil, burning the gas, than they are in hiding the emissions through turning it into blue-grey hydrogen, and having an otherwise astute energy minister, Angus Taylor, misled into selling it as “clean”. Think “clean coal”. Think “clean hydrogen”. Think “cancer-free tobacco”. It all adds up to the same thing – misleading sound bites put out by industries wishing to continue a duplicitous social licence to operate. And Australia has thousands of times, thousands of times more renewable energy than fossil fuel has reserves. So, let’s keep fossil fuel going but only as long as we need to, and let’s do everything we need to switch to a green future. Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest touts the raft of announcements made in Queensland and NSW this week: On Saturday, I announced the one billion build of the world’s largest green electrolyser facility here. It will double the supply, not in India, not in China, not in Europe, but in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia. The starter gun has been fired on the journey, bringing manufacturing at home roaring back, particularly to regional Australia. Up to this point, practically all our green energy – think wind turbines, think solar panels – have, like our diesel and like our oil, been imported. But I want countries, including most of all ours, to take control of their own economic and energy sovereignty. On top of that the great state of Queensland, where Fortescue Future Industries, or FFI, is making our first major manufacturing investment, New South Wales is also to receive the world’s first green hydrogen energy import and export terminal, as well as a dual fuel power station, which will transition from a blend of green hydrogen and LNG to 100% green hydrogen as soon as GH2 supply increases. Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest is about to virtually address the National Press Club. I’ll bring you the highlights – the title of his address is “Green Hydrogen, the Power of Now”, which is timely. Victoria today downgraded the ACT from a red zone to an orange zone. Many thanks to Matilda Boseley – hopefully my embrace will be suitably warm. I’ll be with you for the rest of the day. With that, I shall pass you over to the warm embrace of Caitlin Cassidy, who will guide you through the afternoon. Stay safe everyone! Robert: The numbers tell us that the epidemic continues to impact the workforce extensively and this impact will continue while lockdowns are enforced. The numbers tell us the impact is very strong where lockdowns are imposed and, of course, the impact is substantially lessened when lockdowns are ended... This isn’t unexpected, it’s a tale of lockdowns. When lockdowns are in place, we see substantial job losses. Just on those job numbers, federal employment minister Stuart Robert has sledged Queensland’s border restrictions urging the premier to provide certainty to businesses. It is fundamental that all states and territories provide that certainty to their citizens. But now New South Wales, the citizens of those states know exactly what occurred at 70% and they will know exactly what happens at 80%. As in Victoria. In Queensland, where we are standing, we are surviving press conference by press conference. I have no idea what is going to happen. No idea whether citizens of New South Wales can pop in. No idea whether we can plan for Christmas. Whether we can see relatives. No idea at all. There is absolutely no certainty. How do the businesses of the Gold Coast, how do they plan? How do they recruit? How do they employ staff right now? How do they train staff? How do they take bookings? None of these questions can be answered unless there is a degree of certainty. A simple question for the premier. At 70%, what happens? At 80%, what happens? The two other states can answer those questions. Why can’t Queensland? Australia’s unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in September as a further 138,000 jobs were lost due to lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. The jobless rate had unexpectedly eased to a near 13-year low of 4.5% in August as a result of people giving up searching for work, reports AAP’s Colin Brinsden. The participation rate of those in work or seeking employment fell further in September to 64.5%, from 65.2%. The number of hours worked rose by 15m or 0.9%. Australian Bureau of Statistics head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said: Extended lockdowns in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory have seen employment and hours worked both drop back below their pre-pandemic levels. In September, there were 111,000 fewer employed people and two per cent fewer hours worked than in March 2020. The low national unemployment rate continues to reflect reduced participation during the recent lockdowns, rather than strong labour market conditions. Oops! Hmm, this is interesting. Just ducking back to the NSW premier’s press conference this morning, where Dominic Perrottet was asked about the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils plans to host an online forum that included two members of the Taliban. Have a read of what he says and then I’ll point out the issue. Perrottet: Well obviously I read that report this morning and I’m incredibly concerned by it. I immediately contacted our multicultural minister Geoff Lee and asked him to reach out to the Islamic Council in relation to that event and I think there’d be a lot of people today who have served in Afghanistan – or have had loved ones who were lost, fighting in Afghanistan – would be deeply shocked and saddened to see that report today. So I’ve reached out to the multicultural minister Geoff Lee and I’ll be raising it with him again later today. Thanks. Here is the problem. Geoff Lee isn’t the multicultural minister anymore, it’s Natalie Ward, one of only two Liberal women in the NSW cabinet. I mean the event got cancelled so clearly he called someone, but did Lee just humour him the whole phone call and pass the message along? Barr: Now, from tomorrow, more businesses will start to reopen. Some people will start to go back to their workplace and we can begin to return to the life in Canberra that we are used to, the life that makes this the most liveable city in Australia. But with this increased activity, and interaction between people, the risk of contracting the virus increases. And this is especially the case for the 90,000 eligible Canberrans who have only had one dose of the vaccine. And it is also important for the 70,000 children under 12 who are not yell to be vaccinated. So please be careful. Keep wearing your mask. Keep washing your hands. And please avoid unnecessary risks. As we step out of lockdown into the next path, the next step, in our recovery. From Tasmania: The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, is speaking now. Despite relatively high case numbers and the death of a man who was in palliative care and subsequently infected with Covid-19, Barr is determined to move ahead with reopening now that the territory’s vaccination rates are so high. Good morning. I have sad news to start this morning’s press conference. A man in his 80s, who was Covid-positive, passed away yesterday. He was a resident at the Calvary Hayden aged care facility. On behalf of the ACT government, we send our condolences and love to his family and friends at this very difficult time. In a little over 12 hours, the ACT lockdown will end. This does not mean the end of Covid risk, though. And that’s why the first step out of lockdown will be a gentle and measured step forward. Lockdown has not been easy. But it has kept our case numbers significantly lower than they would otherwise have been. Lockdown has allowed hundreds of thousands of Canberrans to get vaccinated and it has saved tens of thousands of Canberrans from getting very sick. Here is what the Victorian acting chief health officer, Prof Ben Cowie has to say about why the state’s cases have jumped so dramatically overnight. It will hit hard for many, many people in Melbourne and in Victoria. It does really show how easy it is for this virus to pass from person to person. There’s no single event that we can really pin this very substantial increase in numbers relative to the last couple of days to explain it but there are some trends which we’re exploring and we’ll have more information on and which start to build the picture. So 46%, nearly half of the cases, reported yesterday were aged under 30 years. 63% were aged under 40 years. Within these new cases, there were 1,245 newly impacted households, so we will see these cases continue to generate further cases amongst their contacts in the days to come. New Zealand has reported 71 new cases of Covid-19 in the community, all in Auckland. The deputy prime minister Grant Robertson said the government had expected to see cases in Auckland rise, but that they are growing more quickly than anticipated. He said health officials believe the outbreak can be contained under the current lockdown settings. Many of the cases are spreading at workplaces and through gatherings inside people’s homes, despite restrictions prohibiting gatherings indoors. Robertson said: My message today is clear, we need people to stick to alert level 3 rules. New Zealand’s level 3 is amongst the toughest set of restrictions applied by any country in the world ... level 3 has worked to contain outbreaks in Auckland before, but with Delta we know we are facing a more tricky and challenging opponent. I can’t urge people enough that now is not the time for complacency. There are now 1,790 cases in the Delta outbreak and 33 of those are in hospital, with five of those in ICU. Of Thursday’s cases, 28 are yet to be linked to an existing cluster. More than 80% of the population over 12 years old has had its first dose of the vaccine, and more than 58% is fully inoculated. The director general of public health Dr Caroline McElnay said Thursday’s cases were “sobering but not unexpected because of where we are in the outbreak”. Dr McElnay said: As we see numbers increase, it is even more important that people get tested if they feel unwell and get vaccinated ... vaccinations remain our best tools for fighting the virus. The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (Afic) has cancelled its planned online forum that was due to include two senior Taliban representatives. In a statement released this morning, Afic say they decided to cancel the event “in response to community concerns” with Afic president Dr Rateb Jneid saying the event was not intended to “legitimise any group”: This event was not convened to legitimise any group or to offend any group ... in view of developments, I have taken the executive decision to cancel the event. The event’s announcement sparked outrage in the Afghan and Muslim communities in Sydney, with the Afghanistan-Australian Advocacy Network (AAAN), along with prominent community leaders, condemning the panel earlier today. The AAAN’s Arif Hussein had called on the event to be cancelled, and for Afic to offer an apology to the Afghan-Australian community: There is no justification for giving a public platform to members of the Taliban at a time when they continue to repress the rights of women and minorities such as the Hazaras in Afghanistan. This event clearly demonstrates a clear lack of judgment and empathy on Afic’s part. The cancellation also comes after NSW premier Dominic Perrottet released a statement, saying the NSW government had asked Afic to cancel the event. The New South Wales community is currently opening its arms to refugees and Australian repatriates from Afghanistan. We join Muslim community leaders in NSW, and especially Afghan community leaders, in condemning events of this kind. Afic has yet to offer an apology for the event. Merlino has confirmed that, TGA approvals permitting, rapid antigen testing will be rolled out in school campuses across Victoria. In addition to the trial of rapid home testing for school communities that I announced a couple of weeks ago, we’re now also working with the department of health on an additional wider trial of the use of rapid antigen testing in school settings as part of the suite of Covid-safe measures for school and we’ll have more to say about that over the coming weeks as we approach 1 November, which is the indicative date for self-administered rapid testing, providing, of course, that individual tests are approved by the TGA. So that’s the announcement in regards to VCE students. All students other than those who are confirmed cases, all students will be able to sit every single one of their exams and I think that’s a terrific announcement that we’re making today. VCE students who are close contacts of positive Covid-19 cases will still be allowed to sit their exams on campus, Victorian education minister James Merlino has confirmed. Students who are primary close contacts will be able to sit their exams, I’ll start again. Students who are primary close contact can sit their exams in a dedicated room with a separate entrance either by themselves or safely distanced from other students who are also primary close contacts depending on the school’s capacity. There will be supervised by staff wearing face shields and healthcare worker level PPE. The rooms will be safely ventilated and cleaned between each use. Help us keep the community safe, each student who is a primary close contact needs to be tested every 48 hours through the first week and after their exposure on day 13. If the students are fully vaccinated, they are in isolation for seven days, and for students without a vaccination, they are in isolation for 14 days but have an exemption to go and sit their exam. That’s the critical announcement that we are making today. The regular testing that I’ve just mentioned is the key to ensuring that students and the broader community are kept safe and making sure we pick up any further spread nice and early. The process for students who test positive for coronavirus will not be changing, so they won’t be able to attend school or sit their VCE exam and they’ll receive a derived examination score for any exam that they miss and obviously there’s the consideration of educational disadvantage process to make sure that every single student, their marks and the impact of Covid is reflected in their final results. Ummm, I sat my VCE exams six years ago, back in precedented times, and I’m still traumatised. I can’t imagine doing that while in Covid-19 isolation! Merlino: Form 11.59pm tonight, the CHO has declared that the ACT will move from a red to orange designation. As I said earlier, these numbers are not what everyone wants and I know that people will be feeling anxious about them. But they are in line with the modelling and our goals are still our goals. The Victorian deputy premier James Merlino is giving the state’s Covid update now and has given details of the 11 people who died overnight. Sadly, 11 people have lost their lives with Covid-19. A man in his 50s from Moonee Valley. A man in his 60s from Mooreland. A man in his 70s and a man in his 60s both from Melton. And the man in his 70s and a man in his 60s and a man in his 50s all from Hume. A man in his 70s from Greater Shepparton. A woman in her 80s, a woman in her 70s both from Knox. And a man in his 80s from Brimbank. These people are not just a statistic. Every one of them lived a full life with family and friends who love them and we pass on our deepest sympathies to their families and friends. Australian Federation of Islamic Councils has cited community concerns as their reason for cancelling the panel in a statement released this morning. A spokesperson for Afic said that “discussion has taken place with officials in Australia during the fermentation of the idea, with a view to possibly having officials involved in posting out questions.” The Australian Federation of Islamic Councils will cancel their online forum event which included two members of the Taliban after the NSW government contacted them to ask for it to be called off, according to a release from the premier’s office. The NSW government has contacted the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (Afic) over its plans to host two members of the Taliban for an online forum intended for the Australian Muslim community. We asked Afic to cancel this event and they have agreed to do so. The New South Wales community is currently opening its arms to refugees and Australian repatriates from Afghanistan. We join Muslim community leaders in NSW, and especially Afghan community leaders, in condemning events of this kind. We are relieved for all members of our community that this event has been cancelled and look forward to a continued constructive relationship with Afic. Andrews has been asked if rapid antigen testing may ever be used to allow unvaccinated people into large events such as remembrance day ceremonies. Those who aren’t vaccinated because they can’t for medical reasons is a different category and the system recognises them as a green tick if you have an exemption that is lawful.... In terms of those who object to being first and second dose, those who don’t want to be vaccinated, and choose not to be, there will be limits on their freedoms for a considerable time. The exact nature of that will have to be said later but I can’t definitively tell you what January, March and April looks like next year. Anybody thinking that they’ll wait this out if they wait a few weeks they could go to the pub because the double vaccinated green tick to get it won’t be a thing. Yes, it will. Because it’s not about only getting open but staying safe in ensuring we have a health system that can look after not just Covid patients but everyone who needs the care that our hospitals provide. Andrews: I’m confident all my staff have appropriate behaviour. At all times yes. I have no reason to think otherwise. My expectations are clear. I’m not here to be running a commentary again on matters that may or may not be relevant. I don’t know who has been called. I don’t know other than the broader subject matter, these matters are live, active, there have been hearings all week and I won’t run parallel process normally get into debates with Mr Somyurek or anyone else about these issues. Ibac should be allowed to do its work and I’m confident they will. If they come forward with a whole range of recommendations and advice on things they like us to do, things we should do, we stand ready to do that. Okay, now questions are turning to the ongoing Ibac hearings into branch stacking into the Labor party. Andrews has whipped out the expected line about not commenting on matters in front of the commission, but he did go into a bit more detail when he was asked if there were “zero cultural problems with Labor”. In terms of cultural issues in the Labor party, my approach to the national executive is to ask them to take over the branch, and a clear acknowledgement that, yes, that’s the party, you are talking about the government. This government is focused on delivering its commitments and getting people vaccinated, getting the state open. In terms of the party, there has been substantial reform very significantly, audits, rule changes, illustrators are still there. I would say that letting Ibac do its work means at the end of the process, if they recommend we go further, if they recommend that there should be more rule changes and measures, we won’t hesitate to do that. Reporter: Is your determination to deliver on the roadmap regardless of case numbers, and regardless therefore of a huge increase in the impact of the health system, a recognition of the fact that there is no appetite for Victorians to remain lockdown any longer? Andrews: No, no. I would not put it that way. I would not put it that way. We have, fundamentally, a really important agreement with the Victorian community. You get vaccinated and we will open up, and I do what I say. So, that is why we are going to be opening up because people have got vaccinated in record numbers in record time and they should be proud of that and I am proud of them and deeply grateful to them. The Victorian premier says once the state opens up case numbers will become less and less relevant, but health teams will still be tracking and tracing as much as they can. We have never had a situation where there was rampant community transmission with every day and increasingly vaccinated communities. That is unique in any of our lifetimes. So, on that basis, case numbers do become less relevant, except for the number of people getting it who are unvaccinated will contribute and will be directly linked to the number of people who finish up in hospital. It may not be linear. It might not be 10% – it might be less than that, but we will always have a close eye on the unvaccinated and there will still be contact tracing and protocols. It will be different because you are talking about volume but we will be tracking and tracing as much as we can. Andrews has been asked if people in Victoria have “given up on the lockdown” with cases now soaring above 2,000 cases. The strategy is about protecting our health system from being thoroughly and comprehensively overwhelmed for Covid and non-Covid patients. So, it is one of those difficult ones where I am not here today, and I would not want anyone to interpret anything I say as, ‘We’re barracking for cases and we are happy if cases go up.’ Because we aren’t. But at the same time, 1,000 cases, 500 cases, 1,500 cases, 2,000 cases even with a lockdown on, just imagine what that number would be with a lockdown off. If you had only 40%, 50% vaccinated? What we know is that those that are in hospital, really unwell, nine out of 10 of those people, if not more, have not been vaccinated. That is every reason to go and do this. But the Victorian premier is not quite ready to say if the state will come out of lockdown early just yet: We are going to get to 70% next week double dose at the same time that we will be at 90% single dose; that is a stronger performance than so many around the world, and that is something that we should be very pleased about and it does give us some options. I am not here today to talk about those options and I am not here to talk about how we operationalise the 70% – how we flick the switch – that work is still ongoing and it will be a busy few days but as soon as we can give people clarity about next week, we will. Andrews: We are racing to 70% double dose. It looks like we will finish up getting to 90% are single-dose on or about the same time, and that is a fantastic achievement. That means more people are protected than we thought would be, and that that we can confidently deliver on the roadmap and confidently deliver the national plan. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking now on his way into parliament house. He says it’s likely that vaccination rates in the under 16 population will soon catch up with the adult cohort. I don’t have a 12, 13, 14, 15-year-old number for you but we are seeing really significant take-up amongst the group so I think the 80% to 16 plus and the 80% 12 plus will essentially be about the same time, maybe a day later, but that is fantastic, and particularly important giving the schools roadmap and kids going back for part of the week over the next few weeks time. The Australia Capital Territory has recorded 46 new local cases of Covid-19 today. 30 are linked to known clusters, but only 18 were in quarantine for their entire infectious period. The territory also recorded one death, according to a release from ACT Health: Sadly, ACT Health has been notified of a man in his 80s who has passed away with Covid-19. The man was receiving end of life care at the Calvary Haydon Aged Care Facility before being diagnosed with Covid-19. This brings the number of lives lost in this current outbreak to seven and the total number in the ACT to 10 since the start of the pandemic. Three Royal Australian Navy have escaped with only minor injuries after they were forced to ditch their helicopter in the Philippine Sea. This has lead the navy to temporarily pause the flying operations of the MH-60R Seahawk fleet while the cause of the crash is investigated. According to a statement from the Department of Defence, the crew of the MH-60R Seahawk helicopter were doing a routine flight over the sea last night when “the crew conducted an emergency landing in the water”. HMAS Brisbane, the boat that the helicopter was operating from, deployed sea boats and rescued the crew around 20 minutes later. The three members received first aid for minor injuries once they were safely returned to the ship. Here is what commander of the Australian fleet, rear admiral Mark Hammond, had to say: The successful rescue is credit to the devotion to duty and skill of the officers and sailors of HMAS Brisbane. Their immediate actions ensured the survival of the aircrew, validating the significant training undertaken in the event an emergency of this nature occurs ... With the aircrew safe, investigating the circumstances that led to the helicopter ditching is the priority at the moment. As a precaution, we have temporarily paused flying operations of the MH-60R Seahawk fleet. Two Victorian MPs will put forward an amendment on Thursday in a bid to allow them to attend state parliament without providing proof of vaccination. The Liberal Democrats Tim Quilty and David Limbrick want PCR and rapid antigen tests used instead of proof of vaccination when admitting members to parliament. They say the amendment will “safeguard” health and safety while averting the “undemocratic” move of preventing MPs who do not wish to provide their health information from voting on legislation. The pair say the amendment echoes schemes announced by the state government for level crossings and the Royal Melbourne hospital. The amendment is expected to be discussed in parliament later on Thursday. Australia’s coronavirus vaccine rollout boss insists the gap is closing between immunisation rates of Indigenous people and the broader population, reports AAP. Just 42.3% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have received both doses compared with 64.4% of the general population aged 16 and over. The gap between first doses is even greater. More than 83% of over-16s have received one shot among the broader population, while the figure is just 57.5% among Indigenous people. Vaccine rollout co-ordinator, John Frewen, told a Senate hearing on Thursday the rollout was now catching up. A positive of the last three days is the first-dose vaccination rates for Indigenous peoples have exceeded the national averages ... That’s the first time we’ve experienced that so we are starting to see a closing of the gap now. Frewen said the discrepancy was the government’s primary concern. Of particular worry were Indigenous vaccination rates in Western Australia, where the state has some of the lowest levels of overall coverage. We are very concerned about rates in WA and we are working closely with the vaccination program leaders in WA to not only understand the areas of highest priority but the specific requirements ... We have got efforts going on in a number of communities. Similar vaccine strategies rolled out to Indigenous communities in western NSW and northern Queensland are also set to be enacted in remote WA areas, such as door-to-door activities or pop-up hubs. Labor has blamed the Morrison government for a supply shortage which significantly hampered the Indigenous vaccine rollout. Frewen said that vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and complacency were also significant factors in lower immunisation rates. The committee was told there had been stories of some members of the Aboriginal population believing the vaccine would reduce someone’s Indigeneity. There is very pernicious and hard-to-counter misinformation. Australia’s four big banks appear to be split over their decision to mandate vaccines for staff. Sydney-based Westpac and Commonwealth Bank have both released statements this morning confirming they will require all employees to be fully vaccinated. Westpac CEO Peter King said: We recently asked our employees for their views on vaccination and received more than 10,000 responses. Pleasingly, 91 % said they are, or intend to be, vaccinated, with a further 4% undecided ... Since the NSW outbreak started in June, more than 3,800 of our employees have been required to isolate and more than 280 branches have closed and re-opened, both significantly disrupting operations. It is clear that the best way to keep our people safe and stay open for our customers is for people to be vaccinated. In a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, a spokesperson from the Commonwealth Bank confirmed it would be doing the same. In line with our ongoing efforts to protect our people and customers from the health risks associated with Covid-19, CBA will require all employees around Australia to be fully vaccinated ... This follows regular feedback from our employees and customers who want certainty, consistency and confidence as the economy re-opens and life in our communities returns to normal. However, Melbourne-based NAB and ANZ have stated previously that they are satisfied with vaccine uptake among their staff and do not feel the need to make them mandatory, at least for the time being. Bruce Lehrmann’s criminal case for the alleged rape of former Morrison government staffer Brittany Higgins has been adjourned until 5 November. Lehrmann remotely appeared before the ACT magistrates court on Thursday via telephone, but the matter was delayed before it is expected to be committed by consent to the ACT supreme court. Lehrmann intends to plead not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent and denies that any form of sexual activity took place. His appearance on Thursday was limited to brief greetings confirming his appearance, greeting the magistrate and confirming he could hear via audio link. Lehrmann’s lawyer, John Korn, sought an adjournment, revealing that the brief he had received from police contained “material in it that I shouldn’t have had”. Korn told the court he undertook not to read the material, and has not done so. Korn received a hard copy of the correct version of the brief on Tuesday, necessitating a delay of three weeks. Korn said he would need two weeks to get across the material and would schedule one conference with his client, who is currently in Queensland. The ACT director of public prosecutions, Shane Drumgold, said it remains “ready to commit” the matter but did not oppose adjournment. Justice Campbell adjourned the matter to 5 November. The summons, seen by Guardian Australia, alleges one breach of the Crimes Act by Lehrmann for “sexual intercourse with Brittany Higgins, without her consent, and [that he] was reckless as to whether she had consented”. The offence is punishable by up to 12 years in prison. Higgins alleges that Lehrmann raped her in the Parliament House office of the former defence industry minister Linda Reynolds in the early hours of 23 March 2019. In August Lehrmann’s lawyer John Korn said in a statement: My client absolutely and unequivocally denies that any form of sexual activity took place at all. He will defend the charge. Australian federal police began investigating the allegation Higgins had been raped by a colleague at Parliament House in 2019 after she made a formal complaint in February. A brief of evidence was passed to the director of public prosecutions in June. A quick update from Tasmania. The Northern Territory government remains in the dark about potential moves by the federal government to scrap a Chinese company’s lease over the Port of Darwin amid national security concerns. With the defence department edging closer to finishing a review ordered five months ago, Guardian Australia understands the federal government is considering options that go beyond the binary choice of keeping or scrapping the lease. A third option is to keep the 99-year lease in force but impose additional requirements on the operator, Landbridge Group. Under critical infrastructure laws that passed the parliament in 2018, the federal government has the power to require a port operator to take specific actions based on security risks. You can read the full report below: Just touching on that CSL news. There has been a bit of chatter around that the company, which is responsible for Australia’s domestic AstraZeneca production, may be suspending operations, but the company says this is not the case. A CSL spokesperson released the following statement: CSL is committed to the manufacture of approximately 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria. Already over 20 million doses have been produced to protect Australians and those in the Asia Pacific region, and it is expected that the remaining production will be completed early next year. As CSL Chair Brian McNamee AO said at the Annual General Meeting this week: “We are pleased to say that the Australian Government and AstraZeneca trusted us as their partners to help the country respond to the emerging crisis through the most effective solution available: vaccination.” CSL and Seqirus are proud of the role they have played in providing Australia with onshore vaccine manufacturing capability throughout the pandemic. Now, let’s talk about how we are going to helping our Pacific neighbours. Greg Hunt: In terms of AstraZeneca, I’ve spoken with the chair of CSL, Brian McNamee, today, and have been engaging with Liz Chapman, who’s the Australian CEO of AstraZeneca – both have confirmed that CSL and AstraZeneca are on track to complete the full 50m dose production run in Australia and the 3.8m supply from overseas. So, 53.8m AstraZeneca doses. So, our expectation and our plan is that that program will be completed in full. And all of those extra doses are being supplied to the region. So, Fiji has very much built its vaccination program with the support of Australian AstraZeneca. It’s made a huge difference there. There’s a very significant offer – Dfat is coordinating it right across the region. PNG, as you mentioned, our Pacific Forum friends and neighbours, Indonesia, Vietnam we have been able to support, and others. So, all of these items are coming together and we’ll continue to support them both directly with our AstraZeneca, which I’m really pleased to be able to say – the confirmation I’ve had today – on track, delivery in full. The health minister is asked what he plans to do if the TGA approves the use of Pfizer for five- to 11-year-olds but the vaccination advisory body Atagi says no: Look, no change in policy or position since the question earlier on in the week. And that is, we take a double green-light approach. Atagi is our advisory body on vaccines and the TGA is our safety regulator. And so we take a double green-light approach to that. That’s been the situation. They were cautious in assessing the 12- to 15-year-olds. They assessed the data carefully, they made their decision. We’re rolling that program out now with 690,000 first doses and 190,000 second doses. And so we’ll continue to follow that medical advice. Greg Hunt has been asked what the government is doing to increase vaccination rates in Indigenous communities, which have generally fallen behind the Australian average: Indigenous rates at the moment are 57.5% first dose, 42.3% second dose. And, as Pat Turner, who’s the CEO of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, said, it’s not a question of access, it’s very much a question of either hesitancy or confidence. And Pat was absolutely clear with health ministers in that statement. And so our task now is to work collectively, of federal government, state government, Indigenous leaders, Indigenous representatives and media, to help encourage and boost that take-up ... So it’s very much about three things, going forwards. One is the continued program of rolling out, around the country, and presenting and presenting and presenting. And so it’s not just one opportunity. We’re providing multiple opportunities. Two, we’re taking a different approach, and there’s a lot more work which was done, for example, in Wilcannia, of having to literally go house to house. And so within communities, there’s a lot more direct outreach, house to house. Even though there’s the access, even though there’s the availability. And the third is the confidence-building program around the country, and that’s very much a partnership with Indigenous communities, and we’re focusing on what is the message that best works in each community. Oh and Greg Hunt also has some non-Covid-19 health news for us (I know! I forget that other diseases existed as well!): There’s $30m that I’m delighted to announce is being released for grant application rounds, competitive grant application rounds, under the medical research future fund. Two programs – a $20m program under the emerging priorities program, which is focusing on childhood and teen musculoskeletal, about diagnosis and treatment. Many young kids, many teens, will have spinal conditions. It could be something such as juvenile arthritis, it can be painful and debilitating, which of and in itself is a real concern for parents. But prolonged chronic pain can, at any age, have an impact on mental health. And so this research is, I think, really timely and very important. The other part of it is $10m, under our health data program, to focus on emerging pathways for health data. Hunt has confirmed the Australian vaccination rate (the 16 and over population) now sits at 83.6% first dose and 65.4% double dosed. Greg Hunt: What does it mean? It means that we have the supply, we have the distribution mechanisms. At the moment, we’re seeing roughly over 300,000 vaccines a day on weekdays, and a similar number over the course of the weekend, that are being distributed. And we will just continue going on, as we’ve done with 12- to 15-year-olds, as we’ve done with the boosters for the severely immunocompromised. And so I think that’s a very important sign and it offers additional support and protection for parents and families. It’s coming at an earlier time than we had previously expected, so I’m very, very pleased about that. Federal health minister Greg Hunt has confirmed that Pfizer will be allowed to make its case to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to allow five- to 11-year-olds to be vaccinated with its Covid-19 vaccine: The Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, Australia’s medical regulator, has provided provisional determination, which allows for Pfizer to submit their application for the Pfizer vaccine for five- to 11-year-olds. That will be done on an expedited basis. And so there are then three stages from here. Pfizer will need to submit its data, which we are hoping will come in the coming weeks. They are working with the CEO of Australian Pfizer, Anne Harris, last week and this week to that effect. Then the TGA, which has already begun its process of assessment, will assess the final data. And if they provide a green light, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation will also do their consideration – and if they provide a green light, then we provide the vaccine. We’re very confident that all of these processes will proceed but, as ever, we follow the medical advice. Heads up, looks like opposition leader Anthony Albanese will be speaking at 10am AEDT. That’s just after we are slated to hear from the federal health minister Greg Hunt at 9.30am. But on the upside, the NSW seven-day rolling average is now in the 400s. Big thanks to Josh Nicholas for the speedy graph work: You can see just how dramatic that Victorian case number case jump is on the outbreak graph: The NSW numbers have also just come through. The state recorded 406 new local cases and, sadly, six people infected with Covid-19 have died. The Victorian numbers are in and they’re not good. The numbers have jumped by more than 700 cases from yesterday, with 2,297 new infections recorded overnight. The state also recorded 11 deaths. Heads up, we should be hearing from federal health minister Greg Hunt in about half an hour: The federal government is seeking to overturn a landmark high court decision that deemed Aboriginal Australians cannot be aliens and cannot be deported. The Love and Thoms ruling in February 2020 ranks as the high court’s most significant constitutional decision in years, with the narrow four-to-three judgment prompting Coalition conservatives to lobby for black-letter judges to be appointed. Just a year and a half later, the commonwealth has revealed it wants the precedent to be overturned after a New Zealand man tried to fight deportation using the Love and Thoms precedent. Part of Shayne Paul Montgomery’s federal court case seeks to prove that the category of “non-citizen, non-alien” should be extended to people customarily adopted as Aboriginal even if they have no Aboriginal biological descent. You can read the full report below: Emissions reduction targets of between 40% and 50% are absolutely necessary for Australia, according to mining magnate Andrew Forrest, reports AAP. The former Fortescue chief executive also said it would be a “high-profile” declaration of where Australia sits on climate change if Scott Morrison did not attend an upcoming Glasgow summit to address the issue. Yesterday Forrest outlined billion-dollar plans for green hydrogen production facilities across Australia, including in NSW, Queensland and Tasmania. Before a final decision on Australia’s net zero emissions policy by the government, Forrest has hit out at MPs who have criticised such proposals as being detrimental to the economy. He told ABC Radio National this morning: We need to stop the fear-mongering ... It might crack a few more votes at the next election, but after that it is seen as fear-mongering, when coal starts to subside. Much of the criticism of net zero plans have come from senior Nationals MPs, who have said attempts to reduce emissions would impact on regional areas and jobs. The Nationals will hold a party room meeting on Sunday to discuss the net zero plans. Nationals Senate leader and cabinet minister Bridget McKenzie said yesterday there would be “no deal unless it is right for the regions”. Forrest said he had spoken yesterday to deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce and McKenzie about the plans for green hydrogen facilities: I’m sure they are quite capable of hearing the facts ... Economies are going green and they are going to grow the fastest and have the most jobs. If Australia doesn’t do it, that capital will go to countries that will. Forrest will address the National Press Club at lunchtime. Just in case you were wondering why Queensland has issued a severe weather warning for today. Wilcannia locals are celebrating the news there have been no new Covid cases for two weeks but say they are now on the long path to recovery after the virus hit “like a cyclone” in August. Yesterday was the 15th consecutive day of no new cases, an “incredible” outcome according to Brendon Adams, who runs Wilcannia River radio and who worked on the frontline during the crisis. “It was like a cyclone, we were just overwhelmed by the impact,” Adams said. “There was a lot of depression, there was isolation but our community came together, and to see an outcome such as this is unbelievable.” As NSW lifts restrictions, one Aboriginal health expert warned that “we are still in the thick of it”, with new cases appearing in other Aboriginal communities every day. You can read the full report below: New Zealand’s defeat by the Delta strain of Covid-19 could see a relaxation of international border rules by Christmas, reports Ben McKay from AAP. And Jacinda Ardern’s government is preparing to allow New Zealanders with Covid-19 to stay at home or isolate at community facilities if they do not need hospital-level care. A predicted surge of coronavirus cases has prompted the changes. The hard border has been maintained as New Zealand pursued an elimination strategy against the virus, but the reluctant acceptance of ongoing community cases has turned the government’s mind to a border rethink. Ardern appears set to loosen the compulsory 14-day stay in a quarantine hotel – known locally as MIQ – on arrival. Covid-19 minister Chris Hipkins said: We are actively considering our MIQ settings in light of the fact that we are unlikely to get back to zero cases ... You can expect to see us talking more about that fairly soon. International travel has been on hold since July, when New Zealand suspended the trans-Tasman bubble due to growing cases in NSW and Victoria. State government commitments for 2030 have put Australia within reach of meeting global expectations on tackling the climate crisis, but it will fall short unless the Morrison government steps up, a new analysis has found. Guardian Australia understands Scott Morrison has told colleagues he wants to increase Australia’s existing 2030 emissions reduction target as part of his negotiations with the Nationals about climate policies to be unveiled before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. Emissions projections to be released shortly are expected to forecast Australia will beat the current target of a 26% to 28% cut by 2030 compared with 2005 levels, and the prime minister wants to reflect that in a new target to be outlined ahead of Glasgow. You can read the full report by Katharine Murphy and Adam Morton below: Fortescue Metals chairman Andrew Forrest has been speaking to ABC radio this morning about his investments in green hydrogen initiatives: It’s a market we’ll compete with, instead of importing everything from overseas. My dream, my passion is to get those jobs all making manufacturing green ... A company that produces no pollution goes green? Great, slow clap. We need the heavy emitters, people like me, we have to go green as soon as possible to stop global warming. When asked about National frontbencher Bridget McKenzie’s comments yesterday, when she suggested that committing to net zero emissions by 2050 could hurt regional communities, he said: We need to stop scaring Australians. We need to stop fear-mongering ... You might crack a few more votes but after this coming election you’ll be seen for what you are – just fear-mongering to try and save your political job, not the jobs of regional Australians. Dominic Perrottet: There is alfresco dining change that was brought in last year. They were temporary and now permanent. We know that they’ve been incredibly successful here in the CBD and down in The Rocks. We want to bring life and laughter into the city during summer. We’re also offering up to $500,000 grants to councils right across the state to improve their high streets, to improve amenities. We want to make sure that every single neighbourhood flourishes and has activity and action right through the summer months and beyond. So these grants will help them with that as well. And importantly, we’re providing $5,000 grants to 5,000 businesses on a first-in, first-served basis, who want to embrace alfresco dining. We want to move the inside to the outside. There’s no reason why that should be something that’s just limited to Europe. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has just been speaking in Sydney, announcing the second part of his government’s business supports in the lead-up to Christmas. And this time the customers have something to look forward to as well: We know that Dine and Discover vouchers have been incredibly successful, incredibly positive, used by close to 5 million people right across our state. So today, we are doubling down on Dine and Discover. We’re offering two additional $25 vouchers. We know that these vouchers have injected close to $500m into the New South Wales economy. They have been incredibly successful and popular, from Ballina to Balmain, from Byron to Broken Hill. People right across the state have gone out and used the voucher, and importantly, spent more. It’s driven economic activity in New South Wales. It’s got people back into work. We know that they’re popular. We said as we were going through the economic recovery period that we’d look at those programs that worked and we would expand them if we could. That’s exactly what we’ve done in relation to this. Australians hoping to fly overseas in the coming months are facing exorbitant costs due to high demand and a scarce supply of seats on services flying into the country, as experts warn high prices will last another year. The complicated logistical planning required for airlines to ramp up from skeleton operations has meant those seeking to take advantage of the reopened border will face financial hurdles, while aircraft are recalled from desert parking lots and furloughed staff and ground handling contracts are brought back online. A backlog of more than 45,000 Australians are still stranded overseas, adding another layer of complexity, demand and frustration to the picture. An analysis of flight costs provided to Guardian Australia by the booking site Kayak shows the average cost of a one-way economy ticket from Sydney to New Delhi – the most sought-after route on the site over the past month – is $1,051, while the return leg on average adds $2,668 to the ticket cost for travel between November and December. You can read the full report below: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Thursday. We are nearly done with the week – don’t worry, we can do it! Well, vaccinations rates are rising fast in Australia’s two most populous states and, as positive is as that is, it’s causing a little bit of a headache for the new NSW premier. Dominic Perrottet is looking down the barrel of reaching 80% of the 16 and over population being fully vaccinated less than a week after opening the state up after reaching 70%. The government has promised that the next stage of the post-lockdown reopening will start the Monday after the state reaches 80% full vaccination among its eligible population. But whoops! Many are predicting 80% to be reached on Sunday, potentially leaving only a week between the two phases. The government’s Covid-19 and economic recovery committee – formerly known as crisis cabinet – will on Thursday discuss postponing regional travel, given the lower vaccination coverage in rural communities. Perrottet alluded to this yesterday: There has been concerns raised about regional NSW when you look at those double dose vaccination rates ... [But] we don’t make decisions on a knee-jerk reaction. We make decisions in consultation with our health and economic teams. Down south in Victoria it looks as though reopening could be coming early as well, with the chief health officer suggesting he is open to lifting Melbourne’s lockdown before next weekend. The state is on track to reach its 70% double vaccination target before the indicative date of 26 October, and Brett Sutton confirmed that a decision on reopening could be announced as early as this weekend. While speaking to ABC radio yesterday, he also hinted that the home visitation ban could be lifted, which under the state’s original Covid-19 roadmap, was slated to change at 80%: We’ve always said, if we can do more, we will do more ... We’re acutely aware of home gatherings leading to spikes and that was definitely a feature of [the AFL] grand final. They were people that didn’t normally come together ... It’s different for families. If we can limit numbers, if we think the epidemiology looks OK, absolutely open to that as well. OK, with all that out of the way, why don’t we jump right into the day!"

          "headline": "MP Claudia Webbe could face jail after harassment conviction",
          "bodyText": "The MP Claudia Webbe is facing a potential jail sentence and demands to stand down from her seat after being found guilty of a campaign of harassment including threatening an acid attack. Webbe, the independent MP for Leicester East, who was elected as a Labour candidate in 2019 but had the party whip withdrawn, was accused of harassing Michelle Merritt, a friend of her partner, with threatening phone calls. The trial was told she had called Merritt a slag, threatened to “use acid” and said she would distribute naked pictures of Merritt to her family. Following the guilty verdict and a warning from the judge that she could face a prison sentence, Labour called for Webbe to quit her seat, which would trigger a byelection. Webbe protested her innocence and made clear that she planned to continue as an MP. “While I’m preparing for the appeal I want to assure the people of Leicester East that I will continue to stand up for them in parliament, fighting on their behalf,” she said. Webbe, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was elected as Labour MP for Leicester East with a majority of 6,019 but had the whip withdrawn last year after being charged. She denied harassment between 1 September 2018 and 26 April 2020 but after a two-day trial chief district judge Paul Goldspring found her guilty. “I find she was jealous of the relationship between Lester [Thomas, her partner] and Michelle. Whatever the nature of that relationship, she certainly thought it was something she was not happy with,” he said. “I found Ms Webbe’s evidence to be vague, inconsistent and at times to be illogical. It was shaped around the overwhelming evidence against her she could not innocently answer, but ultimately I found it to be untruthful.” He said her conduct towards Merritt was “oppressive and was designed to be so”. “In particular threatening to send intimate photographs to her family and to ‘use acid’ are in my view the best evidence of the intent.” He adjourned sentencing to 4 November and released Webbe, 56, on unconditional bail but warned she could face prison. A Labour spokesperson said: “The Labour party strongly condemns Claudia Webbe’s actions and she should now resign.” During the trial Paul Hynes QC, defending, read out a string of character references from figures including Corbyn, the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. Webbe is a former chair of Operation Trident, which was set up in response to shootings disproportionately affecting black people in London. She was a councillor in Islington between 2010 and 2018 and was a member of Labour’s national executive committee. She entered the House of Commons in December 2019, winning the seat formerly held by Keith Vaz, the former Labour minister who retired from parliament in the wake of a scandal involving cocaine and sex workers. Last month an official report found Vaz had engaged in “sustained and unpleasant bullying” towards a member of parliamentary staff. If Webbe receives a custodial sentence of less than a year and her appeal fails, a recall petition would be triggered in her constituency. To prompt a byelection, 10% of the electorate within the constituency would need to sign the petition. Vaz told the Guardian last month that he would not stand again as a Labour candidate in Leicester East but he is known to still carry some support among the constituency party’s executive and voters. Westminster magistrates court heard Webbe made a string of unwanted calls to Merritt. Merritt told the court that the calls, most of which were from withheld telephone numbers, made her “worried and unnerved”. “When you’re being called and there’s no one answering it unnerves you, especially as a woman who lives alone,” she said. After Merritt received a call on Mother’s Day in 2019, in which Webbe identified herself, she decided to contact police, telling them: “She works for the Labour party, she is in the public arena and she’s accusing me of, in her words, ‘slagging around with her boyfriend’, which I’m not. She’s threatened to throw acid over me, she knows where I live, she’s going to send pictures of me and him to my daughters.” Police officers spoke to Webbe and Merritt and requested that contact should cease, the court heard. But on 25 April last year Merritt received two calls, both eight seconds long and from the same number. Merritt told the court: “I just hung up very quickly. I didn’t want to speak to her. “[Having received those two calls] I had to somehow prove that she was calling me because until that date all the calls had been no caller ID and the first threat call wasn’t recorded ... so I called back the number that was on my phone.” In the recording, played to the court, Webbe answered the phone and shouted at Merritt: “Why are you still butting in and getting with Lester? Why, why? He’s not your friend, he’s with me and I don’t want you to be in touch with me, I don’t want you to be in touch with him.” Webbe screamed “get out of my relationship” 11 times, according to the recording. She also said: “I’ve seen all of your posts, I’ve seen all of your naked pictures, I’ve seen all of your relationship with Lester. Otherwise I will tell all of your family and I will show them all of your pictures.” Giving evidence last month, Webbe, from Islington, denied harassment, claiming she had made “courtesy calls” to warn Merritt not to breach coronavirus rules by meeting Thomas. Asked whether she had threatened Merritt, Webbe told the court: “I’ve spent my lifetime campaigning for the rights of women, challenging this kind of behaviour. This is not something that’s in my character and it’s not something I would ever do.” After the verdict, Webbe said she was “deeply shocked”. “I am innocent and will appeal this verdict. As I said in court and repeat now, I have never threatened violence nor have I ever harassed anyone,” she said. Her lawyer, Raj Chada, added: “We will be appealing this unjust verdict. The recording of the call Ms Webbe made has been taken out of context. We are sure that Ms Webbe will be vindicated at an appeal.”"

          "headline": "Spot on or unfair? Facebook employees split on whistleblower Frances Haugen’s critique",
          "bodyText": "When former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen testified before the Senate last Tuesday, she painted an unsightly picture of the social networking company. As a member of the company’s civic misinformation team for almost two years until her departure in May, Haugen shared insights the company had previously hidden – from Facebook’s willingness to propagate hateful content on its platforms to keep users engaged to research proving Instagram’s detrimental effects on teen girls’ mental health – and leaked thousands of pages of internal documents backing up her claims. “The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook. And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money,” Haugen said in an appearance on 60 Minutes. Lawmakers, in a rare display of bipartisanship, applauded Haugen for coming forward as a “whistleblower” who identified foul play. But inside the notoriously insular company, employees’ perceptions of Haugen appear to be divided. Facebook is known for ironclad NDAs and a history of retaliating against workers who speak out. Even when the company faced sharp condemnation in the past, including after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, public airing of internal criticism has been muted. Facebook employees have become more vocal internally in past years, however. Last summer, employees spoke out against Zuckerberg’s handling of Donald Trump’s Facebook posts. Zuckerberg defended his decision to allow Trump to continue using the platform citing free speech arguments, but many saw it as a public display of valuing Facebook’s engagement – Trump’s posts bringing eyeballs to the platform – over ethics. Responding to Haugen’s testimony, according to the New York Times, the company’s communications department issued a memo to employees reminding them to stay silent, no matter their views on Haugen and her revelations. “We are increasingly hearing about reporter requests to employees to discuss Frances Haugen and people’s sentiments about her,” Andrea Saul, a director of policy communications, reportedly said in the memo. “We have had employees specifically ask if they can defend the company by referencing experiences they had with her. PLEASE DO NOT ENGAGE in these conversations.” Few employees have been willing to break those NDA agreements to speak on the record. Those that have done so prominently have echoed some of the sentiments Zuckerberg voiced in a lengthy internal memo last week seen by the Guardian. “It’s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives. At the most basic level, I think most of us just don’t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted,” Zuckerberg wrote. Some of the employees who spoke publicly said Haugen failed to recognize the steps the company is already taking to make its products more ethical. In a series of tweets published on Friday, David Gillis, a product design director at Facebook, said that he has supported some of Facebook’s teams that work on integrity and safety issues, and Haugen’s testimony didn’t acknowledge the progress that’s been made. “Frances didn’t work on stuff like this and maybe was already starting to move on from FB at the time,” he wrote. “My point is our teams do have a track record of making core product changes that prioritize integrity impact over engagement, which I am proud of.” In the thread, he cited a series of updates that the teams have made to Facebook, such as a feature that reminds users to read articles before sharing them; if one attempts to share an article they haven’t opened, Facebook now displays a prompt encouraging one to read it for fear of “missing key facts” before distributing it to one’s network. Gillis added: “I think for past and present folks who’ve worked on integrity here, there *is* a felt sense that we face headwinds, asymmetries and structural barriers to advancing our work; that there’s a higher bar our teams often need to clear to have impact.” On Blind, a popular app where employees can anonymously discuss their employers, others have offered similar takes. “Fb has better moderation than any other social platform by a mile,” one employee posted in a thread about Haugen’s testimony. Another employee argued that all companies prioritize profits without the scrutiny Facebook has received of late. Some appeared to downplay the revelations and the source material Haugen collected to support it. One Facebook employee wrote that the documents leaked on teen mental health are hardly incriminating, and in her testimony, Haugen “just stated her personal opinion”, though Haugen had revealed the findings of three years of research studies, which demonstrate adverse effects on many teens. Still, the post has dozens of “likes”. But speaking anonymously to reporters, other employees have offered a harsher evaluation of the company. Haugen’s testimony was spot-on, one employee told the New York Times: Haugen was a “hero”. Another applauded her for “saying things that many people here have been saying for years”. On Wednesday, the company reportedly made private those discussion groups on its internal message board Workplace that are focused on platform safety and protecting elections in an effort to further prevent leaks."

          "headline": "Apple may cut iPhone 13 production by millions as US warns of Christmas shortages",
          "bodyText": "Apple may slash the number of iPhone 13s it will make this year by up to 10m because of a shortage of computer chips amid a worldwide supply chain crunch that led the White House to warn that “there will be things that people can’t get” at Christmas. Apple was expected to produce 90m units of the new iPhone models this year but has told its manufacturers that the number would be lower because chip suppliers including Broadcom and Texas Instruments were struggling to deliver components, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Shares in Apple fell 1.2% in after-hours trading on Tuesday, reflecting broader falls in the US stock market and in Asia especially because of fears that the lingering impact of Covid and supply chain problems will spark rampant inflation and hamper growth. In July, Apple forecast slowing revenue growth and said the chip shortage, which had started hitting its ability to sell Macs and iPads, would also crimp iPhone production. Texas Instruments also gave a soft revenue outlook that month, hinting of chip supply concerns for the rest of the year. Apple declined to comment on the latest Bloomberg report. Broadcom and Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It is the latest sign of the serious bottlenecks affecting the flow of global trade as the chaotic economic recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic causes a shortage of energy, components, finished goods, labour and transportation. Along with technology companies, car makers have been among the worst hit by the shortages – particularly of semiconductors – with an estimated 7.7m fewer vehicles being built this year. Many US factories have put production on hold this year due to a lack of parts. Energy shortages and soaring power prices have led to shutdowns in factories in Asia’s large manufacturing centres such as China and South Korea in recent weeks, compounding already critical delays throughout the global logistics system. White House officials, scrambling to relieve supply bottlenecks choking US ports, highways and railways, warn that Americans may face higher prices and some empty shelves this Christmas season. American consumers, who are not used to finding goods unavailable, may need to be flexible and patient, White House officials said on Tuesday. “There will be things that people can’t get,” a senior White House official told Reuters, when asked about holiday shopping. “At the same time, a lot of these goods are hopefully substitutable by other things ... I don’t think there’s any real reason to be panicked, but we all feel the frustration and there’s a certain need for patience to help get through a relatively short period of time.” Fears were also mounting in the UK about shortages in the run-up to Christmas after Felixstowe, the country’s biggest container port, was forced to turn away ships from Asia because of a backlog of containers caused by lack of truck drivers. AP Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, said the shortage of labour meant containers were not being picked up and returned quickly enough, leading to a large backlog. “The trouble is that now we don’t have the same speed of flow of boxes moving in and out,” said Lars Mikael Jensen, head of east-west network at Maersk. “With fewer truckers on average it takes longer to get boxes out of the terminal, so they are left standing there.” Concern about shortages – and higher prices of food especially – led UK prime minister Boris Johnson to appoint a new adviser – former Tesco supermarket chief executive David Lewis – in an attempt to resolve blockages in supply chains. The Biden administration has launched a major effort to tackle inflation-inducing supply problems. It formed a taskforce in June that meets weekly and named John Porcari, a veteran transportation official, as “bottleneck tsar” to push private-sector companies to ease logjams. President Joe Biden himself plans to meet top executives from retail giants Walmart and Home Depot and with unions and other stakeholders on Wednesday to discuss efforts to relieve transportation bottlenecks before delivering a speech on the topic. Supply chain woes are weighing on retail and transportation companies, which recently issued a series of downbeat earnings outlooks. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve last month predicted a 2021 inflation rate of 4.2%, well above its 2% target."

GW Plans by online retailer THG to win support from shareholders for its strategy backfired spectacularly on Tuesday after an investor day sparked a sell-off that wiped a third from its share price. The retailer, formerly known as The Hut Group, which is run by its founder Matt Moulding, held a capital markets day, where it shared its 2030 sustainability strategy with investors. But investors took fright at the update and concerns that Japanese investment giant SoftBank’s support for THG was cooling, drove down its share price almost 35% from Monday’s closing price of 437p, to close at 285p on Tuesday. That wiped £1.85bn from the company’s market value, taking it down to £3.48bn from £5.33bn at the start of the day. The Manchester-based e-commerce specialist owns a range of online beauty and nutrition brands including Lookfantastic and Myprotein, and is also planning to expand its role as a technology provider, helping brands such as Unilever and Danone to sell directly to consumers. It has been less than 13 months since THG first floated on the London Stock Exchange in September 2020, with an offer price of 500p per share, which valued the business at £4.5bn.... Here’s the full story: British American Tobacco will cease all operations in military-ruled Myanmar and withdraw from the country by the end of this year, the company said on Tuesday. This makes BAT the latest Western firm to pull out of the country in turmoil since a February coup, as Reuters explains: Responding to a query from Reuters about the status of its operations in the Southeast Asian country, the company said the decision was taken having assessed the long-term viability of its Myanmar business. “Like any global company, we continuously evaluate our operations around the world,” the company said. “Having evaluated the long-term operational and commercial viability of our business in Myanmar, we have taken the decision to withdraw from the country and cease all operations.” Myanmar has been in chaos since the coup, ending a decade of tentative democracy and economic reform that followed the end of a half century of military rule in 2011 and years of crippling western sanctions. Many big companies in Myanmar initially expressed their commitment to the country in the weeks after the coup, but a months-long army crackdown on strikes and protests and the killing of more than 1,000 civilians has forced many firms to rethink. More here: REUTERS: British American Tobacco pulls out of army-ruled Myanmar Sky News are reporting that Ofgem, the energy regulator, is braced for a fresh wave of supplier collapses this week as the crisis engulfing the industry continues to accelerate. They say: Sky News understands that at least four suppliers were in talks with Ofgem on Tuesday about entering its Supplier of Last Resort (SOLR) system in a development expected to add several hundred thousand households to the toll of those impacted by soaring wholesale gas prices. Industry sources said the decision of at least some of those four companies to cease trading could be announced as early as Wednesday. More here: Energy watchdog Ofgem braced for fresh wave of supplier collapses Fears are growing about Christmas stock shortages after Felixstowe, the UK’s biggest container port, was forced to turn away ships from Asia because of a backlog of containers caused by the HGV driver shortage. The world’s largest container shipping company, the Danish firm AP Moller-Maersk said the Suffolk port – which handles about 40% of containers coming in and out of the UK – was among the most challenging ports in the world, after Los Angeles and Savannah in the US. It’s a timely example of the supply chain problems which the IMF warns is slowing the global recovery. “Felixstowe has come back up as one of our challenges,” said Lars Mikael Jensen, head of east-west network at Maersk. “There is a shortage of truckers in the UK. Normally after four to five days the containers are out of the terminal and into a warehouse in Birmingham or wherever before coming back empty. “The trouble is that now we don’t have the same speed of flow of boxes moving in and out. With fewer truckers on average it takes longer to get boxes out of the terminal, so they are left standing there.” Jensen said congestion has been building for the past fortnight and as a result, Maersk was diverting as many as one in three large vessels to dock at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where the goods are unloaded and brought to the UK on smaller ships. The Guardian understands there are as many as 50,000 empty containers at the port of Felixstowe, out of a total capacity of around 145,000. Here’s the full story: The UK steel industry has called for urgent state support to avoid a “full blown steel crisis”, warning that plans to issue loans to soften the impact of soaring gas prices “won’t address the problem”. As industry leaders voiced dismay at the perceived lack of support from government, trade unions wrote to the prime minister warning he was at risk of making a “historic mistake with devastating consequences” for an industry employing 32,000 people. Uncertainty about how to support power-hungry industries such as steel has already sparked a political row between the Treasury and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, over whether to offer financial support. While the Treasury is understood to be reluctant to fund a bailout, ministers are weighing up proposals from Kwarteng to provide short-term loans or guarantees while gas prices are high, to help sectors such as steel, glass, chemicals and paper. Representatives from the industry met officials from BEIS on Tuesday but left disappointed at a lack of detail on the proposals and concerned that the loan plan won’t help. “If it is only these loans that are on the table, then for the steel industry that won’t address the problem,” UK Steel’s director, Gareth Stace, told the Guardian. “We need to get back round that table to discuss and agree better solutions.” More here: Gas and oil production company Diversified Energy had a particularly rough day, with shares sliding almost 20% after a Bloomberg investigation into its assets. Diversified has built up a large portfolio of tens of thousands of old oil and gas wells across America, which it plans to run down and seal off gradually over the coming decades. Bloomberg visited 44 of these sites (often rusting, overgrown with vegetation, and home to spiders, mice and the occasional porcupine) and found that many were leaking methane -- a gas which contributes to global heating. On average, the article explains, Diversified’s CEO Rusty Hutson estimates his wells have an additional 50 years in them - so no rush to start saving money to cover plugging costs. However, that’s well beyond president Biden’s net zero goal of 2050. Here’s a flavour of Bloomberg’s piece: Outside of hunting season, few people visit the Tri-Valley Wildlife Area in the rolling hills of southeast Ohio. When a couple of Bloomberg Green reporters showed up on a muggy June morning, the only sounds were birdsongs and the whirring of our infrared camera. We set out on foot and soon spotted the first of several rusty natural gas wells scattered across a broad meadow. Their storage tanks, half-covered with vines and brush, looked like the forgotten monuments of some lost civilization. There are hundreds of thousands of such decrepit oil and gas wells across the U.S., and for a long time few people paid them much mind. That changed over the past decade as scientists discovered the surprisingly large role they play in the climate crisis. Old wells tend to leak, and raw natural gas consists mostly of methane, which has far more planet-warming power than carbon dioxide. That morning in Ohio we pointed our camera at busted pipes, rusted joints, and broken valves, and we saw the otherwise invisible greenhouse gas jetting out. A sour smell lingered in the air. To Rusty Hutson, it smells like money. Hutson is the founder and chief executive officer of one of the strangest companies ever to hit the American oil patch and the reason for our four-day visit to the Appalachian region. While other oilmen focus on drilling the next gusher, Hutson buys used wells that generate just a trickle or nothing at all. Over the past four years his Diversified Energy Co. has amassed about 69,000 wells, eclipsing Exxon Mobil Corp. to become the largest well owner in the country. Investors love him. Since listing shares in 2017, Hutson’s company has outperformed almost every other U.S. oil and gas stock, swelling his personal stake to more than $30 million... Diversified have defended their business, saying that otherwise mature wells could “fall into disrepair” and potentially emit more gases. “The company believes that aggregating producing wells and tailoring operating programs designed to improve their performance and emissions profile addresses a void in the industry whereby wells often pass from one operator to another creating a ‘churn’ effect, removing long-term accountability for asset integrity. “Without capable operators like Diversified, often less capable, less financially stable or less accountable, operators acquire assets from companies that are more focused on developing new wells. As a consequence, mature wells sometimes fall into disrepair and potentially emit in excess of levels that simple, routine maintenance would limit.” European stock markets have ended the day slightly lower, as worries over growth and inflation continue to weigh on equities. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 17 points lower at 7130 points, down 0.23%. Travel and hospitality had a bad day, with airline group IAG losing 3.4%, and catering firm Compass down 2.15%. Miners also dropped, along with engineering group Melrose (-1.9%). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums up the day: A negative lead from Asia saw markets in Europe open sharply lower earlier today, and although we’ve rebounded off the lows, it’s still difficult to determine an overall direction. Investors shrugged off a minor downgrade to global growth for this year from the IMF, however no one really pays much attention to what these organisations have to say in the wider scheme of things. The biggest laggards have been in basic resources, which helped underpin yesterday’s FTSE100 gains. The problem facing investors right now is the bi-polar nature of markets one day to the next. Since July we’ve seen moves to the upside, as well as the downside, but within a clearly definable range. While investors want to believe a narrative that can see equity markets move higher, any optimism is being tempered by the prospect that rising prices, as well as supply chain disruptions, may well negatively impact profit margins, as well as prompting a consumer slowdown. The main change since July has been a sell-off in bond markets, which has seen yields move quite a bit higher, reflecting much more elevated inflation expectations over the next six to 12 months, and it will be company guidance over the next few months that may well dictate where we head next. Airlines have been another drag today, with IAG and Ryanair in negative territory after easyJet announced a full year loss of just over £1.1bn. The numbers weren’t all bad, however today’s update also serves to illustrate the challenges facing the industry as we head into another fiscal year which is still likely to be pandemic affected. We’ve seen a decent rally off the lows this year, however the rebound has been somewhat constrained with the shares pretty much where they were at the start of this year. Today’s Q4 update showed that the airline reached 58% of 2019 capacity, flying 17.3m seats, which was slightly above what it expected in early September, and well above the 17% in Q3. Nonetheless it still fell slightly short of the 60% it had hoped for in its initial Q3 numbers. In a sign that it is more optimistic about its next financial year it raised its capacity guidance for Q1 from 60%, to 70% of 2019 levels. The recent rights issue has helped reduce its debt to £900m from £2bn giving the airline a solid platform from which to build its resilience for its next fiscal year. With rising fuel prices, a significant headwind easyJet has said it is 55% hedged for the year at $500 a metric tonne, with current spot prices currently 50% higher. The US private equity giant Blackstone has struck a deal with Merck Mercuriadis, which advises the London-listed music rights business Hipgnosis, to set up a $1bn (about £735m) venture to acquire music rights and manage catalogues. Over the past three years Mercuriadis has overseen an acquisition spree at Hipgnosis, buying the royalty rights to the music of stars from Neil Young and Barry Manilow to Beyoncé and Blondie and building up a portfolio of almost 61,000 songs worth $2.2bn. Blackstone has struck a deal with Mercuriadis’s separate advisory business, Hipgnosis Song Management (HSM), backed by an initial $1bn, in the latest move by big investors to tap into the streaming boom that has fuelled a recovery in the music industry. “The music industry is at the forefront of the fast-growing streaming economy and is unlocking new ways of consuming content,” said Qasim Abbas, senior managing director at Blackstone Tactical Opportunities. “This partnership underscores the long-term, sustainable value we see in creative content across the wider entertainment industry.” Back in Washington... the IMF has warned that the emergency support provided by central banks and finance ministries during the Covid-19 pandemic has fuelled speculation and left the world vulnerable to another financial crisis. Policy makers were faced with a “challenging” trade-off between continuing to support economic activity while preventing unintended consequences and medium-term financial stability risks, the IMF says in its half-yearly Global Financial Stability Review (GFSR). Noting that share prices appeared to be overvalued and house prices had risen rapidly in many countries, the Washington-based body said investors were becoming increasingly concerned about the economic outlook amid rising virus infections and greater uncertainty about the strength of the recovery, particularly in emerging markets. It said: “Warning signs – for example, increased financial risk-taking and rising fragilities in the nonbank financial institutions sector – point to a deterioration in the underlying financial stability foundations. If left unchecked, these vulnerabilities may evolve into structural legacy problems, putting medium-term growth at risk and testing the resilience of the global financial system.” The number of job openings at US companies has fallen, for the first time this year, but remain close to record levels. There were 10.4m unfilled positions at American companies in August, down from almost 11.1m in July (a record), according to the latest JOLTS report. That’s still a very high number, but it suggests that demand for labor may have weakened slightly as Covid-19 cases rose. More people voluntarily left their jobs, as the surge in vacancies forced employers to offer more attractive starting salaries and signing-on incentives. The quits rate (the number of quits in the month as a percent of total employment), increased to a record 2.9%. The IMF has also singled out the UK as a country which faces the risk of an inflation shock. Today’s World Economic Outlook says: We project, amid high uncertainty, that headline inflation will likely return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022 for the group of advanced economies and emerging and developing economies. There is, however, considerable heterogeneity across countries, with upside risks for some, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and some emerging market and developing economies. So central banks should be ready, the IMF says, in case inflation expectations become more materials: Central banks should chart contingent actions, announce clear triggers, and act in line with that communication. IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath has warned central banks that they should be prepared to act quickly if inflation becomes a more serious problem. Presenting today’s World Economic Outlook, Gopinath says central banks need to tread a fine line -- addressing inflation and financial risks while supporting the recovery. While monetary policy can generally look through transitory increases in inflation, central banks should be prepared to act quickly if the risks of rising inflation expectations become more material in this uncharted recovery. Gopinath also said the Fund takes data integrity ‘incredibly seriously’ and has ‘robust systems’ in place, when asked about allegations that IMF MD Kristalina Georgieva pressured World Bank staff to manipulate data to benefit China during her time as World Bank chief. [The IMF board backed Georgieva overnight -- saying the evidence presented “did not conclusively demonstrate” that she played an “improper” role in China’s ranking in a flagship report while at the World Bank.] Gopinath insists that the global growth picture doesn’t look remotely close to stagflation at the moment, with global growth still seen at 5.9% this year and 4.9% next year, and eurozone growth at 5% in 2021 and 4.3% in 2022. But there are risks of supply side shocks, with rising commodity prices and shortages, meaning firms are creating less and lifting their own prices On the move towards home working, Gopinath says that employment growth has been weaker than output growth in the recovery, and weaker than normal. Working from home can provide flexibility to those who aren’t ready to return to customer-facing roles in the pandemic, help workers be productive as they don’t have to commute, and give more flexibility to women, she says. However, we are not seeing that flexibility translating into more women returning to labour force. And on the latest US debt ceiling crisis, Gopinath says the brinkmanship is unproductive, and creates uncertainty [the House of Representatives will vote on a short extension to the ceiling today]. It would be good if the debt limit were reformed, perhaps replaced with a medium-term borrowing target, or automatically lifted in line with Congress’s tax and spending decisions. she suggests. This chart from the IMF’s WEO shows how the recovery has slowed in recent month.... ...while this chart highlights the vaccine inequality which is worrying the IMF: The IMF has also warned that rich nations need to deliver on their promises on vaccine availability and climate change measures. In the World Economic Outlook, the Fund warns that the unequal access to Covid-19 vaccines risks undermining the recovery. If Covid-19 were to have a prolonged impact into the medium term, it could reduce global GDP by a cumulative $5.3 trillion over the next five years relative to our current projection. It does not have to be this way. The global community must step up efforts to ensure equitable vaccine access for every country, overcome vaccine hesitancy where there is adequate supply, and secure better economic prospects for all. Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s economic counsellor, explains in a blogpost that there is a “great vaccine divide”, with the pandemic hitting low-income countries harder: “The dangerous divergence in economic prospects across countries remains a major concern,” “Aggregate output for the advanced economy group is expected to regain its pre-pandemic trend path in 2022 and exceed it by 0.9% in 2024. More here: Just in: The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecasts for the world economy this year, and warned that supply chain problems are hitting growth and driving up inflation. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF says that the momentum of the global recovery has weakened, hobbled by the pandemic and the rise of the Delta variant. It says: Fueled by the highly transmissible Delta variant, the recorded global COVID-19 death toll has risen close to 5 million and health risks abound, holding back a full return to normalcy. Pandemic outbreaks in critical links of global supply chains have resulted in longer-than-expected supply disruptions, further feeding inflation in many countries. Overall, risks to economic prospects have increased, and policy trade-offs have become more complex. The IMF has trimmed its forecast for world economic growth in 2021 to 5.9%, from 6% back in July. Growth in advanced economies this year has been cut to 5.2%, from 5.6%. The Fund says this is largely due to downgrades to three major economies: United States (due to large inventory drawdowns in the second quarter, in part reflecting supply disruptions, and softening consumption in the third quarter); Germany (in part because of shortages of key inputs weighing on manufacturing output); and Japan (reflecting the effect of the fourth State of Emergency from July to September as infections hit a record level in the current wave). The IMF now predicts the US will expand by 6% this year, down from 7% estimated back in July, with Germany’s growth forecast cut to 3.1% from 3.6%, and Japan trimmed to 2.4% from 2.8%. The UK is now forecast to growth by 6.8% this year, down from 7% previously forecast. That would still make the UK the fastest-growing advanced economy this year (after one of the largest contractions in 2020) The IMF also warns that gaps in expected recoveries across economy groups have widened since the July forecast, for instance between advanced economies and low-income developing countries -- due to “large disparities in vaccine access and in policy support”. As recoveries proceed, the risks of derailments and persistent scarring in heavily impacted economies remain so long as the pandemic continues. The Fund also warns that inflation has increased “markedly” in the US, and also in some emerging market economies, as supply has struggled to keep pace with rising demand. Although price pressures are expected to subside in most countries in 2022, inflation prospects are highly uncertain, it warns, which is “forcing difficult choices on policymakers—particularly in some emerging market and developing economies”. Supply disruptions pose another policy challenge, the IMF adds: On the one hand, pandemic outbreaks and weather disruptions have resulted in shortages of key inputs and dragged manufacturing activity lower in several countries. On the other hand, these supply shortages, alongside the release of pent-up demand and the rebound in commodity prices, have caused consumer price inflation to increase rapidly in, for example, the United States, Germany, and many emerging market and developing economies. Food prices have increased the most in low-income countries where food insecurity is most acute, adding to the burdens of poorer households and raising the risk of social unrest. One in ten petrol stations in London and the southeast of England are still out of fuel, with forecourts still in the dark about when fresh supplies might turn up. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), says the fuel supply is improving (more than two weeks after panic buying began). However, it remains ‘serious’ in London and the South East, where supplies aren’t getting through in time, Madderson explains: “Whilst there has been a welcome improvement over the weekend in the London and South East region with 10% reporting dry sites which is not far behind the rest of the country, a large majority of retailers continue to express concerns that they have no forward visibility of their next deliveries. “There are many reports of wet sites quickly going dry because the continuity of tankers remains out of kilter with orders. “The situation in London and the South East remains serious. According to the RAC Foundation, filling stations in London and the South East are used more intensely than other regions of the country. “Not only are there more vehicles per filling station (each London filling station serves 5112 cars on average), but the distance travelled per filling station is higher in London and the South East than any other region. These filling stations therefore need to be refuelled more often. “The need to refuel filling stations in London and the South East is even more necessary when customers panic buy, because there are more cars to be filled per station there than the GB average”. Back on this morning’s jobs data... and the NIESR thinktank have predicted that underlying wage growth will pick up in the last quarter of this year. That’s despite the slowdown in headline earnings in the last quarter (as flagged earlier, the ONS estimates that underling pay rose). NIESR say: The growth rate in average weekly earnings including bonuses (AWE) in Great Britain decreased in the three months to August to 7.2% compared to a year ago, down from 8.3%in the three months to July. This is in line with the 7.1% we forecast last month. Excluding base effects, the growth in average weekly earnings was at 4.2% in the three months to August, unchanged from the three months to July. A record level of vacancies and rising inflation suggest a future acceleration in wage growth. We forecast underlying average weekly earnings (excluding base effects) to accelerate from 4.2% in the third quarter to 4.5% in the fourth quarter. Staff at the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have launched a formal petition for union recognition following months of growing disenchantment with the regulator’s leadership, according to a union (PA Media’s Simon Neville reports). Unite said staff want to be represented by an independent trade union after new pay proposals will leave three out of four workers facing pay cuts of 10%, it is claimed. The union revealed it has seen a significant rise in membership at the regulator and called on bosses to hear the concerns of its workforce. A petition has been set up to gauge interest, with the results to be presented to the organisation responsible for regulating the UK’s financial sector. Staff are said to be unhappy with chief executive Nikhil Rathi’s transformation plans, which they believe will see wages cut but are unlikely to affect the FCA’s leadership team. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: “Staff across the FCA are joining Unite in unprecedented numbers and want their voices heard. “The significant growth in trade union membership demonstrates that the recognition of an independent trade union at the FCA is long overdue.” He added: “Staff at the FCA are demoralised by the consultation launched by the CEO in September and feel it is a poor way to reward FCA staff who worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to deliver credit card and mortgage payment holidays that were a lifeline to people up and down the country.” According to staff, morale has plummeted in recent months, resignations are rising on a daily basis and recruitment is failing to keep up. Unite members are angered that Mr Rathi, currently paid more than 455,000, has proposed allowing the highest paid FCA staff to be paid more to avoid caps on the tax breaks for the largest pension pot holders. Formal communication events have attracted waves of criticism, leading to union membership increasing four-fold, Unite said. The Bank of England and the Pensions Regulator already formally recognise trade unions. Supply chain problems and labour shortages are hitting confidence among Americas’s small businesses. Optimism among small firms has fallen to its lowest lowest reading since March, according to the latest survey from National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index fell to 99.1 in September from 100.1 in August. NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg said: “Small business owners are doing their best to meet the needs of customers, but are unable to hire workers or receive the needed supplies and inventories,” Expectations for better business conditions over the next six months deteriorated, and more than 35% of small-business owners said supply-chain disruptions have had a significant impact on their business - leading many to lift prices. Dunkelberg explained: Supply chains are still in disarray, with ships and containers piling up on the coasts but only slowly being unloaded and distributed to businesses as truck drivers are in short supply. Last week’s non-farm payroll showed that the US economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant and a tight labor market appeared to be holding back hiring. GlaxoSmithKline shares spiked 4% this morning after a report that private equity firms are circling its consumer arm, which is set to be split off from the pharmaceuticals and vaccines business next summer. The drugmaker has come under pressure from two hedge funds – the New York-based Elliott Management and the much smaller London-based firm Bluebell Capital Partners – to explore a sale of the consumer business, whose value analysts have estimated at around £45bn. GSK is pushing ahead with a demerger, though, and insists that this is what the majority of investors want. Bloomberg reported that private equity firms Advent International, Blackstone, Carlyle Group, CVC Capital Partners, and KKR are among those running the rule over the consumer business. It is understood, however, that GSK is not currently in discussions to sell off the unit. A GSK spokesman said: “As we have said, the GSK Board will fulfil its fiduciary duties to evaluate any alternative options for Consumer Healthcare which may arise that maximise value for all shareholders.” Elliott and Bluebell have also repeatedly demanded that GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley reapply for her job, while the company continues to insist that she will lead the pharma and vaccines division after the split. The GSK chairman, Sir Jonathan Symonds, held a virtual meeting with GSK’s top 50 investors last week where the Elliott founder Gordon Singer questioned Walmsley’s leadership and asked why the drugmaker’s share price had fallen below pre-Covid levels. luebell emerged on the scene last month, when it made similar demands as Elliott. It has taken a small stake in GSK, worth €10m, or 0.01% of the company, while Elliott is thought to have taken a substantial stake. Bluebell’s managing partners Marco Taricco and Giuseppe Bivona upped the pressure on GSK’s board when they wrote to the company again on Monday to demand the replacement of its chairman. Bluebell claimed that among the leading shareholders “there remains a broad scepticism of the current leadership, well beyond what has been voiced publicly by selected shareholders”. Bluebell wrote: “The separation of Consumer Healthcare should represent a new beginning for New GSK. This is why, given what we learned at the Investor Forum, we have reached the conclusion that a more radical change agenda than we have previously envisaged is required at New GSK Board’s level, and that this includes the appointment not only of a new CEO but also of a new Chairman.” A GSK spokesperson responded: “We completely reject the content and claims made in this letter, which are not representative of the discussion at the meeting or the majority of our shareholders’ views. We are disappointed that Bluebell have deliberately sought to misrepresent the meeting and to distort what was said in order to advance their own narrow agenda. “We laid out a very clear strategy for GSK at the Investor Update on 23rd June, including very specific performance KPIs. The Board and Executive team have engaged extensively and directly with GSK’s major shareholders with over 500 meetings since the start of the year. The feedback we have had from shareholders is supportive of this strategy - the focus is now on execution. “We remain absolutely focused on tackling the root causes of previous historical under-performance and delivering improved and sustained value for all shareholders. We are making good progress but there remains more to do. The Board is confident that we have the right strategy and the right team to deliver a step-change in growth and performance.” Cars remain the UK’s No 1 export but volatile energy prices and the cost of complying with EU regulations post-Brexit are blunting the industry’s competitive advantage, the sector’s trade body has said. Nine in 10 firms in the industry told the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) that costs, measured in time and resources, had increased as a result of leaving the EU, with 60% saying the extra expense for trading with the bloc was a “much more significant rise than other export destinations”. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: “The cost of complying with new regulations has made the UK potentially less competitive compared with some of our European counterparts. “The first few weeks months were incredibly difficult. There were delays at borders, some of those were teething problems, some of those issues were more substantive. Undoubtedly the industry is facing additional cost and complexity; costs which generally have to be absorbed, to maintain competitiveness.” The SMMT said that regardless of such issues, the EU would “remain a central trade partner”, with about half of all cars made in Britain exported to EU member states, while almost all vans exported by the UK end up on European roads. Overall vehicle export revenues to all markets reached £27bn in 2020, even as the Covid pandemic disrupted trade flows and shut down markets around the world. The SMMT hopes for caps on energy prices in recognition of the importance of the new generation of electric cars to the country’s climate emergency goals. Here’s the full story: Car sales in China fell last month, as chip shortages and the energy crisis hit automakers. Reuters has the details: China’s auto sales slumped 19.6% in September from a year earlier, industry data showed on Tuesday, falling for a fifth consecutive month as a prolonged global shortage of semiconductors and a domestic power crunch disrupt production. This time of year, known as “Golden September, Silver October”, is usually a high point in sales for the industry, with consumers making purchases after staying away from showrooms during the stifling summer months. Sales in the world’s biggest car market totalled 2.07 million vehicles in September, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed. The sales drop was due to the domestic power crunch caused partly by the shortage of coal and prolonged global chip shortage that has forced many major automakers to idle or curtail production, said Chen Shihua, a senior official at CAAM. More here: Chip shortage and power crunch hit China auto sales in ‘Golden September’ Global supply chain bottlenecks have hit economic sentiment in Germany again. The ZEW Institute’s gauge of economic sentiment for Germany dropped by 4.2 points this month to 22.3 points, the lowest since March 2020 during the first lockdown. The index of investor confidence has now fallen for five months in a row, as the assessment of the economic situation in Germany has worsened since a bright start earlier this year. The outlook for the economic development in the next six months has noticeably deteriorated, warned ZEW. ZEW President Professor Achim Wambach said problems obtaining raw materials are hitting German industry: The economic outlook for the German economy has dimmed noticeably. The further decline of the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment is mainly due to the persisting supply bottlenecks for raw materials and intermediate products. The financial market experts expect profits to go down, especially in export-oriented sectors such as vehicle manufacturing and chemicals/pharmaceuticals.” Miners, travel groups, and hospitality companies are among the fallers on the FTSE 100 this morning. Rio Tinto (-2.7%) and Anglo American (-2.2%), two commodities giants, are among the fallers, with British Airways parent company IAG (-1.9%) and catering group Compass (-1.4%) also dropping. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, says the prospect of higher UK interest rates is keeping shares down. “The big squeeze on companies as higher costs take hold has again choked off gains for the FTSE 100, keeping the index down 0.5% by mid-morning. It’s the expectation that the Bank of England will step in to try and squash down inflation by raising interest rates by the end of the year, that’s weighing down stocks, given the financial markets have become so addicted to ultra-low rates and easy financing. With vacancies hitting 1.1 million between July and September, the highest level since records began 20 years ago, it’s putting even more pressure on many companies which are already struggling to cope with the tourniquet of higher energy costs and supply chain problems. The crisis at indebted property group Evergrande crisis is also worrying investors, she adds: The company looks set to miss payments on interest payments due yet again. It’s feared the waves of repercussion risk pulling down a flotilla of smaller property companies. Although it’s still likely Beijing will try and stop the crisis spreading to financial firms, with the expectation that more state owned companies could step in and buy parts of Evergrande, the situation is still likely to cause a further marked slowdown for China’s property and construction sector, with a knock on effect on mining companies in particular. The additional concern is that a big slide in house prices will knock consumer confidence in China and if consumption dips, that might cause fresh ripples on financial markets.” Growth and inflation worries are weighing on the stock markets today, with the FTSE 100 index dipping by 0.5% this morning: Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM, says investors are worried about a ‘stagflation’ scenario, where companies suffer rising prices and a slowdown in growth: Stock markets started the week on the wrong foot. From paralyzed supply chains to an energy crisis that threatens to cripple Europe and Asia to growing credit risks in the Chinese property sector, there are several threats on the radar forcing traders to play defense. It’s a perfect storm. Supply chains seem overwhelmed, with disruptions spilling over from ports to the mainland lately amid lorry driver shortages, squeezing corporate profit margins as transportation and energy costs soar simultaneously. This burden could be passed onto consumers, taking a bite out of real incomes. The fear is that global growth slows down as companies can’t cover demand but inflation remains hot thanks to cost pressures - a toxic combination that central banks are powerless against. And with the fallout from Evergrande spreading across the Chinese property market as more developers miss debt payments, there is a dimension of credit risk as well. That said, this isn’t a catastrophe either. Growth is unlikely to slow enough to turn this into another recession and investors remain fairly confident that any credit events in China will remain isolated. Hence, there is light at the end of the stagflation tunnel, although it’s too early to call for the bottom ahead of an earnings season that will likely echo worries around growth and inflation. EasyJet expects to make a pretax loss of more than £1bn this year but said its recovery was under way, with a 400% surge in demand for winter sun breaks after the UK government relaxed travel restrictions. The low-cost airline is adding 100,000 seats thanks to the popularity of destinations such as Egypt, Turkey and the Canary Islands, and expects to fly up to 70% of 2019 levels in the three months to 31 December. October half-term bookings have also been strong, particularly to the Canaries where easyJet has increased its capacity to 140% of 2019 levels. Bookings for the first half are double those of the same time last year. Johan Lundgren, the easyJet chief executive, said: “It is clear recovery is under way. Business travel is returning to easyJet with corporates and SMEs attracted by our value, network and approach to sustainability. We have seen city breaks beginning to return alongside growing demand for leisure travel from customers looking for flights and holidays to popular winter sun destinations including Egypt and Turkey.” Shares in easyJet have dipped by 2.2% this morning to 633p; here’s Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor: Here’s economist Julian Jessop’s take on the jobs data: Job vacancies soared to a record high of almost 1.2m in September, according to official figures, as employers hunted for staff to meet shortages brought on by Brexit and the pandemic. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures also showed a 207,000 increase in the number of people on payrolls to a record 29.2 million – 120,000 above pre-pandemic levels – and a steep fall in unemployment before the furlough scheme came to an end at the end of September. London experienced the biggest rise in employment as the capital made up ground with the rest of the country after a large drop during the pandemic, but unlike many other areas, failed to reach pre-pandemic levels. In the three months to September, vacancies grew across most sectors driven by a jump in demand for workers by shop owners and wholesalers while motor garages looked for 35,000 extra staff.... More here: Britain’s economic recovery is being held back by a “labour gap” of nearly one million workers, says Institute for Employment Studies’ director Tony Wilson. He’s spotted that the UK labour market is the tightest in decades, with the lowest number of unemployed people per vacancy on record (just 1.45, compared to 4.1 in the first lockdown in 2020). The labour gap is partly due to fewer older people in work and more young people in education, as well as the drop in migration. Wilson says the UK must do more to help people back into work: These shortages are holding back our economic recovery, and won’t fix themselves by just exhorting firms to pay people more. Instead we need to do far better at helping some of the six million people who are outside the labour market because of ill health, caring or full-time study to get back into work. He’s also written a very informative thread about today’s jobs data: UK consumers cut their trips to supermarkets last month amid the petrol crisis, but those who got to the shops faced higher prices. Research firm Kantar reports that visits to grocery stores in the last month fell to the lowest level since the February lockdown. With some forecourts closed, and others seeing lengthy queues, people may have limited the number of trips they made to supermarkets to avoid draining their tanks. Overall, grocery sales fell by 1.2% year on year in the 12 weeks to 3 October 2021, Kantar says. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, explains: “Queues outside petrol stations made headlines last month and visits to forecourts in the south of England increased by 66% on Friday 24 September as people topped up their tanks ahead of the weekend. The reduced availability of petrol saw shoppers limit the number of trips they made to supermarkets. The average household made 15.5 store visits in the past four weeks, the lowest monthly figure since February. Shoppers staying off the roads also meant the proportion of groceries bought online, which has been steadily decreasing over the past seven months, crept up to 12.4% compared with 12.2% in September. Kantar also reports that grocery prices jumped by 1.7% in the last four weeks, compared with a year ago, as the cost of living squeeze hit families. McKevitt explains: “In real world terms, the average household had to spend an extra £5.94 on groceries last month than they did at the same time last year. The typical household spends £4,726 per year in the supermarkets, so any future price rises will quickly add up. Shoppers will look to manage their spend by carefully selecting the products and retailers that offer them the best value.” City analysts say today’s jobs data may bolster the case for the Bank of England to raise interest rates (with traders expecting Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, says the UK now looks “firmly on the path to higher interest rates”; the question is how quickly the BoE takes us there. “The dials in the labour market are pointing towards an interest rate rise, with job vacancies at a record high, unemployment falling, and the number of payrolled employees back to pre-pandemic levels. The only sign that tightness in the labour market might be easing was the continued fall in average earnings, as base effects start to fall out of the equation. The record number of job vacancies suggests even this moderation may peter out, as employers find themselves competing for workers with cold hard cash. “The number of job vacancies is now within touching distance of the number of unemployed people in the country, which suggests this is not simply a transitory or frictional matter. However the jury is still out on exactly how dry the labour market is until the full effects of the end of the furlough scheme can be seen. If lots of previously furloughed jobs are axed, the resulting job seekers could fill some holes, though their skills probably won’t map neatly across to the jobs being advertised. ING developed markets economist James Smith says today’s solid UK jobs report does “little to dampen rate hike expectations”: If markets are right, we may only be a matter of weeks away from the first Bank of England rate hike. That’s undoubtedly bold, but at face value there’s little in the latest UK jobs report that will sow any fresh seeds of doubt in the minds of investors. Hiring demand is clearly strong, and the rebound in employment in the hardest-hit consumer services sectors continues apace. Wage growth is around pre-virus levels, if ONS estimates of underlying trends are to be believed. And so far, there’s no discernible increase in redundancies ahead of the furlough scheme ending. In short, it’s an uncertain backdrop in the jobs market. At a time when the cost of living is increasing sharply – and inflation is set to be at or above 4.5% next April – it’s likely that real wages will be flat, or indeed negative for many workers over the winter. Nye Cominetti, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation, fears inflation could overtake wage growth this winter: “With households across Britain facing a triple whammy of rising prices, energy bills and benefit cuts, the jobs market is providing some welcome relief amid a turbulent autumn. “Record vacancies levels in September were matched by a record hiring surge, which should help formerly furloughed workers find work as a quickly as possible in October. “But while encouraging, the UK labour market remains smaller than it was pre-pandemic. And though wage growth looks almost unbelievably strong right now, there are big questions over whether it will remain strong enough over the coming months to prevent real wages from falling this winter.” Jonathan Reynolds MP, shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, points out that the UK’s long-term unemployment total (those out of work for at least a year) hasn’t improved: “Long term unemployment remains persistent and the Government’s Plan for Jobs has done nothing to alleviate supply shortages or prepare for the future. Families and businesses are facing an energy crisis, shortages and price rises because of this Government’s poor decisions and lack of planning. And now working people are being hammered by tax hikes and cuts to Universal Credit. Our country faces a difficult winter and people need a Government on their side, not the complacency and chaos of the Conservatives.” Although basic and total pay growth has slowed, the ONS’s estimate of underlying UK pay growth has gone up. They now estimate that underlying regular earnings (trying to strip out the impact of the pandemic) are rising at between 4.1% and 5.6%, up from last month’s 3.6% to 5.1% range. But, the ONS cautions that there’s a lot of uncertainty about how best to control for the impact of the pandemic. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, says a rise in underlying earnings could worry Bank of England policymakers (who already sound nervous about inflationary pressures). The distortions from the furlough scheme and the change in the composition of employment that have boosted average earnings growth have now started to ease. The 3myy rate fell from 8.3% in July to 7.3% in August. But the ONS said that excluding those distortions, underlying wage growth accelerated from a range of 3.6-5.1% in July to 4.1-5.6%. That may fuel some of the concerns at the Bank of England that the rise in inflation is becoming more persistent, even though the outlook for overall economic activity has weakened since August. Dales also warns that there’s no real signs in this release that the labour shortages have started to ease. The end of the furlough scheme will probably help, but we’re increasingly of the view that labour shortages will last at least until the middle of next year. A cloud is hanging over today’s jobs report -- the ending of the furlough scheme at the end of September. Rob Clarry, economist at PwC, says the labour market faces its ‘sternest test’ since Covid-19 hit. “September marked another positive month for the UK labour market. The number of payrolled employees reached a record high of over 29 million, exceeding the pre-pandemic level for the first time. And demand for employees remained elevated with a record 1.2 million job vacancies open. “However, with the furlough scheme winding down at the end of September, the labour market now faces its sternest test since the start of the pandemic. We expect to see a period of adjustment as workers made unemployed either enter sectors experiencing high demand for labour, such as transport and construction, or retrain to pursue new vocations. “The gradual increase in the supply of available workers should also soften wage growth over the coming months, as people move into the sectors which are running hot. This could provide some welcome respite for the transport sector, which recorded a 56% increase in the number of vacancies open over the last 3 months.” The surge in vacancies shows that the UK labour market is tight - and should give workers bargaining power for pay rises. So says Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity International: The shortage of HGV drivers has been well documented, but other sectors from hospitality to retail are also dealing with talent gaps - 12 of 18 sector categories are showing record levels of vacancies. “The rise in open job vacancies should hand workers even more power to demand higher wages. Monk also points out that the picture on pay is less rosy than the headline figures suggest: Working out the real rate of pay rises is difficult, however. The headline rate of 7.2% comes a with a big asterisk. Last year’s pay figures were brought lower by many people having seen their wages drop while on the furlough scheme, making this year’s number look better. Meanwhile, many lower paid workers have lost their jobs, with the effect of pushing the average higher. Stripping out these effects brings the underlying rate of regular earnings down a bit, to between 4.1% and 5.6%. “That’s still enough for the Government to claim wages are rising in real terms because inflation is currently 3.2% - but the rise is far less that the headline rate of wage rises suggests. While some jobs are seeing significant pay increases, many are seeing below-inflation rises - and public sector workers are seeing their pay frozen completely. With inflation forecast to rise significantly further, it would be a mistake to be complacent about a squeeze on the cost of living in the months ahead.” The surge in vacancies shows that UK firms are struggling to fill jobs, says Matthew Percival, CBI Programme Director for Skills &amp; Inclusion: “Companies have found hiring difficult this autumn and the official data is beginning to tell the same story, with the number of people on payroll exceeding pre-Covid highs and record vacancies. “It’s welcome that Government has set up a new taskforce chaired by Sir David Lewis to advise on the impact of supply chain disruption and labour shortages on the recovery. Business and Government working together is the best way to create the high-wage, high-skill, high-investment, high-productivity economy we all want to see.” (Business leaders have felt unfairly blamed for the UK mounting supply-chain problems, with ministers also accusing some firms of using immigration to keep wages low). The easing of lockdown restrictions in the spring led to a rise in the number of hours worked over the summer. Total actual weekly hours worked in the UK increased by 39.9 million hours from the previous quarter, to 1.02 billion hours in June to August 2021. Thats’s still 30.9 million below pre-pandemic levels, though. Part-time workers made up the majority of the increase in employment in June-August, after bearing the brunt of layoffs during the pandemic: Minister for Employment Mims Davies MP says: “With unemployment falling once again, and another record rise in the number of workers on employer payrolls, it’s clear our plan to create, support and protect jobs is working. “As we enter the next phase of recovery, the £500m boost to our Plan for Jobs will continue to deliver more skills and opportunities for people up and down the country whilst crucially helping to fill vacancies across growing sectors as we push to build back better.” In September alone, there were almost 1.2 million vacancies across the UK, the ONS says, which a record high. This chart shows vacancies over the July-September quarter also soared to a record (at 1,102,000): There were 3.7 vacancies for every 100 employee jobs, which is another record high, the Office for National Statistics says. Vacancies rose fastest in transport and storage -- up a blistering 56.1% in the quarter, amid the scramble to find lorry drivers and other logistics staff. The ONS adds: July to September 2021 saw continued growth across the majority of sectors with 12 of the 18 categories displaying a record number of vacancies; the largest quarterly increase was seen in Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, which was up 35,000 (32.4%) Across the majority of industry sectors the rate of growth in vacancies began to slow down; vacancies rose by 239,000 (27.7%) in July to September 2021, down from 242,000 (38.9%) last quarter. In July to September 2021, all industry sectors are above or equal to their January to March 2020 pre-pandemic levels with accommodation and food service activities increasing the most, by nearly 50,000 (59%). All industry size bands displayed a record number of vacancies in July to September 2021. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Unemployment across the UK has dipped, as company payrolls continued to swell over the summer as the economy recovered from the economic shock of the pandemic. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning show that the jobless rate fell to 4.5% in the three months to August. That’s down from 4.6% in the three months to July, and 0.4 percentage points lower than the previous quarter. In another sign that the labour market continuing to recover, the number of payroll employees rose by 207,000 in September to a record 29.2m, back at pre-pandemic levels. Firms are also struggling to fill jobs, the survey confirms. Job vacancies in July to September 2021 hit a record high of 1,102,000 - an increase of 318,000 from its pre-pandemic January to March 2020 level. But the surge in pay growth seen earlier this year (and hailed by Boris Johnson) has slowed. Total pay, including bonuses, rose by 7.2% in the June-August quarter, down from 8.3% in May-July. Regular pay rose by 6.0% in the quarter, down from 6.8% And adjusted for inflation, that leaves real total pay at 4.7% and real regular pay at 3.4%. But, the ONS points out that this data should be treated cautiously, as the loss of more low-paid jobs in the pandemic has pushed up average earnings. They explain: Annual growth in average employee pay is being affected by temporary factors that have inflated the increase in the headline growth rate: base effects where the latest months are now compared with low base periods when earnings were first affected by the pandemic, and compositional effects where there has been a fall in the number and proportion of lower-paid employee jobs, therefore increasing average earnings. Overall, the ONS estimates that underlying regular earnings growth rate is between 4.1% and 5.6% -- but again, given the uncertainty around this range, interpretation should be treated with caution. ONS Director of Economic Statistics Darren Morgan says the jobs market continues to recover: More details and reaction to follow... Stock markets are expected to open lower, as fears about weakening growth, the global energy crunch, higher prices and the possibility of interest rate hikes keep investors on edge. Yesterday, the odds of a UK interest rate rise before the end of 2021 increased, as rising fuel and food prices push up inflation. And the International Monetary Fund is holding its annual meetings in Washington, where its expected to issue a downbeat economic outlook, as supply-chain bottlenecks and rising inflationary pressures threaten the recovery.

          "headline": "NHL season predictions: better fashion, the Kraken wakes and an NY title",
          "bodyText": "Seattle won’t get an inaugural playoff visit There’s a lot to love about an NHL team finally returning to Seattle (jersey collectors no doubt await a revival of the Golden Seals kit), if for no other reason than to give the Vancouver Canucks a true regional rival – even if their jerseys are, annoyingly, almost indistinguishable on TV. Still, the Kraken’s expansion draft might not prove as fruitful as that of the Vegas Golden Knights a few years ago. Jordan Eberle, Mark Giordano, Jamie Oleksiak, and – perhaps above all – Philip Grubauer, will certainly provide a good base to work with. But it doesn’t feel like the team is deep enough to get them out of a difficult division with the Golden Knights, or even past the Flames and Oilers. More teams will adopt a relaxed dress code The NHL’s game-day dress code isn’t just tradition, it’s written into the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and the players’ association. Paragraph 5 of Exhibit 14 stipulates that players are “required to wear jackets, ties and dress pants to all Club games and while traveling to and from such games unless otherwise specified by the Head Coach or General Manager.” Enter the Arizona Coyotes, the first team to relax the code, thanks to a prompt from their brand manager. This is likely why other teams will follow, uh, suit (sorry). While the players may see it as a chance to show off their fashion bona fides, owners will probably recognize the marketing and sales opportunity. This summer, the Maple Leafs collaborated with Justin Bieber’s clothing line, Drew House and, surprise, it’s not a bunch of suits and ties. Connor McDavid – and Oilers fans – will be disappointed again There are few more frustrating storylines in the NHL than McDavid’s. The guy’s a wizard alien. He’s a freak. The fastest kid alive. The NHL’s best player. And yet perennially unfulfilled. Last year was no different. The Oilers didn’t just lose their first-round series against the Winnipeg Jets last spring – they got swept, 4-0. It’s difficult to pinpoint a single cause, but that they were outscored 14-8 in the series, with not just McDavid but Leon Draisaitl as well, might be it. Obviously goaltending was also a factor, and remains one. Adding Zach Hyman is a positive step. But Duncan Keith feels like an answer to a question nobody asked – unless it was one about anti-vaxxers. McDavid may have to be satisfied with Olympic gold in February. That is, unless… The Americans win gold in Beijing If there was ever a moment for the United States to win Olympic gold in men’s hockey, this is it… I think? Let’s see. So far, the US has named three players to its Olympic roster: Auston Matthews, Seth Jones, and Patrick Kane. Seems like a good start! Who else might make the cut? Cole Caufield, the Canadiens’ wunderkind/playoff saviour may do. How about Jack Eichel (assuming he’s healthy)? Who else is on this list? Johnny Gaudreau, Brock Boeser, Kyle Connor, John Carlson, Ryan Suter, Connor Hellebuyck, Ben Bishop… yeah, these guys are stacked. Let’s be honest, Canada will most likely ice a solid squad, too. Beyond McDavid, Sidney Crosby, and Alex Pietrangelo already named to the team, Canada’s options include Nathan MacKinnon, Mitch Marner, Jonathan Huberdeau, Brad Marchand, Mat Barzal and Cale Makar – a solid group! But it feels like the Americans might have the edge now. Unless it’s actually Finland? Or maybe Russia? Should be a good tourney. The Maple Leafs won’t lose to the Canadiens in the playoffs The good news for Leafs fans is that it’s unlikely they’ll see a repeat of last spring’s brutal playoff exit to Montreal. But that’s only because the Canadiens won’t make the playoffs this year. Is that dismissive of a team that went all the way to the Finals just a few months ago? Yes. But the return to the regular divisional format in 2021-22 means the Habs are in much tougher company than when they faced just the North (against whom they frankly struggled). The Bruins, Panthers, and Lightning will be too challenging. Same story for the Leafs. While they’ll likely make the post-season again, Toronto will likely need to get past either the Bolts, Bruins, or Panthers to advance – and that’s only if Matthews and Marner start to actually put up points, which they don’t tend to do in the playoffs. The Leafs going far is possible, but… yeah, I dunno, probably not? The best games will be in the Central Division Keep your eyes on the Central. Colorado will be looking to redeem themselves after their second-round playoff loss to Vegas. Dallas will be hunting for a playoff berth and a repeat of their 2020 Stanley Cup Final berth – before everyone gets too old. Meanwhile, Winnipeg remains a threat and the Blues and Predators will likely be stiff competition for the wildcard spot. As for Chicago? The Blackhawks over-delivered on expectations for much of the truncated 2021 season but faltered down the stretch and missed the playoffs. With Marc-Andre Fleury between the pipes now and Seth Jones on the blue line, Chicago may now have what it takes to slip into the postseason. This will be a competitive division with deepening rivalries and the highest potential for meaningful midseason match-ups. We’re going to talk more about what happens off the ice The NHL continues to reckon with some of its darkest demons. During the summer, TSN reported that a former Chicago Blackhawks player alleged that he’d been sexually assaulted by the team’s then-video coach in 2010, and that the team did nothing after he spoke up about the alleged abuse. The coach has denied the allegations, and the Blackhawks are expected to release a report on the incident soon. More recently, Golden Knight’s goalie Robin Lehner levelled allegations of a different kind. Lehner tweeted about a disagreement between the Buffalo Sabres and Jack Eichel over the proper treatment for his herniated disk injury (the team wants Eichel to get fusion surgery, but Eichel favours disk replacement surgery – the disagreement has led to the Sabres stripping Eichel of his captaincy and his requesting a trade). Lehner tweeted a story about Eichel, commenting “Better to have pain for the rest of their lives… At least they will supply the pain meds… same old shit.” He then accused the league of endorsing irresponsible prescription drug and sleeping pill distribution to players. Lehner has since spoken to both the NHL and NHLPA and said he’s “excited about the potential change that can be made to protect the younger generation.” More to come, as they say. And then there’s Carey Price. Montreal’s surprising Cup run last spring would not have happened without Price between the pipes – and certainly not without him being, by all appearances, so zoned-in as to be in an almost trance-like state. We don’t know what happened since then, nor is it our business. But last week, Price voluntarily joined the NHL’s player assistance program, which helps players with mental health or substance abuse issues. Maybe we’ll find out more, maybe not. In any event, Price’s decision is a good one – both for himself and his family, and for hockey more broadly. It’s OK to ask for help. The playoffs will unfold like this… The league has yet to confirm the 2022 playoff format, but assuming it returns to pre-pandemic form, here’s how it could look: In the East, Tampa, Florida, Boston, and Toronto will make the postseason, along with the Islanders, Carolina, Washington, and Philadelphia. Out west, the weaker Pacific division will see only three teams go to the playoffs, Vegas, Edmonton, and Calgary. Five teams from the Central will make it through – Colorado, Dallas, Winnipeg, with St. Louis, and Chicago taking the wildcard spots. The Islanders will beat Toronto to face Tampa in the second round, while Florida will advance to face Carolina. Calgary will better Edmonton to play Dallas, and Vegas will meet Colorado. This will mean that… The New York Islanders will make the Final Post-Olympics, the biggest question in the NHL will probably be: Who can take down Tampa? Friends, it’s the New York Islanders. They came very close to doing it last year, after all, losing just 1-0 in Game 7 against Tampa Bay in the semifinals. It was virtually the same story in 2020. For Tampa, the road to the Stanley Cup seems always to lead through Long Island. And while the Lightning may not three-peat the Cup itself, it seems likely that a third semifinal between the two teams is likely. Tampa still feel like a championship team, but if anyone can end that, it’s the Islanders. Captain Anders Lee will return after injuring his ACL last season. Mat Barzal should be in his usual form. And the Semyon Varlomov-Ilya Sorokin combo in net is one of the best, if not the best, goalie duo in the league. The end result? The Stanley Cup will leave Florida Look, Florida can be fun. And Lord Stanley’s cup has clearly enjoyed itself there, despite the head injury. But come on, you can’t stay in Florida forever (OK, maybe in the Keys). Tampa will fall to the Islanders, finally. The Panthers will try to keep the Cup in-state, but against the Islanders they won’t prove quite ready. A lengthy Final series will see the Islanders raise the Stanley Cup."

          "headline": " Michigan tells majority-Black city not to drink tap water amid lead crisis",
          "bodyText": "Residents of a majority-Black city in Michigan have been advised by the state not to use tap water for drinking, bathing, or cooking “out of an abundance of caution” owing to lead contamination. For at least three years, residents of Benton Harbor, Michigan, have been suffering from lead-contaminated water with what experts describe as insufficient intervention from state and local officials. This month, the state promised to expand free water distribution in the city and reaffirmed its commitment to comply with federal lead regulations. Activists, who say Benton Harbor’s poor water quality is a sign of environmental injustice and have been calling on the state to take action for years, say these are steps in the right direction, but more remains to be done. In 2018, Benton Harbor was found to have lead contamination of 22 parts per billion (ppb) in its tap water – far higher than the federal action level of 15 ppb and higher, even, than nearby Flint at the height of its water crisis. No level of lead exposure is considered safe; the federal action level is a national standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine which water systems must take action to lower its lead levels. Local activists welcome these steps after three years of questioning whether the city’s water was safe, and organizing bottled water drives for the community themselves. “I believe the action … shows they’re ready to do something,” said the Rev Edward Pinkney, head of the Benton Harbor Community Water Council, a significant step in the right direction. “That’s a good thing.” But Pinkney said far more was needed to address the crisis in full, and called on Governor Gretchen Whitmer to declare a state of emergency – both as a means to accelerate the timeline to replace the city’s water lines and to make clearer to those residents unaware of the emergency that the water is unsafe to use. “You need to call for a state of emergency right now,” Pinkney said. “That will get the attention of the people in Benton Harbor.” He also believed the phrasing of the state’s latest measures failed to capture the scale of the crisis. “Tell the people that the water is unsafe,” Pinkney said. “Just tell them.” The Natural Resources Defense Council, along with Pinkney’s group and several other organizations, filed an emergency appeal to the EPA on 9 September demanding federal action. In a 5 October response, the EPA told the petitioners that it was now working with the state, county, and city to “ensure there is prompt action to address the community’s public health needs”. The federal involvement has triggered a more assertive response from the state, according to Cyndi Roper, Michigan senior policy advocate for the NRDC. “It is clear that EPA’s involvement is driving this forward,” Roper said. “The state has not responded to this for three years in a way that protected residents. It wasn’t until EPA headquarters got involved that we have begun to see an urgent response.” Following the petition in September, the Michigan department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE) said it would work with other agencies at the state, county and municipal level to bring water filters to every home in Benton Harbor and to provide bottled water to residents – measures that were previously spearheaded by Pinkney’s group and volunteers. Whitmer, meanwhile, signed a budget allotting $10m to replace lead lines in the city. Last week, EGLE and the Michigan department of health and human services (HHS) announced an expanded water distribution program and a filter effectiveness study, and discouraged residents from using their tap water. “Protecting the health and safety of Benton Harbor residents is a top priority,” Elizabeth Hertel, director of the Michigan HHS, said in a statement. “We’ve listened to the community’s concerns and out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending that residents use bottled water for cooking, drinking and brushing teeth.” Lynn Sutfin, public relations officer at the state HHS, said in a statement that “many efforts have been taking place since 2018” from the state and Berrien county, and that the recent actions have been “part of an accelerated, across-the-board effort” to reduce the risk to residents while lead service lines are replaced by the city. Roper, of the NRDC, said that the recent moves were encouraging, but that officials should follow residents’ lead and speed up the timetable for replacing the city’s 6,000 service lines. “We definitely think it’s a step in the right direction,” Roper told the Guardian. “But we still have a long way to go.” Replacing the lead lines will be a challenge. Under a proposal from Whitmer, the pipes would be removed over the course of five years. But it’s unclear how the project will be funded: the Republican-controlled Michigan legislature agreed to only half of the $20m she said it would cost, and Joe Biden’s infrastructure bills that put $45bn in federal dollars toward replacing the nation’s aging lead lines are currently stuck in a legislative impasse on Capitol Hill. Erik Olson, senior strategic director for health at the NRDC, expressed concern in a previous interview with the Guardian that any cuts to pipe removal funding in the final bills could come at the expense of disadvantaged communities like Benton Harbor. Meanwhile, residents and their advocates say that the five-year timetable proposed by Whitmer is too long, and have been pushing for an accelerated pace, citing the speed with which the far-larger city of Newark, New Jersey, has moved to replace its lead pipes; since early 2019, it has removed more than 20,000 service lines. Pinkney has called for the Benton Harbor lines to be replaced in one to two years. “We can’t wait no longer,” Pinkney said. But only about 100 are slated to be removed by next spring. That means residents will probably have to rely on stopgap measures for the foreseeable future, unless something changes. “Just think about if your children were living in Benton Harbor – would you allow this?” Pinkney said. “Look at Benton Harbor, and do the right thing.”"

          "headline": "Sarah Everard’s death prompts men to join groups trying to halt male violence",
          "bodyText": "The murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa could mark a turning point in men taking responsibility for male violence against women and girls, experts have said. Groups led by men that work to end violence against females have experienced a surge in interest from other men, but organisers say if the momentum is not harnessed the opportunity will be lost. Beyond Equality had 150 men come forward in the two weeks after Everard’s death, asking to volunteer at the charity. Previously the average was two men a week. The surge in interest has been sustained: more than 80 schools booked workshops with the group in the past week, compared with an average of three inquiries a week previously. “It’s a sign of how badly our work is needed that it takes not just the death of two women at the hands of men – because women are killed by men all the time – but the wall-to-wall coverage that these two murders received, for men to contact us in these numbers,” said Dr Daniel Guinness, the managing director of Beyond Equality. But whatever the motivation, Guinness said increasing numbers of men were realising that protecting women is not just about being a good person themselves. “All men are responsible for the violence,” said Guinness. “I have never met a man who hasn’t condoned a dialogue by joking along or staying silent where misogynistic or sexist comments were made. But by not challenging those attitudes, you’re giving your tacit approval to the misogynist making the comments, which leads to the normalisation of those attitudes, which ultimately leads to the abuse of women,” he said. “It’s a continuum.” Michael Conroy, the founder of the community group Men at Work, agreed. “I might be a good guy who would never hurt a woman but this isn’t about me: this is about men, plural,” he said. Conroy, who also said his company had received much more work since the murders of Everard and Nessa, pointed to Philip Allott, North Yorkshire’s police commissioner, who said Everard “never should have submitted” to arrest by her killer. “All men are in this up to their necks in one way or other, so it’s up to all men to work actively to dismantle it,” he said. Davy Thompson, the campaign manager for the charity White Ribbon Scotland, said. “Many men realise they shouldn’t walk behind a woman late at night because it scares her,” he said. “But it’s not enough to just change your route: men need to change the atmosphere where simply being a man in a woman’s vicinity at night is a source of fear for her. “That starts with men squeezing the social spaces in which sexist men feel their misogyny is condoned until those men are left with no spaces in which they feel their attitudes are normal,” he said. The organisation What Can I Do? was set up by the musician Mark Hegarty in the wake of the murders. “I’m just a normal bloke who had thought this issue didn’t affect me. But then I started talking to the women around me and I realised that male violence affected every single one of them,” said Hegarty, who co-founded the group with Gauri Taylor-Nayar, a campaigner against of domestic violence. “This is a really pivotal moment,” said Dr Stephen Burrell, a trustee for White Ribbon UK, which was contacted by the Wunderman Thompson consultancy after Everard’s murder to advise on a nationwide advertising campaign to encourage all men to take responsibility for male violence towards women. But this “sea change” could ebb away if not harnessed, he warned. “For real, meaningful change, we need to see much more action from governments and other organisations as well, including the police, schools, universities and workplaces.” The group Engage will hold what it says is the first male-led, international pro-feminist online conference in November. While the event was arranged before the murders, organisers have said male interest in it has increased dramatically since. But Chris Green, the founder of Engage, said that while the increased interest was good, it was not enough. “We’re still a long, long way from engaging men in a mass way,” he said. Green is worried by what he said were powerful forces working to reverse any progress made by anti-violence groups, including the “massive juggernaut” of online pornography and the ongoing failure of four UK parliaments and three UK prime Ministers to ratify the Istanbul convention, an international treaty protecting women’s rights that is already law in 21 European countries. Darshan Sanghrajka, the co-founder of the Being ManKind project, said he feared the increase in online misogyny would undo any advances made. “Over the last couple of years, the internet has become increasingly toxic,” he said, pointing to Facebook’s own researchers who found that 64% of all extremist “group joins” were due to its recommendation tools. “Algorithms quickly suck you into an echo chamber where groups are increasingly extreme,” he said. “You end up in an alternate reality where your feelings of being slighted by women can easily get manipulated into a determination to revenge yourself against them.” However, James McCann, a co-founder of the Feminist Men Project, said men had no choice but to plough on. “It can be easy to feel overwhelmed but we fight for change because we must. We have to aspire to a better quality of life for everybody, always.”"

          "bodyText": "It might not have been the immediate public inquiry sought by opposition parties and bereaved families, but the landmark joint report into the UK’s handling of Covid proved less toothless than some feared. Published almost exactly a year to the day since the MPs’ inquiry was first announced, the “lessons learned to date” report, prepared by two Commons committees after mammoth evidence sessions, is not short on lessons – some of them expressed with notable bluntness. The delay to impose a first lockdown last spring was “one of the most important public health failures the United Kingdom has ever experienced”; planning for a possible virus outbreak smacked of “British exceptionalism”; the lack of early testing capacity was “an almost unimaginable setback”. The condemnation goes on, echoed through 151 pages, with just about the only element of the pandemic response spared a kicking being the vaccine rollout. While the Commons health committee and science and technology committee are cross-party, taking in Labour and SNP members as well as Conservatives, they are led by Tory ex-ministers, Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark. Clark, the business secretary under Theresa May who was shunted to the backbenches by Boris Johnson, is unlikely to expect a return to ministerial life and has relatively little direct political investment in the issues scrutinised. In contrast, Hunt was health secretary from 2012 to 2018 and was central to planning for such pandemics. He has clearly not relinquished the idea of coming back into government, or even competing again to be Tory leader, and would thus arguably have a vested interest in not overly upsetting either Boris Johnson or Conservative MPs more generally. The Lib Dems had in particular expressed worry that Hunt’s involvement in pandemic preparations, including a report into a 2016 exercise based on the outbreak of a respiratory virus – details of which only emerged in the Guardian last week – made his hand in the report worrying. While the final report, published on Tuesday, is highly critical of both ministers and scientists, opposition MPs involved said initial versions, notably its conclusions, were considerably less damning when first presented. It took many hours of “robust” debate to agree the final wording, they said. Wrangling is standard on cross-party reports but the stakes here were high: the first official attempt to apportion some responsibility for what was arguably the greatest political crisis since the war, and one where the UK fared notably worse on several metrics than neighbouring countries. The view from opposition parties is that the committees’ report showed what can be gained from such rapid inquiries but should be seen only as a start. While Johnson has promised a full public inquiry into the pandemic, this will not begin until spring 2022 at the earliest. It was this delay that prompted Hunt and Clark to launch their own process, arguing it could avoid future errors. It was, however, always a process with a limited scope and beset with political compromises. Thus, while many failings are outlined, they are generally institutional; there is nothing in the report likely to hasten the end of a ministerial career, or even to prompt an urgent question in parliament. “This isn’t enough,” one MP involved in the process said. “We owe it to the families of those who died to get to the bottom of who got it wrong. And that needs a public inquiry.”"

          "bodyText": "Asos is the latest in a string of pandemic winners to lose its shine, after the departure of its chief executive and a profit warning for the year ahead. “We are not immune,” said Mat Dunn, Asos’s finance chief turned temporary day-to-day boss, pointing out that high-flying digital businesses that have done so well during lockdown are struggling from the same perfect storm of issues facing the wider retail industry. Surging air and shipping costs, supply issues, warehouse labour and driver shortages, rising wages and customers returning more products have prompted jittery investors to wipe billions off the value of British e-commerce darlings. “A year ago there was the widespread assumption that online retailers would continue to have their wicked way against their brick and mortar rivals,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “However, the last few months have shown that even for online retail there is no such thing as a free lunch. There is still a lot of hard work involved and we are seeing input cost inflation, logistic bottlenecks and public pressure on the issue of supply chains and sourcing. Most of these firms working to relatively tight operating margins are now finding it a lot more difficult, it’s a tough market.” Boohoo A big winner in the brand grab as traditional high street retailers succumbed to the pandemic, Boohoo snapped up household names including Debenhams, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. But a 64% slump in pre-tax profits in the half year to the end of August, pushing its share price down to half what it was a year ago, is testament to the difficulties the company is now facing. John Lyttle, chief executive, has pointed to a doubling of the cost of air freight to the US, and shipping costs for products from east Asia climbing three or even four fold, as well as the “most difficult year in terms of recruitment and wages”. The brakes have been put on the rate of sales growth, falling from 50% in the UK earlier this year to 19% in the quarter to the end of August. AO World Earlier this month more than £200m was wiped off the stock market value of the online retailer after it blamed driver shortages and supply chain problems for lower-than-expected profits. Sales target misses in the UK and Germany prompted a 23% slump in the Bolton-based company’s share price, making it the top faller on the FTSE 250 the day of the announcement, and its market capitalisation is down about a third from this time last year. The pandemic-fuelled £64m in pre-tax profits last year are now a memory, with the company telling investors to expect a level of between £35m and £50m this year. Ocado The online grocery delivery company reported its first ever sales decline in August, as the home shopping boom triggered by the pandemic lost some of its lustre as shoppers returned to stores as social distancing restrictions eased. Trading at close to £29 in January, investors have sent its share price down around 45% to £15.70 this year. Last month, Ocado said it expected to spend up to £5m hiring and paying delivery drivers and warehouse staff as labour shortages continue. The company’s performance has not been helped by a fire at its warehouse in Erith, caused by the collision of three robots, which caused Ocado to lose 300,000 orders. The Hut Group (THG) The Hut Group’s £4.5bn flotation last summer was the biggest listing in five years with the Manchester-based business hailed as a great British e-commerce success story. Riding the wave of the lockdown e-commerce shopping boom, the company’s share price touched highs of close to 800p in January, and as recently as August its billionaire founder, Matthew Moulding, continued his empire building buying beauty business CultBeauty for £275m. But a plan outlined in September to break up THG, and amid concerns over a general slowdown in online shopping, the loss-making company’s shares have fallen by almost 30%. It is currently trading at 428p, well below the level THG floated at a little over a year ago. CMC Markets The share price of the financial spread-betting firm run by city tycoon Peter Cruddas has slumped by a quarter over the last year as the boom in lockdown trading tapered off as pandemic restrictions eased. In September, the FTSE 250-listed firm issued a profits warning cutting its forecast of annual earnings by £80m, to between £250m and £280m, although the company says that while trading volumes have lightened overall customer numbers remain up about a third on pre-pandemic levels. And a traditional retailer … Primark-owner ABF With no online shopping service Primark’s business ground to a halt as the pandemic shut its stores. But the pent-up demand for the cheap fast fashion retailer’s clothes has fuelled record busting sales as shoppers return to the physical stores. Early summer sales surpassed pre-pandemic levels with more than half of its stores breaking sales records, with many offering extended opening hours to cash-in on the shopping revival. Parent company ABF’s share price is off just 6% over the last year. Primark’s sales struggled alongside the retail industry as a whole as shoppers stayed at home during the “pingdemic” in June and July. However, the company raised its profit guidance for its year to 18 September, and reassured investors that while it iswas experiencing some supply chain issues there was not going to be an issue of empty racks and shelves heading into the “golden quarter” sales period in the run-up to Christmas."

          "bodyText": "PS: A little more from today’s Nobel prize winners: Time to wrap up: The odds of a UK interest rate rise before the end of the year are increasing, as rising inflation puts more pressure on the Bank of England. Bank of America predicted the BoE would raise interest rates in December, to show that it is taking inflationary pressures seriously. UK gilt yields hit their highest level since May 2019, as the City braced for higher borrowing costs. The pound hit a two-month high against the euro, before worries over the latest Brexit row pulled sterling back. A Deutsche Bank survey found that inflation, and rising bond yields, are the top risk... with many investors fearing that the Bank of England will raise interest rates too soon. Oil prices rallied again, with Brent crude hitting a three-year high of $84 per barrel, as the energy crunch intensified -- helping to push aluminium to a 13-year high. The UK’s supply chain crisis continued to hurt the economy. Consumer confidence hit a five-month low, while business output growth slowed as rising prices, empty shelves and haulage delays hit companies and worried households. The government announced a deal with US fertiliser group CF industries to maintain carbon dioxide supplies... ...but was warned that key industries are on the brink of crisis due to record high energy costs. UK Steel urged Boris Johnson to bang ministers’ heads together to reach a solution. The supply chain has also hit fast fashion chain ASOS, which warned on profits and announced the departure of its CEO today. The Nobel prize for economics has been awarded to David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens for their work on using natural experiments to examine economic systems such as labour markets. Card’s work included a crucial research paper which showed that higher minimum wages needn’t lead to higher unemployment. The World Bank warned that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a “tragic reversal” in development and pushed debt in poor countries to record levels. Struggling giant Evergrande looked set to miss a fresh round of debt repayments worth $148m, and another Chinese property developer pleaded for more time to repay what it owes. Transport campaigners called for domestic flights should be banned and long-distance train fares subsidised. NHS test-and-trace units run by G4S have cut the pay of some workers by up to 5% in the wake of a new contract from the government that specifies they should receive the real living wage. And former chancellor Philip Hammond has added another job to the dozen or so he has taken on since leaving the Treasury in 2019, this time as an adviser to a Mayfair-based cryptocurrency trading firm. Goodnight. GW In the City, the FTSE 100 index has ended the day at its highest closing level in a month. The blue-chip index gained 51 points to finish at 7146 points, up 0.7%. Miners were among the risers, lifted by stronger commodity price, including mining giants Anglo American (+5.2%) and Rio Tinto (+3.5%) and copper producer Antofagasta (+4.2%). Banks also gained ground, lifted by the prospect of higher interest rates, with HSBC gaining 2.6% and Lloyds Banking Group up 2.3%. But Ocado fell by 3.6%, to its lowest level since April 2020, meaning the tech grocer has lost almost a third of its value this year. European markets had a more subdued day, though, as investors summed up the economic picture. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, explains: Traders are sitting on the sidelines today as they still don’t know what to make of last Friday’s US jobs report. The headline non-farm payrolls reading was very disappointing, because only 194,000 jobs were created last month, and that was an enormous miss on the 500,000 that economists were expecting. At the same time, the unemployment rate fell from 5.2% to 4.8% - the lowest mark since the start of the pandemic. In the week that proceeded the jobs report, there was growing speculation the Fed might look to begin tapering its bond buying scheme in the next few months, possibly in January, but the latest employment data muddied the water, hence why volatility is low across the board today. Over in Westminster, business minister Kwasi Kwarteng has submitted a formal bid to the Treasury for assistance to help industries affected by high energy prices. The move follows a string of warnings from steel, glass, ceramics and paper makers, and other sectors, that they could be forced to halt production. The move comes a day after the Treasury slapped down Kwarteng after he suggested he was consulting the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, about support for firms struggling with soaring energy prices. Our Politics Live blog has all the key developments today: Sterling has dipped back from its earlier highs, as the latest Brexit row weighs on the currency, as Raffi Boyadjian of XM explains: Sterling climbed a two-week high of $1.3673 earlier in the session following hawkish remarks over the weekend by Bank of England policymakers. MPC member Michael Saunders warned the British public to expect “significantly earlier” rate hikes, while Governor Andrew Bailey didn’t hide his growing concern about rising inflation. However, the latest rate hike bets have only modestly been boosting the pound as, apart from the supply and fuel shortages that are clouding Britain’s outlook, London and Brussels are facing another standoff over Northern Ireland. The EU will reportedly unveil proposals on Wednesday to reduce checks on the Northern Irish border, but the UK government has already signalled they don’t go far enough. The former chancellor Philip Hammond has added another job to the dozen or so he has taken on since leaving the Treasury in 2019, this time as an adviser to a Mayfair-based cryptocurrency trading firm. Lord Hammond, who also served as foreign secretary and was an early supporter of bitcoin and other digital currencies, joined Copper.co with immediate effect on Monday. The former chancellor, who was said to be one of the wealthiest ever cabinet ministers with a fortune once estimated at £8.2m, has taken up as many as 14 paid and unpaid jobs since leaving politics after a bust-up with Boris Johnson over Brexit. Hammond was last month criticised by Westminster’s lobbying watchdog for using his government connections to assist OakNorth, a bank he is paid to advise. More here: The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a “tragic reversal” in development and pushed debt in poor countries to record levels, the head of the World Bank has said. David Malpass, the bank’s president warned the virus had widened the gap between rich and poor nations, setting back progress by years and, in the case of some countries, by a decade. Announcing new World Bank figures showing the debt burden of more than 70 low-income nations had increased by a record 12% to $860bn (£630bn) in 2020, Malpass called for a comprehensive plan to ease the debt pressures and for rich countries to make vaccines available to the less well-off. He said one particular problem was the lack of a bankruptcy process to help in cases where debts had become unsustainable. Under the current system, companies can declare themselves bankrupt but countries cannot.... More here: Bank of America has predicted that the Bank of England will raise UK interest rates from their current record lows before the end of the year, to show they are taking rising inflation seriously. BofA now expects a 15 basis point rise in December 2021, which would take interest rates up to 0.25%, followed by a 25bp hike in February. BoFA had previously predicted the first rate rise would come in February 2022. But economist Robert Wood told clients that BoE policymakers sound increasingly concerned about inflation expectations de-anchoring, and the persistence of the shock. Wood writes that supply shocks seem to grow by the week, with petrol prices rising amid panic buying and soaring gas prices likely to drive inflation higher too. So, the BoE could decide that an early rate hike would ‘add credibility’, and avoid more hikes later. UK households also face a squeeze in 2022, from tax increases and rising prices in the shops, Wood points out in a BofA Global Research report: With price hikes combined with tax increases the UK consumer may face a real income squeeze of more than 3% of income over the next year. That is likely to have an impact far in excess of that from small rate hikes and is why we expect the BoE to pause after the second hike. So, the decision of when and how fast to hike will be finely balanced.... The size of the real income squeeze and the potential effect of the end of the Furlough Scheme could weigh on medium term inflation. But BoE speakers have so far focused only on inflation rather than the growth risks from recent developments. They appear ready to hike soon. We think the BoE will judge that a 15bp rate rise in the near-term, taking rates to 0.25%, would do little to damage growth but would signal they care about inflation. We choose a December hike because the BoE will have October labour market data at that point, and Saunders noted December pricing. We assume they also in December signal they plan to hike again, to 0.5%, at the February meeting if the post-Furlough labour market data remain strong enough. Global investors are concerned that the Bank of England may raise interest rates too soon. Deutsche Bank’s monthly investor survey found that just 20% of market professionals think the BoE will get its timing right. Around 45% seeing a risk that the UK’s central bank is too hawkish (by hiking borrowing costs before the economy is ready), while only 20% fear it will delay too long. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank were seen as much more likely to leave monetary policy loose for too long - with over 40% of investors fearing the Fed and the ECB will be too dovish. Traders are preparing for the Bank of England to lift borrowing costs by the end of this year, reports Bloomberg: Money markets priced in at least 15 basis points of tightening by the BOE’s December 2021 meeting on Monday, according to sterling overnight index swaps, which would take the key rate to 0.25%. The market was previously betting the first increase would be in February. Michael Saunders, one of the most hawkish members of the Monetary Policy Committee, suggested in remarks published Saturday that investors were right to bring forward bets on rate hikes. Hours earlier, Governor Andrew Bailey warned of a potentially “very damaging” period of inflation unless policy makers take action. Britain’s government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in almost two and a half years, as the City anticipates a rise in interest rates. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year gilts hit 1.2% this morning for the first time since May 2019. That extends their recent surge as energy prices and supply chain problems have intensified inflationary pressures. Bond yields rise when prices fall, and this move suggests that traders believe the Bank of England is more likely to raise interest rates soon, to tame rising inflation. The move comes after Bank policymaker Michael Saunders said UK households should to get ready for “significantly earlier” interest rate rises, and governor Andrew Bailey warned that rising inflation needs to be managed to prevent it from becoming permanently embedded. Mohit Kumar of investment bank Jefferies predicts that inflation could remain higher for longer in the UK than in Eurozone or the US. That’s pushing up gilt yields (and thus the UK’s cost of borrowing). Over the weekend, Saunders (a known hawk) argued that the market was right to bring forward rate hike expectations. Governor Bailey’s comments were also on the hawkish side, suggesting that the BoE should be seen as acting to counter the threat of inflation. Back in the markets, aluminium has hit a new 13-year high, driven by rising energy and raw material costs. Production cuts in China, where power cuts are adding to an anti-pollution drive, are also hitting aluminium supplies and driving up the cost of the widely used metal. Aluminium is extremely widely used, from power lines and consumer electronics to household and industrial appliances, window frames, cans, aeroplane parts and electric cars. Power outages in India amid a coal crunch, and soaring energy costs which forced Dutch aluminium producer Aldel to suspend production last Friday, are also pushing up aluminium. A labour market expert whose work influenced the introduction of the UK’s minimum wage has been named as a joint winner of the Nobel economics prize. David Card, a Canadian-born economist, was one of three US-based academics given the prestigious award for their work on whether economic theory is supported by real-life situations. The trio – Card, Joshua Angrist, an American, and Guido Imbens, from the Netherlands – were cited for their work on natural experiments, which is said to have revolutionised empirical research. Card, who received half the 10m Swedish kronor (£838,000) prize fund, made his name with a paper that studied whether an increase in New Jersey’s minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.25 an hour in 1992 cost jobs in the fast-food industry. Contrary to previous research, Card and his fellow economist Alan Krueger found that employment in New Jersey restaurants increased after the minimum wage was raised. The widely cited paper was seized on by Gordon Brown and his then economics adviser Ed Balls to justify their plans for a UK national minimum wage, which was introduced in 1999. Although there is now cross-party support for the minimum wage, it was initially opposed by the Conservatives on the grounds that it would cost jobs. Krueger, who worked in Barack Obama’s government, died in 2019 before his work could be honoured. Here’s the full story: The academic research of David Card has important implications for UK policymakers, says Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool’s management school. He tells us: Card showed that US wages did not drop in response to immigration. If anything, Card’s work ‘derails’ the arguments of UK government officials who keep on telling us that their ongoing policies will contrast with past ones that decided to reach “for the same old lever of uncontrolled migration to keep wages low”. Prof Milas adds that Card, Angrist and Imbens’s work is all ranked very highly: Among 63,005 registered authors (economists) evaluated for research, popular site RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) ranks David Card 15th in the world. Joshua Angrist is ranked 43rd and Guido Imbens is ranked 45th. Rising inflation and higher bond yields are the number one worry facing investors -- who are also expecting stock markets to post further losses before the end of the year. That’s according to Deutsche Bank’s monthly survey of over 600 market professionals around the world, conducted last week. It found that ‘higher bond yields/inflation’ has shot back up to be the biggest risk to the current relative market stability, along with the risk that central banks commit a policy error (raising interest rates too soon, or too late...) The poll also found that’ weaker growth’ is one of the top three risks for the first time of asking, while direct Covid-19 risks are out of the top 3 for the first time since the pandemic began. A further equity correction before the end of the year remains the consensus now, with 71% expecting shares to fall at least 5% at some point before the year end. Also short term equity sentiment is as negative as it has been since the summer of 2020, points out Deutsche strategist Jim Reid, who conducts the poll. Reid adds: A very overwhelming 84% thought the next 25bps move in 10yr US Treasury yields would be up. Respondents cannot agree on a definition of stagflation, but there is a fairly strong consensus that stagflation of some kind is more likely than not. This is especially true in the UK, where over 50% expect it over the next 12 months. 5yr average inflation expectations continue to increase but not spectacularly. In Europe they have hit 2% for the first time of asking though. On the transitory question, the belief that inflation is permanent is continually edging upward but is still the minority opinion. Only 17% are now fully WFH as office work continues to edge up. The US and Asia still lag Europe. UK consumer confidence has hit its lowest level since lockdown measures were eased back in April. New data from YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) shows that confidence among UK consumers fell significantly in September. The index fell by 2.3 points to 110.5, the weakest since April 2021, as pandemic restrictions were being relaxed. The index also found a sharp fall in the number of people who expect their household finances to improve, rather than worsen, over the next 12 months. This metric plummeted into negative territory last month, from 101.5 to 90.9. That’s the second largest decrease on record, trumped only the 16.5 point fall seen in March last year when COVID-19 hit. Sentiment among households about their finances in the past 30 days also grew more negative in September (down 5.5 points to 89.6), as consumers struggled with empty supermarket shelves, fuel shortages and rising prices. Sentiment among homeowners remained stable despite stamp duty cut ending, but expectations of job security and business activity worsened last month. The recent gains in consumer confidence this summer have been wiped out by rising inflation, and the gas and petrol crisis. Darren Yaxley, Direct of Reputation Research at YouGov, says: “The past few months of rising prices, bill increases and a fuel crisis brought on by labour shortages have decimated Britons’ confidence in their personal finances for the coming year, meaning Brits are less and less confident that that their household finances will improve.” Kay Neufeld, Head of Forecasting and Thought Leadership, adds that cutting universal credit this month (by £1,000 per year) is also hitting confidence. “September’s drop in the Consumer Confidence Index comes as no surprise following a month of headline-dominating crises, from the spike in gas prices and energy providers going bust to the recent fuel shortages and empty supermarket shelves. While inflation has been on the rise for a while, the effects have started to become more tangible in recent weeks for the average consumer, further exacerbated by the termination of several government pandemic support schemes such as the Universal Credit uplift and the furlough scheme. The largest decreases in this month’s index were recorded in the household finance measures, with consumers concerned about the erosion of their purchasing power through higher inflation. Decreases in the business activity and the forward-looking job security measures further confirm that the economic recovery has hit a speed bump.” The British steel industry’s lobby group warned on Monday of an impending crisis due to soaring wholesale energy prices, Reuters reports. Without help, plants could be forced into expensive shutdowns, stoke emissions and sow chaos through supply chains, UK Steel fears. A shortage of natural gas in Europe had sent prices for electricity and gas soaring, triggering sharp rises in the prices paid by people heating their homes or for major heavy industrial plants smelting steel. UK Steel, which lobbies on behalf of the British steel industry, said in a briefing document: “These extraordinary electricity prices are leading to smaller or wiped-out profits and thus to less reinvestment,” “With winter approaching, demand for gas and electricity will rise, and prices could get higher, which will make it impossible to profitably make steel.” UK Steel argues that the government could help by providing a fixed amount of capacity at a competitive price or a virtual interconnector. Unless the government helps, “the consequences will be dire for our industry,” it said. More here. Back in the UK’s supply chain crisis...the carbon dioxide industry in Britain has struck an agreement to ensure businesses have a sustainable supply, even as energy prices spike. Under the deal, CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers, a US company, a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high. Announcing the deal, the government says it reflects the vital importance of CO2 to everything from nuclear industry and hospitals to the food and beverage industry CF Fertilisers produces around 60% of Britain’s commercial CO2 requirements. It caused panic last month when it halted work at two UK fertiliser plans (which also produce CO2) after energy prices soared, prompting the government to provide funding to prevent CO2 supplies running out. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says the deal ensures UK businesses have access to a sustainable supply of CO2. Today’s agreement means that critical industries can have confidence in their supplies of CO2 over the coming months without further taxpayer support. The government acted quickly to provide CF Fertilisers with the support it needed to kick-start production, and give us enough breathing space to agree a longer-term, more sustainable solution. I would like to thank all the parties involved in this agreement who have recognised the importance of avoiding supply disruptions and delivering for UK businesses and consumers. Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens’s work includes a study from the mid-1990s into the causal relationship between education and income. It examined under what conditions a natural experiment can be used to estimate the effects of a particular intervention, such as a computing course, when the effects vary between individuals and the academics do not have complete control of who participates. Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences explains: Somewhat simplified, we can imagine a natural experiment as if it randomly divides individuals into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group is entitled to participate in a programme while the control group is not. Angrist and Imbens showed that it is possible to estimate the effect of the programme by applying a two-step process (known as the instrumental variables method). The first step investigates how the natural experiment affects the probability of programme participation. The second step then considers this probability when evaluating the effect of the actual programme. Given a few assumptions, which Imbens and Angrist formulated and discussed in detail, the researchers can thus estimate the impact of the programme, even when there is no information about who was actually affected by the natural experiment. One important conclusion is that it is only possible to estimate the effect among the people who changed their behaviour as a result of the natural experiment. This implies that Angrist and Krueger’s conclusion about the effect on income of an additional year of education – which they estimated to be nine per cent – only applies to those people who actually chose to leave school when given the chance. It is not possible to determine which individuals are included in this group, but we can determine its size. The effect for this group has been named the local average treatment effect, LATE. David Card also created an important natural experiment into the impact of immigration on the jobs markets: In April 1980, Fidel Castro unexpectedly allowed all Cubans who wished to leave the country to do so. Between May and September, 125,000 Cubans emigrated to the US. Many of them settled in Miami, which entailed an increase in the Miami labour force of around seven per cent. To examine how this huge influx of workers affected the labour market in Miami, David Card compared the wage and employment trends in Miami with the evolution of wages and employment in four comparison cities. Despite the enormous increase in labour supply, Card found no negative effects for Miami residents with low levels of education. Wages did not fall and unemployment did not increase relative to the other cities. This study generated large amounts of new empirical work, and we now have a better understanding of the effects of immigration. Nobel laureate David Card’s work included a hugely influential paper, with fellow economist Alan Krueger, in the early 1990s whether higher minimum wages led to more unemployment. Card and Krueger used a natural experiment, to analyse the impact of New Jersey lifting its minimum hourly wage from $4.25 to $5.05. The conventional wisdom among economists was that higher minimum wages lead to lower employment because they increase wage costs for businesses -- but the evidence of such a causal link was not fully convincing. Just studying what happened in New Jersey after this increase wouldn’t show the impact, so the pair used a control group where wages didn’t change but all the other factors were the same. So they chose fast food restaurants -- an industry where pay is low and minimum wages matter --- and compared those in New Jersey against those over the state border in Pennsylvania, Contrary to previous research, they found that an increase in the minimum wage had no effect on the number of employees. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences explain: David Card arrived at the same conclusion in a couple of studies in the early 1990s. This pioneering research has led to a large number of followup studies. The overall conclusion is that the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage are small, and significantly smaller than was believed 30 years ago. More details here: Card and Krueger research’s was used by Gordon Brown and Ed Balls to refute claims that New Labour’s minimum wage would cost jobs (our economics editor Larry Elliott reminds me). Card and Krueger ran another important experiment, into whether school resources have an impact on students’ future labour market success, To do this, they compared the returns on education for people who lived in the same state in the US, but who had grown up in different states – for example, people who had grown up in Alabama or Iowa, but now lived in California. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences explains: The idea is that people who have moved to California and have the same level of education are comparable. If the returns on education differ, this is probably due to Alabama and Iowa having invested differently in their education systems. Card and Krueger found that resources are important: returns on education increased with teacher density in the state in which the individuals had grown up. Alan Krueger went on to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, and chaired Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers from late 2011 to August 2013, as the US emerged from the great recession. Sadly, Alan Krueger died in 2019 so wasn’t eligible for today’s award, but he’s being warmly remembered today, as another driving force in the credibility revolution. David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens have been rightly recognised for their leading roles in economics’ “credibility revolution”, says economics professor Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan: The 2021 Nobel prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded to three economists, for their work using natural experiments to answer important questions - such as the impact of the minimum wages, immigration or spending another year at school on a person’s income. Half of the award goes to David Card, of the University of California, Berkeley, “for his empirical contributions to labour economics” The other half is shared jointly between Joshua D. Angrist, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA, and Guido W. Imbens, of Stanford University, USA, “for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships” The award explains that the trio all used natural experiments to tackle big questions about cause and effect. Assessing how immigrations affect pay and employment levels, or the impact of longer education on someone’s future income, because you don’t have the alternative scenario as a comparison. So the solution is to use natural experiments – situations arising in real life that resemble randomised experiments. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, who award the prize, explain: Using natural experiments, David Card has analysed the labour market effects of minimum wages, immigration and education. His studies from the early 1990s challenged conventional wisdom, leading to new analyses and additional insights. The results showed, among other things, that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs. We now know that the incomes of people who were born in a country can benefit from new immigration, while people who immigrated at an earlier time risk being negatively affected. We have also realised that resources in schools are far more important for students’ future labour market success than was previously thought. Data from a natural experiment are difficult to interpret, however. For example, extending compulsory education by a year for one group of students (but not another) will not affect everyone in that group in the same way. Some students would have kept studying anyway and, for them, the value of education is often not representative of the entire group. So, is it even possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of an extra year in school? In the mid-1990s, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens solved this methodological problem, demonstrating how precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee, says the trio’s work has been of great benefit. “Card’s studies of core questions for society and Angrist and Imbens’ methodological contributions have shown that natural experiments are a rich source of knowledge. Their research has substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit to society. Incidentally, the award isn’t one of the original Nobel prizes. It was created by the Swedish central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, in 1968, but is still the most prestigious award in economics. Card, Angrist and Imbens will share a prize worth 10m Swedish crowns (£838,000). Wholesale gas prices are rising this morning, with the UK next-day delivery contract up 7% at 209p per therm. That’s below last week’s record highs, when it struck 355p per therm, but still much higher than normal (back in January it was around 60p per therm). Here’s some reaction to the news that ASOS’s profits are being squeezed by supply chain problems, and that CEO Nick Beighton is leaving. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears the fashion retailer’s supply chain woes will continue: “ASOS has enjoyed a huge boost to trading over lockdowns, albeit for less-lucrative casual wear as its core demographic was stuck at home. A reluctance to leave the house meant return rates were lower, resulting in XL margins. However, the tailwinds are easing and the ASOS bubble has burst. Higher labour and freight costs are just one problem, but ASOS has also had trouble getting hold of the right stock, so in some cases, although demand has strengthened, the group couldn’t meet it. Supply chain problems are going to continue for the foreseeable future, which is some explanation for why next year’s sales outlook is so disappointing. ASOS is a huge player in the world of online shopping, but the pandemic has chivvied a lot of its bricks and mortar rivals to up their own digital offerings, so it will need to peddle hard to keep growing market share. This bump in the road comes as there’s a change in leadership at the top, adding a layer of strategic risk.” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says the scale of the problems at ASOS appear to have been underestimated: Nick Beighton had risen through the ranks of ASOS in his 12 years with the company, moving from chief financial officer to a dual role as chief operating officer and numbers man, and then CEO in 2015. “He took the top job just as the fast fashion movement was really going places, but that success also brought in more competition and the big players in the industry had to spend big on marketing to keep their brand front and centre for consumers. “Cost inflation is a problem affecting multiple industries, so not something that can be blamed on Nick Beighton. But he appears to have lost his position in the company due to a struggle to sustain momentum in the business. “ASOS seems to have found it hard to keep up with the fast fashion movement in recent years, coming under criticism for not being able to turn around new product designs quickly, experiencing warehouse problems and poor stock availability. ASOS chairman Adam Crozier has told Reuters that Beighton is departing because he wouldn’t commit to stay for at least half of the group’s next five-year plan. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Beighton’s exit is a loss for ASOS: Asos shares tumbled this morning as CEO Nick Beighton steps down and the company warned of continued supply chain problems. Revenues also missed expectations, but undoubtedly the departure of Beighton, who has steered the company through an incredible period of growth, is a contributing factor. A big loss for the company. The search is on for a successor who can deliver £7bn of annual revenue within the next 3 to 4 years. Annual results were impressive with sales growth of +22% and profits +36%, but expectations for the next year are being massaged down to 10-15% with first half sales in mid-single digits. Asos is not wasting this supply chain crisis to lower the bar. Heathrow is still a lot quieter than before the pandemic, but is hoping that the easing of travel restrictions will provide a boost. The UK’s largest airport reported this morning that September passenger levels were below 40% of pre-pandemic levels. Just 2.6 million people travelled through the west London airport in September, compared with 6.8 million during the same month in 2019. That’s partly due to a slump in North American traffic due to the US ban on arrivals (which is now being lifted), as Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, flags; John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow’s chief executive officer, told Sky News that there is still a “long way to go”. The UK is still taking a cautious approach, Holland-Kaye says, compared to European rivals who have opened up much more widely. He welcomes the reduction on the ‘red list’ to just seven countries, calling it a “good step ahead” that will help people plans business trips and holidays again. “The UK is still taking a cautious approach, still requiring testing for anyone coming into the country, but this is a good step ahead and people can start to plan their business trips, their holidays, visiting the families they haven’t seen for a long time, with confidence, including going to wonderful places like South Africa.” Shares in fast fashion group ASOS have tumbled almost 15% to their lowest in over a year, after it warned that supply chain disruption will hit its profits this financial year. ASOS also surprised the City by announcing that chief executive Nick Beighton was stepping down. ASOS reported that adjusted profits jumped 36% in the financial year to 31st August, to £193.6m. But it also predicted that adjusted earnings in the current financial year will drop to between £110m and £140m -- which would be a fall of up to 40%. ASOS said it faces “notable cost headwinds” including rising freight costs bringing goods into the UK, Brexit duty, labour cost inflation, and outbound delivery costs. ASOS shares have dropped to £23.70, the lowest since May 2020, having hit nearly £60 back in March this year. Mat Dunn, ASOS’s CFO, will lead the business on a day-to-day basis while a new CEO is found. Nick Beighton said: “I have enjoyed every moment of my 12 years at ASOS. When I joined, there were fewer than 200 people and we had annual sales of around £220m. I leave a business reporting turnover of almost £4bn, with more than 3,000 fantastic ASOS-ers delivering for 26 million customers in 200 markets around the world. I am particularly proud of the way in which we have led our industry on putting sustainability at the heart of everything we do with our Fashion with Integrity programme. I wish Mat and the rest of the team well for the next phase of the ASOS journey. Britain’s steel industry did receive one piece of good news overnight. The owner of Liberty Steel has pledged to restart its plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire this month, saving the “substantial majority” of 1,000 jobs, by pumping £50m in cash into the business. The move comes after Sanjeev Gupta’s conglomerate, GFG Alliance, said it had refinanced debts at its Australian steel and mining business. The struggling group is understood to have repaid about a third of total debt of Liberty Primary Metals Australia, which includes a mining and steel business in Whyalla and a coalmine at Tahmoor, using cashflow from its reviving business. The plan is to gradually repay the rest of the debt by June 2023 to key lenders Credit Suisse and the collapsed Greensill Capital. Previously, the debt was expected to be repaid next year. More here: Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, has called on the Prime Minister to “bang ministerial heads together” and take control to avoid an industry crisis hitting his sector. Mr Stace said the steel sector delivers “100%” for Boris Johnson’s vision to level up the economy. It creates highly skilled, high wage jobs -- paying 45% more than the average in the regions where it operates, he says. Stace told LBC: “This is a critical time. The Business Secretary has also said it’s a critical situation, and therefore why is Government just sitting on its hands and doing absolutely nothing at the moment? “From my point of view, today, with the reported Government infighting between the Treasury and BEIS, the Prime Minister now needs to bang ministerial heads together, take control and remember that if he does nothing, then his levelling-up ambition will be left in tatters.” Otherwise, Stace warned, the energy crisis will turn into an industry crisis, as factories are forced to shut down because they cannot afford their gas and electricity bills. Stace also argued that the PM shouldn’t be on holiday (in Marbella) during the energy crisis, but should be taking action to address the ‘exorbitant’ energy costs which firms are facing. “I’m sure he can get on the phone and get talking to them but to my mind, now is not the time for a prime minister to be on holiday, from the steel sector point of view.” Stace wants Britain to copy other European countries, such as Italy, and remove some of the overheads added to bills which put UK at a ‘competitive disadvantage’ against European counterparts. Financial markets were braced for more bad news about the shaky Chinese property market as struggling giant Evergrande looked set to miss a fresh round of debt repayments worth $148m, and another developer pleaded for more time to repay what it owes. China Evergrande Group missed two coupon payment deadlines last month worth $131m amid widespread concern of huge losses as the developer wrestles with more than $300bn in liabilities. Expectations are slim that the company will make the semi-annual payments on its April 2022, April 2023 and April 2024 offshore bonds, which are due at midnight New York time on Monday. It is expected the company will prioritises local Chinese creditors and completing the building of about 1.6m homes it has taken the money for but is yet to finish. More here: The pound is rising this morning, as traders ponder whether inflationary pressures will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Sterling has gained half a cent against the US dollar to $1.367, its highest level in two weeks. Against the euro, sterling has hit a two-month high of €1.18, a level last seen in mid-August. The rally comes after a Bank of England policymaker warned households to get ready for “significantly earlier” interest rate rises as inflation pressures mount, and Kraft Heinz became the latest company to say that food prices will rise. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Michael Saunders, one of the Bank’s nine rate-setters, said investors were right to bet on faster increases in borrowing costs with consumer price inflation on course to rise above 4%, adding to signs Threadneedle Street might become the first major central bank to raise rates since the coronavirus pandemic struck. “I’m not in favour of using code words or stating our intentions in advance of the meeting too precisely. The decisions get taken at the proper time,” Saunders said in an interview with the Telegraph. “But markets have priced in over the last few months an earlier rise in Bank rate than previously and I think that’s appropriate.” His comments come as households face mounting energy bills and the prospect of higher food prices. The boss of Kraft Heinz said on Sunday the company, the maker of Heinz tomato ketchup and baked beans, was putting up prices in several countries. “We are raising prices, where necessary, around the world,” Miguel Patricio told the BBC, adding there were a number of reasons behind the rises. Governor Andrew Bailey weighed in too over the weekend, telling The Yorkshire Post newspaper that inflation is likely to head higher, and that the Bank faces a “very delicate and challenging job” managing its longer-term impact on the economy. Another sign of the energy crunch: The oil price has climbed to new multi-year highs this morning, as inflationary pressures build. Brent crude has jumped by 1.3% this morning to around $83.50 per barrel, the highest since October 2018. US crude has hit a new seven-year high, at $80.70 per barrel for the first time since 2014. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says the global energy crunch is pushing oil higher, shaking off worries about slowing growth. The barrel of US crude is now trading above the $80 level and given the global energy crunch and a cautious OPEC, there is little that could halt the positive trend, other than worsening growth expectations. In this respect Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecast from 5.7% to 5.6% for this year and from 4.4% to 4% for the next. But on the other hand, India warned that it has no more than a couple of days worth of coal reserves left, German fuel reserves are running out of fuel, and China unloaded an Australian coal shipment despite an important ban on Australian imports, and their morose relationship of nowadays. All in all, it looks like the oil bears are good for hibernating… bad news for inflation. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the UK supply chain crisis and business. The UK’s supply chain crisis is hitting businesses and consumer confidence, as worries over inflation, the energy crisis and HGV driver shortages mount. Output growth across UK businesses slowed for the fifth month running in September, hitting its lowest levels since the lockdown in March, according to accountancy and business advisory firm BDO LLP. BDO’s latest Business Trends report shows that supply chain disruption and staff shortages are undermining the prospects for an economic recovery, with both manufacturing and services firms reporting a slowdown. And in a worrying sign for households, BDO’s Consumer Inflation Index jumped to a 10-year high in September, pushed up by surging energy and fuel. That suggests consumers face rising prices over the coming months, as firms pass on costs to customers. Kaley Crossthwaite, partner at BDO LLP, says the UK’s acute labour shortages and supply chain disruption are weighing heavily on productivity: Ultimately, this could mean consumers end up paying more for less this winter. Many businesses are caught between a rock and a hard place. Long-term planning for a post-pandemic and post-Brexit economy is crucial, but the significant challenges at their door make it increasingly difficult to focus beyond these short-term issues. The Chancellor’s autumn Budget will be watched closely later this month to see whether the government steps in to restore the confidence felt through the summer.” Consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level this year, PwC reports this morning. PwC’s latest gauge of morale found that rising in inflation, and concerns over supply chains and out-of-stocks, have pulled optimism down last month. Sentiment fell across almost every age category, region, and demographic, showing that people are beginning to feel uneasy about their financial security. This pulled the index back to pre-pandemic levels (at +3, slightly more respondents thought they would be better off in the next 12 months than worse off.). A majority of those surveyed said they’d seen empty shelves at supermarkets, and they expect stock shortages to worsen as we approach Christmas. The survey also found a drop-off in spending intention on big-ticket items, such as furniture and household appliances, with the number of people expecting to spend less outnumbering those who expect to spend more by 3 to 1 -- another sign that consumer optimism has eased. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets lead at PwC, warned that the next few weeks will be “make or break”: The inflationary factors that have triggered the decline in sentiment are unlikely to ease in the short term, particularly for grocery, utilities and petrol. Combined with the current problems facing those industries in relation to supply, we’re beginning to see it affecting consumers’ day-to-day lives and, in turn, sentiment and demand. “For both retail and leisure sectors, the timing couldn’t be worse. After the disappointment of last year, retailers and hospitality operators desperately need a strong run up to Christmas. Even without lockdowns, they will need to convince consumers to part with savings to have any hope of recovering to pre-pandemic levels. For many, the coming weeks will be make or break: can the driver shortages be addressed and supply chain pressures eased? When will the crisis at the petrol pumps be resolved? And will higher energy prices cause more widespread inflationary pressures and a reluctance from consumers to spend?” Yesterday, the Treasury rebuked business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, after he suggested he was consulting the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, about support for firms struggling with soaring energy prices. Representatives from firms in key industries including steel and paper are said to have told Kwarteng at a meeting on Friday that many are “days away” from having to halt production because of spiralling costs. A source said the business secretary had asked his team to help with work on an agreed list of proposals that could be passed on to the Treasury in the next few days. However, Treasury sources denied the department had yet received any proposals or even discussions about support for ailing essential industries, despite claims made by Kwarteng to broadcasters on Sunday morning. Also coming up today, the Nobel prize in economic sciences will be awarded. The AFP newswire say that macroeconomics, health and labour markets are some of the topics which could be rewarded, with a number of women in with a chance of scooping the traditionally male-dominated prize: American Anne Krueger, formerly the number two and briefly the managing director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as a former Vice President for Economics and Research at the World Bank, is one possible winner. Her compatriot Claudia Goldin, whose research has focused on inequality and the female labour force, is another favourite to become the third woman to receive the prize. Other potential female winners are fellow American Janet Currie, known for her work on the impact of government anti-poverty programmes on children, or Belgian labour economist Marianne Bertrand and American microeconomist Susan Athey, who was the first woman to win the prestigious John Bates Clark Medal in 2007.

          "bodyText": "The Treasury has issued an extraordinary reprimand to the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, after he suggested he was consulting the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, about support for firms struggling with soaring energy prices. Representatives from firms in key industries including steel and paper are said to have told Kwarteng at a meeting on Friday that many are “days away” from having to halt production because of spiralling costs. A source said the business secretary had asked his team to help with work on an agreed list of proposals that could be passed on to the Treasury in the next few days. However, Treasury sources denied the department had yet received any proposals or even discussions about support for ailing essential industries, despite claims made by Kwarteng to broadcasters on Sunday morning. Kwarteng was accused of “making things up” when he said he and Sunak were considering the options. A chastened Kwarteng was forced to change approach mid-way through his broadcast round. One industry boss who attended the meeting with Kwarteng on Friday said the business secretary had at first seemed blase about the potential problems for industry, suggesting soaring energy prices were temporary and driven by the weather. However, after pressure from businesses, which said they were likely to be forced to suspend production if costs continued to remain high, he had promised to examine their suggestions and ask the Treasury to consider some of their demands. These include reducing green levies and a request that the energy regulator, Ofgem, replicated the network tariff discounts offered to competitor industries in the EU. But sources close to the chancellor cautioned the business secretary against making any promises to companies and said there had been no approach to the Treasury. Kwarteng had suggested that struggling companies would not get much more support from the Treasury, saying he was liaising with Sunak but did not expect “billions” more in subsidies. One Treasury source said it was wrong to suggest the pair were already in discussions about potential support. “Kwasi was mistaken. The facts are that, to date, the Treasury and the chancellor have not been involved in any talks on this topic,” the source said. The source did not rule out any further support but said the Treasury could not assess what may be necessary without seeing proposals. A source close to Kwarteng said work was under way after the meeting with businesses, while proposals were examined. The companies are also reported to have requested potential subsidies, as well as putting forward suggestions for a cap on gas prices, though it is understood both the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury see that suggestion as far too complex, backed by Ofgem. However, Kwarteng said on Sunday he had not asked for significant further support from the Treasury. “I’ve not asked for billions. We’ve got existing schemes. I’m working very closely with Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, to get us through this situation,” he said. Kwarteng told Sky it was clear some businesses did need short-term help. “What I’m very clear about is we need to help them get through this situation – it’s a difficult situation, gas prices, electricity prices are at very high levels right across the world and of course I’m speaking to government colleagues particularly in the Treasury to try and see a way through this,” he said. When he was asked on the BBC whether it was definitive that those industries would get more support, Kwarteng said: “No … we already have existing support and we’re looking to see if that’s sufficient to get us through this situation.” Treasury sources briefed that Kwarteng was overreaching with his comments about negotiations with Sunak – and then the business secretary told Times Radio there had been no specific request. Kwarteng said he had not “asked him for anything” but that his department was “always in conversation with the Treasury”. Labour said the cabinet split showed there was no direction at the top of government to help business in crisis – as it was also revealed that Boris Johnson was to spend the next week holidaying in Marbella. “In the teeth of a crisis of its own making, the government has put its out-of-office on. The prime minister has gone on holiday, no one knows where the chancellor is, and this morning we understand the business secretary has entered the realms of fantasy,” said the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson. “The two key government departments responsible for the current cost-of-living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce. If government ministers can’t even tell the truth about each other, then what hope do we have for the challenges facing our country?” In his interview, Kwarteng suggested removing green levies was an unattractive option. “We need to double down on the age of transition. We need to invest in hydrogen as we’re doing and get a better diversity of supply away from fossil fuels and that’s exactly where we’re going.” The price of wholesale gas has risen 250% since January, leaving many businesses in crisis because many have not fixed their purchase prices and there is no energy price cap for companies, unlike for consumers. The UK’s steel makers warned the government that failure to take action could lead to long-term damage to the industry. Gareth Stace, the director general of the UK Steel trade body, said some companies had already been forced to suspend production even though the market for steel was “incredibly healthy”. He said: “Failure to [take action] may result in long-term damage to the future of the steel industry in the UK. Heading into the winter months, increasing prices could result in extended shutdowns, damage to equipment, loss of export opportunities and market share at home, and a loss of talent and employment.” Other energy intensive industries, including glassmakers and ceramics producers, said the government needed to take “prompt and preventative measures” to avoid the spread to other sectors."

          "headline": "Facebook whistleblower testimony should prompt new oversight – Schiff",
          "bodyText": "Testimony in Congress this week by the whistleblower Frances Haugen should prompt action to implement meaningful oversight of Facebook and other tech giants, the influential California Democrat Adam Schiff told the Guardian in an interview to be published on Sunday. “I think we need regulation to protect people’s private data,” the chair of the House intelligence committee said. “I think we need to narrow the scope of the safe harbour these companies enjoy if they don’t moderate their contents and continue to amplify anger and hate. I think we need to insist on a vehicle for more transparency so we understand the data better.” Haugen, 37, was the source for recent Wall Street Journal reporting on misinformation spread by Facebook and Instagram, the photo-sharing platform which Facebook owns. She left Facebook in May this year, but her revelations have left the tech giant facing its toughest questions since the Cambridge Analytica user privacy scandal. At a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Haugen shared internal Facebook reports and argued that the social media giant puts “astronomical profits before people”, harming children and destabilising democracy via the sharing of inaccurate and divisive content. Haugen likened the appeal of Instagram to tobacco, telling senators: “It’s just like cigarettes … teenagers don’t have good self-regulation.” Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said Haugen’s testimony might represent a “big tobacco” moment for the social media companies, a reference to oversight imposed despite testimony in Congress that their product was not harmful from executives whose companies knew that it was. The founder and head of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has resisted proposals to overhaul the US internet regulatory framework, which is widely considered to be woefully out of date. He responded to Haugen’s testimony by saying the “idea that we prioritise profit over safety and wellbeing” was “just not true”. “The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,” he said. “We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don’t want their ads next to harmful or angry content.” Schiff was speaking to mark publication of a well-received new memoir, Midnight in Washington: How We Almost Lost Our Democracy and Still Could. The Democrat played prominent roles in the Russia investigation and Donald Trump’s first impeachment. He now sits on the select committee investigating the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January, by Trump supporters seeking to overturn his election defeat – an effort in part fueled by misinformation on social media. In his book, Schiff writes about asking representatives of Facebook and two other tech giants, Twitter and YouTube, if their “algorithms were having the effect of balkanising the public and deepening the divisions in our society”. Facebook’s general counsel in the 2017 hearing, Schiff writes, said: “The data on this is actually quite mixed.” “It didn’t seem very mixed to me,” Schiff says. Asked if he thought Haugen’s testimony would create enough pressure for Congress to pass new laws regulating social media companies, Schiff told the Guardian: “The answer is yes.” However, as an experienced member of a bitterly divided and legislatively sclerotic Congress, he also cautioned against too much optimism among reform proponents. “If you bet against Congress,” Schiff said, “you win 90% of the time.”"

          "headline": "Covid bereaved voice anguish at ‘ignored’ UK virus planning report",
          "bodyText": "Families bereaved by Covid have expressed pain at revelations that a government exercise modelling a large-scale coronavirus outbreak recommended four years before the pandemic that better preparations were needed in key areas including building stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE) and a contact-tracing system. Following the Guardian’s revelations about the previously confidential report on Exercise Alice, the Liberal Democrats have questioned the credibility of Jeremy Hunt, who was health secretary at the time of the exercise, in co-leading an inquiry into lessons from the pandemic, which reports next week. “Our loved ones might still be with us today if only the government had followed their own recommendations,” said Lobby Akinnola, the spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, which represents more than 4,000 bereaved families. Exercise Alice war-gamed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers-CoV) arriving in London and Birmingham and spreading rapidly. The findings warned of the need for stockpiles of PPE, a computerised contact-tracing system and screening for overseas travel. “For the tens of thousands of families that lost loved ones as a direct consequence of the lack of PPE, ineffectual contact-tracing systems or the failures in screening for foreign travel, this news is extremely painful,” Akinnola said. “We can’t help asking what is the point in the Department of Health carrying out these exercises if they’re just going to ignore them when a crisis actually hits?” The Department of Health has said Mers differed from Covid-19 and that “the results of Exercise Alice have been incorporated into ongoing planning work”. But Labour said the emergence of the report, which warned of actions to prepare for a potentially fatal coronavirus that spreads asymptomatically and attacks respiratory systems, showed “devastating incompetence at the top of government with the most tragic of consequences”. “Ministers were complacent, hubristic and asleep despite the warning signs,” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. “What’s more, years of Tory cutbacks left us with a weakened NHS lacking the beds and staff numbers needed when the crisis hit.” Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, sent the revelations would prompt doubts about Hunt’s role in the report being published on Tuesday following a joint inquiry by the Commons health committee, which Hunt chairs, and the science committee. “It is increasingly clear that one of the reasons we have such a high death rate, the reason we failed on test and trace, the reason we had such a tragic crisis in our care homes is that, on Jeremy Hunt’s watch as health secretary the government failed to prepare,” Davey said. “Can we really trust Jeremy Hunt to tell the public one lesson we have to learn is that he got it wrong?” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton who had been pushing for the report to be released in parliament, said: “We now know beyond any doubt that there was an utter lack of preparedness by this government against virtually every basic measure to keep people as safe as possible in the event of a pandemic – and that they ignored warning after warning of the likely consequences. The promised public inquiry into the handling of the pandemic should be expanded in scope, with its interim findings made available before the next general election.” The government initially refused to release the report under the Freedom of Information Act to Dr Moosa Qureshi, a clinician and transparency campaigner, arguing it could “lead to loss of public confidence in the government’s and the NHS’s Covid-19 response … based on misinterpretation of the report.”"

          "headline": "Gaven Morris signing off: ABC news chief’s parting words to staff and ‘small media’ rivals",
          "bodyText": "Outgoing ABC news chief Gaven Morris says he has had a consistent message for the 1,200 journalists under his watch these past six years. “One of the things that I’ve encouraged staff to do constantly is not to look at small media mouthpieces that have an agenda; and look at the impact that we have with our audience,” Morris told Raf Epstein on ABC Melbourne hours after announcing his resignation. Those “small media mouthpieces” are in the main the Australian and Sky News, the ABC’s biggest critics who both have niche audiences, and prosecute Rupert Murdoch’s agenda to see the ABC privatised. “And what I would say to our staff and our teams: look at the broader impact we have on the Australian public,” Morris, 49, said. “The Australian public often don’t think in the way that Sky News might think. And so, focus on the needs of the audience, focus on the feedback, and the respect and the dedication we have from our audience. That’s what matters a lot more to me than the media organisations that might have a preset agenda.” Morris was responsible for Four Corners, 7.30, TV and radio news, documentaries, ABC online and the news channel, so there was a lot of pressure. Sometimes it came from within, from journalists not happy with his decisions, as in the recent delay of the program about Scott Morrison and a supporter of QAnon, and sometimes it even came from the ABC board, which famously called for him to sack political correspondent Andrew Probyn. Morris, who started as a copyboy on the Sydney Morning Herald in Canberra before landing a dream job as a reporter on ABC TV’s 1990s youth program Attitude, also had to take the blame when shows were axed: notably the historic 7.45am radio bulletin and TV’s Lateline. He says the hardest part is not deciding what to do but deciding “what not to do” with limited resources. “One of the hardest parts of a role like this in the ABC is so much of what we all do is precious to people and has a lot of heritage wrapped up in it.” Morris told Michael Rowland on ABC News Breakfast that he has no regrets about the corporation’s reporting on Christian Porter’s historic rape allegations, which Porter denies, or the Ghost Train documentary about the Luna Park fire. “I really don’t,” he said on Friday morning. “I think the journalism we did around those stories was first-class. We’ve not changed a word of those stories. They are still available for anyone to see and to read.” Cold reception The new New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet has been told in no uncertain terms he is not welcome on one of the state’s most popular media platforms, the Kyle and Jackie O Show. Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O host the top-rating breakfast program on KIIS, and have provided some lucky politicians access to their listeners, including Perrottet’s predecessor Gladys Berejiklian and recently Scott Morrison when he wanted to address rumours about Engadine Maccas. “How can someone run a state like New South Wales and be anti-abortion and anti-gay rights,” Sandilands asked on Wednesday during a conversation with a psychic. “Oh well he’s out in my books then. “Oh this guy’s gotta go. He’s never allowed on the show guys, just so you know. He’s not allowed, I don’t want that rubbish!” Jackie O said it was “gutting” to hear Berejiklian would be replaced. “Honestly a person like that to replace Gladys, oh my God,” she said. Splendid isolation The journalists who travelled with the prime minister on his trip to the US last month will come out of 14-day quarantine at midnight on Sunday. The correspondents all made individual arrangements – sanctioned by ACT health – perhaps staying in a granny flat at home where they could isolate from family, or renting an Airbnb or staying in Defence accommodation. They all kept working, making unique arrangements to keep filing despite the restrictions, and had regular health checks and tests. Seven’s Mark Riley and cameraman Steve Quick quarantined together, setting up a mini studio in their temporary lounge room and broadcasting live pictures that some Seven executives thought looked better than the studio ones. SBS’s Anna Henderson was able to quarantine at home in a separate granny flat, while doing live crosses to the SBS World News. The Australian’s national editor Dennis Shanahan went straight into quarantine in the ACT on his return from the US. “I have been monitored daily by ACT health and had a full schedule of Covid tests administered by a doctor like everyone else on the trip as far as I am aware. I have not left quarantine and won’t until after midnight on Sunday pending a final negative test.” Python prompt Ballina Shire councillor Keith Williams found himself the centre of media attention this week when he posted pictures on Twitter of a giant snake in his kitchen on the NSW north coast. He found it rather disappointing as he has been trying to get the media to pay attention to his attempts to clean up the Richmond River for almost a decade. A big snake is always going to grab the media’s attention. “I’ve been asked to appear on ABC News Breakfast tomorrow to chat about my snake experience,” Williams said. “Not my nine-year freakin slog to clean up the Richmond River, or anything useful like that. Sigh. But you know I’m gonna do it anyway.” After his chat, Williams thanked the Breakfast team “for giving me 30 secs to rant on my favourite topic, the health of the Richmond River. Woohoo!” Valentine’s breakfast date James Valentine has been named as the replacement for Wendy Harmer and Robbie Buck who will be leaving ABC Sydney Breakfast in December. The former ABC Weekend Breakfast host Josh Szeps will move to the Afternoons program, which Valentine has hosted for 20 years. The breakfast slot is being shortened by an hour and will run from 6.15am-8am, then break for AM and return until 9am. “When I first worked at the station in the mid-90s, it was Clive Robertson, then Phil Clarke, with Andrew Olle on afterwards. Angela Catterns, Adam Spencer, Wendy and Robbie – that’s a legacy to build on and I’m excited and grateful for the opportunity,” Valentine said."

          "headline": "Calls for investigation after court finds Dubai ruler hacked ex-wife’s phone",
          "bodyText": "MPs and human rights groups have called on ministers and parliament to investigate how the ruler of Dubai was able deploy sophisticated spyware to hack the phones of his ex-wife and her legal team in Britain last summer. Their demands follow the revelation of the spying scandal on Wednesday, which emerged after English courts concluded that agents of Sheikh Mohammed had infiltrated Princess Haya’s phone using controversial NSO Pegasus software. Graham Stringer, a Labour member of the foreign affairs select committee, said that the body had previously inquired into “state interference in this country by China and Russia” and should now consider state-sponsored phone hacking. “We should look at it as a Commons committee,” the MP said, adding that the British government also needed to undertake its own analysis of the fast-growing practice of sophisticated mobile phone surveillance. An investigation by the Guardian earlier this year discovered that 50,000 phone numbers had appeared on a leaked list who were believed to be persons of interest to government clients of NSO Group since 2016. At least 10 countries – including the UAE, of which Dubai is part – had entered numbers into the system. Wednesday’s court rulings are the clearest example yet of Britons being targeted by NSO’s Pegasus spyware, which is sold to states for use against terrorists and organised criminals. It has the power to secretly take control of a person’s phone, stealing personal data or turning on the microphone to record its surroundings. But there have been repeated criticisms that activists, journalists and lawyers were also being targeted by government security agencies using the technology, with 400 other UK numbers appearing in the leaked list having been selected by the UAE. Others who were victims of the hacking campaign, the courts concluded, were Fiona Shackleton, a high profile divorce lawyer, and a senior colleague who both were advising Haya in an acrimonious legal battle with Sheikh Mohammed over the welfare of her two children. Human rights watchdog Amnesty International said the “targeting of UK citizens and residents by NSO Group’s spyware” should now prompt urgent and public inquiries by government agencies and parliamentary committees. Danna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty’s technology unit, added: “Authorities in the UK – including parliamentary bodies – should conduct an immediate, independent, transparent, and impartial investigation.” Former Whitehall insiders said that there had been some concern about the growing availability of NSO’s spyware, but also a recognition that, in practice, little could be done once the technology had been sold. There was an informal agreement not to sell the technology to countries opposed to the UK and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence network, but the UAE is considered an ally. If Pegasus is then misused against British targets, it was impossible to prevent, the insider added. Publicly, the UK government only made a muted complaint. In its first statement since Wednesday’s court rulings, the Foreign Office said all countries should use cyber surveillance “in a way that is legal, responsible and proportionate”. A government spokesperson added: “The UK-UAE bilateral relationship is strong” – and then highlighted last month’s visit of the country’s crown prince and ruler, Mohammed bin Zayed, to London, where he met the prime minister, Boris Johnson, for a summit at Downing Street. In response, Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dems justice spokesperson, accused ministers of being complacent: “We need an urgent investigation into what exactly happened and how this scandalous act of phone hacking has been allowed to take place.” Haya, who was Sheikh Mohammed’s sixth wife, fled Dubai for the UK in 2019 as their marriage broke down and she began to fear for both her and her children’s safety. The intense court battle that followed made her increasingly feel under threat. “It feels like the walls are closing in on me,” Haya said in a witness statement to the court. “I feel like I am defending myself against a whole ‘state’”. But Sheikh Mohammed said the findings of hacking presented “an incomplete picture” – and added: “As a head of government involved in private family proceedings, it was not appropriate for me to provide evidence on such sensitive matters”. The judgments reveal that NSO Group alerted Haya’s lawyers on 5 August, via its ethics adviser Cherie Blair, at around the same time a digital forensics specialist has also suspected that the phone hacking was taking place. NSO said the courts had expressed their “appreciation of NSO’s cooperation, which was given although NSO is not within the jurisdiction of the court”."

          "bodyText": "Twitter users poised to dive into a heated online debate will be warned they are about to enter an “intense” conversation, under a safety trial. The social media platform is testing a feature that drops a notice under a potentially contentious exchange, stating: “Heads up. Conversations like this can be intense.” Another prompt, which appears to be aimed at people making a reply, goes to greater lengths to calm down users and urges the tweeter to “look out for each other”, “remember the human” and note that “diverse perspectives have value”. The trial is being conducted with a small group of users, on English-language settings, on Apple’s iOS platform. In testimony to US senators this week, the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen referred to Twitter’s attempts to take the heat out of some interactions as an example that her former employer could follow. Haugen, who said Facebook was too focused on making its platform “twitchy” and “viral”, said Twitter had reduced angry interactions by introducing a feature that asked users whether they wanted to tweet a link they had not tapped on. The “intense” conversation test is Twitter’s latest attempt to limit abuse on its platform, an issue that came into renewed focus in the UK this year after England football players were racially abused by Twitter users during the Euro 2020 tournament. Other initiatives being tested by the US company include: a feature that allows users to remove unwanted followers without officially blocking them; and a “safety mode” that blocks accounts for seven days if the tech firm’s systems spot them using harmful language or sending repetitive, uninvited replies and mentions. The safety mode feature is being trialled initially among a small group of users, with a particular emphasis on female journalists and members of marginalised communities. Twitter is also considering giving users the ability to archive old tweets and remove them from public view after a set period of time, such as 30, 60 or 90 days. Online abuse is coming into sharp legislative focus in the UK with the draft online safety bill, which imposes a duty of care on social media companies to protect users from harmful content. Social media firms are required under the draft bill to submit to Ofcom, the communications watchdog, a “risk assessment” of content that causes harm. A joint committee of MPs and peers is scrutinising the bill and is due to report at the end of the year."

          "headline": "Tony Abbott tells Taiwan president democracies must ‘stand shoulder to shoulder’ against China",
          "bodyText": "The former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has told the president of Taiwan he hopes his visit to the democratically ruled island will help end its isolation from the international community. Abbott met Tsai Ing-wen at the presidential office in Taipei on Thursday. He said China’s recent incursions into Taiwan’s air defence zone made it even more important that “fellow democracies stand shoulder to shoulder with you”. The ex-prime minister, speaking a day before he is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech to a regional conference, appeared to describe Taiwan as a “country” – a position opposed by China which considers it a renegade province. “It is in large measure to try to help to end this isolation from which Taiwan has been suffering for so many decades that I am here in this country and I do hope that this will be the first of many visits,” Abbott said. Under the Australian government’s one-China policy, Australia does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state, and therefore dealings between government officials take place unofficially. But Canberra has flagged its support for deeper ties, particularly on the economic front. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters in Canberra on Thursday that Abbott was “a private citizen” visiting Taiwan in a private capacity. But Taiwan considered the trip significant enough to grant Abbott a meeting with Tsai on Thursday and the event was also attended by Jenny Bloomfield, the representative of the Australian Office in Taipei. During an exchange broadcast by the presidential office, Tsai said she wanted to extend a warm welcome to Abbott on his first trip to Taiwan. She hoped the visit would “facilitate even more cooperation and understanding between Taiwan and Australia”. Tsai thanked Abbott for voicing support for an economic cooperation agreement between Australia and Taiwan and for backing Taiwan’s inclusion in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. “Your statements on the importance of a secure and peaceful Taiwan Strait are also greatly appreciated,” she said. Abbott, in turn, described Taiwan as a model for the wider world and “certainly a model for so many countries in this part of the world”. Taiwan, he said, had “transformed from an impoverished dictatorship into a vibrant, dynamic, pluralist democracy”. “You have demonstrated to all of the countries of this region that it is possible to be both rich and free and it is possible to have both liberty and democracy,” he said. “Of course not everyone and not everywhere is pleased [by] Taiwan’s progress and I do note that Taiwan is challenged on an almost daily basis by its giant neighbour. It’s more important than ever, under such circumstances, that your fellow democracies stand shoulder to shoulder with you.” Abbott said the best thing that countries like Australia could do for Taiwan was to try to build an “ever deeper relationship across the board” but particularly in trade. “If I may say so, perhaps in recent times countries like Australia have overemphasised fostering democracy in places where it has never taken root and underemphasised protecting democracy in places where it has. It’s important that we get the balance right in the future.” Abbott said he could not think of a stronger signal of democracies standing shoulder to shoulder with Taiwan than accepting Taiwan’s accession to the CPTPP. “Obviously I can’t make specific commitments on behalf of the Australian government, but I am confident that I do speak for the entire Australian people when I say that as a people we wish the people of Taiwan to continue to flourish in peace and in freedom.” Tsai had earlier noted the Australian government had been “actively adjusting its strategies in response to geopolitical changes in the Indo-Pacific region” and had backed Taiwan’s international participation. “Taiwan is willing to contribute to upholding regional peace and stability,” she told Abbott, who was Australia’s prime minister from 2013 to 2015. “We seek to deepen collaboration with other freedom-loving democracies in such areas as vaccines, emerging technologies, climate change and supply chains.” Abbott began his remarks by thanking Tsai for her “wonderfully warm and deeply courteous welcome” but also took a swipe at face masks. “I am looking forward to my next trip to Taiwan, a trip where I’m sure it will be possible to enjoy the bounty of this wonderful place, where, please God, we won’t be required to wear these wretched masks any more,” he said on Thursday. “On that note though, I should congratulate Taiwan for being the one place on Earth which has best tamed this Covid beast and has managed to do it without any major restrictions on economic activity and human freedom.” Taiwan remained largely Covid-free during the pandemic, after shutting its borders to non-residents early, enacting strict quarantine measures, and encouraging widespread mask-wearing. Taiwan currently requires all entrants to quarantine in a hotel at their own cost or in a government facility. During its largest outbreak earlier this year, Taiwan went into a soft lockdown, ordering public sporting venues, adult and entertainment venues, and restaurants to close – except for takeaway. The more than three-month shutdown was widely followed but did prompt complaints from some business owners, particularly in hospitality, who were devastated by the economic hit. – additional reporting Helen Davidson in Taipei"

          "bodyText": "Top story: ‘Resources have never been pulled in such a dramatic way’ Morning everyone. I’m Virginia Harrison and these are the top stories today. More than a decade of austerity has dealt a “massive body blow” to police services in England and Wales, severely hampering their ability to tackle violence against women and girls, former senior police figures say. They have called for a “Stephen Lawrence moment” of transformation in the service and a full judge-led inquiry to restore faith in policing. Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent with the Metropolitan police , said resources have “never been pulled in a such a dramatic way”. He joins others in arguing that women and girls have been harmed by systemic underfunding. “There is not a single person who I meet who does not know a woman who has been the victim of some kind of abuse. That is absolutely appalling,” Babu said. “We need a Stephen Lawrence moment here, where we acknowledge the way that we’re failing women and young girls.” Experts say crimes of violence against females require officers with specialist skills and knowledge about offenders – something heavily restricted by underfunding. It comes with the Met in crisis over the failures that allowed then serving police officer Wayne Couzens to kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard. * * * Conference called – Business figures have taken aim at Boris Johnson in the wash-up to the Conservative party conference, accusing the prime minister of lacking a coherent economic plan after he delivered a boosterish conference speech that barely mentioned the supply chain crisis. From the need to match “rhetoric with action” to “not a single rousing moment”, our panel of experts give their verdict on the PM’s closing address in Manchester. Political correspondent Aubrey Allegretti also combed through the speech and explains what he said – and what he actually meant. And finally, John Crace’s view: “Not so much a conference speech, more an extended Daily Telegraph column.” Read his take here. * * * Pandora papers – In 2010 the former Conservative MP and minister Jonathan Aitken flew to Washington for the launch of his latest book: a flattering biography of Kazakhstan’s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. His speech to an audience of senators and diplomats at the prestigious Library of Congress failed to mention one crucial point: that a PR firm working for the Kazakh government appears to have secretly commissioned and paid for his book. According to the Pandora papers – the largest leak of offshore data in history, which has been shared with the Guardian and other media by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – Aitken got £166,000 for his literary efforts. The money was routed via Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands and discreetly sent to Oxford and the ex-MP’s company, Aitken Consultancy &amp; Research Services Limited. According to the documents, the firm, WorldPR, also picked up the bill for Aitken’s overseas book tour. WorldPR is run by Aitken’s one-time press adviser Patrick Robertson. Aitken’s expenses included a stay at the Capital Hilton, two blocks from the White House. Aitken’s $1,527 (£1,117) receipt – found in the leak – lists three nights’ accommodation, laundry, a meal in the bar and grill, as well as Twigs restaurant, plus high-speed internet access. The PR company paid the Library of Congress $6,996 for venue hire. Aitken did not respond to an email asking for comment or to two letters sent to his home address in London. Similarly, Robertson did not reply to three emails, a letter and a message left on his mobile phone.

Increasing levels of “eco-anxiety” – the chronic fear of environmental doom – were likely to be underestimated and damaging to many in the long term, they said. It’s not yet considered a diagnosable condition but recognition of eco-anxiety and its complex psychological effects is on the rise, experts writing in the British Medical Journal said, along with its “disproportionate” impact on the young. So what can people do about it? Access to reliable information about mitigation and adaptation can help, experts say, as well as help to connect with nature, make greener choices and join forces with like-minded groups. * * * Fly, fly away – A worrying piece of news for those already eco-anxious: the UK has recorded its lowest ever number of butterflies in an annual survey of the insects. Butterfly Conservation has been conducting the count for 12 years and said the latest numbers should prompt urgent action. As well as forming a vital part of the food chain, butterflies are considered significant indicators of the health of the environment. * * * Spell check – Universities and colleges are failing to mark down students for poor spelling, grammar and punctuation, which is leading to grade inflation due to a misguided application of equalities legislation, England’s higher education regulator said. A review of five institutions by the Office for Students (OfS) said it feared that staff being allowed to ignore errors in students’ written work was “widespread”. The review follows cases this year of institutions using “inclusive assessment” policies more widely, and taking quality of writing into account only in courses where it was deemed to be critical, leading to condemnation from ministers. * * * ‘I just wanted to write something funny’ – Torrey Peters’ novel Detransition, Baby caused a storm last year when it was longlisted for the Women’s prize, and is one of the most talked-about of the year. She talks to writer and trans dad Freddy McConnell about LGBTQ+ families and the “Sex and the City problem”. * * * Today in Focus podcast: Can women trust the police? In the aftermath of the sentencing of Sarah Everard’s killer, women’s trust in the police has collapsed. Can anything be done to restore it? Is misogyny endemic in British policing? And is there a risk that such an appalling crime could happen again?

          "bodyText": "Good morning. NSW is looking forward to some freedoms now that it has reached 70% double-dose vaccination coverage of the adult population but police have been accused of handing out unfair Covid fines – to the tune of $9m. The US faces another debt impasse. And the Australian whistleblower lawyer Bernard Collaery celebrates a “victory for justice”. NSW residents will enjoy new freedoms from Monday, including being able to gather in each other’s homes, go to restaurants and bars, and the reopening of most retail and service businesses – including barbers and hairdressers. But community legal centres have accused police of “systematic failure” over the “ridiculous” proportion of on-the-spot Covid fines handed down to younger Australians. More than 10,000 fines were issued for alleged Covid infractions between March 2020 and July 2021, with a blitz of 6,815 fines being handed out in July 2021 alone. And regional NSW mayors have expressed concerns that the state’s reopening could prompt Covid infection rates to spike. All 10 NSW LGAs with double vaccination rates below 50% are regional – six of which are presently battling outbreaks. President Joe Biden has accused the Republican party of playing “Russian roulette” with the US economy in the face of ongoing filibuster before a crucial debt ceiling vote. In scenes reminiscent of the 2013 debt crisis and subsequent government shutdown, Biden has accused leading Republicans of “obstruction and political games”, saying social security benefits would effectively stop on 18 October if the debt ceiling were not raised. Bernard Collaery has heralded an appeal ruling that lifts secrecy provisions as a “victory for justice”, thanking the lawyers who have helped him, pro bono, during the multimillion-dollar trial brought against him by the Australian government. In handing down its ruling, the ACT court of appeal cited the importance of open justice in preventing “political prosecutions”. The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, had sought to use the National Security Information Act to keep part of the case against Collaery secret. The lawyer faces five charges of disclosing protected intelligence information to journalists in collaboration with his client, former Asis whistleblower Witness K. Australia GPs have cautioned against online telehealth websites that promise consultations for vaping scripts “in minutes”, saying vaping as a way to try to quit smoking should only be pursued if “all else has failed”. Leading climate scientists have dismissed the role of carbon capture and storage in combination with existing fossil fuels to reach net zero emissions targets, saying that only if used with clean energy sources might CCS have a part to play in transitioning to net zero. The ATO has said furore related to the leaked Pandora papers will lead to future crackdowns, citing the effect the 2016 Panama papers had in helping collect an additional $38m in tax revenues.

Recommended reads “A silver lining of the pandemic has been knowing that birds are bringing these same kinds of joy to so many others’ lives.” For ornithologist Leo Joseph, a chance encounter with a colourful rosella in 1968 set him on a path from which he’s never strayed. “Australian birders, whether hardened old campaigners or new recruits, can take pride in the role our continent has played in the evolution of birds. From DNA-based research, we know that the world’s songbirds, for example, originated right here and that a distant ancestor of our robins gave rise to the rest of the world’s songbirds.” Remember to vote today as the Guardian Australian 2021 Australian bird of the year heads into the final tense day of voting. It’s 20 years since the west’s response to the September 11 attacks plunged Afghanistan into conflict and chaos. A collective of Australian and Afghan artists, musicians and journalists is planning a series of exhibits and performances – hoping to offer a “more reflective, and critical perspective” on the past two decades. “I vividly remember reporting from insurgent territory in the country and seeing and hearing the Afghans caught in the middle of a senseless war,” the project co-founder Antony Lowenstein said. “Afghan art is one way to resist this futility and build something beautiful and provocative.” “Despite the growth of China, one would have to be a fool to deny the hold America still has on the global economy.” And as the US once again eyes debt default it creates a “chilling effect outside its borders”, argues Greg Jericho. “It may send a calamitous tsunami through the global financial system that sets off GFC 2.0, or investors might all take a deep breath and in effect ignore it as best they can because actually thinking that the US dollar is no longer safe is too scary to contemplate.” From Darude to melodicas, Bec Hill has scoured the internet to present you her 10 funniest things for this week.

          "headline": "UK gas price surge then falls back as Putin offers to stabilise energy markets – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Time to wrap up. UK gas prices have surged to fresh record highs today, as the energy price crunch threatens to drive inflation sharply higher, hitting growth and hampering the recovery. Bur prices tumbled back in a roller-coaster ride, after Russia’s president indicated Moscow could stabilise soaring global energy prices. Vladimir Putin hinted that Russia’s state-backed monopoly pipeline exporter, Gazprom, may increase supplies to help Europe. The price of gas for delivery in November initially surged by almost 40% to 400p per therm this morning, but reversed course after Putin’s comments, to finish 9% lower at 266p. Gas for next-day delivery also fell back from record levels. After hitting 355p per therm this morning, it is now 231p, down 17% today. But unless the energy crisis eases, UK industry could face shutdowns this winter: Energy worries weighed on markets, with European equities and Wall Street both falling. Oil hit new multi-year highs, before subsiding, amid worries that petrol prices could surge higher before Christmas. UK borrowing costs hit their highest since May 2019, before easing back this afternoon. Inflation worries prompted New Zealand and Poland to both raise interest rates. German industrial orders tumbled, as supply chain bottlenecks hit industry. The supply chain crisis has also hit UK builders, where growth hit an eight-month low last month. New data has shown that UK car traffic hit its lowest since May during the fuel crisis. In other news: Goodnight. GW Stocks in London have ended the day at their lowest close in a fortnight, although they did recover from their lowest point. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed 81 points lower at 6996 points, a drop of 1.15% today. Worries about growth and inflation weighed on stocks. Copper producer Antofagasta was the top faller, sliding by 5.5%, followed by retail group Next (-4.8%), hotel operator Whitbread (-4.5%), and engineering group Melrose (-4.5%). But Tesco (+5.9%) led the risers after doubling its profits, announcing a £500m share buyback, and said its supply chain was holding up well. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Russia’s president calmed markets today. “When Putin’s promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it’s clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in. Surging gas prices which accelerated the sell off on the FTSE 100 were reined in a little after Russia’s president said the country would increase the amount of gas it will send to Ukraine via Europe, over the level it’s currently contracted to do. It underlines the volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe. Although the government says there is no magic solution to surging prices, one UK industry organisation, the Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, clearly believes the energy situation is so desperate that emergency measures are needed to avoid shut downs. European markets also ended lower, with the Stoxx 600 down 1%. US oil inventories have risen unexpectedly, which could further cool some of the frenzy in the energy market. Crude inventories rose by 2.3 million barrels last week, against expectations for a modest dip of 418,000 barrels, the U.S. Energy Department said. That has helped to pull oil down from its earlier highs. US crude is now down 1.7% today at $77.55 per barrel, having hit seven-year highs over $79 today. Inflation has prompted Poland’s central bank to unexpectedly raise interest rates today, for the first time since 2012. The National Bank of Poland, or NBP, surprised the markets by lifting its benchmark borrowing rate to 0.5%, from 0.1%. The move surprised the markets. The NBP acted after Poland’s interest rate jumped to 5.8% in September, partly driven up the surge in energy prices. Earlier this week a group of former Polish central bank officials wrote an open letter to governor Adam Glapinski urging an immediate interest-rate hike to curb inflation, but their plea had not been expected to be heeded. Wall Street has opened lower, as inflation jitters continue to weigh on stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA) is down 301 points, or 0.9%, at 34,013 points, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index has dipped by 0.65%. The tech-focused Nasdaq is faring better, down 0.3%. Energy stocks are among the fallers after oil prices eased back today, with materials stocks, industrials and financials all lower too. Chemicals firm Dow Inc (-3.8%) is the top faller on the DJIA, followed by American Express (-2.25%) and construction machinery maker Caterpillar (-2.2%). Oil company Chevron (-1.9%) and aerospace manufacturer Boeing (-1.8%) are also among the fallers, suggesting growth worries continue to hit stocks, despite today’s ADP jobs report beating forecasts. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with ThinkMarkets., says equities, emerging market currencies and many other risk-sensitive assets are being hit by inflationary pressures. The energy spike has fuelled fears that inflation is not going to be transitory as many central banks hoped, he points out: Rising energy prices is not only impacting households but businesses too, adding to their costs. The net result would be higher prices for the goods and services, potentially meaning lower demand from households, already hit by rising energy prices eating into their own disposable incomes. Oil has dropped back from this morning’s multi-year highs too. Brent crude has slipped back to around $81.45 per barrel, having hit a three-year high of $83 earlier, as president Putin’s comments about stabilising global energy markets bring some calm. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Putin may have put a ceiling on the “crazy market moves” for the time being (although the situation remains difficult). Winter is coming and supplies are still very short and markets volatile. Plus how long does Putin play nice? Anyway it seems to have calmed the market for the time being. The price of UK gas for next-day delivery has fallen back from this morning’s record highs, after Vladimir Putin indicated that Russia is prepared to stabilise global energy markets. It’s now down 6% today at 260p per therm, having burst through the 300p mark for the first time earlier today. UK gas prices have fallen back from their earlier highs, after comments from Russia’s president calmed the market. Reuters reported that Vladimir Putin said Russia is boosting gas supplies to Europe, including via Ukraine, in response to the energy crunch and stands ready to stabilise the market amid surging prices. Russian gas sales to Europe may hit a new record this year as a result, he said, and transit via Ukraine is set exceed volumes agreed under Gazprom’s contract with Kyiv. This has pulled the price of UK natural gas for delivery in November back down to 267p per therm. That’s a drop of almost 9% today, after it briefly surged 39% to around 400p this morning. Last month, the world’s energy watchdog called on Russia to send more gas to Europe to help with the supply crunch. EU politicians have accused the Kremlin of deliberately withholding gas supplies while it awaits regulatory approval for a controversial pipeline project, Nord Stream 2, which would double Russia’s capacity to export gas to Germany. But Putin today said that Europe was to blame for the current energy crisis. The AFP newswire has the details: “They’ve made mistakes,” Putin said in a televised meeting with Russian energy officials. He said that one of the factors influencing the prices was the termination of “long-term contracts” in favour of the spot market. “It turned out, and today this is absolutely obvious, that this policy is wrong,” Putin said. Road traffic fell to its lowest level since May as the fuel crisis gripped the country. Department for Transport figures show car traffic across Britain on Tuesday 28th September was just 86% of pre-pandemic levels after several days of shortages at the pumps. That’s its lowest in four months. Car traffic had been 100% of pre-pandemic levels on the previous Friday, the first day of long queues at forecourts. But it fell to 91% on Monday 27th (down from 97% a week earlier), after a weekend of panic buying left many petrol stations dry. Car traffic then remained below 90% between Tuesday 28th and Thursday 30th September, suggesting motorists cut back on journeys for fear of running out of fuel. By this Monday, car traffic was still only 91% of pre-pandemic levels, with around a fifth of forecourts in London and south-east London still dry. AA’s head of roads policy Jack Cousens says: “Not only did the fuel shortages, which had been managed successfully up until details of a Government meeting with the fuel industry and hauliers were leaked, leave millions of cars having to queue but they had a direct impact on commerce. “This has been a woeful chapter in a long history of UK drivers being let down or exploited. American firms hired more workers than expected in September. US payroll operator ADP reports that private payrolls increased by 568,000 jobs last month, up from a downwardly-revised 340,000 in August. It was led by leisure and hospitality firms, who took on 226,000 more staff, as the slowing in Covid-19 infections encouraged more Americans to travel, and visit bars and restaurants. Manufacturers took on another 49,000 staff, with construction payrolls up 46,000. UK building firms were hit by widespread supply shortages last month, which drove up cost inflation and hit growth. The latest survey of the construction sector found that shortages of materials and staff hold back the construction recovery in September. Growth hit an eight-month low, as builders reported softer demand, unavailable transport, a severe lack of materials and continued staff shortages. It was also harder to find sub-contractors, who hiked their prices at the fastest rate on record. Some firms said the unpredictable pricing environment had slowed clients’ decision-making on new orders and led to delays with contract awards. This dragged the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI down to 52.6 in September, from 55.2 in August. That only shows a moderate expansion, and the weakest in eight months. Purchase prices increased rapidly in September, although the rate of inflation eased further from June’s all-time peak. Around 78% of the survey panel reported a rise in their cost burdens, which was mostly linked to supply shortages and transport surcharges. Staffing levels rose, but at the weakest rate since April, which partly reflected long wait times to fill vacancies. Tim Moore, Director at IHS Markit, says labour shortages and the supply chain crisis led to a severe loss of momentum: “The volatile price and supply environment has started to hinder new business intakes as construction companies revised cost projections and some clients delayed decisions on contract awards. As a result, the latest survey data pointed to the worst month for order books since January’s lockdown. Shortages of building materials and a lack of transport capacity led to another rapid increase in purchase prices during September. There was also a considerable decline in the availability of sub-contractors, with survey respondents citing shortages of bricklayers, drivers, groundworkers, joiners, plumbers and many other skilled trades. Measured overall, prices charged by sub-contractors increased at the fastest rate since the survey began in April 1997. The Financial Times says stagflation fears are on the rise... The UK is viewed as particularly exposed to stagflation because of supply chain disruptions related to Brexit, alongside soaring energy bills and labour shortages. “This is hitting consumers in the pocket, and that’s before you get to the Bank of England possibly jacking up mortgage costs later this year. This is looking like a move towards stagflation,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management. More here: Surging energy prices rattle bonds and stocks The energy crisis is also dragging down government bond prices, pushing up the cost of borrowing. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year UK gilts has risen to 1.118% this morning, it highest since May 2019. This suggests the markets are anticipating that UK inflation will push higher, intensifying pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Other government bond yields are also rising (including US Treasuries), as investors worry fret about rising prices hitting growth. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: Inflation/stagflation, supply chain problems, the US debt ceiling, an energy crisis as natural gas prices soar to new records in Europe and the UK, tighter monetary policy from central banks, worries about the Chinese property sector – all swirling around equity markets this week and not going away any time soon. Chiefly this morning we might say that rising Treasury yields and soaring energy prices are conspiring to knock risk appetite. This morning’s slump in German factory orders is also weighing on the markets. The 7.7% tumble in industrial orders in August suggests supply chain disruption is hurting growth and demand: George Vessey, currency strategist at Western Union Business Solutions, says: Investors are nervous about surging energy prices driving inflation higher and forcing interest rate hikes despite economic growth slowing globally. The euro is under pressure amidst risk aversion but also the slowing economic recovery - evidenced once again this morning with German industrial orders surprising a lot lower than expected. The surge in wholesale gas and electricity prices will force the collapse of more UK energy providers, predicts rating agency Moody’s. Joanna Fic, senior vice president at Moody’s, says that nine suppliers serving over 1.7 million customers have ceased trading since the beginning of September. More will follow, Moody’s predicts, as suppliers face Renewable Obligation payments due in October. With customers of failed suppliers being taken over by rivals, there will be market consolidation and reduced competition for the remaining suppliers, including British Gas, Fic says. But profitability will be hit until higher commodity prices can be passed on to customers (when the energy cap rises next April). Fic explains: “The cost of energy supplier failures – which could well exceed £1 billion and could be a multiple of that in a scenario with a higher number of market exits – and higher energy bills will exacerbate affordability concerns and the risk of credit negative political intervention.” Such an intervention could include a ‘windfall tax’ to ease household bills (as has happened in Spain), or state loans and the creation of a “bad bank” to support energy suppliers But Fic adds: It is, however, unclear how any of such proposals could be implemented and what their impact on the industry would be. Fears of a new era of stagflation are worrying investors today, says Raffi Boyadjian of XM: Global equities were back in the red on Wednesday as concerns about sluggish growth and higher inflation returned to haunt investors. The shift towards tighter monetary policy by central banks amid worsening supply shortages around the world and surging commodity prices has dampened the outlook for the major economies at a time when the recovery was already on shaky foundations due to the uncontainable Delta outbreak. Fresh highs in oil futures are keeping investors on edge, he adds, pushing up inflation expectations, which are in turn driving government bond yields to multi-month peaks. European stock markets have sunk deeper into the red, as rising energy prices threaten economic growth and drive up inflation. The FTSE 100 index has now fallen by 120 points, or 1.7%, to 6956 points, a two-week low. Every sector is down, led by consumer cyclicals, technology and industrial stocks, with mining stocks, travel companies and UK housebuilders among the fallers. “A continuing surge in energy prices means the sceptre of inflation is looming large over the markets again, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. “Oil prices are camped above $80 per barrel after producers’ cartel OPEC failed to increase output and natural gas continues to touch record highs. The concern will be that rising prices will prove much stickier than hoped. “This is undermining the markets’ efforts to pick themselves off the canvas after a bruising autumn so far. The next big announcement on the radar is the US jobs report on Friday – a weak number could prompt concern that we are heading for the dreaded stagflation scenario.” Germany’s DAX has slumped by 2.4%, with European markets all a sea of red: Dutch and British wholesale gas prices both extended record highs on Wednesday morning, in line with rallying energy markets, and as forecasts of lower wind and cooler weather lift demand and supply remains scarce, says Reuters. The November gas price at the Dutch TTF hub, a European benchmark, rose by €25.60 to €143.10 per megawatt hour by 0839 GMT. It earlier traded at a record €155.00 per megawatt hours. “It’s amazing what we are looking at. Total craziness,” a gas trader said. The cost of UK gas delivery in November has also surged higher today. It’s up 25% right now (an astonishing move in normal times), at around 370p per therm, up from 294p last night. But these are not normal times. The market is in ‘demand destruction’ mode. Energy prices hitting levels that will force some users, such as heavy industry, to cut demand. Here’s David Sheppard, the FT’s energy editor: UK gas prices have surged to new all-time highs today, piling more pressure on energy users and providers. British wholesale gas for day-ahead delivery breached the £3 per therm mark for the first time on Wednesday morning. The British day-ahead contract jumped by 25%, extending its run of very sharp moves higher, to hit 350p per therm, Refinitiv data shows. This takes wholesale gas prices further above the spike seen in 2018, when the “Beast from the East” weather system created a scramble for gas. A series of factors have driven up gas and energy prices across Europe -- from lower production levels and higher global demand, to a lack of wind to power the renewables turbines, and forecasts of a cold winter. Bloomberg’s Will Hares points out that the UK’s natural gas benchmark has more than doubled in the last month, as the crisis intensified. Yesterday, a UK industry body representing energy intensive sectors including steel, chemicals and fertilisers called for more help from the government to ensure they could continue to operate this winter. Without emergency measures, there could be shutdown at essential industries, they warned. Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said: “We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors. “Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter given that UK energy intensive industries produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains. “Now is the moment for government and Ofgem to take preventative action.” Nearly two-thirds of UK manufacturers expect to raise their prices in the run-up to Christmas after being hit by mounting cost pressures. The British Chambers of Commerce said inflation expectations had risen to their highest since its records began at the end of the 1980s, with 62% of industrial firms planning price hikes over the next three months. It’s another sign that inflationary pressures are on the rise, intensifying the cost of living squeeze on households. More here.

More here: Tesco is bucking the selloff this morning, after doubling its profits in the first half of the year. The UK’s largest supermarket cut costs related to the coronavirus pandemic and said its strong supply chain had kept shelves stocked despite widespread delivery problems across the industry. Sales rose 3% to £27.3bn in the six months to 28 August and profits soared by 107% to £1.1bn. It said its shoppers had sought out clothing and other household goods while it got a boost from the Euro 2020 football tournament, which was postponed to the summer of 2021, and more families holidaying in the UK because of travel restrictions. Tesco said: “As industry supply chains came under increasing pressure, we were able to leverage our strong supplier relationships and distribution capability to maintain good levels of availability for customers, contributing to our market outperformance. Here’s the full story: Tesco also announced a £500m share buyback, which is helping to push its share up by 4.1% this morning. Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment at interactive investor, tweets: European stock markets have dropped smartly in early trading, as worries about growth and inflation swirl. The FTSE 100 has fallen back the 7,000 points mark -- dropping by 91 points or 1.28% to 6985 points. Retailers, hospitality firms, travel companies and housebuilders are all among the fallers, with most stocks down. JD Sports (-3.5%), hotel operator Whitbread (-3.1%) and gambling group Flutter (-3.1%) are the top fallers. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 has dropped by 1.1%, following losses in Asia-Pacific markets. Kyle Rodda of IG explains: Stocks have rolled over in Asia trade, as market participants fall back down that proverbial wall of worry. The priority remains inflation, policy and by extension future economic growth, as fears about rising global costs and the knock on effects that’ll have on asset valuations keeps investors in price discovery mode. Somewhat unexpectedly, the RBNZ – normally a central bank that can say plenty without moving the markets a lot – seems to have catalysed this bout of risk aversion today. As expected, the [New Zealand] central bank hiked rates to 0.5% today, but put quite a strong emphasis on the persistent cost pressures motivating their decision in its statement, dispensing slightly with the general rhetoric from other global central banks that inflation is transitory. Inflationary pressures prompted New Zealand’s central bank to raise interest rates today, for the first time in seven years. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) increased its cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.5%, as it tries to cool inflation and a red-hot housing market. Economists had expected the hike last month but the bank held off due to an outbreak of the Covid-19 Delta variant. New Zealand is one of the first developed economies to reverse rate cuts put in place during the pandemic, following South Korea in August and Norway in September. New Zealand has enjoyed a rapid economic recovery since a Covid-driven recession last year, partly because it reopened its economy before others following efforts to eliminate coronavirus. But with its borders still shut, labour and goods shortages are pushing up inflation, as well as contributing to a surging property market, which has been driven by ultra-low interest rates. The RBNZ committee noted: “Demand shortfalls are less of an issue than the economy hitting capacity constraints.” These sharply rising energy prices are fuelling concerns about stagflation (higher costs and slowing growth) Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Think Markets, explains: I think rallying crude oil are driving stagflation concerns for a large part – especially for emerging market economies who are also net oil importers. India and China to name a couple. Even in the more advanced economies, rising crude oil prices have raised fuel prices, directly impacting consumers’ disposable incomes. The other factors are driven by other energy prices – most notably gas, but also surging electricity prices – as well as supply-chain bottlenecks – the latter raising both inflation and hurting economic growth. European natural gas prices have surged to new highs in early trading: As Bloomberg’s Javier Blas explains, the gas crisis risks morphing into a real political crisis: Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says the ‘sudden massive drop’ in German factory orders in August was primarily caused by supply chain bottlenecks. He fears it will be a headwind to growth this year: German industrial orders tumbled in August, as supply bottlenecks and shortages hit factories in Europe’s largest economy. Factory orders fell by 7.7% during the month, after two months of strong gains, much worse than the 2.1% fall which analysts expected. Car orders were particularly weak. The Federal Statistics Office said that orders for motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts fell by 12.0% in August -- a sign that the global shortage of semiconductors is hitting German carmakers. Orders for metal production and processing dropped 9.6%, with manufacturers also blaming delivery bottlenecks for preliminary products. The drop was driven by a drop in demand from countries outside the eurozone: Domestic orders fell 5.2% in August 2021 compared to the previous month. Foreign orders fell by 9.5%. Incoming orders from the euro zone increased by 1.6%, while incoming orders from the rest of the world fell by 15.2%. The steep drop on the month was partly caused by a rise in orders for planes, ships and other large vehicles in June and July. Without this distorting effect, industrial orders were down by 5.1% in August. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the UK’s supply chain crisis, and business. The energy crunch is intensifying, driving up costs for households and businesses, and sending inflation fears rippling through the markets. US crude has hit its highest level since 2014 this morning, extending its recent rally, amid tight supplies, rising demand, and the rocketing gas price. A barrel of US crude touched $79.40, a new seven-year high, while Brent crude has hit a three-year high of $83 per barrel. The recent surge in the oil price is making investors jittery, especially after the Opec+ group is resisting pressure to ramp up its production. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: Oil prices in the United States have climbed to their highest level since 2014, rising for the last 5 sessions. Crude oil has gained support from uncertainty regarding energy supplies as supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude appear to be tighter. Monday’s OPEC meeting only exacerbated the issue as the group conveyed no significant rise in oil production and decided to go on with its already existing timeline to avoid any major repercussions caused by another wave of coronavirus. However, the cartel may be pushed into a corner if demand continues to rise, leaving no option but to ramp up production. The jump in the oil price will drive up petrol prices, with the RAC warning that they could hit all-time highs before Christmas -- bringing “misery” for motorists still reeling from the fuel shortage crisis. Amid signs that the number of petrol forecourts running dry was easing, the drivers’ organisation warned that anxiety about whether motorists could fill up their tanks was likely to be replaced by concern about how much it would cost. The RAC’s fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams, said that oil demand was outpacing supply as economies begin to pick up pace amid eased Covid restrictions, with the increase exacerbated by Opec opting not to increase oil flows significantly this week. He said: “[The trend] looks likely to spell further misery for drivers at the pumps as we head towards Christmas … If this were to happen we could see the average price of unleaded hit a new record of around 143p per litre. Diesel would shoot up to 145p, which is only 3p off the record high of 147.93 in April 2021.” The frenzy in the gas markets, where prices are surging by the day, is also pushing up crude, as countries may be forced to burn more oil instead. Kim Kwangrae, senior commodities analyst at Samsung Futures Inc, explains (via Bloomberg) “The tight supply outlook and the extra oil demand coming from countries in Europe and Asia in search of alternative fuels due to the global energy crunch have pumped up prices,” said “Oil at $80 will become a psychological burden for some investors, potentially driving a sell-off if the American government data shows crude inventories have climbed as per expectations.” These worries are hitting equities too; European stock markets are expected to open around 0.7% lower.

          "headline": "Adele announces long-awaited return with comeback single, Easy on Me",
          "bodyText": "After weeks of feverish speculation, Adele has announced her return. A new single, Easy on Me, is set for release on 15 October, ahead of her fourth album. The musician, 33, teased her first new music in six years with a clip that shows her loading a cassette into a car tape deck and driving along as sheet music blows out of the window. Some stately piano chords, presumably the song’s introduction, play over the clip. The sound is in keeping with the balladry that has made Adele the best-selling female album artist of the century in the UK, according to figures published by the British Phonographic Industry this March. That is, unless the introduction turns out to be a feint. While Adele’s fourth album is unlikely to be the “drum and bass record to spite you all” that she teased impatient fans with in 2019, critics have been guessing whether transformations in the singer’s personal life might prompt a move away from her trademark sound. Adele and her ex-husband, charity CEO Simon Konecki, divorced in 2019. They have an eight-year-old son. She has since been linked to the UK rapper Skepta and recently confirmed her relationship with US sports agent Rich Paul. She has also undergone a pronounced physical transformation, as she acknowledged when she guest-hosted Saturday Night Live in October 2020: “I know I look really, really different since you last saw me,” she said in her opening monologue. “But actually, because of all the Covid restrictions, I had to travel light and I could only bring half of me. And this is the half I chose.” Adele recently updated her social media profiles to match a mysterious global advertising campaign that saw the number “30” projected on to landmarks including the Tate Modern and the Brooklyn Bridge, appearing to confirm the title of her fourth album. Despite her once saying she intended to move away from the number-based naming convention of her albums, 30 follows 19 (2008), 21 (2011) and 25 (2015). While no release date has been announced, fans have guessed it may arrive on 19 November, after Taylor Swift pulled forward the release of her latest album re-recording, Red (Taylor’s Version), to 12 November, presumably to avoid going head to head with another pop behemoth. It all makes for a very busy fourth quarter in pop – and good news for retailers – with Adele and Swift joining major releases from Ed Sheeran, whose fourth album, =, is released on 29 October, and Abba, whose ninth album, Voyage – their first in 40 years – lands on 5 November."

          "bodyText": "GPs are failing to urgently refer patients with “red flag” signs of suspected cancer to a specialist, research suggests. Six out of 10 patients in England with key symptoms indicating possible cancer did not receive an urgent referral for specialist assessment within two weeks, as recommended in clinical guidelines, according to a new study. Nearly 4% of these patients were subsequently diagnosed with cancer within the next 12 months. The findings were published in the journal BMJ Quality &amp; Safety. In the study, researchers analysed records from almost 49,000 patients who consulted their GP with one of the warning signs for cancer that should warrant referral under clinical guidelines. They found that six out of 10 patients were not referred for cancer investigation within two weeks of the first visit. Of the 29,045 patients not referred, 1,047 developed cancer within a year (3.6%). Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is crucial to survival chances. Every four-week delay in cancer treatment increases the risk of death by 10%. The study was led by the University of Exeter, working with University College London, and funded by Cancer Research UK. Researchers studied records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, as well as data on visits to hospital and cancer registration data between 2014 and 2015. They looked at patients who had reported cancer warning signs to their GP for the first time. The “red flag” symptoms included blood in urine, a breast lump, problems swallowing, iron-deficiency anaemia and postmenopausal or rectal bleeding. The lowest referral rate was for problems swallowing, at just 17%, and the highest was for breast lump, at 68%. “The number of patients who go on to be diagnosed with cancer when they are not urgently referred indicates that following the guidelines more strictly would have significant benefits,” the researchers wrote. The lead author of the study, Dr Bianca Wiering, said: “It’s important to note that this issue does not just lie with GPs – we also need to ensure the services to provide the tests needed on referral are well resourced, which we know is currently not always the case.” Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “GPs follow clinical guidance to ensure that referrals are appropriate and are sensitive to the risks of over-referring patients because this would risk overloading specialist services and would not be helpful to patients or the NHS. “GPs find themselves in a position where they are criticised for referring both too much and too little: what would help is better access to diagnostic tools in the community and additional training to use them and interpret the results, so that better informed referrals can be made.” Separately, the charity Breast Cancer Now has warned that almost 12,000 women could be living with undiagnosed breast cancer after missing out on NHS screening because of the pandemic."

          "headline": "Pandora papers: tax avoidance revelations prompt outraged denials",
          "bodyText": "The Pandora papers’ revelations prompted an avalanche of international reaction on Monday, ranging from solemn government pledges to clamp down on tax avoidance to outraged denials and a few cries of “old news”. The leak published on Sunday by the Guardian and other global media partners revealed the leading role played by the US in the offshore industry, including in the state of South Dakota. It also showcased the use of offshore secrecy jurisdictions by world leaders past and present, as well as other politicians and top public officials. The Biden administration said it would “crack down on the unfair schemes that give big corporations a leg up” in the wake of the Pandora disclosures. “It’s time to deal in hardworking Americans and ensure the super-wealthy pay their fair share,” the White House said in a tweet. In Moscow, the Kremlin insisted there was nothing to see, despite the fact that several of Vladimir Putin’s friends and associates – including an alleged former lover – appeared in the data. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, said the leak was made up of “unsubstantiated claims”. Peskov said no hidden wealth was found among Putin’s inner circle, despite the leak suggesting the opposite. “What catches the eye is which country is the world’s largest lagoon. This, of course, is the US,” Peskov said at a daily press briefing in Moscow. Multiple countries including Spain, Mexico, Panama, Pakistan, India, Brazil, the UK and Australia said they would now investigate the Pandora documents – 11.9m leaked files from 14 offshore providers. The British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the UK’s tax authorities would “look through those to see if there’s anything we can learn”. Sunak – whose father-in-law is an Indian tycoon and billionaire – was asked if he had personally benefited himself from an offshore arrangement. “No, I haven’t,” he told Sky News. The Australian tax office said it would examine any links to Australians that emerge from the leak. About 400 Australian names are in the papers, which feature southern hemisphere tax havens such as Samoa, as well as the British Virgin Islands, Monaco and Switzerland. The government of Panama said it would begin a “supervision” of offshore service companies mentioned in the Pandora papers. One of those providers, a Panama-headquartered law firm known as Alcogal, plays a major role in helping Latin America’s political class set up shell companies in tax havens. It says it complies with all legal requirements wherever it operates. Pakistan’s prime minister, Imran Khan, said his government would investigative all citizens mentioned in the documents – including several of his own ministers and key members of his inner circle. They include Pakistan’s minister for water resources, Chaudhry Moonis Elahi. Elahi pulled out of making a large investment in a tax haven after he was told his country’s tax authorities would be informed, documents in the Pandora papers suggest. Instead he set up a trust structure in the UK. Elahi denies impropriety and says his family’s assets were declared. “If any wrongdoing is established, we will take appropriate action. I call on the international community to treat this grave injustice as similar to the climate change crisis,” Khan tweeted. The ruling elite in the developing world was plundering national wealth in the same way the East India Company once looted India, he said. “Unfortunately, the rich states are neither interested in preventing this large-scale plunder nor in repatriating this looted money,” Khan said. The UN had calculated that a staggering $7tn in stolen assets was parked in largely offshore tax havens, he said, pointing out that corruption caused poverty in his and other countries. Meanwhile, the billionaire Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, reacted angrily to the Pandora claims. They show he used a convoluted offshore structure to finance his purchase in 2009 of a £13m mansion in the south of France. The timing of Sunday’s publication – ahead of elections on Friday and Saturday – was a murky political plot, he suggested. “So it’s here. I had expected them to pull something out on me just before the elections in order to harm me and influence the Czech elections,” Babiš tweeted. He said he had never done anything “illegal or wrong”. “That does not prevent them from trying to denigrate me again and influence the Czech parliamentary elections.” Babiš did not deny the substance of the offshore claims. He conceded that a politician should not proceed in this way, but said he was not active in politics at the time. “Of course a politician cannot afford to do that, but I did the transaction 12 years ago,” he said. Czech police’s organised crime unit said it would investigate the disclosures relating to Babiš and about 300 other Czechs. There was a similarly unhappy reaction from the royal family in Jordan. On Sunday it emerged that the country’s ruler, King Abdullah II, had splurged $100m on properties in the US and UK, including a mansion in Malibu, California, and three houses in Belgravia in central London. All were concealed behind a dense web of shell corporations. In a statement, Jordan’s royal court dismissed the reports by the Guardian, Washington Post and other media as “distorted”. It said they “included inaccuracies and exaggerated the facts”. Identifying the properties’ addresses was “a flagrant security breach and a threat to His Majesty’s and his family’s safety”, it said, adding that the king had “personally funded” the purchases. In Ukraine, opposition politicians used the Pandora papers to attack the country’s comedian turned president, Voldymyr Zelenskiy. The data suggests Zelenskiy had an undeclared interest in an offshore company, which he secretly transferred to a friend in March 2019, weeks before winning power. The head of Zelenskiy’s office, Mykhailo Podoliak, dismissed the report and said the president had complied with anti-corruption laws. Zelenskiy’s predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, however, launched a furious attack in parliament. He said that thanks to Zelenskiy’s actions, Ukraine featured in world headlines as a place associated with global corruption and money laundering. No investigation was happening because the country’s SBU intelligence service was associated with Ukraine’s “top political leadership”, Poroshenko said. He added: “If anyone wants confirmation of this, I ask you to just look at the Guardian, El País , the Washington Post, Euronews, CNN, Deutsche Welle. The last place we can talk about this is the parliament. The leadership of the majority is trying to shut [us] up here as well.” Transparency campaigners urged politicians to act. “This is another shocking exposé of the oceans of money sloshing around the darkness of the world’s tax havens that must prompt immediate action, as has long been promised,” Susana Ruiz, tax lead for the global anti-poverty group Oxfam International, said in a statement. Alex Cobham, an economist and chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, said the “personal actions” of some in the leak were “shameful”. But he stressed: “Few of the individuals had any role in turning the global tax system into an ATM for the super-rich. That honour goes to the professional enablers – banks, law firms and accountants – and the countries that facilitate them.” European politicians described the Pandora papers as a “wake-up call” for EU finance ministers. They are poised to reduce the number of countries on an EU tax haven blacklist. Sven Giegold, a Green MEP, described the move as grotesque, absurd, and badly timed. He said a number of leading tax havens were missing from the list, including the British Virgin Islands, which features heavily in leaked files."

          "headline": "Met police tweets may encourage young people to carry knives, research finds",
          "bodyText": "Young people may be nudged into carrying knives by the police, research has found, as a new count showed the Metropolitan police circulated more than 2,100 images of seized knives on Twitter in a year. In the same period, three leading violent-crime prevention charities – Hope Collective, the Ben Kinsella Trust and Dwaynamics – circulated two images of knives between them, according to research by the Green party in the London assembly. “It’s deeply worrying to see police sharing such frightening images of knives when the charities involved in reducing knife harm don’t do this at all,” said Caroline Russell, a Green party assembly member who sits on London’s police and crime committee. “The disparity of approach is staggering, with the mayor’s own violence reduction unit sharing no images of dangerous knives.” According to the Greens, between July 2020 and August 2021, images of knives were published 612 times by Met borough accounts, 229 times by the Met taskforce, 82 times by the roads and transport command, 16 times by the firearms command and 15 times by the main Metropolitan Police Service account. Based on the average number of knife images posted by a sample of ward accounts from various boroughs, they estimated that local policing teams published a total of 1,176 images of knives. There has been a long-running debate around sharing images of weapons on social media. The Met says it publishes pictures of seized weapons to reassure the public that its officers are committed to tackling violent criminals. “We aim to include images of our officers in action showing the breadth of policing, alongside any images of weapons,” a spokesperson said. “This is not always possible. We always include wording which explicitly discourages weapon carrying and violence to accompany any imagery.” Critics have said the images contribute to a sense that the carrying of weapons is widespread. At a youth violence summit in London, an adviser to the city’s violence reduction unit said photos of blades could prompt young people to consider “upgrading tools”. That assessment seems to be backed by research published as a pre-print this month that suggests knife seizure images “potentially encourage knife-carrying”. Young people in Glasgow shown images of seized knives told researchers led by the University of Strathclyde that they thought the pictures contributed to a climate of fear and perpetuated negative stereotypes of certain groups and areas – although all said they were personally opposed to knife-carrying. Dr Charlotte Coleman, a psychologist at Sheffield Hallam University who was involved in the study, said the researchers questioned young people in high- and low-crime areas. “For those young people that were living in high-crime areas, they felt quite stigmatised by the volume of knife imagery that was flooding their area,” she said. Such images had the potential to frighten susceptible young people into carrying knives for self-defence, but equally others could be excited by them, prompting them to carry a knife because they thought doing so was “cool”, Coleman said. Regarding the Met’s use of images of seized knives, she said: “I find it concerning that so many images are used. It’s not just the 2,100 times that they are posted by the police, because they are posted and reposted. So, actually, the exposure becomes amplified by the number of shares.” People more worried or excited by knives were more likely to share, she suggested. There was a 31% year-on-year fall in knife offences recorded in London in the year to March. But an increase in the severity of attacks in early 2021 led to a rise in the number of killings by a quarter, and police have warned London could be on track for its worst year of young homicides since 2008. A Met spokesperson said: “The Met is an evidence-driven organisation, and that extends to the way in which we communicate with Londoners. We look forward to the results of this research being published in the coming months, which will help inform our approach moving forward.”"

          "headline": "Barnaby Joyce condemns ‘Spanish Inquisition’ Icac, saying it makes MPs ‘terrified to do their job’",
          "bodyText": "Barnaby Joyce has compared the New South Wales anti-corruption watchdog to the “Spanish Inquisition” and complained that it’s making politicians “terrified to do their job”. The deputy prime minister’s comments on Monday are the latest in a series of attacks on the Independent Commission Against Corruption following the resignation of Gladys Berejiklian on Friday. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, on Sunday questioned whether Icac should be made to hold initial hearings “behind closed doors” while former federal attorney general Philip Ruddock said the commission should act more like a director of public prosecutions, working privately to initially establish whether a person has a case to answer. Icac already has the power to conduct private examinations, which it regularly uses, including in Operation Keppel, the inquiry that is now examining Berejiklian. Joyce appeared on Channel Seven on Monday morning and took a swipe at Icac, saying it was working “very, very badly”. “This is not the great righteous process, it’s a little bit Spanish Inquisition. We elect politicians, not bureaucrats. People should be the final arbiter,” he said. “The bureaucracy reigns supreme here and politicians are basically terrified to do their job.” Speaking on the same segment, Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon also criticised the Icac, describing it as a “failed experiment” and “kangaroo court”. Fitzgibbon’s party holds a policy position of establishing a federal anti-corruption commission that has the power to conduct public hearings. Supporters of Icac says it draws significant strength from its ability to hold public hearings, which, apart from providing transparency, help to attract new witnesses and prompt additional lines of inquiry. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, also says there was no compulsion on Berejiklian to resign. Indeed, she decided to stay in the job during the previous hearings of Icac, when wiretaps recorded conversations with her ex-partner, the former MP for Wagga Wagga, about his efforts to secure money from a land deal near the Western Sydney airport. “She was not required to resign; she decided to resign,” Dreyfus said. “She could have decided not to do anything and toughed it out. Nothing in the legislation required her resignation.” Former Icac assistant commissioner Anthony Whealy told the Guardian on Friday that part of Icac’s fearlessness was built on the fact that state governments had not sought to make wholesale legislative changes to weaken it following corruption scandals. “I think that it’s a good thing that that hasn’t happened in NSW,” Whealy said. Icac has routinely warned that its funding model leaves it open to political interference. The chief commissioner, Peter Hall, has repeatedly warned state parliament that Icac needs an independent funding model to prevent yearly budget cuts from hampering its investigative ability. The criticism of Icac comes at a tumultuous time in NSW politics. Both Andrew Constance, a key moderate, and John Barilaro, the deputy premier, have announced they are quitting state politics. The former is running for the federal seat of Gilmore. Barilaro said he quit to give the state the chance for a new beginning. “I have decided now is the right time for me to hand the reins over to new leadership, and resign as deputy premier of NSW,” he said. Barilaro and Berejiklian’s resignations will trigger byelections in Monaro and Willoughby. Constance has committed to staying until the end of the parliamentary term."

          "bodyText": "Otherwise, that’s us – thanks for your company and enjoy the rest of the weekend. Ta-ra. But worry not, we’ve yet more ball for you – join Rob Smyth for Liverpool v Man City. Elsewhere, Wissa has scored in injury-time to put Brentford 2-1 up at West Ham, while Palace-Leicester has finished 2-2. That was an extremely enjoyable game – another extremely enjoyable game, because already this season we’ve had loads – with a shock result that was extremely well-earned. If West Ham carry on playing like that, they’ll cause every team bother, while City need a reset because they were poor today. City lose their second home game in a row! They now sit ninth in the table, while West Ham move up to fourth! 90+6 min We’ve seen this game so many times, a team sitting back then finding a way to score. But West Ham have done it so, so well, limiting chances without forgetting to create their own. OH MY DAYS! Hasegawa, who’s been really good when given the ball, puts Stokes under, and when the ensuing pass is short, she seizes upon it, taking a touch then clipping a luscious lob over Taieb to secure the points! West Ham have been perfect today! 90+3 min Now it’s Coombs trying her luck, driving from the edge, and again Arnold is equal to the effort, shovelling behind then flapping the corner clear. 90+3 min Greenwood plops up a dolly, lacking in pace and venom, so Arnold – who’s doesn’t need asking twice – comes for it and punches clear, again. 90+2 min I say that, but Cissoko sticks one on Shaw, so Greenwood will swerve in a free-kick 25 yards out, left of centre; Cissoko is booked... 90 min City win a corner down the left, Park with it, but it’s headed clear at the front post. We’ve not been told how long’s to go but West Ham are almost there. 90 min Hemp turns up in the middle, just outside the box, and she spins then clobbers left-footer that kisses the post! That’s a brilliant effort, but this is West Ham’s day! 90 min Beckie’s had a quiet second half but she’s trying her best to redeem that, sticking in a dangerous cross that’s cleared. 88 min There’ve been so many great performances from West Ham players today, and Arnold is one of them; this time, she saves from Shaw, turning her shot around the post, and the corner is eventually cleared. 88 min Hemp moves away from Brynjardottir and from the edge of the box tries to clip a finish back the other way to the far corner ... but Arnold dives to punch clear. 87 Beckie looks to find Park down the right, but puts too much on the pass, and it zips into touch despite her despairing slide. 86 min City were 1/12 to win today – I know this because they formed part of my accumulator. Happily, Ajax have ruined it for me already by losing at home to Utrecht. 84 min Flaherty walks to the side – she’ll be back when the ref waves her back – and this is a decent chance to mention how well she’s played today, controlling her team’s defence. Cissoko has also been terrific. 83 min Flaherty takes a ball to the phizog and sits down for a little r&amp;r. She’ll be fine, I think. 82 min West Ham have done a superb job shutting City down. Hemp missed a one-on-one just before the goal, but I can’t think of too many other opportunities allowed. 82 min Bowen has equalised for West Ham men, who are now level at 1-1 with Brentford. 81 min Another change for West Ham, Parker replacing Svitkova. 80 min Stokes finds space down the left and delivers a gorgeous low cross, but Shaw can’t quite reach it – I think she was on her heels there. 78 min Weir slides a ball into the box with Shaw and Hemp in pursuit, the latter deemed to have shoved Cissoko. That looked soft to me, but Cissoko takes the opportunity to resolve some cramp, eliminating time in the process. 76 min Unless White is injured, I’ve no idea why Taylor took her off. I mean I do, he wants to play 4-3-3, but there’s no point being implacably wedded to a formation because football is a dynamic game that requires different elements in different circumstances. One striker against three centre-backs doesn’t seem like the best odds to me, and 4-4-2 is a pretty good method against 3-5-2. 74 min The sun’s out now, so when Greenwood pumps a free-kick into the box, Arnold punches clear, then when the ball comes back she somehow slides in and clears with her foot! 73 min These last few minutes have been quiet, exactly what West Ham were after. 72 min And Palace have equalised against Leicester, Schlupp coming off the bench to score – and their first goal was bagged by Michael Olise, who also started as sub. 71 min Lucas Moura has put Spurs 2-1 up against Villa, who were level for about a minute. 69 min Goodness me, here come West Ham again, Hasegawa crossing for Yallop to cushion a header seeking the far corner ... which drifts only just wide. 69 min Shaw scored three in midweek so I’m not surprised to see her given a go, but am a bit surprised it’s instead of, not alongside White. 68 min A double change for City, Shaw and Stanway replacing Angeldahl and White. 67 min City look much livelier now and Coombs finds Angeldahl, who powers towards the box then shanks over the bar. 66 min At Spurs, Ollie Watkins has equalised for Villa, while Palace have halved their deficit against Leicester. 65 min West Ham need to just sit in here, but here’s Leon bustling through a pair of challenges and almost playing Yallop through as she scrabbles on the ground trying to find the poke that’ll stick her mate in. 64 min Here come City again, Weir driving through midfield and lamping a left-footer that flies over the top of Arnold’s bar. Give Ellen White chances and she’ll score! But this goal is all about Lauren Hemp, who chases back at Leon, unloads her, and slides a pass to meet the run, White pulling left then drilling a precise finish into the far corner from eight yards. She’s an expert! But an expert who strayed offside! 61 min Leon gets involved immediately, coming deep and turning to feed wide for Yallop. She sees Svitkova on the overlap, but Hemp tracks back well enough to stop collection of the pass. 60 min Change for West Ham, Leon replacing Walker – who’s seen little of the ball but put in some serious yards. 60 min West Ham are shutting down the spaces pretty easily now. 58 min But her they come again, Park whizzing down the right and crossing, only for White to make minimal contact with brow on ball, sending it skidding square rather than punished towards goal. 57 min Stokes does well to win the ball and Hemp sets off looking for a pass. But she wants it inside and it goes outside, thereby ending another City attack. 56 min Beckie wins a throw and uses it to find White, who tries to flick past Flaherty and spin, but the ball runs away from her. 55 min West Ham are seeking a second and Yallop finds Hasegawa at inside-left, but her shot is straight at Taieb, who saves at her near post. 53 min City look like a struggling side here. The cohesion isn’t there, but beyond that, they don’t have many players able to make a goal out of nothing – certainly not when compared to Chelsea and Arsenal. 52 min Cissoko, who’s having a fine game, is limping. I think it’s a knock rather than a pull, but we’ll see. 51 min City need to get White into the game but in the meantime, Angeldahl finds Coombs, who sticks a ball in behind for Park to chase ... but she can’t catch up with it, and West Ham will lap the ensuing goalkick right up. 49 min West Ham win a free-kick out on the left touchline, midway inside the City half, and Wyne swerves in a decent ball that’s just too high for Walker and Brynjardottir. But they were the two who really wanted it – City’s defenders did almost nothing to stop them. 47 min A cross from the right, aimed at White, makes its way through to Weir at the back post ... but from close range, she can’t quite wrap her foot around it, and Arnold makes another telling stop. 47 min This is a crucial 45 for City – if they can’t turn no points into three points, their title bid will be close to over, just five games into the season. 46 min City have made a change, Coombs replacing Walsh. 46 min We go again. That was a terrific half from West Ham, who’ve worked hard and kept discipline, denying City chances and space. Gareth Taylor has a lot of work to do. 45+1 min Faced up by Cissoko, Hemp bends a cross around her ... that Arnold flaps away effectively enough. 45 min There’ll be one additional minute. 45 min There’s much more intensity about City now, who could do without half-time. 44 min This is better from City, who gets bodies into the box as Park dips and wriggles to work a shooting opportunity, lifting her effort above Arnold, who does well to claw it away. 43 min But here they are now, Weir spreading to Park who shoots low and early, looking for the far corner ... but Arnold, who’s been excellent so far, watches it well to tip around the post. The resultant corner comes to nowt. 43 min City have really lacked zip so far today. They looked good for two or three minutes at the start, but otherwise there’s not been the coherence you’d expect. 42 min Jamie Vardy has put Leicester 2-0 up at Palace. 41 min That goal was the height of football, and the kind of thing you rarely get in other team sports because scores are too frequent – basketball – or the game is too physical – rugby. Well! Hasegawa crosses nicely from the right and at the back post, Brynjardottir does superbly to retain composure and head powerfully down, picking out the space between keeper and near post. City are in all sorts! 38 min More City pressure after a relatively quiet spell, White unable to direct a shot on target and another corner flying menacingly across the box. 37 min Aaaaarrrrggghhh! Flaherty looks to shove out to Wyne but doesn’t get enough on it and Hemp reads her intention, intercepting, mooching into the box ... and Arnold sprawls to save. She shouldn’t have smelt it, but. 36 min Somehow, City’s corner goes all the way back to halfway, but then they win a free-kick on the left touchline that Weir will mixer ... and someone, White I think, gets the first touch on it. But it’s a flick, so West Ham will clear via goalkick. 35 min Beckie is a good outlet for City and she gets away again, but Longhurst reads her shoulder-drop, following her outside after she feints inside and blockign behind to concede a corner. 34 min A little more West Ham pressure, Svitkova crossing from the right ... and missing everyone. 32 min Hmmmm, Park looks to hit the line and Longhurst, caught out, gently introduces her to the turf with a a little hand in the back. With VAR, that might be a penalty, but I can see why the ref said no without the security of being able to overturn the call. 31 min Iheanacho has put Leicester ahead at Palace. Follow that one here... 30 min Back in the Premier League Spurs have been second-best against Villa but lead thanks to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s goal. 29 min Nice, quick passing in midfield allows Hemp to nash down the left – she needs more of the ball really – but Cissoko does superbly to follow her, slide in, and not only win the tackle but a goalkick with it. 28 min West Ham are starting to fancy this and a poor clearance allows Brynjardottir to cross for Walker ... whose shot is blocked. That’s a warning. 27 min I know City are wedded to 4-3-3, but if I’m Gareth Taylor I’m thinking that 4-4-2 wouldn’t cede midfield control and would provide an additional target and presence in the box. 26 min City win another corner, this time down the left, but Park’s delivery isn’t as good this time and West Ham make first contact, Flaherty – I think – flinging a header clear. 24 min Bryan Mbuemo has given Brentford the lead away to West Ham. What a start to the season they’ve made and are making. 22 min A decent ball in from Park flies flat across the face of goal but there’s no one on-hand to stick it home. So City come again and Arnold does well to race out and smother at Weir’s feet as she chases a ball into the box. 21 min City work it left to right and Angeldahl tries a cross, which flicks off Wyne and wins a corner. 20 min City have done ok out wide, but they need more third-player runs from their midfield because White is isolated and fighting for balls across with at least 73 West Ham defenders. 19 min City will be low on confidence, so starting to wonder, and as I type that Scott ploughs through Brynjardottir, doing well to avoid a booking. 17 min Beckie is playing very high now, trying to work angles with Park. But West Ham are growing in confidence and starting to play a few passes of their own. 16 min City get the corner away easily enough. 16 min Stokes gives it away and Wyne sticks one in behind for Walker, forcing Greenwood to come across and block her shot behind for a corner. 14 min Weir and Walsh prompt, White coming deep to get involved in the play, but West Ham shut down the space well enough so that when she spins, there’s no angle to find her again. 13 min Hemp turns up on the right and burrows towards the box, but a bum touch allows Flaherty to unload her. 12 min That said, they’ll have taken 0-0 after 12. 11 min West Ham badly need to find themselves an out-ball, whether that’s playing into feet with Walker holding up or hoping Svitkova or Hasegawa can take it for a walk, because at the moment every time they get it away it comes straight back. 10 min Now here come City again, Weir releasing Beckie with a lovely ball inside Wyne, but the resultant cross somehow misses everyone in the middle ... then Hemp, arriving at the back post, can’t direct her effort goalwards. 9 min Stokes drives forward and wins a free-kick which goes wide to Beckie; she lumps it forward, but White can’t control on her chest and West Ham have a throw deep inside their own half. In the context, it’s a pretty decent goalscoring opportunity. 7 min West Ham are starting to press City’s defenders as little, but one straight pass from Angeldahl gets them out. As it goes, though, City might’ve scored twice in the first couple of minutes, but since then their possession has been largely unthreatening. 5 min I don’t think West Ham have had a touch in the City half yet. 4 min West Ham just can’t get out, Brynjardottir passing straight to Walsh when her team win the ball back. 4 min Yup, the pattern is set: City knocking it about, West Ham chasing the previous pass. 2 min Here they come again, Hemp again making ground down the left and sliding a low cross into White’s path, but she can’t quite catch up with it and West Ham have a goalkick. 1 min West Ham have been looking to start games more quickly this season, but it’s City who take the ball and keep it, probing for angles as Stokes releases Hemp. But he cross can’t find White, so City retrieve possession and build once more. 1 min Off we go! Right, here we go and here come the teams! Our game can be watched, for free, on the FA Player. That’s the good news, and the better news is that the muzak has started meaning coverage should soon be with us. My guess is that West Ham will stick with their 3-5-2 formation, so City will look for overloads out wide – they’ve got excellent full-backs in Beckie and Stokes, along with a striker who thrives on crosses. I’m sure Weir will be looking to play through midfield, but I’d expect the broad plan to focus on the flanks. Meanwhile in men’s Ligue 1, Rennes lead PSG 2-0 with only the dregs of injury-time left. Paris are sill six points clear at the top, but I’m not sure how you play Pochettino football with Neymar and Messi in your front three. We’ve also got some gee-gees. Elsewhere, Leicester are at Palace – you can follow that here: Emma Hayes is brilliant, part 903,792: Jonas Eidevall already looks an inspired appointment by Arsenal. Here they are yesterday. Already this weekend, Arsenal and Chelsea have won convincingly and look the class of this season’s field. City don’t quite have the firepower or options to rival them, while Manchester United are paying for the disrespectful shambles that prompted Casey Stoney’s resignation. City also smashed Leicester in their last game, 6-0 in the cup; they replace Stanway, Losada and Shaw with Stokes, Walsh and White as Gareth Taylor searches for the blend. West Ham make three changes to the team which beat Leicester 4-0 last time out. Parker and Leon drop to the bench, with Wyne and Svitkova, both of whom came on that game, replacing them. West Ham United: Arnold, Longhurst, Cissoko, Flaherty, Wyne, Stringer, Brynjarsdottir, Yallop, Svitkova, Hasegawa, Walker. Subs: Leat, Parker, Joel, Cairns, Filis, Leon. Manchester City: Taieb, Beckie, Scott, Greenwood, Stokes, Walsh, Angeldahl, Weir, Park, Hemp, White. Subs: Keating, Coombs, Stanway, Shaw, Kennedy, Mace. We’re only in the fourth weekend of the season, but this is an indisputably colossal match. Over the last few years, City have been a mainstay of the WSL, champions in 2016 and there or thereabouts most of the rest of the time. But last Sunday they were absolutely deconstructed by a rampant Arsenal having lost their previous game to Spurs and are already out of the Champions League, so desperately need to get themselves going. And they should manage that against a West Ham side still establishing themselves in the upper echelon of the game – the Irons have beaten Leicester, but drawn with Villa and lost to Brighton, all sides inferior to City – who gubbed them 5-1 in the cup. But they’ll know that this is a good chance to assert themselves, so will be ready to make things nasty. Kick-off: 2pm BST"

          "bodyText": "After I die, I want my ashes to be scattered in Pentre Ifan’s shadow. The scatterer will have to wait for a rare, windless day. It’s on those still days that the nearby hawthorn trees, the ones most exposed and bent nearly lateral by prevailing westerlies, can break your heart. They look ridiculous, like blown birthday candles perpetually being extinguished, gusted over to one side. When there’s no wind, you wonder why they don’t spring back up straight. But they never do. The hawthorns grow at a respectful distance to the west of Pentre Ifan. The horizon behind them is hitched to the sky by the largest “mountain” in west Wales: Carn Ingli, the Hill of Angels. It’s just 347 metres of ancient shield volcano, but it has a big reputation. They say if you sleep on its summit, angels will whisper their secrets in your dreams. Another version says the Earth will speak to you as you sleep. I’d rather hear what the bedrock has to say. Wales’ first national poet, Gwyneth Lewis, declares in six-foot letters on the slate facade of Cardiff’s Millennium Centre: “In these stones, horizons sing.” I’m American, but I’ve been listening to Welsh rock for well over 30 years. I first went to Wales as a graduate student in Lampeter, and felt instantly at home in the landscape. Friendships, familiarity with history, legend, even language, all came later, but the West Walian landscape sang to me immediately of belonging. The countryside seemed both familiar and important, even though I’d never been there before. Its hilly, treeless lucidity revealed how the earth had been made, by both men and glaciers. I felt I’d found the key to a map I’d carried in my head since I was a little girl, but because I’d always lived in cluttered places, had never been able to read. And until I could read that map, I’d had no sense of my or my species place on the planet. That’s how important Wales was for me – and I’m just describing the reactions of my first month! The highlight of my first month was a visit to Pentre Ifan in Pembrokeshire’s Preseli Hills. Pentre Ifan is a megalithic monument, which just means it’s a structure made of big rocks: six standing stones and a massive, horizontal capstone. The latter is delicately balanced more than two metres up in the air atop just three of the vertical stones – a fourth barely misses touching. The effect is of a laden tray carried on the fingertips instead of the palm of the hand. One of the remaining standing stones serves as a stationary door, and the other two huddle nearby in moral support. All are covered in generations of lichen that bristle atop one another, grey-on-grey, like big, dirty snowflakes. Pentre Ifan may also be called a cromlech, a prehistoric tomb, or a dolmen. It was built about 5,500 years ago, 1,000 years before the Egyptians started work on the pyramids at Giza. Wales’s “ancient” castles are just pop-up ruins by comparison. I live in the US but come to Wales every year to direct the Dylan Thomas Summer School creative writing programme. We often take the students to Pentre Ifan, no matter the weather. Perhaps because of its singularity, and the fact that I live most of my life elsewhere, the monument acts like a lightning rod to memory. I see the students photographing the dolmen, but I also see myself at 23, flirting with the young archaeologist who first took me there. Blink. I see myself at 30 with a different haircut and my now-longtime female partner, pretending the capstone is falling on my head. Blink. I see myself alone at 56, talking on the phone to my 95-year-old mother in the US, reminding her who I am. How about this: what if Pentre Ifan was originally built as a lightning rod to memory, exactly the way it still works for me today? Archaeologists have long thought of portal dolmens as tombs, though no trace of human remains has ever been discovered at Pentre Ifan. In Places of Special Virtue, their 2004 study of megaliths and the neolithic landscape of Wales, Vicki Cummings and Alasdair Whittle propose a different theory about Welsh megaliths in particular. What if portal dolmens such as Pentre Ifan were bookmarks in an origins story gleaned from the landscape? Comparing the settings of 104 monuments in Wales, Cummings and Whittle discovered that megaliths such as Pentre Ifan are geographic cruxes. From each a viewer can take in a range of distinctive landscape elements. Don’t think of Pentre Ifan as an end in itself, they say; think of it instead as a prompt to look out rather than in. A giant picture frame that draws together views of the Irish Sea, Carn Ingli, the Preseli Hills, and four rocky outcrops on the south-western horizon called Meibion Owen – Owen’s Sons. The Welsh landscape would have been more forested in Neolithic times, but these landmarks would’ve been visible through the trees, especially in winter. A radical idea, right? And why not? Cummings and Whittle suggest that in neolithic Wales, clans weren’t settled; they migrated seasonally, and dolmens such as Pentre Ifan acted as mnemonics for their storytellers, prompting tales about places and past. No one can be certain as to the megaliths’ purpose – that horizon of forgetting has disappeared over the rim of prehistory – but I believe this theory. In fact, I can enact it for you. If you stand to the east and look through Pentre Ifan’s great aperture, you’ll see Carn Ingli framed in the westward distance. I suggest hiking it – an hour up, a picnic, 45 minutes down. It offers a wonderful view of Cardigan Bay, and in certain weather, you’ll see sunbeams bent into rings around its summit as they refract in the mist. The fires of the gods of old. If you stand at the dolmen and gaze north, the Earth slopes down to form the great bowl of the Nevern valley, crowned by the blue blur of the bay. On the A487, nearly opposite the Pentre Ifan turning, is a signpost to Nevern/ Nanhyfer. I love the name in both languages. Nevern. It’s both promise and prohibition. “This way to never.” Go that way. You’ll come to a twilight of ancient yews – about 500 years old and famous for their blood-red sap – and just past them, in a churchyard, a 10th-century Celtic cross nearly four metres tall and swathed in neon-orange lichen. Then you’ll come to Saint Brynach’s church, founded in about 540, though the oldest element of the current structure is its 14th-century tower. I like to spend a quiet moment or two inside, my fingers tracing the Ogham inscriptions – its letters like rain slashes in children’s drawings – of a gravestone of the Romano-British worthy, Maglocunus, set into the sill of the south window. If you return to Pentre Ifan and turn east, you’ll be looking in the direction of Castell Henllys, an evocative reconstructed iron age village. And if you gaze south, you’ll see the Preseli Hills, original home of Stonehenge’s bluestones, riding earthen waves to the horizon. The Preselis offer some of the best hiking in Wales. My favourite trail is the seven-mile Golden Road, a 4,000-year-old ridgeway frequented by hikers and wild ponies, which extends between Crymych in the east and the Gwaun Valley in the west. Tradition has it that gold mined in Ireland’s Wicklow Hills was transported in prehistoric times via this route to England. When I last hiked it with friends from Swansea, their daughter Roísín declared it “The Main Street” of her Neolithic ancestors. At the centre of this compass is Pentre Ifan itself, my favourite place on Earth. Because I don’t live in Wales, I often feel hiraeth for the rootedness I sense in its presence – a chain of associations taking me back through my own past all the way to the stone age. Hiraeth is an untranslatable Welsh word meaning something like longing, or homesickness. I like to think of it as an acute presence of absence haunting the present moment. Over the past nine years I’ve been writing a memoir called The Long Field, which uses hiraeth as a lens to view Wales and my own life. In the book I say that I believe hiraeth is at the heart of Welsh culture. I don’t just mean that Wales has suffered many losses and absences; I mean that absence often becomes an engine for creative invention as well. Case in point: megaliths such as Pentre Ifan are monuments orphaned by time. Their meaning is absent to us now. And yet, that missing signification prompts archaeologists like Cummings and Whittle to wonder and, through their research, reimagine the past. It also prompts all sorts of folk tales to grow up around the monuments. At Pentre Ifan, the tradition is to make a wish beneath the capstone’s southern overhang. My wish is that we never solve the riddle of the megaliths. I never want to stop wondering. Pamela Petro’s The Long Field is out now (Little Toller Books, £20).

          "bodyText": "The Redfern Oval that Fran Grant remembers is long gone. The old hill into the ground and the cardinal and myrtle grandstand were pulled down years ago and replaced by a schmick $20m redevelopment that’s all clean lines and cool cement. The South Sydney Rabbitohs are long gone too, of course. Lured away like so many NRL clubs to the cavernous Olympic Stadium, where clubs don’t have to worry about pesky local council fees and instead get paid handsomely to play. Today the spiritual home of one of rugby league’s foundation clubs matches the profile of the largely gentrified inner-city suburb it has become; populated by designer dog walkers and gym-fit preeners. It was different when Grant was a kid. Along with her father, a member of the stolen generation, she remembers the raucous crowds, heady atmosphere, and the sense of belonging to something. “It was very working class, a poor area, but that never seemed to bother anyone,” she told the Guardian this week. The home of Australia’s first Aboriginal-run health and legal centres during the 1970s, the Block, TJ Hickey and Paul Keating’s Redfern speech, the suburb has for a long time been synonymous with Sydney’s Indigenous population. That intersection of politics and culture hasn’t escaped the Rabbitohs either, and the club’s history is over-stuffed with Indigenous icons such as Greg Inglis and Nathan Merritt. “But the fans were not only from Redfern, we grew up in Maroubra near the beach in public housing, it was just a great feeling being around people who not only loved the Rabbitohs but also our family. For all the Koori people there it was about being around your mob,” Grant remembers. “There was always a lot of Koori people there, I guess it’s important to keep in mind, Redfern was not an Aboriginal settlement per se, it was just where people came to be together, there was work there in the railways.” On Sunday night, the Rabbitohs will play the Penrith Panthers in the NRL grand final. It will be an event like no other in rugby league history. Sydney’s long Covid-19 lockdown saw the game shifted out of its heartland and into Queensland, which will play host to its first ever decider. The fraught relocation has made for a stunted build-up. While Souths’ last grand final appearance in 2014 seemed to prompt a week-long party, Redfern’s main strips, along with the southern beaches where its main fanbase exists, were quiet this week. So too out west, where fans have had to make-do with DIY pageantry, decking out homes in flags and banners. But beyond the jarring prospect of two Sydney clubs playing to an out-of-state crowd, there is a kind of symmetry in the game. Located at diametrically opposite ends of the stark geographic and class divide that separates Sydney, Souths may represent rugby league’s blue collar past but it is the Panthers who better embody it in 2021. “It was always a tough area,” 2003 Panthers premiership hero Luke Rooney says of the Penrith he grew up in. “But it was my kind of town. Growing up I didn’t know anything else, but there are a lot of beautiful people there and it’s all about rugby league.” Located in Sydney’s far west, the Panthers have never been a glamour club. When it joined the NSW rugby league in 1967, the club president owned a butcher’s shop, the vice president was a boiler maker, and one director’s profession was listed simply as “driver”. While the club may have lacked boardroom heft, its emergence from Sydney’s league obsessed, working class west meant it developed a production line of local talent. When Penrith won their first premiership in 1991, it was on the back of local products like Greg Alexander and Brad Fittler. So too in 2003, when Penrith juniors like Rooney and Luke Lewis became household names. The same has held in 2021 – much has been made of the fact many of the Panthers stars have played together since they were teenagers. “That’s the thing, we get this stigma in western Sydney of being bogans and maybe we sometimes live up to that stereotype, but the reality is the team is about locals come good,” life-long Penrith fan Ben Cummings says. “It’s awesome to see these guys who didn’t have everything gifted to them on a silver spoon,” he says. If a change has occurred, it has been in tandem with the cultural dynamic of the area. As western Sydney has become more diverse, so too has the talent pool of young and eager footballers. That has, in many ways, helped rugby league reflect the culture and background of its fans more effectively than its rival code in Victoria. While the Age recently reported that a swathe of the starting players in the AFL grand final were products of Melbourne’s elite private schools, many of the Panthers players have spoken at length about the role of rugby league in helping to navigate life in the hardscrabble Penrith suburbs of Mount Druitt and St Marys. Charismatic winger Brian To’o in particular has been open about the challenges in his upbringing. In 2019 he told the Daily Telegraph about his family not being able to pay for a headstone after his sister died of cancer at the age of eight. In that interview, he told the newspaper about missing out on birthday presents when money was tight. “But you go without,” he said at the time, “so your family can eat”. He used his Panthers contract to buy a headstone for his sister and, more recently, his match fees from State of Origin to help his parents buy a home. While league has a less than saintly reputation off the field, the presence of To’o and many other prominent Pasifika players among the Panthers means religion has also become a more central theme of the game. It has become common in recent years to see players in prayer huddles after games, and many of the players are open about the role of faith in their lives. “It is a good thing to see them practising their faith in the public arena, but also to see them on the field because it is inspiring to others,” Siona Vaelaa, the minister at the Samoa Worship Centre Christian Church in St Marys told the Guardian this week. “Especially young people who have no hope, who come from difficult backgrounds, it is very inspiring to see people that came from the same kind of place succeeding. “They had nothing too once, but they have done this. It really gives people hope that if those guys can do it, anybody can.” But this is rugby league, and if the game is inextricably linked to the class of its fans and players, it is also, at its core, a capitalist machine. The Panthers’ on-field success may be attributable to its thriving junior nursery, but off the field its financial heft is built on the same thing that most NRL clubs survive on: poker machine revenue. From the late ‘90s the club began merging with a series of clubs across Sydney and greater NSW. By 2020, the Panthers group reportedly controlled six licensed clubs raking in $150m, including annual poker machine revenue of $66m. It’s an association South Sydney have been one of the few clubs to successfully shed. Between the club’s last grand final victories in 1971 and 2014, Souths went from rugby league powerhouses to whipping boys, league rejects and then back again. After they successfully gained reinstatement following their ejection from the NRL in 2000, the new ownership of Hollywood actor Russell Crowe and casino mogul James Packer has seen the club attain the kind of cultural cache that other NRL clubs can only dream of. Crowe, in particular, has made the club fashionable by leaning into its storied history. The site of actress Natalie Portman at a Souths game this year was just the latest in a series of surreal moments for long-time Rabbitohs fans. For long-time fans like Josh Kemp, who was there at the very first meeting of Fightback campaign that saw Souths reinstated to the league, the change in stars still takes some getting used to. “Put it this way, I went to a school where it was predominantly [Canterbury Bull]Dogs fans and it was really, really unfashionable to support Souths,” he says. “I mean I was a proud Souths fan and I didn’t really care one way or another but we were getting belted every week and copping it, even in the fightback years it was not fashionable to support Souths. There were plenty of times at games where there were not many of us around.” But for all the changes to the club and its traditional heartland, Souths has maintained a connection with its roots. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Grant, who works for a major airline, was stood down along with thousands of other employees. Through the Rabbitohs not-for-profit public benevolent institution, Souths Cares, she was able to keep putting food on the table for her three children. “It obviously meant a pretty big adjustment for our finances, but they have been just fantastic in supporting us with things like produce boxes but just generally supporting the family and our daughter, checking in and making sure she’s doing OK,” she says. “I think that’s thing that matters most about sport to me, is the community feeling.”"

          "bodyText": "Compel action Dame Vera Baird Victims’ commissioner If we are to truly turn the tide of male violence against women and girls, we need to see the government compel the police to act. This starts with the government promoting tackling violence against women and girls to the status of a national strategic policing requirement. This would compel every force in the country to treat it with the same urgency and priority as terrorism and county lines. It would afford it more resources, co-ordination from the highest levels and true leadership. But change must start with the police. We know from recent investigations that over 800 allegations of domestic abuse have been made against police officers and staff over the past five years. Just 43 cases were prosecuted, demonstrating that police don’t recognise the problem in their own ranks – let alone treat it with the seriousness it requires. This has to change urgently. I’m afraid the burden now falls to the home secretary to force the police’s hand. Listen to us Evie Hairsine Founder of Our Bodies, Our Streets, a grassroots organisation in Sheffield I think the police need to put listening first and be more transparent about the fact that things are going wrong. They should open up to a women-led advisory coalition of groups working in this area and make themselves vulnerable to being told what they need to do. The biggest problem is within the police force itself. I think there should be immediate removal and suspension of any officer who’s suspected of committing an offence, before they do anything worse. I also think they need to make it a lot easier for officers to report suspected misogyny among their colleagues. More training would be good, too. Police should make sure their ideas are informed by victims or groups like ourselves, who are working on the ground. We’re trusted in our community and we can help. They should listen to us. We want to hold them to account. Change the culture Jess Phillips Shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding British policing needs to, for the first time ever, prioritise violence against women and girls and include it as serious violent crime, with all the prevention strategies and resources that come with that. Women’s complaints need to be handled better and more swiftly, with proper support. We also need more good old-fashioned community policing – the police need to go out and be visibly in support of women.Recruiting more women police would help, but it needs to be that when women police officers speak up, they don’t feel they’re risking their careers. Without a culture of transparency and whistleblowing, and proper systems in place to make sure that complaints will be listened to, we’re just encouraging more women to work in a difficult environment. So there needs to be a cultural change within the police. But the first thing they could do is take the crimes against us more seriously and not fail to take action against a police officer who’s flashing at people. Earn our trust Meena Patel Spokeswoman, Southall Black Sisters, a non-profit organisation supporting female victims of violence We see a lack of trust among women that the police will ever do anything. Victims need to be better informed about all actions that the police are taking and what’s happening to their cases. There are also problems about the way in which black and ethnic minority women are treated. The police need to ensure they are supported, as opposed to criminalising victims or asking them about immigration status. I’d like to see the police engaging more with grassroots organisations like ourselves. We could give them examples of good practice and show them how they should be helping women to feel safer. Police forces also need to demonstrate that they take robust action against officers when other officers complain about sexual assault or violence. If female officers don’t feel their complaints will be taken seriously, why would women outside the force feel they can trust the police? Improve vetting Susannah Fish Former chief constable of Nottinghamshire who suffered sexual assaults from colleagues We need a public inquiry, on a similar scale to the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, and the home secretary needs to prioritise violence against women and girls as a national threat. She should put it on the National Risk Register at the same level as terrorism, and then provide resources accordingly. The police selection process, which is sexist, racist and under-resourced, needs to change. We need a vetting process that probes individuals’ online presence and a recruitment and promotion process that properly tests their values and behaviours. Victims should be put at the heart of the investigation process. Forces should commission more independent domestic abuse advocates. They should investigate perpetrators, not victims. We also need to transform and support whistleblowing practices. At the moment, nothing stays secret and they’re rarely used, especially by frontline officers, who become vulnerable and isolated if they complain about a colleague."

          "bodyText": "When Karin Tamerius first started arguing with her elderly uncle about rightwing memes he was posting on Facebook, she surprised herself. She found herself launching personal attacks, making him feel he was objectively “bad” for holding certain beliefs – behaviors she knew through her work as a therapist were unfair at worst, and didn’t work at best. But she couldn’t stop herself. She felt she had a moral imperative to act, a compulsion to make the case for her side. In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Tamerius saw her uncle drifting into more extreme rightwing rhetoric thanks to his exposure to Fox, Breitbart and social media. They fought so much that eventually they stopped speaking. Then Trump won the election, and Tamerius began to question her approach to politics and her persuasion strategies. She started reaching out to her uncle and his friends to understand him – and half the country – better. Scouring through his Facebook posts, she found willing participants in conversations about gun policy and abortion and realized they had more in common than she imagined. She also realized how words had become a barrier between them. Using the term “gun control” could set people off, but making a small change – using the term “gun safety” instead – opened up the conversation. “The most important thing I learned was how much of the division between us is an illusion, that it has far more to do with speaking a different language and communicating poorly than then it does with an actual difference of opinion,” says Tamerius. Of course, there are – and should be – instances of irreconcilable differences. People shouldn’t have to debate their right to exist in the world as themselves; or whether they should be treated with respect and dignity. Racism is not a debate, for example, nor is being a trans person. Being open-minded isn’t the same as letting people with archaic ideas bulldoze a conversation. But Tamerius realized certain words she commonly leaned on – like “privilege”, or “triggering” – were creating a wall between her and those who weren’t as steeped in the discourse that came naturally to her. She started a Facebook group called Smart Politics to strategize how to have healthy political conversations with other left-leaning Americans. And that’s when the penny dropped: “We don’t just have trouble talking with people on the other end of the political spectrum,” she said. “We have trouble talking with people on the left.” Victims and villains While progressives desire ambitious, structural change, it’s surprising how often arguments descend over minutiae: the internet abounds with articles lambasting people for using the wrong terms, like “POC” instead of “bipoc” , or not recognizing one’s privilege before speaking up. Other times, people simply call something “problematic” rather than defining the actual criticism. While the right can cry wolf about “cancel culture” – many have landed lucrative book deals and TV slots after they complained about it – there is a valid reason to be wary of putting people off with words. If the left wants to ensure broad inclusion in political movements, it needs to talk to a broad range of people. The left increasingly finds itself dividing rather than building allies – the massive rift in the Democratic party between traditional liberals and the new left being a prime example. A 2017 Pew Research Center study tracking political typology in the US notes that while the gulf between values held by Democrats and Republicans is the widest in two decades, the fissures within both parties are also increasingly visible. The report outlines four distinct groups within the Democratic party: two are more affluent and mostly white, while two are less affluent, “majority-minority” groups. The two groups who are more affluent are more likely to believe that life in the US is better for people like them compared to 50 years ago, while the two other groups disagree. Concurrently, the influence of traditional Democratic constituents such as trade unions has waned , and blue collar workers typically aligned with the left were more likely to vote for Trump in the last election – especially those who are white. And yet, a persuasive left should be able to build unity with these groups, and to talk to the concerns of people who would benefit from their suggested reforms, such as higher minimum wages and universal healthcare coverage. Research on overcoming polarization might hold lessons for the left on how to have more meaningful conversations within its ranks. One of the problems at the root of conversational blocks is social media – and how we talk to one another when using it. Megan Boler, a University of Toronto professor who studies online polarization, likens social media to melodrama, inflamed by loaded words to create a cast of victims and villains. And, she adds, this tendency to simplify reality is spilling offline. The right and left are motivated by different aspirations. Researching polarization in the lead-up to the 2020 election, Boler found that while the right is driven by nostalgia – wanting to go back to a “simpler time” – the left is motivated by change, to ensure rights for all, whether that’s healthcare or fair wages. Researchers have found the right has a heavier hand in online polarization, but if those on the left want to mobilize against this highly organized rightwing media ecosystem, they will need to find a way to unite. Boler found that while distrust is a dominant emotion among the right, anger incites the left online. For those on the left, pithy statements on social media amplify this anger, and not always in useful ways. Discussion of complex issues like structural racism are reduced to retorts like “check your privilege.” When words like “privilege” first migrated from academic to mainstream discourse, it was an opportunity to have conversations about things like how your immigration status influences your earning potential, or how race affects educational opportunities. But academics unpack words over decades of research and hundreds of pages in books – 280 characters doesn’t exactly provide space for nuance. Closing ranks Peggy McIntosh, senior research scientist at the Wellesley Centers for Women, helped popularize the term “privilege”, describing it as “a combination of unearned advantage and unearned disadvantage in life” in a 2014 New Yorker interview. Race is one variable, but so is your body type, education level, your place of birth – and “it changes minute by minute, depending on where we are, who we’re seeing, or what we’re required to do,” McIntosh added. The concept requires deep reflection, to see how the systems around us are influencing us, how that shapes what we have access to and what we don’t. “Check your privilege,” by contrast, can shut down conversation by saying that having unearned advantages means you’re not allowed to have an opinion, rather than examining what others have to deal with in life to form a more informed opinion. Strict language policing has cropped up in part because the left has felt under attack for years, says Peter T Coleman, a Columbia professor who studies intractable conflict. Coleman found research from Michele Gelfand offered a compelling explanation for the increasing hostility within the left. Gelfand’s insight, as Coleman explains it, is that “when groups are under duress and threat, they tend to close ranks and have very clear norms. Violators of those norms are really shunned and shamed.” Coleman points out that even though Democrats won the 2020 election, the left and its values are still under fire: Fox News attracts the most viewers, abortion rights are being obliterated, and voter suppression tactics are being made law. This context creates a “tight culture” within the left that demands people in the group “fall in line.” While this behavior is motivated by the need to mobilize against an outside threat, ironically, it can result in arrested development. The other issue suffocating meaningful conversation is the adversarial nature of debate embedded in American culture. “Debate is a game to win,” says Coleman, who published The Way Out: How to Overcome Toxic Polarization earlier this year. “I’m listening to find flaws in your argument that I can weaponize against you to show you that I’m right.” That’s the opposite of dialogue, which, when facilitated properly, is a process of discovery and learning. Dialogue is what Coleman and his colleagues try to cultivate at the Difficult Conversations Lab at Columbia University. The lab facilitates conversations between people on opposing sides of divisive issues, like abortion and gun control, and studies the results. Researchers track participants’ emotions – asking them to listen to audio of the discussion, to follow what their emotions were like throughout the conversation. Coleman is a fan of “complicating the narrative”. Instead of pitting someone who is anti-abortion against someone who is pro-choice, the lab would frame abortion as a “highly complicated, nuanced, personal set of decisions” that has medical, religious, health and gender equity implications. The pair is then asked to create a statement they can agree on from their conversation. Participants report a variety of emotions – they can move from negative emotions towards their partner to thinking huh, that’s a good point they made. And while participants still advocate for their position, in conversations that lead to a shared understanding, people tend to ask more questions, such as, “Can you explain that?” or “Tell me more about what you mean.” He also found that those who have a high degree of complexity in their own lives – for instance, who have friends across religious and political stripes – are able to have richer conversations. Cultivate curiosity, and really listen Tamerius learned that curiosity was the key to repairing her relationship with her uncle. She learned more about his views by approaching conversations as she would as a therapist: guided by questions while being supportive. Within a month, she saw a difference. She offered to look into memes when he wasn’t sure of the source, for instance, and he would delete ones associated with white nationalists. Soon, he started to post doubts about Trump – like wishing Trump would tweet less. “He didn’t feel like he had to always defend his initial position,” Tamerius says. Her uncle died soon after Trump was inaugurated, but those conversations led her to build Smart Politics into an organization that holds workshops and is her full-time job. While other organizations working at depolarization are explicitly nonpartisan, like Braver Angels, Tamerius is transparent about her partisan agenda: she wants liberals to be more effective in persuading people. “I want people to feel like it’s OK to advocate for what you believe in,” she says. “But it turns out the way to do that is actually to listen to what they have to say and connect with them around it.” John Regalado grew up in a household that listened to Rush Limbaugh in a suburb outside Denver, but working as a video journalist for a left-leaning series at Univision, he knew there were large parts of the country his work wouldn’t speak to. So he started working on a web series called Middle Ground, which brings together six people on opposing sides of issues like gentrification and immigration. Regalado’s first assignment was in Jerusalem, bringing together Palestinians and Israelis to discuss the conflict. Prompts guide the conversations – each participant stands when hearing the prompt, and if they identify with it, they take a seat to discuss it, and eventually the others also join in. The first prompt was: “Someone I know has died because of this conflict.” Five out of six participants took a seat, and shared who they had lost. Even though it quickly became clear even within this small group that the Palestinian side suffered at a different scale, the conversation allowed participants to connect around the impact of their losses. The prompts are designed to be simple jumping off points for discussion, not clearcut political statements where it’s obvious who will agree or disagree. While there are heated moments in that first episode Regalado directed, at the end of it the participants all chose to hang out and share a meal together. It’s clear when watching the show that when participants try to convince or lecture others, walls come up. And research shows that most people aren’t looking to be persuaded. Tamerius likens the mind to a fortress, trying to protect its existing way of understanding the world. But there are still ways to effectively talk about subjects with those seemingly on the “other side”. Tamerius has co-written two bots for the New York Times that model conversations on polarizing subjects. Her most recent, on how to speak with people who don’t want a vaccine, opens with a friend texting that getting a Covid vaccination seems like a “bad idea”. The bot then prompts you to choose a response: one is an answer you know is wrong (“Are you an anti-vaxxer?”), the second is a more subtle form of persuasion (“Covid is scarier”), and the third is a question (“You’ve heard some things that make you worried and unsure?”). When you click on your favored response, you’re told why it’s a good or less effective choice. The third one is the best choice because people want to feel heard – so instead of spamming someone with links to convince them that vaccinations are necessary, first hear where their fear comes from. Tamerius often gets comments from people who say they know what the right answer is, but just can’t stop themselves and choose another. “That is exactly what [it’s] like when you’re in a conversation,” she said. “The responses that are counterproductive or emotionally gratifying are kind of like the junk food of political discourse.” When you don’t have a bot to help you along in those moments, Tamerius suggests two things. First, change the way you think about the other person. “Stop thinking about the other person as ‘them’, and immediately start thinking in terms of ‘us’,” she advises. And second, listen. But, like, actually. “That doesn’t mean listen to respond; or listen to rebut; or listen to reply – or God forbid, listen just to take turns talking,” she says. “It means listening to understand – until the other person feels heard, not until you feel like you’ve heard them.” Intellectually, it makes perfect sense. But practically, how do you avoid reaching for the gratifying junk food when you’ve been fed a steady diet of it for a decade? “You’ve got to set the intention and work at it,” says Tamerius. “Over time, it builds into habit.” This article was amended on 5 October 2021 to clarify the findings of the 2017 Pew study."

          "bodyText": "Sorry kids, no carefully curated data-extraction experience for you quite yet. On Monday, Facebook announced that it is “pausing” controversial plans to create Instagram for Kids, a version of its photo-sharing app designed for children under the age of 13. Does this mean Facebook has realised that it might not be in children’s best interest to hook them into social media at a tender young age? Has the company decided to put people above profit? Don’t be silly! The reason the tech giant has paused the project is because we idiots in the media misunderstood it, apparently. In an almost comically condescending blog post and series of tweets, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri explained that the company stood by the need to create a social media “experience” for children. Alas, he said, news about the project leaked before it had figured out all the details. “People feared the worst, and we had few answers at that stage. It’s clear we need to take more time on this.” I wonder whether Mosseri has taken time to ponder why so many people feared the worst when they saw the cursed phrase “Instagram for Kids”? Could it be because Facebook, which bought Instagram in 2012, has given us umpteen reasons to fear the worst? The extensive coverage of Facebook being cavalier with people’s data and being used to incite violence and undermine democracy? Could it be a reaction to the Wall Street Journal’s recent report suggesting Facebook was aware that Instagram was “toxic for teen girls” but “made minimal efforts to address these issues and plays them down in public”. According to the WSJ, an internal Facebook presentation from 2019 noted that “we make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls”. Another slide said: “Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression.” I wonder whether the next slide said: “And this is why we really ought to make an Instagram for Kids!” Facebook has denounced the reporting. While it concedes teen girls have said Instagram made their body image worse, the company asserts: “Many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced.” It has been a long time since I was a teenage girl, and I can’t speak for today’s kids. But I can tell you this: I am incredibly thankful that I grew up before social media became ubiquitous. I had a pretty severe eating disorder when I was a teenager and I often wonder whether I would have recovered if I had lived in a world with Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok; an image-obsessed world of likes, retweets, follower counts and filters. I managed to recover from my illness, in part because I was strict about not weighing myself; I forced myself to stop boiling my self-worth down to a number. But while it’s fairly easy to avoid scales, it’s almost impossible to avoid modern technology. I am not saying that Instagram is an unmitigated evil. Like most things in life, it has positive and negative applications. However, it has become increasingly evident that Instagram can be addictive and damaging; that the compulsion to use social media has similarities to that of highly regulated substances such as tobacco and alcohol. And as the comparisons to big tobacco gain traction, so do calls for social media to be subject to an age restriction of 18 (most platforms currently permit 13-year-olds). Frankly, I don’t think enforcing an age limit for Instagram is any more useful than creating an Instagram for Kids. Age limits are not the answer; accountability is.

          "headline": "Pinker’s progress: the celebrity scientist at the centre of the culture wars",
          "bodyText": "On a recent afternoon, Steven Pinker, the cognitive psychologist and bestselling author of upbeat books about human progress, was sitting in his summer home on Cape Cod, thinking about Bill Gates. Pinker was gearing up to record a radio series on critical thinking for the BBC, and he wanted the world’s fourth richest man to join him for an episode on the climate emergency. “People tend to approach challenges in one of two ways – as problem-solving or as conflict,” Pinker, who appreciates the force of a tidy dichotomy, said. “You can think of it as Bill versus Greta. And I’m very much in Bill’s camp.” A few weeks earlier, Gates had been photographed in Manhattan carrying a copy of Pinker’s soon to be published 12th book, Rationality, which inspired the BBC series. “We sent it to his people,” Pinker said. Pinker is an avid promoter of his own work, and for the past 25 years he has had a great deal to promote. Since the 1990s, he has written a string of popular books on language, the mind and human behaviour, but in the past decade, he has become best known for his counterintuitive take on the state of the world. In the shadow of the financial crisis, while other authors were writing books about how society was profoundly broken, Pinker took the opposite tack, arguing that things were, in fact, better than ever. In The Better Angels of Our Nature, published in 2011, he gathered copious amounts of data to show that violence had declined across human history, in large part because of the emergence of markets and states. Understandably, the book struck a chord with people who move markets and run states. Gates called it “the most inspiring book I’ve ever read”, and Mark Zuckerberg included it on a list of what to read at Davos. Then, in 2018, at the height of Donald Trump’s presidency and amid the accelerating climate crisis, Pinker published a follow-up, Enlightenment Now, which expanded his argument. It wasn’t just that life had become less violent; thanks to the application of science and reason since the 18th century, the human condition had dramatically improved in health, wealth and liberty, too. Bill Clinton had Enlightenment Now on his bedside table, and Gates declared it his “new favourite book of all time”. “Bill’s got a pretty nimble mind, so I think he can riff on anything,” Pinker said, imagining how Gates would fare on the radio show. He was looking out over Cape Cod Bay from the upper deck of his house, which he shares with his wife, the philosopher and novelist Rebecca Newberger Goldstein. From the bottom deck, a staircase of more than 100 steps runs down to a beach, like one of Pinker’s trademark graphs depicting the decline in some measure of human misery. Pinker sees the world in broadly utilitarian terms. “A quantitative mindset, despite its nerdy aura, is in fact the morally enlightened one,” he writes in Enlightenment Now. On this basis, he has ranked Gates, who has spent roughly $50bn on philanthropy, near the top of a moral hierarchy crowned by people such as Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Peace prize-winning agronomist credited with saving more than a billion lives through his innovations in agriculture. Pinker’s positive spin on the world has brought him into the orbit of many powerful people. On his phone, under the heading Politicians, he keeps a list of the two dozen or so heads of state, royalty and other leaders who have asked him for an audience. They include the prime minister of his native Canada, Justin Trudeau (“That was the greatest thrill for a Canadian boy”) and Mauricio Macri, then the president of Argentina (“I got to stand on the Evita balcony”). In 2016, Pinker co-authored an article for the New York Times with Colombia’s then-president, Juan Manuel Santos, two months before Santos won the Nobel Peace prize for helping to end the country’s 50-year-long guerrilla war. He has twice been a guest at Bohemian Grove, which has been described as an off-the-record summer camp for male members of the American establishment. He told me he had met some amazing people there, like Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, the former secretaries of state to Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, respectively. He seemed to enjoy both the absurdity of the experience and its purpose – to bring powerful people into contact with one another. Pinker says he offers these global leaders “an infusion of ideas – or even just enthusiasm for good, old-fashioned liberal democracy”. That means “a mixture of civic norms, guaranteed rights, market freedom, social spending and judicious regulation,” as he put it in Enlightenment Now, all held together by a state strong enough to keep people from each other’s throats. He believes the balance of these elements should be cautiously tweaked and twiddled through experimentation and empirical feedback. In the case of the western world, this roughly translates to the view that things are pretty good, which isn’t to say they couldn’t be better, and although there are threats to face, we shouldn’t burn the system down, because things could certainly be a whole lot worse, and if we can make incremental improvements, then a rising tide will lift all boats. It’s a position that Gates, in a conversation with Pinker and the New York Times, called the “conservative centre”. In the eyes of his critics, this stance has made Pinker the world’s most prominent defender of the status quo. At a time of rising inequality and ecological catastrophe, his prescription for the world – do basically the same thing we have been doing, just a bit better – can seem perverse. To less optimistic observers, the existence of billionaires such as Gates – he and seven other men own as much wealth as the planet’s poorest 3.5 billion people, according to a recent Oxfam estimate – indicates a profound rot in the current arrangements of civilisation. The writer Pankaj Mishra has called Pinker a member of the “intellectual service class”, which shuffles about justifying the positions and soothing the moral sensitivities of society’s winners. Nicolas Guilhot, a professor of intellectual history at the European University Institute, believes that Pinker is fighting a somewhat desperate rearguard action on behalf of neoliberalism against an encroaching army of detractors across the political spectrum. Pinker’s books, and their support from the likes of Zuckerberg, Clinton and Gates, are a reaction, Guilhot told me, “from people who are aware that they’ve lost a lot of ground”. * * * Despite his preference for problem-solvers over conflict-mongers, a strong case can be made that Pinker belongs in that second camp. “Sometimes to my own retroactive surprise, I seem to have a taste for controversy,” he recently told Steven Levitt, the economist and author of Freakonomics. A search for Pinker’s byline on the newspaper archive site Nexis returns 191 articles since 1994, with headlines that reflect the breadth of his interests, as well as an inclination to provoke: Why Can’t a Woman Be More Like a Man?, Sniffing Out the Gay Gene, Nuclear Power Can Save the World, The Enlightenment Is Working. Over the course of his career, the subjects of his major books have expanded from language to the mind, and from human behaviour to the sweep of history. Each new topic has taken him further from the fields in which he did original research, and each new book has seemed more eager than the last to start a row. In recent years, Pinker has carved out a niche for himself as a pundit who brings social science to the culture wars. He comes to these conflicts armed with the rhetorical skills of the debate champion and the visual aids of a management consultant. By some metrics, it is a winning strategy. He makes liberal use of graphs and charts in his recent books – there are about 180 in Better Angels and Enlightenment Now – and helped to create Google Books’s ngram viewer, which plots the frequency of words and phrases in the English corpus, among other languages. His own ngram results put him below Richard Dawkins and Noam Chomsky, two of his major intellectual influences, but above Yuval Noah Harari and Jordan Peterson, to whom he has been compared. (Google Trends, which tracks more demotic kinds of interest, in the form of search queries, puts Peterson on top by a significant margin.) As a young scholar in the 80s, Pinker was distinguished more for his insights into language acquisition and visual cognition than for his willingness to plunge into acrimonious debates over gender, race and progress. His life in the public eye began in the early 90s, when an editor at a scholarly journal told him he wrote stylishly, and suggested he try doing it for a broader audience. Not long afterwards, he spoke to the philosopher Daniel Dennett, who had recently made the leap from academic to mainstream writing. “Within 40 seconds of hanging up with Dan, the phone rang and it was his literary agent, John Brockman, on the line,” Pinker told an interviewer in 2001. The initial outcome was The Language Instinct, a wide-ranging account of the nature of language, published in 1994, which combined easy-to-follow discussions of Chomskian linguistics with evolutionary theory and jokes from Woody Allen. A quarter of a million copies have been sold. When I suggested that he must have been gobsmacked by his sudden transformation from research scientist into public intellectual, Pinker demurred. “I had seen the success of Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, and realised that no one had yet done the same thing for language or cognitive science,” he said. “So I was prepared for it to be popular.” The section of The Language Instinct that garnered the most attention happened to be its most acerbic one, a chapter chiding rule-bound grammar bores. Its popularity seems to have emboldened the contrarian in Pinker. In 1997, he published How the Mind Works, which he framed as a critique of what he called the “standard social science model”, according to which nurture explained almost everything, and nature almost nothing. The next year, Pinker sold out one of London’s largest lecture halls for a debate about the book’s thesis. “Not every academic who has the chance to speak to large audiences enjoys it in the same way,” says Ravi Mirchandani, who was Pinker’s UK publisher in the 90s, and who also published Richard Dawkins at the time. Before the debate, a journalist asked Pinker about his treatment of academic orthodoxies. “I suppose I do line them up and mow them down,” he replied, while mimicking firing a machine gun. By the time of The Blank Slate, which came out in 2002, Pinker was positioning his work as an attack on what he considered the three central dogmas of the “intellectual establishment” in academia and the media – that there is no such thing as human nature, that our minds are somehow separate from our bodies, and that people are born good. By contrast, he held that quite a number of traits are universally human, that the mind is an information processing system running on the unique hardware of the brain, and that, whatever good we’re capable of, the basic condition of humanity, to paraphrase Thomas Hobbes, his favourite political philosopher, is a war of each against all. Those first popular books irked their fair share of reviewers and academics, especially on the left, who feared that Pinker’s debatable scientific interpretations had unsavoury political implications. But the real turning point in his career arrived in 2007, in the form of a simple question: “What are you optimistic about?” The prompt was part of an annual symposium for the website Edge, run by Pinker’s literary agent, Brockman. Pinker’s 678-word answer was that violence had declined across human history, an argument he expanded over the next four years into the 696-page book Better Angels. “A large swathe of our intellectual culture is loth to admit that there could be anything good about civilization, modernity, and western society,” Pinker wrote in the book. Around the same time that he was researching violence, Pinker was beginning to see himself as having a particular role to play in public life – not just as a talented explainer of science, or even a critic of intellectual orthodoxies, but as someone who could stand athwart the stupidification of public discourse. “I came out of the closet as a defender of reason and objectivity,” Pinker told the Times. The major result of this decloseting was Enlightenment Now, which he described to me as his “theory of everything, or almost everything, or at least a lot”. In the book, he argues that, along with liberalism, the Enlightenment gave rise to three main values – reason, science and humanism – that led to the massive improvements he charts in the human condition. These improvements were not only material but moral, as people began to expand their circle of moral concern to those beyond their own family, tribe, nation or species. It was his wife, he said, who convinced him that these values were “worth singling out and defending”. Since Enlightenment Now came out, in early 2018, Pinker has been engaged in almost unceasing conflict with what he considers his many intellectual enemies, who include intellectuals (“intellectuals hate progress”), progressives (“intellectuals who call themselves ‘progressive’ really hate progress”), and universities full of progressive intellectuals (a “suffocating leftwing monoculture”). He has also taken aim at postmodernism (“defiant obscurantism, dogmatic relativism, and suffocating political correctness”), a stretch of the green movement running all the way from Al Gore to the Unabomber (“quasi-religious ideology … laced with misanthropy”), contemporary identity politics (“an enemy of reason and Enlightenment values”), and the many people who “lack the conceptual tools to ascertain whether progress has taken place or not”. In these conflicts, Pinker sometimes presents himself as the lone contrarian in a sea of irrationality. He has written in the past that arguments that are “completely reasonable to me, yet blazingly controversial to everyone else” are “the story of my life”. * * * This summer, I flew to Provincetown, on Cape Cod’s northern tip, to observe up close the intellectual habits of a man considered by some to be one of the most influential thinkers of our time. I arrived on a warm morning at the start of tourist season, and when Pinker picked me up he had the top down on his Volvo convertible. Provincetown has long been a summer resort, especially for LGBTQ people; it is the sort of liberal idyll – commerce meets individual rights meets cappuccinos – that Pinker extols. Fourth of July celebrations had ended the previous day, and the clothing boutiques and cafes along the main drag were festooned with American flags and pride banners. Men in thongs with tanned pectorals cycled by the waterfront. Pinker recognises the dangers of being trapped within the comfortable perspective of such a comfortable world. The antidote, he says, is an empirical mindset. In Rationality, he notes that in 2019, following the first shark fatality in Massachusetts in 80 years, towns up and down the Cape invested in expensive shark warning and control measures, even though car crashes kill 15 to 20 people there every year, and “cheap improvements in signage, barriers and traffic law enforcement could save many more lives at a fraction of the cost”. That actuarial approach to human life has caused some to think he is bloodless, which he is not. He loves classic rock, says his favourite genre of movie is the concert film or rock documentary, and has watched The Last Waltz, about the largely Canadian band the Band, at least a dozen times. He is a keen landscape and wildlife photographer. “He just takes an infinite delight in the world as it presents itself,” his mother, Roslyn, told me. Pinker began his training as an experimental psychologist in the mid-70s, and spending time with him is a little like auditing Intro Psych, which he has taught every year at Harvard, and before that MIT, for the past 25 years. No matter the topic of conversation, he will reach for a wider theory or study to explain it: the universality of facial expressions, the roots of physical attractiveness, the moral awe people feel for Noam Chomsky, why zebras have stripes. He likes to divide the world into opposing forces or tendencies: he has written that there are two basic intellectual cultures, two fundamental political outlooks, two types of declinism, two flavours of pessimism, two sides to happiness, two ways to get something you want from other people, two ways to appreciate the world’s progress, and two forms of politicisation subverting reason today. When we stopped to order sandwiches at a deli in the small town of Truro, he brought up a study from the 80s that identified two species of vegetarian – those who eschew meat for moral reasons, and those who do it for health. Pinker, who ordered a smoked turkey sandwich with muenster cheese, described himself as a “reducetarian” and reckons that, morally speaking, he probably shouldn’t eat meat. (If he could choose his final meal, he told the aspiring jet-setter’s magazine Monocle, it would be a rib steak, beer and bottle of San Pellegrino at the Brooklyn steakhouse Peter Luger.) We ate our sandwiches on the upper deck of his house. The conversation bounced from his book sales (higher per capita in the UK than in the US) to people’s irrational fears about nuclear energy (“Chernobyl killed about as many people as coal emissions kill every day”) to Woody Allen (“Can you mention Woody Allen these days? I think you can mention Woody Allen. For one thing, he was almost certainly innocent”). Afterwards, Pinker showed me his study, where a large swathe of fabric the colour of snooker baize hung. When the coronavirus pandemic closed the university, he decamped to the Cape, and delivered his lectures for Intro Psych online. “I put my slides behind me on the green screen so I could point at them like a weatherman,” he said. He has described himself as “a modern lecturer-entertainer, with bullet points, borscht belt humour and audiovisual razzle-dazzle”. On a nearby shelf was a small bag filled with fake cockroaches and a curl of plastic dog poo. “For my lecture on disgust,” he said. Pinker is not only a scientific showman; he is also a willing guinea pig. By his own admission, he does not shy away from self-revelation. He has an MRI scan of a sagittal section of his brain on his website, and has had his genome sequenced and posted online, along with his medical history (basal cell skin cancer, 1995; Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, 2010; blood type, O+). According to genetic tests published in 2012, he shares significant amounts of DNA with his longtime friend the Harvard law professor and Trump impeachment lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and with the conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks, with whom he also shares significant parts of his worldview. Having toured the house, Pinker and I suited up for a bike ride. “I like to go fast,” he told me. He rides a several-thousand-dollar carbon frame, which he bought secondhand on eBay. For many years, he used to check the weight of everything that went on his bike, including his water bottle. “It was truly obsessive compulsive, because we know that, when it comes to speed, aerodynamics are a far bigger factor than weight,” he said. Before the advent of GPS tracking apps, he used to measure his routes out on a map and record his rides in a journal. He still weighs himself every morning. “We’re a pair of Mamils,” Pinker joked as we cycled out of his garage. “Middle-aged men in Lycra.” I added that we were Weird, too. (The acronym – which stands for western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic – is drawn from the work of Joe Henrich, the chair of evolutionary biology at Harvard, and several of his colleagues. They have criticised behavioural scientists for routinely publishing “broad claims about human psychology and behaviour” based only on samples from Weird societies.) “Right,” Pinker said, before plunging down his steep drive. * * * Later that afternoon, Pinker and I arrived at a pair of graveyards flanking the Truro Meeting House, a converted church where he was due to give a talk on Rationality the following week. In one of the burial grounds was a modest obelisk commemorating an 1841 gale in which 57 of the town’s fishers died. Many of the other old graves contained children. Since the 19th century, child mortality has plummeted a hundredfold in the developed world, Pinker writes in Enlightenment Now. Up the road, in another cemetery, he had once taken a photograph of the tombstone of a father and his five-day-old son. The inscription read: “O Death all Eloquent how dost thou prove / What dust we dote on when we creatures love.” “You need these slices of life to reassure you that the data is not off the mark,” Pinker said of the graves. From a Pinkerian perspective, the story of his own family is the story of modernity’s rising trend lines. He was born in Montreal in 1954 in a community of Jewish refugees. His maternal grandmother lived through the Kishinev pogrom in what is now Moldova, in 1903; his paternal grandmother’s entire family was annihilated in the Holocaust. In Montreal, Pinker’s father lived in what Pinker described as “the most oppressive immigrant poverty”. Eventually, several of the men in the generation above Pinker started flourishing businesses. “I am not the descendant of a long line of rabbis (as an improbably large proportion of Jews claim to be),” Pinker has written, “but of makers or sellers of gloves, neckties, auto parts and women’s garments; I grew up with the belief that God made the Jews as a light unto the nations, and made the gentiles because someone had to buy retail.” In kindergarten, Pinker’s teacher told his mother that he was “the smartest kid she ever taught,” Roslyn recalled. “I came home and said to my husband, ‘You’ll never believe this.’ That was the first time I had thought anything about it.” As a child, Pinker read the encyclopedia cover to cover. As he grew older, his outlook on the world was shaped by the cold war and the domestic upheavals of the 60s. He has said that the first historical event he can recall is the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, and that he can still feel the dread he experienced hearing radio tests of the air-raid siren. It was a politically fraught time in Montreal – a militant leftwing nationalist movement was agitating for the rights of Quebec’s oppressed French-speaking people – and discussions in the Pinker household would often turn on fundamental questions. There were arguments about whether humans were essentially brutish or noble, whether, if left to their own devices, they would devolve into violent anarchy or self-organise into a communalist utopia. Pinker engaged in these debates, but was not exactly a partisan, he told me. “A lot of people would say, ‘I went through my Marx, Rand, Mao, whatever phase,’” he said. “But I was never an ideologue.” In The Blank Slate, he tells a slightly different story, perhaps for effect. “As a young teenager in proudly peaceable Canada during the romantic 1960s, I was a true believer in Bakunin’s anarchism,” he writes. “I laughed off my parents’ argument that if the government ever laid down its arms all hell would break loose. Our competing predictions were put to the test at 8am on 7 October 1969, when the Montreal police went on strike. By 11.20am, the first bank was robbed. By noon, most of the downtown stores were closed because of looting. Within a few more hours, taxi drivers burned down the garage of a limousine service that competed with them for airport customers, a rooftop sniper killed a provincial police officer, rioters broke into several hotels and restaurants, and a doctor slew a burglar in his suburban home.” Pinker concludes: “This decisive empirical test left my politics in tatters (and offered a foretaste of life as a scientist).” But somewhat contrary to this tale of dark human instincts run riot, the Canadian historian Bryan Palmer told me that much of this violence was motivated by the political grievances of the Quebecer minority, and was targeted at Anglo businesses like the limousine service, which was given preferential treatment by the city government. The “sniper” was a security guard from the limousine service who fired a shotgun into a crowd. In 1976, when the cold war was still hot, Pinker began his graduate studies at Harvard, in the department of psychology. He went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT, where in 1982 he became a professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences. Pinker’s views of the era in which he grew up and trained as a scientist seem to have stuck with him. In Better Angels, he charts a spike in homicide rates in the 60s that lasted for a generation. He told me this was due to the “depravity that was unleashed” in that decade. “The 60s were a temporary local reversal of the civilising process,” he said, referring to the historical theories of the sociologist Norbert Elias, whose work influenced Better Angels. “If you defy the norms of bourgeois propriety, you’re going to have a lot of macho violence, and in the 1960s it was the bourgeois vision of the nuclear family that we had a lot of contempt for.” Pinker has always searched for universals – the underlying structure shared by all languages, the behaviours practised by all cultures, the traits shared by all minds. In his telling, history, too, revealed basic lessons of human nature. Scoured of its particular economic and political conditions, it had been transformed into a kind of parable. * * * The day after our bike ride, Pinker and I scampered down a short embankment dotted with poison ivy and put in to the little Pamet River in a tandem kayak. I had forgotten to change for the excursion before leaving my rental, so I was wearing an old pair of Pinker’s shorts. We were not far from the mouth of the river, where Pinker proposed to Goldstein, and where he has said he wants his ashes scattered. A few years ago, a massive storm surge had swept salt water up the stream, killing off much of the fauna that inhabited it. Now, as we paddled through lush alleys of cattail and bulrush, frogs seemed to be popping up all around us. “They’ve come back!” Pinker said, delighted. We stopped at an open bend so he could try to take a photo of a frog to send to his wife. The world here was green and bursting with life. I recalled a throwaway line from Enlightenment Now: “Everything is amazing.” Everything, of course, is not amazing. Pinker knows this, but many of his critics say he hasn’t grasped quite how much is going wrong. His data shows that many bad things, from global poverty to racism and sexism, have declined, but a recurring theme of the criticisms is that he’s not always careful with the data (“shockingly shoddy,” is how the historians Philip Dwyer and Mark Micale have put it). Pinker has attempted to address some of these criticisms in a 10,000-word defence of Enlightenment Now in the rightwing publication Quillette. A deeper problem, critics say, is Pinker’s faith in data to reveal the truth. Yes, it would be great to just rely on the data, they argue, but data is interpretive all the way down, shaped by what is collected, how it’s collected and for what purpose. That’s a problem Pinker acknowledges in Enlightenment Now, but never fully reckons with. “When you really dig not only into the facts but into his own sources, it’s fully ideological,” Guilhot, the intellectual historian, told me. Several critics have also argued that it’s cruel to ask people to see themselves as data points along a rising trend line, especially if they happen to be among the many people the trends haven’t lifted up. Others say that progress rarely comes from the cheerleaders of the status quo; it comes from radicals organising against the powers that be. Many point out that, whatever the data may show, the really important question is not how much better the world has become, but how much better it could still be. Pinker’s relative comfort with the status quo has led him into arguments that spill well beyond the covers of his books. He often says he “manages his controversy portfolio carefully”, but controversy seems to have overtaken him in recent years. He has sparked anger by describing “people who gravitate to the alt-right” as “often highly intelligent, highly literate” people; by writing that the Tuskegee study, in which more than a hundred poor African American men were allowed to die of untreated syphilis and related complications, was “a one-time failure to prevent harm to a few dozen people”; and by “drowning out the voices of people suffering from racist and sexist violence”, according to an open letter signed by hundreds of graduate students and more than 180 professors in the field of linguistics. Then there were the pictures that began circulating of him with the financier Jeffrey Epstein at various public events, including after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for sex offences against a minor. It turned out that Pinker had also helped his friend Alan Dershowitz interpret a statute in Epstein’s defence on sex trafficking charges in 2007, the same year Pinker and Dershowitz co-taught Psychology 1002: Morality and Taboo. “He’s sending a signal that men who abuse women are welcome in our field,” Jessica Cantlon, a professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, told me. (Pinker says he regrets having helped Dershowitz with his defence of Epstein.) Many critics allege that Pinker’s recent remarks are part of a longer history of comments and behaviour that have come dangerously close to promoting pseudoscientific or abhorrent points of view. To take a single example: the journalist Malcolm Gladwell has called Pinker out for sourcing information from the blogger Steve Sailer, who, in Gladwell’s words, “is perhaps best known for his belief that black people are intellectually inferior to white people”. Angela Saini, a science journalist and author of Superior: The Return of Race Science, told me that “for many people, Pinker’s willingness to entertain the work of individuals who are on the far right and white supremacists has gone beyond the pale”. When I put these kinds of criticisms to Pinker, he called it the fallacy of “guilt by association” – just because Sailer and others have objectionable views, doesn’t mean their data is bad. Pinker has condemned racism – he told me it was “not just wrong but stupid” – but published Sailer’s work in an edited volume in 2004, and quotes Sailer’s positive review of Better Angels, among many others, on his website. Pinker cherishes facts over assumptions, but occasionally his assumptions have caused him to rush past the facts. In 2013, Pinker initially defended the philosopher Colin McGinn after McGinn had been accused of sexually harassing a female graduate student, calling McGinn’s actions “no more serious than exchanging sexual banter”. He revised his opinion of the case after being confronted with the evidence. What McGinn did crossed the line, Pinker told me, but he still thought the punishment was disproportionate. (McGinn resigned his position, though it’s unclear under exactly what circumstances.) McGinn later made a failed attempt to start a business ethics consulting firm, and Pinker and Goldstein signed on as advisers. “Rebecca and I were pretty sure that nothing would become of it,” Pinker told me. “It was basically a favour to him, a gesture of friendship with no consequences.” “Depending on how much of a sense of humour you and your editor have, here’s an answer to the question, ‘Are there downsides to being famous?’” Pinker emailed me after I asked him about Epstein, Sailer, McGinn and others. “Yes. Journalists ask you to explain why you’ve been ‘associated with’ various people, out of the thousands you’ve interacted with over the decades, who’ve done something wrong.” Earlier, he had said of the various criticisms he has faced, “It’s as unpleasant as you’d expect. But I do my humanly best. I process them as part of a set of stress management strategies – not before bed, often on an airplane when I’m already miserable.” Ultimately, though, Pinker sees this as part of the job of the public intellectual. “This is the business we’ve chosen,” he said, quoting The Godfather Part II. “People are going to attack me, and I’m going to attack back.” * * * Although the controversies Pinker generates have intensified, it’s not because his basic view of the world has changed. What has changed is the world. The same defence of capitalism and liberal democracy that animates much of Enlightenment Now can be found, in miniature, in The Blank Slate, though between them stand the financial crisis, the migrant crisis, the forever wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the rise of social media and authoritarian populism, and numerous increasingly alarming reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. At the same time, over the past decade or so, a greater diversity of people have entered academia and public discourse, and have challenged opinions that were once considered acceptable. “There’s a huge reckoning happening,” Saini said. It’s hard not to see Pinker’s latest book, Rationality, which walks readers through various cognitive biases, as a response to his critics – particularly those who lacked “the conceptual tools to ascertain whether progress has taken place or not”. In Enlightenment Now, Pinker recommends “cognitive debiasing” programmes as part of a strategy of countering irrationality in the world; Rationality reads like the centrepiece of the curriculum. If only everyone were capable of reasoning properly, Pinker sometimes seems to imply, then our endless political arguments would not occupy so much of public life. Instead of being consumed by conflict, we would be busily problem-solving. “I think the issue that a lot of people have with Pinker is that, for someone who is so exercised about other people’s biases and lack of rationality and logic, he sometimes feels a little reluctant to question his own,” Saini said. Pinker’s methods sometimes seem cynical, but I never got the sense that he was anything less than sincere. He agrees with his leftwing critics that we are living in a precarious moment, in which hard-fought-for advances in human wellbeing are under threat. He consistently says that the political battle against the Trumpist, authoritarian, conspiratorial right is of primary importance. But the cultural and ideological battle against what he called “woke-ism, Occupy Wall Street leftism, Rage Against the Machine leftism, Extinction Rebellion – these rather cynical and destructive movements” seems to occupy more of his emotional energy. In his view, many factions on the left see the world as a zero-sum battle for supremacy among different racial, ethnic and gender groups. He also believes that the excesses of the left are partly to blame for the dangerous lunacy of the right. “Unlike a lot of academics, I actually have conservative and libertarian friends,” he said. “They sometimes ask me, ‘Why should we trust climate science when anyone with an opposing view would be cancelled?’ I disagree about the climate science, but it’s otherwise a good point.” To fight back against this, Pinker has joined the boards of more than half a dozen organisations that say they are dedicated to promoting free speech. When I began listing a few to check which ones he belonged to, he interjected: “I’m on the board of all of them!” He went on: “The reason these organisations are so important is that a lot of repression comes from a small number of activists. Even if they’re not a majority view, a radical minority can become a repressive regime.” In Better Angels, he continued, he wrote about this dynamic of the “spiral of silence”, which led to witch-hunts, the Inquisition, the French Revolution, Stalinism and Nazi Germany. He also compared what he sees as the intellectual bankruptcy of woke orthodoxy to the folktale The Emperor’s New Clothes. “It takes a little boy to point it out,” he said. * * * On my last morning on the Cape, I strolled through Provincetown to the wharf where Pinker and I were taking the ferry to Boston. While I waited for him in the queue for the boat, a man and his boyfriend announced their engagement to a group of friends – then joked they only did it so one would be eligible for the other’s healthcare benefits. The moral circle was expanding, but maybe not as far as it could. Back in Boston, Pinker showed me around the spacious open-plan apartment he shares with Goldstein, in a converted leather warehouse. On a wall opposite the front door were two large photographs of the couple with the Obamas on the day that Goldstein was presented with the National Humanities medal, in 2015. If anywhere were western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic, it was this million-dollar former warehouse with photos of Barack Obama on the wall. Pinker’s apartment seemed to contain the curated fruits of his career. Gazing down on the room was a nearly lifesize portrait of him, reading a book. On another wall was a caricature of him which first appeared in the New York Review of Books. A small painting of him was lying loose on top of a low bookshelf. “One of the things that happens when you’re famous is that people send portraits to you,” he said, bemused. Next to the portrait was a little pile of new translations of Enlightenment Now – Italian, Japanese, Hungarian. Standing at the centre of the apartment like a statue, in the dead space where his study and the living room converged, was a glass magazine rack, about the height of Pinker himself. Displayed on its zigzagging levels were publications, some more than a decade old, with his or Goldstein’s face staring up from the covers. “What’s on the rack are basically things that we don’t feel we can throw out, but not the things that we tend to read in bed,” he later joked. Success tends to be its own justification, and the evidence that Pinker’s approach to the world works for him was all around us. “Celebrity is bizarre,” I remarked. Pinker grinned. “Yes it is,” he said. Pinker and I had planned to go up to Harvard to see his office, which he hadn’t entered since the start of the pandemic, nearly a year and a half earlier. Before we left, I asked to see a pair of black caiman-leather cowboy boots he had custom made for him by the legendary bootmaker Lee Miller, part of his signature look at public events. (“He told me he likes cowboy boots because it’s the only way a man can get away with wearing high heels,” Pinker’s friend the biologist Jerry Coyne told me. “He likes mostly reptile boots, I think.”) Pinker showed me the boots, but opted to wear a pair of driving loafers designed by Nicolas Sarkozy’s son Louis, for whom Pinker is a celebrity model. Earlier, Pinker had picked up a chunk of graffitied concrete, the size of an American football, from the top of one of his shelves. “Part of the Berlin Wall,” he said. His father had brought it back from a business trip he took to Germany in the weeks the wall was coming down. Pinker put the souvenir back in its place, where it lay like a page torn from a book. “Whatever happened to good old liberalism?” Pinker said to me later, exasperated but cheerful. “Who’s going to actually step in and defend the idea that incremental improvements fed by knowledge, fed by expanding equality, fed by liberal democracy, are a good thing? Where are the demonstrations, where are the people pumping their fists for liberal democracy? Who’s going to actually say something good about it?” This article was amended on 28 September 2021 because an earlier version referred to “Quebec’s... French-speaking minority”. That group is a minority in Canada as a whole, but forms a majority of the population of Quebec. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

          "headline": "Power shortages in China hit homes and factories prompting global supply fears",
          "bodyText": "Widening power shortages in China’s north-east have left homes without power and halted production at numerous factories, while some shops operated by candlelight as the economic toll of the squeeze mounted. Residents in the north-east, where autumn temperatures are falling, reported power cuts and appealed on social media for the government to restore supplies. Rationing has been implemented during peak hours since last week, while residents of cities including Changchun said cuts were occurring sooner and lasting for longer, state media reported. China’s power crunch, caused by tight coal supplies and toughening emissions standards, has hurt production in industries across several regions and poses a risk to already strained global supply chains. Manufacturers face existing shortages of processor chips, disruptions in shipping and other lingering effects of the global shutdown of travel and trade to fight the coronavirus pandemic. In the north-east, factories were idled to avoid exceeding limits on energy use imposed by Beijing to promote efficiency. Economists and an environmental group say manufacturers used up this year’s quota faster than planned as export demand rebounded from the coronavirus pandemic. In the city of Liaoyang, 23 people were hospitalised with gas poisoning after ventilation in a metal casting factory was shut off after a power outage, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The suspension of production at some factories prompted concerns over the possible shortage of goods ahead of Christmas, including smartphones and devices. Apple components supplier Eson Precision Engineering said on Sunday it would halt production at its factory in Kunshan, west of Shanghai, until Thursday “in line with the local government’s power restriction policy.” Eson said the suspension shouldn’t have a “significant impact” on operations. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a question from Associated Press about the possible impact on iPhone supplies. The impact on homes and non-industrial users comes as night-time temperatures slip to near-freezing in China’s northernmost cities. The National Energy Administration has told coal and natural gas firms to ensure sufficient energy supplies to keep homes warm during winter. Liaoning province said power generation had declined significantly since July, and the supply gap widened to a “severe level” last week. It expanded power cuts from industrial firms to residential areas last week. The city of Huludao told residents not to use high energy-consuming electronics like water heaters and microwave ovens during peak periods, and a resident of Harbin city in Heilongjiang province told Reuters that many shopping malls were closing earlier than usual. The power squeeze is unnerving Chinese stock markets at a time when the world’s second-largest economy is already showing signs of slowing. The Chinese economy is grappling with curbs on the property and tech sectors and concerns around the future of cash-strapped real estate giant China Evergrande. Stricter emissions standards have in part driven the power shortages. China has vowed to cut energy intensity by about 3% in 2021 to meet its climate goals. Provincial authorities have also stepped up the enforcement of emissions curbs in recent months after only 10 of 30 mainland regions managed to achieve their energy goals in the first half of the year. The ruling party also is preparing for the Winter Olympics in Beijing, and the nearby city of Shijiazhuang in February, a period when it will want clear blue skies. The power pinch has been affecting manufacturers in key industrial hubs on the eastern and southern coasts for weeks. At least 15 Chinese companies have said in exchange filings that production had been disrupted by power curbs, while more than 30 Taiwan-listed firms with China operations had stopped work to comply with the power limits. The fallout of the power shortage has prompted some analysts to downgrade their 2021 economic growth outlook for China, and also warned of possible global supply shortages to textiles, toys and machine parts.

          "headline": "Hospitals in England relax Covid rules to help tackle waiting lists",
          "bodyText": "Ministers have ordered a major relaxation of coronavirus infection control measures in England’s hospitals in an effort to make it easier to tackle the backlog. The move follows a review, led by the chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, Dr Jenny Harries, into whether the NHS could start to remove some Covid rules and enable medics to see more patients. Currently, stringent guidelines designed to protect staff, patients and visitors from coronavirus, in place since the early part of last year, also make it harder to treat the rising numbers in need of elective care. A record 5.6 million people in England are waiting for treatment, according to the latest NHS data. Three key recommendations for elective care were accepted by Sajid Javid, the health secretary, on Monday. Each comes into force immediately. They involve cutting social distancing from 2 metres to 1, dropping the need for patients to isolate before operations, and adopting “standard” rather than “advanced” cleaning procedures. They are likely to prompt concern among some health professionals and scientists, as the virus continues to infect tens of thousands in the UK each day. Trisha Greenhalgh, professor of primary healthcare at the University of Oxford, said on Twitter that the relaxation of rules could “make things worse”. Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the changes appeared “generally reasonable” and should be implemented where they can to “improve access to healthcare”. However, he warned that false negative test results could mean that “some asymptomatically infected patients will be put on wards with vulnerable patients”. Clarke also said the new cleaning guidance “smacks of corner-cutting” and “may well lead to transmission of Covid-19 and other infections in our hospitals”. The changes come hours after it emerged that the UK has joined a handful of countries to have fully vaccinated two-thirds of its population against Covid. More than 44.7m second doses have been delivered in the UK, government figures show – the equivalent of just over 66.6% of the total population. Other countries to have passed this mark include Belgium, Canada, Chile, Singapore and Spain. “As ever more people benefit from the protection of our phenomenal vaccination campaign, we can now safely begin to relieve some of the most stringent infection control measures where they are no longer necessary to benefit patients and ease the burden on hardworking NHS staff,” said Javid. A new analysis by the Health Foundation warned on Monday that the waiting list is likely to “grow significantly”. It suggested that 7.5 million fewer people were sent for hospital care than expected during the pandemic. While it is not clear whether all those will eventually come forward to seek help, the thinktank warned the waiting list will “continue to grow” over the next few years. Boris Johnson conceded this month that the backlog would “get worse before it gets better”. Now fresh advice will be issued to hospitals over how they carry out elective care, Harries said, as more of the population is vaccinated and scientists understand more about how the infection is transmitted and how it can be contained. The review says NHS staff working in areas where Covid control measures have been relaxed should be fully vaccinated, asymptomatic and not be a contact of a positive case. “We have reviewed the existing Covid-19 evidence-based guidance and made a series of initial pragmatic recommendations on how local providers can start to safely remove some of the interventions that have been in place in elective care specifically for Covid-19,” said Harries. “This is a first step to help the NHS treat more patients more quickly, while ensuring their safety and balancing their different needs for care.” The guidance will not apply to certain areas, such as emergency departments. Patients preparing to undergo elective operations, such as hip or knee surgery, will no longer need to have a negative PCR test or isolate for three days before the procedure. Instead, patients in “low-risk” groups who are double vaccinated and asymptomatic will take a lateral flow test on the day."

          "headline": "Tim Costello lauds ruling allowing charities to lobby for political change",
          "bodyText": "A tribunal ruling that found benevolent institutions are allowed to advocate for political change will free charities from “always looking over their shoulders”, reverend Tim Costello says. Earlier this month, the administrative appeals tribunal (AAT) delivered a landmark decision in the case of Global Citizen, a global charity that was initially denied public benevolent institution status in Australia because of its political advocacy. The charities regulator had taken the position that charities which attempt to lobby politically or advocate to governments for change should not be afforded benevolent status, which helps organisations secure vital tax deductible donations and grants from ancillary funds. But the AAT found the decision to deny Global Citizen – a highly successful international education and advocacy group headquartered in New York – the crucial PBI status was wrong, and that such organisations were engaged with the political process as a “regular and indispensable part of their work”. The decision will have widespread ramifications for the charity sector. It is likely to embolden charities to directly pursue political change without fearing their benevolent status – and the associated fundraising benefits – will be at risk. The decision was made at a time when the sector feels increasingly targeted by the Morrison government. Last month, the sector united to protest new laws that allow charities to be deregistered if their staff commit even the most minor of offences, even if no charges are laid. Costello, the chair of the Community Council for Australia and former chief executive of World Vision Australia, said the AAT’s ruling would bring Australia into line with arrangements in other western countries. “Charities always understood that they are actually about two things: practical love, and change,” he said. “Advocacy is fundamental to change and this decision that recognises this is part of what PBIs do is really just falling into line with what happens in other Western free democracies. “I think it frees charities from always looking over their shoulders and being anxious. We can be honest about what our mission is with our donors.” Costello, who supported the Global Citizen application, has also led the fight against regulations that expand the kinds of offences that can prompt the charities regulator to deregister an organisation. The regulations allow the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) to investigate charities if they promote or engage in trespass, threatening behaviour, vandalism, theft, or assault. An alliance of dozens of charities, named Hands Off Our Charities, says the regulations will allow for deregistration if a staff member blocks a footpath at a vigil, for example, or refuses to leave an MP’s office. The group says the charities regulator would be able to launch an investigation if it thought such an offence may have occurred, regardless of whether charges have been laid. Speaking last month, Anglicare Australia’s executive director, Kasy Chambers, said the rules were designed to stop charities from speaking out. “They are not just an attack on charities,” she said. “They are an attack on democracy. We’re calling on the Senate to disallow these changes – and we ask the Morrison Government to put an end to these attacks for good.” The ACNC said it was considering the tribunal’s decision on Global Citizen. “The ACNC welcomes decisions that assist with clarifying the law relating to eligibility for registration as a Public Benevolent Institution. We are currently considering the implications of the decision.”"

          "bodyText": "In March last year, as lockdown was starting to seem inevitable, Lauren turned to her colleague Paul with a proposition: “Will you be my penpal?” Though they had worked together for two years, it was only recently that they had started messaging after hours. Now they had talked more over text than they had in person, making being together in the office a bit awkward. Their conversation was not obviously flirtatious, at least not as Lauren, 26, saw it; but she was enjoying herself enough to want to keep up contact through the lockdown – however long it might last. Paul, 31, not only agreed to her semi-joking suggestion; he escalated it. “He bought envelopes,” says Lauren. “That’s when he really committed.” At the same time as the pandemic precipitated a society-wide shift towards technology, it also saw us return to a time-honoured tradition: writing letters. In June, a survey by the children’s charity Plan International UK found that more than two in five Britons had written letters during lockdown, citing its benefits for their mental wellbeing. The US Postal Service reported a similar increase early last year. There are many reasons why we might have felt moved to put pen to paper through the pandemic: to process our thoughts and feelings, to feel connected to other people, to spend time off screens. But the emotional turbulence and isolation also set the scene for especially intimate, charged correspondence – and to send letters that might have otherwise gone unwritten. “As lockdown hit, the feelings hit – I had so much I wanted to say,” says Marcus, 23. He reconnected with a university friend in a series of letters last year. “We admitted a lot to each other over paper. The last letter I wrote to her was pretty much confessing that I’d really liked her back then – that I felt I’d missed my chance, and I still think about her.” Suspended by the pandemic between past and present, many people chose to reach out. If any couple captures this spirit, it is Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck: together again 17 years after ending their engagement. Their rekindling seemed sudden when it first came to light in April, before it was reported that they had been exchanging “loving and longing” emails for months. (A source said Affleck proved to J-Lo that he could “own her heart” with his pen.) Whether the pandemic proved a prompt to express extant feelings, or they developed through the exchange, it points to a revival not just of letter-writing, but of love letters – and there are historical parallels that help to explain it. Through lockdown, people had to consider how to express themselves from a distance, just as they did in the 18th century, says Sally Holloway, research fellow in history at Oxford Brookes University, who is studying love letters of that time. But writing a letter today has the added significance of having been chosen over a more immediate form of communication, such as a phone or video call. “It is a particular gesture of commitment to take the time to put your feelings into words, which might enable you to write things that you may not feel able to say in person,” says Holloway. “The whole process of writing an email or letter creates this new object, which the recipient can keep in order to read over your sentiments again and again.” Now more than ever, a letter’s lasting value lies in “the investment of time”, says Holloway. And in lockdown, many had time to spare. “I never would have reconnected if I hadn’t sat and thought about what we could have been,” says Marcus. “It’s the genesis for this whole feeling. Before lockdown, I’d never have had the time to sit down and pen a letter about my feelings to someone miles away.” For Lauren, writing letters to Paul, then walking the hour or so to his house to hand-deliver them became “a bit of a ritual” through the lockdown. The task lent structure to the formless weeks, while the writing itself was a welcome creative prompt. “The world just became so small… It was a cool way to explore my previous experiences through someone else’s eyes,” she says. Their letters started out long and lyrical, and progressed to works of art. “They got more and more detailed and illustrated, followed by poems, drawings, spilling out life stories,” says Lauren. Within the exchange, there was also an undeniable eagerness to impress. When Lauren, an artist, sent Paul a watercolour, he dug out his paints and sent one back. Often Lauren, feeling pressed to reply, would “just start writing about completely random things”; Paul was both more ambitious in his replies, and faster. “He definitely sent more than me,” says Lauren. “He showed me up a bit.” About six weeks in, Paul sent her an intricate calendar marking milestones not just in the lockdown but their correspondence. Only then, much to her flatmates’ amusement, did it dawn on Lauren: “I was like, ‘Ohhh – I think this guy really likes me.’” And yet they only spoke once on the phone, and their in-person exchanges were short. “We would just drop the letters in each other’s letterbox and kind of run away,” says Lauren. “It wasn’t illegal for us to talk from a few feet away – we could have.” There was an element, she admits, of wanting to preserve the romance. One time Paul met her at his letterbox. “He came out wearing the most hideous trousers,” Lauren grimaces. “They were three-quarter length, brown, baggy… The illusion was totally off.” Then, after eight weeks in New Zealand, where Lauren and Paul live, the lockdown lifted and they had no reason to write any more. Lauren felt trepidatious: who would they be to each other, off the page? Our relationships have always been shaped by the times and technologies. Love letters flourished through the 18th century because of the massive growth in literacy, says Holloway. People did not just read epistolary romance novels such as Samuel Richardson’s Pamela and Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s Julie or The New Heloise, they were inspired by them. “The letter became this important genre to navigate romantic relationships… You found out whether you were on the same page, literally and figuratively.” Over time, conventions evolved – such as writing in a more familiar, affectionate style and concluding with a flurry of post-scripts. “Some people wrote seven, eight, nine post-scripts, as if they couldn’t tear themselves away,” says Holloway. To see those frenetic, consecutive fragments today, it is hard to miss the parallel with text messages. Equally, suggests Holloway, personalised wax seals added extra emotional meaning to letters without words, just as gifs and emoji do now. It could be argued that even before the pandemic, we were living through a new era of (short-form, fast-paced) epistolary romance – in online dating. Recent figures from the Pew Research Center found 30% of US adults have used a dating site or app, and 12% have started serious relationships through them, making messaging often the first step towards love. (And sometimes last: a 2016 survey found that 72% of online daters found poor spelling a turn-off.) Given our dependence on digital communication, even couples who meet “IRL” get to know each other through the written word now more than they did 50, or even 15 years ago. And by preventing us from meeting in person, the pandemic sent the word count skywards. Tinder reported not only more messages sent in 2020 than in the previous year, but conversations that were 32% longer, even after it introduced its function for video dates; Match and Bumble figures showed similar increases. “Not on here for a penpal” is a grumbling caveat common in dating app bios – but through these unprecedented times, many were glad for just that. Writing in Time, Raisa Bruner described her “forever-online boyfriends of the pandemic”: app matches she never met, but messaged daily for companionship and support. It speaks to the possibility of establishing an emotional connection at a physical remove. Decades of research, such as into long-distance relationships, have established that proximity is not a necessary precursor to intimacy. On the other hand, the speed and ease with which we can communicate digitally does not always reflect the depth of the relationship. When it has never been so easy to share, who you confide in could be incidental. Constance, 32, from southwest England, spent the first lockdown messaging a man she had kissed on a night out a few weeks earlier. “It quickly progressed into speaking every day, sending playlists, talking about issues we were having with housemates, navigating the intensities of lockdown,” she says. She was grateful for the company and distanced perspective – “a satellite person to talk to”, who could only take her at her word. Their messages became longer and more intense, “opening up about painful things, difficult things,” says Constance. “We sort of emotionally exposed ourselves.” Eventually she asked for some space. “It just felt like too much. We hadn’t met since that one evening.” When they met for a coffee after lockdown, Constance found her correspondent to be quite different to the confident, chatty man she had envisaged – but he confided in her as though their relationship neatly transcended the digital space. “Obviously it was a bit awkward. I had to explain that I wasn’t really feeling the physical chemistry,” says Constance. She wonders now whether she ever felt that attraction, or if their messaging had allowed them to invest in a fantasy. “You can do that in writing where it’s almost removed from the other person… but I need them to be there in front of me to know if I really like them.” The relative sparseness of written communication leads our subconscious to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about our correspondents – but rarely accurately, says Jeff Hancock, founding director of Stanford University Social Media Lab. Meeting them in person is then like seeing “the movie that’s based on the book: you come away a little disappointed”, he says. “Our imagination is much more powerful and engaging.” Likewise, writing allows us a degree of control over our self-presentation that would otherwise be effectively impossible. “When we are doing things digitally only, I can take time to write, to edit myself… We create who we want.” When our impressions of someone clash with our in-person cues, says Hancock – “there’s some adjustment to be done.” For Lauren and Paul, their first meeting was a little awkward, but no more so than might be expected post-lockdown. “It was actually a really nice transition,” she says. As they settled into their new relationship, Lauren realised the extent to which Paul had opened up in his letters: “He’s quite quiet and introspective – a sensitive soul.” But those tendencies, so conducive to their correspondence, were not so supportive of their relationship. Lauren and Paul broke up earlier this year, after 10 months together, though they remain close friends. The letter-writing was foundational in their getting together, Lauren says, but not to their split: “It was such a beautiful way of getting to know each other and it led to an amazing friendship… We just weren’t that compatible.” Lauren doubts that she will ever again start a relationship by writing, just because it felt so specific to “the madness of lockdown” – but the exercise in being vulnerable was refreshing and valuable, she says. She still displays a few of Paul’s artworks, framed, on her bedroom wall as a cherished reminder. “The nature of letter writing gave the relationship a start that it wouldn’t have had otherwise… I think it was really productive in testing something.” Just as increasing literacy led to love letters, the pandemic has already forced innovations in how we connect from afar. A recent survey by the Kinsey Institute and Cosmopolitan magazine found that 70% of people who started going on video-dates in lockdown planned to keep doing so. But far from the free-love free-for-all some predicted post-pandemic, the survey also revealed a surprising desire for commitment. More than 50% of singles said they were now looking for a serious relationship; 33% said they’d wait longer before meeting a date in person, and 37% said the same of having sex. It suggests a change not just in our relationship priorities, but in how we pursue them through tech – and a return to deliberate, slow-burn romances, such as those that might in the past have unfolded through letters. Slowly, an app aiming to digitise “the traditional experience of penpals”, makes this desire for a “slower but better pace” explicit. It connects strangers around the world to write to each other, delaying their messages to allow for anticipation to build – just as with the post. The app presents itself as an antidote to superficial connection, “for those who yearn for meaningful conversations in the era of instant messaging”. Notably, it took off through the pandemic, says cofounder JoJo Chan. From February 2020 to January 2021, Slowly saw an 85% increase in new users and a 57% increase in activity compared to the previous year. Now it tallies a massive 4.5m users. Megan, 26, and Vlad, 29, started corresponding through Slowly early last year. All they knew about each other was their username, cartoon avatar, and their locations: her in Illinois, in the US; him in London. “There was no expectation or underlying agenda,” says Vlad. “You don’t have any pictures, you don’t hear them, there’s no swiping: that left room only for your imagination, your creativity, and your interest in replying to the other person.” Their similarities – not just in likes and dislikes, but values – were revealed letter by letter. They shared important moments in their lives, and mundane ones from their days. Megan says they bared their souls on the page: “It was different to how I’d even message friends… It was one version of ourselves – but a very true, essential one.” After a month of corresponding through Slowly, they swapped numbers. The instantaneousness of messaging – more conducive to repartée and humour through gifs, memes and emojis – accelerated their growing attraction. “We were vibing,” says Megan. For Vlad, the “defining moment” was their first video call: “It’s one thing to visualise the person who is writing the letters and the messages, and completely different to actually see them. “Once physical attraction was also established…” – Vlad laughs, embarrassed – “we understood that this was something incredibly special, and we should not stay 7,000 miles apart.” From then on, their Slowly romance moved fast. In September, three months after their first letter, Megan flew to London with a return ticket booked for two months’ time. She checked into a hotel near Vlad’s flat. “I remember standing in front of her door, almost shaking,” says Vlad. “It was bizarre to make the connection that she was no longer 2D on a screen.” But, he says, “there was no dissonance or disparity between the written Megan and the in-person Megan – she is exactly the kind, beautiful person that she is in her letters as she is in real life.” Megan’s return flight went unused. The couple are now living together in the Hague – where Vlad could relocate with his job, and Megan was eligible for residency – and recently became engaged. Their early letters now read as the start of a love story. Not long after meeting Vlad in London, Megan shared a heartfelt account of their relationship with Lockdown Love Stories, artist Philippa Found’s project bringing together more than 1,100 pandemic romances – to surprise Vlad, and make it feel more real. “I thought it would be an excellent way of putting this down to history,” she says. “I love love stories like the one I’m experiencing – I would love to read something like this, and know that it exists.” Their published story was a fitting final chapter for their romance forged through words. It was given the title: “The stuff of novels.” Some names have been changed. Lockdown Love Stories is online at lockdown lovestories.com and on Instagram at @lockdown_lovestories"

          "bodyText": "The gripping new thriller from the author of The Girl on the Train features a dead body on a London houseboat and a smörgåsbord of possible culprits. Read by the actor Rosamund Pike, it is set in the aftermath of a brutal stabbing and is told from multiple points of view. There’s Miriam from the neighbouring boat who “likes to keep an eye on things”; Laura, a hot-tempered young woman who slept with the victim shortly before his death; Carla, the dead man’s aunt, who is already mourning the death of her sister, Angela; and Irene, Angela’s elderly neighbour who is prone to confusion, but not so much that she doesn’t clock the goings-on next door. Pike makes deft work of these unreliable narrators who span several generations, imbuing their voices with a defensiveness and vulnerability born from past disappointments and trauma. Miriam is forever second-guessing the judgment of strangers who she knows see her as a lonely busybody, while Laura is chaotic and brittle-sounding, convinced that none of the calamities that befall her are ever her fault. In particular, Pike captures the melancholy of the widowed Irene, whose frail appearance and occasional mishaps prompt others to condescend and patronise rather than treat her as a sentient adult. This being a Hawkins novel, the plot twists are sprinkled liberally to keep listeners on their toes, though the story is sustained by the humanity of these expertly narrated characters whose secrets are slowly brought to the surface. • A Slow Fire Burning is available on Penguin Audio, 9hr 20min. The best of the rest Maybe I Don’t Belong Here by David Harewood, Bluebird, 8hr 42min A heartfelt memoir about race, identity and mental illness.

          "headline": "Arsenal the perfect destination for muted Harry Kane to turn up the volume ",
          "bodyText": "The in-house Tottenham TV interviewer offered a run-through of the top lines and Harry Kane could not suppress a smile. A 2-0 home win over Arsenal. A great atmosphere inside the stadium. A goal for Kane, which made him the all-time leading scorer in the north London derby. And Spurs on top of the Premier League table. “It literally doesn’t get better than that, does it?” came the prompt. “It’s a pretty good night,” Kane replied, before saying the same thing again, as if to try to process it all. It was only last December but it feels lifted from a different era. Plenty has changed since that high point, which was fired by the presence of 2,000 fans after nine months of empty stands – and particularly for Kane. Spurs would slump to a seventh-placed finish, dismissing José Mourinho along the way, and Kane made it clear that he wanted a move to Manchester City. His patience had snapped. He wanted to play Champions League football, to compete for the biggest trophies, and not to find out first-hand what the quality was like in the Europa Conference League – Uefa’s new third-tier tournament, which Spurs are in this season. We know how the hoped-for transfer worked out – Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, saying no and meaning it – but have not heard how Kane feels about playing in the Conference League. These days, he treats speaking to the press as something to be avoided – a stark contrast to when he was on the up (and happier) – and it is not always a guarantee he will put himself forward when with England. When he does, he is comfortable with national-team questions but Spurs is, well, awkward. It does not take a detective to work out what Kane is thinking and it certainly made for an incongruous sight when he led his out Spurs teammates out at Rennes in the opening round of Conference League group phase games on the Thursday before last. On the preceding two nights, Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku, Robert Lewandowski and Erling Haaland had scored in the Champions League. These are the centre-forwards against whom Kane measures himself and it can not be easy for him to watch them at present. Especially as he considers who Spurs face next in Europe – the Slovenian team NS Mura, at home on Thursday. Kane’s mentality is a big part of what has powered his rise. He does not seem to know self-doubt. Missed chances or poor performances do not touch him. At Euro 2020, he struggled in England’s three group games, scoring no goals and mustering one shot on target, and the scrutiny burned before the last-16 tie against Germany. Kane was supremely unflustered. “I could go 10, 15 games without scoring but, give me a chance, and I’d back myself to score it,” he said. The chance did come late on, he took it to give England a 2-0 win and it was the spark for him to come alive at the tournament, helping to drive the team to the final. There is a different dynamic at play now. Kane can master what he can control but that does not include Levy and the striker would not be human if he had not suffered a blow to his morale and motivation after seeing his desire to move blocked. Kane has been a subdued presence around the training ground, according to sources, and if the season has been a bit of a slog for him so far it may feel like a long way to the end of it, albeit not as long as to the end of his contract, which expires in 2024. Spurs have struggled for creativity under Nuno Espírito Santo and Kane for goals but he did score at Wolves in the midweek Carabao Cup tie, which his team won on penalties. It was reassuring to see him sprint in between the central defenders and on to Dele Alli’s pass before taking two touches, both of them perfect, and lashing low into the far corner. Before that, he had scored two goals in six appearances – both of them against Paços de Ferreira in the Conference League play-off. It was arguably as reassuring to see Kane at the focal point of the formation – where he can do the most damage – after he had spent significant spells of previous matches in withdrawn or wide areas. Kane’s passing is a strength. His shooting is a bigger one. All that Kane can do is try to put the frustration of the summer behind him because to let it fester will only hurt him in the end. And where better to ignite his league campaign than at Arsenal on Sunday? The former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino once said Kane’s excellent record in derbies was down to his ability to thrive off their emotional energy. The best of his 11 goals against Arsenal was the curler from halfway up the left side of the penalty area in March 2016. It put Spurs 2-1 in front, although they would be pegged back to 2-2. But for pure drama, nothing beats the soaring late headed winner in February 2015. How Spurs crave another dividend. • This article was amended on 26 September 2021. NS Mura are Slovenian, not Slovakian, as an earlier version said."

          "headline": "As insurgents limber up for a federal election, the Coalition is worried about its restive right flank",
          "bodyText": "One of the federal government’s Queensland MPs was enjoying some downtime at home recently, watching the reality show SAS Australia. They were interrupted by a sudden jolt – not an abseiling mishap or some other epic fail by a hapless contestant – but the sudden appearance during an ad break of their former colleague Craig Kelly. You may remember him as the Liberal backbencher with brimming feelings and wild theories on pretty much everything. Kelly parted ways with the government back in February. These days, he’s the federal leader of the United Australia party, fronting ads for Clive Palmer’s political operation. Given their startled state, my informant couldn’t remember precisely what the ad said. But the message was against lockdowns. When I spoke to Kelly this week to try to work out which ad was now running during prime time on free-to-air television, he wasn’t entirely sure either, although he guessed it was the “rubber bullets on the streets one”. The script for that reads: “Police on the streets with rubber bullets in Melbourne. The army on the streets in Sydney. Is this the Australia that we want? Fight back and help protect our rights and our freedom with United Australia party.” As agitprop goes, this is all pretty nimble. The UAP evidently moves quickly enough to loop an ugly conflagration on the streets of Melbourne back into political messaging, lickety-split. The party’s advertising operation also responded to events rapidly during the last federal election campaign. A number of Coalition MPs expect that Scott Morrison will call the election after the Christmas break, yet the UAP evidently has the resources to engage in prime time advertising now. It’s not just television. The UAP’s rubber bullets sponsored post started running on Facebook on Thursday, with a spend to date of between $3,000 to $3,500. This campaign is a recruitment drive: like our videos, like our page, and join the party “today”. Professionals who monitor the digital spend by political parties and candidates tell me the UAP spent around half a million dollars on platforms like YouTube between 27 August and 22 September. This pre-emptive cash splash should not surprise. According to an analysis of Palmer’s media buy that Labor commissioned after the last federal election, the mining magnate outspent McDonald’s, Toyota and Coles spruiking the UAP in the year leading up to the federal election. He then spent more than $8m on saturation advertising in the final week of the contest. When I asked Kelly this week what sort of resources the UAP would have for 2022, he laughed and asked “have you seen the film Dances with Wolves?” Given I saw the film back in 1990, I asked for a prompt. He said there was a memorable scene when one of the main Sioux characters asked the Kevin Costner character how many white men would ultimately come to the prairie. The crestfallen Costner character breaks the terrible news: “As many as the stars in the sky.” Kelly contends spruiking on an industrial scale is entirely reasonable because the UAP is seeking to be on a “level playing field” with other established political parties that can draw on taxpayer-funded resources to field their campaigns – professional staff, phones, printing allowances and the like. “There’s another round of community grants coming up, which is another way for members of parliament to get money out the door,” Kelly says. “All that is taxpayer money.” The UAP are not the only insurgents limbering up for the main event. While there has been some speculation that Pauline Hanson may be considering her future, One Nation looks like it’s had a dose of the smelling salts now that a noisy minority backlash against pandemic public health restrictions and the mandating of vaccines in some sectors seems to be gathering pace. In Queensland, the former premier Campbell Newman is also running for the Liberal Democrats in the Senate. These protagonists are orienteering along pandemic fault lines. The opening year of Covid-19 brought Australians closer together, and numerous polls registered a rebound in trust in institutions, including governments. But the second year of the crisis has been more rancorous. Delta, and the protracted lockdowns to try to contain the outbreak while vaccination rates rise, coupled with the Morrison government’s bungling of the rollout, has eroded the sense of Australian exceptionalism that was palpable back when massive fiscal support and effective suppression allowed large swathes of the country to maintain normal-adjacent activity. Most Australians locked down in the south-east are trudging on stoically without the need for performative resistance, like storming Melbourne’s Shrine of Remembrance. But with the pandemic shifting from a bonding experience to an endurance race, and with a small conga line of political actors marshalling to exploit disaffection by framing public health measures as an egregious violation of liberty, the Coalition is obviously worried about its restive right flank. This fear explains all the validating of the protesters that happened this week – at least before the mob started using the shrine as an ad-hoc port-a-loo. Before that, there was lots of opportunistic “our brave boys”, “sons of freedom”, “stick it to the man” (as long as the man is Daniel Andrews) going on. Queensland frontbencher Amanda Stoker was still validating the “deep frustration” of protesting Victorians after the shocker at the shrine. It got so out of hand that Josh Frydenberg had to front Andrew Bolt and say in very clear terms that thuggery in his home town was a disgrace. (Bolt wasn’t sure whether it was a disgrace or not. Frydenberg thought they could “disagree on that one”). There’s an obvious question to ask. Are Liberals and Nationals worried about the competition on their right flank for good reason? Recent history would say no. During the 2019 election, all the noise on the right was ultimately beneficial to Morrison. The surround-sound UAP messaging amplified the risks of a Shorten Labor government, with its nonexistent “death tax”. In Queensland, disaffected Labor supporters parked their protest votes with One Nation and the preferences flowed back to the Coalition overwhelmingly. But it’s not clear yet whether the same dynamic will apply in the coming federal contest. Thus far, the UAP messaging is very much a pox on all your houses. One of Kelly’s YouTube “stop the lockdown” ads has the former Liberal declaring “we can never trust Liberal or Labor again”. But who knows how this wave ultimately breaks. Even if it breaks badly for Morrison, I suspect the noise doesn’t assist Labor. To win the next federal election, the opposition has to be able to mount a “change” case that is simple enough and loud enough for voters to hear. Anthony Albanese has to be able to convince voters tired of Morrison’s missteps that their protest votes should come to Labor, not alternatives. Success requires reaching disengaged cohorts of voters that are increasingly hard to reach. If the cacophony on the right generates an impenetrable wall of sound, that’s not helpful. One of the sharpest political operatives I know thinks the coming contest will be a seat-by-seat slugfest rather than an election with a clear national focal point. This person believes there is actually fertile ground for a grand narrative election because obscured behind the often superficial daily contention of pandemic politics is a lived reality where societal and economic inequality has been supercharged by the public health crisis. The daily contention has also left a lot of Australians wondering whether their federation still works. People want to know what comes next, and voters are craving empathic leadership. So there’s a certainly contest there to be had. The question is, will psychologically fatigued voters have the bandwidth to process it?"

          "bodyText": "A fresh wildfire in northern California spread rapidly on Thursday, burning homes and prompting evacuation orders in a rural community in Shasta county. Meanwhile, two big forest blazes in the heart of California’s giant sequoia country on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada continued to grow. Smoke from those fires raised air quality concerns for the southern end of the Central Valley and flowed over greater Los Angeles, darkening skies and causing mistaken reports of mountain fires. The Fawn fire in northern California started Wednesday north of Redding in Shasta county, and scorched more than 8.5 sq miles (22 sq km) of heavy timber on steep, rugged terrain amid hot, dry and gusty conditions. KRCR-TV aired video of multiple houses burning near the unincorporated Mountain Gate area, and officials said 25 structures were destroyed. It wasn’t clear how many of them were homes. A woman was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of starting the fire. This area of northern California has endured numerous major fires in recent years. As firefighters in Shasta county battled the Fawn fire, the district attorney on Friday announced manslaughter charges against Pacific Gas and Electric for its role in last year’s Zogg fire, which killed four people and burned nearly 90 sq miles. “In this case, they failed to perform their legal duties,” said Stephanie Bridgett, the district attorney. “Their failure was reckless, and it was criminally negligent, and it resulted in the deaths of four people.” The utility, already a convicted felon for sparking the 2018 Camp fire and a 2010 gas pipeline explosion, has sparked hundreds of blazes in California in recent years. In the Sequoia national park, officials showed reporters how the park’s famous Giant Forest has been protected from the KNP Complex fire by years of using carefully set and controlled fires to burn away vegetation that can serve as wildfire fuel. The bases of some of the most famous giant sequoias were also wrapped in fire-resistant materials. Giant Forest has 2,000 sequoias and includes the General Sherman Tree, the largest tree in the world by volume. The fear of catastrophic fire coming through that section of the national park has been greatly reduced because of the combination of the prescribed burns and the low intensity of the fire that moved into part of the forest, said Ed Christopher, deputy fire director for the US Fish and Wildlife Service. “And because of that, we feel that the majority of the trees in this Giant Forest area should come out of this event like they have for the past thousands of years,” he said. Across California, more than 9,000 firefighters remained assigned to 10 large, active wildfires, according to the state’s department of forestry and fire protection. California fires have burned 3,671 sq miles this year, destroying more than 3,200 homes, commercial properties and other structures. Historic drought tied to the climate crisis is making wildfires harder to fight. Scientists say the climate crisis has made the west much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. The KNP Complex began as two fires ignited by lighting on 9 September. The fires later merged into one and have charred more than 56 sq miles. Sequoia and adjacent Kings Canyon national park have been closed. Several communities are under evacuation orders or warnings to be prepared to leave. There was no containment. Nearby, the Windy fire has burned through nearly 77 sq miles on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Sequoia national forest, including Giant Sequoia national monument. It was just 6% contained."

          "bodyText": "China’s central bank has intensified its clampdown on cryptocurrencies by making all transactions in the virtual assets illegal, triggering a drop in the price of bitcoin on Friday. The move signals the latest attempt to rein in cryptocurrency use in China, where regulators fear it might weaken the Communist party’s control over the financial system and promote criminal activity. In a notice issued on Friday, the People’s Bank of China said bitcoin, ethereum and other digital currencies disrupted the financial system and were used in money-laundering and other crimes. “Virtual currency derivative transactions are all illegal financial activities and are strictly prohibited,” the bank said on its website. The price of bitcoin fell more than 8% immediately after the announcement, dropping to just over $41,000 (£30,000). Chinese banks have been banned from handling decentralised cryptocurrencies like bitcoin since 2013, although the People’s Bank of China is currently developing an electronic version of the country’s yuan for cashless transactions that can be tracked and controlled by Beijing. In May this year, China’s regulators issued a fresh notice to banks and payment firms, saying they were not allowed to offer clients any services involving cryptocurrencies. That reflected official concern that cryptocurrency mining and trading might still be going on, or that the state-run financial system might be indirectly exposed to risks. The crackdown by one of the world’s largest economies raises questions over the future of cryptocurrencies, the use of which has only been supported by a limited number of companies and governments. “China’s latest move could really disrupt the evolution of crypto and not necessarily in the way it wants to,” Daniel Lane, a senior analyst at stock trading platform Freetrade, said. “Sweeping and heavy-handed reforms might scare off crypto users in the short term but it might just prompt the industry to go back underground. A bit like the music industry found when illegal torrenting destroyed CD sales – eventually it’s more beneficial to innovate alongside user habits rather than fight them.” However, Lane suggested it was likely to be only a short-term blow to the industry. “To think a ban will stop all activity is optimistic at best and quite naive at worst,” he said. “Ironically, taking a whole country out of open discussions on crypto’s evolution from here just means diehard corners of the market will recede into more nefarious practices rather than move further towards regulation.” Investor reaction to China’s latest crypto crackdown on Friday was relatively muted compared with May’s announcement, which knocked bitcoin’s value by nearly a third to $30,000 (£21,000). “China’s actions haven’t held back cryptos rise too much in the past so I wouldn’t be surprised to see it bounce back once more”, Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at forex broker OANDA said. El Salvador is so far the only country in the world to have adopted bitcoin as legal tender, in a move that its president said was meant to promote “financial inclusion”, investment and economic development. However, the decision, which came into force this month, prompted a mass demonstration in El Salvador’s capital last week."
