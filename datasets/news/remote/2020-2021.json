          "bodyText": "We are closing this blog now. Goodnight and a good New Year’s Eve from London. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, has announced plans to lift Covid containment measures in January that have been in place since March 2020, including reopening schools, bars and nightclubs, citing rising vaccination rates. The country has imposed some of Africa’s toughest restrictions. In September some measures were eased, including allowing the resumption of education for universities and other post-secondary institutions. In a televised speech late on Friday, Museveni said pre-primary, primary and secondary schools would reopen on 10 January. Bars and nightclubs would reopen and a nighttime curfew will be lifted two weeks after schools have resumed, he added. Movie theatres and sporting events would also be allowed to reopen, he said, without giving further details. As of Friday, Uganda had registered about 137,000 confirmed cases and nearly 3,300 deaths. The president urged Ugandans to get vaccinated as the “first solution” to Covid. Here is a quick recap of some of the main developments from today so far: The UK reported another 189,846 Covid cases in the last 24 hours and reported a further 203 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More than 1 million people have tested positive in the last seven days. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in England increased to 12,395, up from 11,452 the day before. Experts say the daily case figures do not include reinfections, and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, suggesting the true number of infections is likely to be higher. The full story is here. One in 25 people in England had Covid before Christmas, including one in 15 in London, according to a new estimate from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Story here. The Philippines will impose tighter curbs in the capital region for the next two weeks, an acting presidential spokesperson said, to try to limit infections by the Omicron variant. The region including the capital, Manila, will be placed under the third of a five-scale alert system from 3 to 15 January. Level 3 bans face-to-face classes, contact sports, and closes funfairs and casinos. The government’s coronavirus taskforce will also reduce the operating capacity for social events, tourist attractions, amusement parks, restaurant dine-in services, fitness studios and personal care services. Ireland became the latest EU country to cut the isolation period for many people who contract Covid, as record infection numbers spark fears of crippling staff shortages in essential public services as well as retail and hospitality venues. Spain, Portugal and Greece reduced isolation times this week, others such as Germany and France are considering doing so, and Italy cut its quarantine for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has tested positive. The moves follow a similar decision by the US and reflect early research suggesting Omicron generally causes milder illness than earlier versions of the virus. The World Health Organization has described the decisions to cut isolation and quarantine periods as part of a delicate balancing act between controlling the transmission of the virus and keeping national economies up and running. Story here. Germany’s leading coronavirus expert has expressed optimism that his country could expect a “relatively normal” winter in 2022, after data from other countries firmed up the impression that infections with the Omicron variant could be milder than Delta. Story here. UK regulators approved Pfizer’s “life-saving” antiviral drug Paxlovid, which boasts nearly 90% success in preventing severe illness among vulnerable adults if taken soon after becoming infected with Covid. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found the oral treatment “to be safe and effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death in people with mild to moderate Covid-19 infection, who are at an increased risk of developing severe disease”. The agency said Paxlovid was most effective when taken during the early stages of a Covid infection, and recommended it was used within five days of a patient’s first symptoms. The approval is for patients aged 18 and over with at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity or diabetes, or being over 60. Story here. The number of NHS hospital staff in England absent due to Covid has nearly doubled since the start of the month, new figures show. There were 24,632 staff at NHS hospital trusts ill with coronavirus or having to self-isolate on Boxing Day, up 31% from 18,829 a week earlier and nearly double the 12,508 at the start of the month. Turkey logged 40,786 new coronavirus cases on Friday, its highest since April. The health minister warned that the Omicron variant had become dominant as Turks celebrated New Year’s Eve without restrictions. “Although there are no restrictions, we recommend that you act as if there are,” Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter in what he called a New Year’s “warning”. The minister recommended that in this time of increased risk, people should avoided crowded, poorly ventilated environments. New Covid infections have more than doubled from 18,910 a week ago. Since the first cases of Omicron were reported in the UK just over a month ago it has spread rapidly across the UK, fuelling a surge of infections. But scientists have also been working at speed. Here is an overview of the expanding scientific knowledge of the variant. Greece reported 40,560 Covid cases on Friday, setting a new record high for the fourth successive day following a surge of cases of the Omicron variant. Health authorities said 76 deaths had been reported on Friday. Greece introduced new restrictions this week, ordering bars, restaurants and nightclubs to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music. An exception is New Year’s Eve, when establishments can close at 2am. The country of 11 million people has reported 1,210,853 infections since the first case was detected in February 2020 and 20,790 Covid-related deaths. Italy reported a record 144,243 Covid cases on Friday, following 126,888 the day before, the health ministry said, while the number of deaths fell slightly to 155 from 156. Italy has officially registered 137,402 deaths linked to coronavirus since February 2020, and reported 6.125 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid - not including those in intensive care - stood at 11,150 on Friday, up from 10,866 a day earlier. There were 119 new admissions to intensive care units, down from 134 on Thursday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,260 from a previous 1,226. A record 1.22 million tests for Covid were carried out in the last day, compared with 1.15 million the previous day, the health ministry said. Here’s a bit more context on those latest case numbers in the UK: The number of confirmed Covid cases in the UK continued to rise on the last day of 2021, with 189,846 reported in the previous 24 hours, while the number of people in hospital and the number of deaths also rose. The figures follow two consecutive days when the number of new cases was above 180,000, with a record 189,213 reported on Thursday and 183,037 on Wednesday – although the latter included a backlog in some nations of cases recorded before and during the Christmas period. Friday’s figures reported 203 people having died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Thursday’s data had 332 recorded deaths, a steep rise from 57 on Wednesday, explained in part by NHS England not reporting hospital deaths since 24 December. The number of Covid patients in hospital in England increased to 12,395 on Friday, from 11,452 the day before. Experts say the daily case figures do not include reinfections and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, suggesting the true number of infections is likely to be higher. According to a new estimate on Friday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in 25 people in England had Covid before Christmas, including one in 15 in London. Based on swabs collected from randomly selected households in England, the ONS said an estimated 4% of the community had Covid in the week ending 23 December – equating to about 2,024,700 people. The week before, about one in 35 people were estimated to be infected. The UK has reported another 189,846 new Covid cases in the last 24 hours as over 1m people tested positive in the last seven days. The number is likely to be on the low side thanks to widespread shortages of PCR and lateral flow tests. The official UK Covid dashboard also recorded another 203 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Nearly 2,000 people were admitted to hospital. The world is celebrating New Year’s Eve in spite of the Omicron variant spreading across the globe – and fireworks and parties are making a comeback this year after many events were cancelled in late 202. My colleague Martin Belam is covering the celebrations in our New Year’s Eve live blog: Portugal has reported a new daily record of 30,829 coronavirus cases, up from 28,659 the previous day, with Omicron accounting for an estimated 83% of new cases. The health authority DGS registered 18 fatalities from Covid, up from 16 on Thursday, but that was a fraction of the more than 300 daily deaths recorded in late January when Portugal had just begun its vaccination campaign. The number of patients in intensive care was steady at 145, well below the more than 900 in early 2021. Portugal has one of the world’s highest Covid vaccination rates with about 87% of its 10 million population fully inoculated. In the run-up to New Year’s Eve, the government ordered nightclubs and bars to close, required people to have negative Covid tests to enter hotels, casinos and restaurants, and limited outdoor gatherings to 10 people. Thousands of flights in the US and internationally have been delayed or cancelled on Friday, adding to travel disruption during the holiday week owing to adverse weather and rising Covid cases, Reuters reports. More than 2,600 flights were cancelled globally as of early Friday, including more than 1,200 flights within the US or entering or departing it, according to a running tally on the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. There were more than 4,600 flight delays in total. The Christmas holidays are typically a peak time for air travel, but the rapid spread of the Omicron variant has led to a sharp increase in Covid infections, forcing airlines to cancel flights as pilots and crew need to be quarantined. On Thursday, for the second day in a row, the US had a record number of new reported cases, with more than 290,000 new infections reported each day, a Reuters tally showed. The state of New York reported more than 74,000 new Covid cases on Thursday, from more than 336,000 tests. New York said last week it would sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its New Year’s Eve celebration. Some critics have raised concerns over the celebrations going ahead at all. The rise in US Covid cases has caused some companies, particularly in the energy sector, to change course from earlier plans to increase the number of employees working from their offices starting next week. Chevron was to start a full return to office from 3 January but told employees this week it was postponing the plans indefinitely. US airline cabin crew, pilots and support staff are reluctant to work overtime during the holiday travel season despite offers of hefty financial incentives. Many workers fear contracting Covid and do not welcome the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, some airline unions have said. In the months preceding the holidays, airlines were wooing employees to ensure solid staffing, after furloughing or laying off thousands over the past 18 months. It’s been more than two years since China first notified the rest of the world of a new virus sweeping through its population. Since then the hunt for Covid’s origins has been mired in controversy and accompanied by political tensions. Our China affairs correspondent Vincent Ni has taken another look at efforts to trace Sars-CoV-2’s origins: Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane medical school in Louisiana, got a call from his university management telling him that agents from the FBI and CIA had requested a chat about his research into the origins of Covid-19. Garry agreed and on 30 July three agents flew down to Louisiana to talk to him in person. The meeting, held at a university conference room, began at 9am and ended at about 5pm. “I presented my evidence to the agents, who were properly trained scientists themselves. They asked all the right questions,” Garry told the Guardian. “I told them: there is no way this virus could have been a manufactured weapon. There is also no evidence to suggest it was a lab leak. But I’m also conscious there are people out there who will always disagree.” Their conversation came two months after Joe Biden ordered US intelligence to investigate how the pandemic began. In normal circumstances, investigating an emerging infectious disease outbreak is a purely scientific inquiry, as was the case with Sars in 2003 and with Mers a decade later. But the search for the origin of the Covid pandemic has come in the middle of a global controversy that has mixed public health, domestic politics and international diplomacy. Local authorities in England are drawing up contingency plans to deal with staff shortages being made worse by Covid that could leave them unable to empty bins or provide other council services. The Local Government Association said: As cases of Covid-19 rise in light of the Omicron variant, councils are concerned that existing staffing issues may get worse, potentially impacting on service delivery in some areas and they are putting in place contingency plans to address this. We want to work with government to address these issues to ensure councils can be resilient in supporting their communities through this wave of the Omicron variant and that they can continue to deliver the services people rely upon. The Philippines will impose tighter curbs in the capital region for the next two weeks, the acting presidential spokesperson said on Friday, to try to limit infections by the Omicron variant. The health ministry on Friday recorded 2,961 new coronavirus infections, a two-month high, and reported a positivity rate of 10.3%. “In the coming days, we might see an increase in active cases,” acting presidential spokesperson Karlo Nograles said in a televised announcement. The region including the capital Manila is an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to more than 13 million people. It will be placed under the third of a five-scale alert system from 3 to 15 January, Nograles said. Level 3 bans face-to-face classes, contact sports, funfairs, and casinos. The government’s coronavirus task force will also reduce the operating capacity for social events, tourist attractions, amusement parks, restaurant dine-in services, fitness studios, and personal care services. With roughly 2.84 million total confirmed cases and 51,504 casualties, the Philippines has the second highest number of Covid cases and deaths in southeast Asia, after Indonesia. The Philippines has so far detected 10 Omicron cases, three of which three were domestic infections and the rest were from overseas travellers. The country’s genome sequencing capacity is limited. “It is prudent to assume that Omicron is already in circulation, or is already in the community,” the health secretary, Francisco Duque, said at a news conference on Friday. Ireland has become the latest EU country to cut the isolation period for many people who contract Covid, as record infection numbers spark fears of crippling staff shortages in essential public services, as well as retail and hospitality venues. Spain, Portugal and Greece reduced isolation times this week while others, such as Germany and France, are considering doing so and Italy cut its quarantine for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has tested positive. The moves follow a similar decision by the US and reflect early research suggesting the highly transmissible Omicron variant fuelling the pandemic’s latest surge generally causes milder illness than earlier versions of the virus. However, the sheer number of people becoming infected – and thus having to self-isolate if they contract the virus, or quarantine if they are a contact of someone who tests positive – threatens to cause chaos in hospitals and on public transport. “Many Omicron cases are going to be asymptomatic,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Monday after halving the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic people to five from 10 days. We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning, while following the science. The UK’s Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on Wednesday cut the 10-day self-isolation period for vaccinated and unvaccinated people in England who have tested positive for coronavirus from 10 days to seven if they get the all-clear from lateral flow tests. The World Health Organization has described the decisions to cut isolation and quarantine periods as part of a delicate balancing act between controlling the transmission of the virus and keeping national economies up and running. “It is a trade-off between the science and being absolutely perfect in what you try to do, but then having the minimal disruption you can possibly have,” Michael Ryan, the WHO emergencies director, said. “Governments are struggling to find that balance.” Read the full story here: EU countries cut Covid isolation periods in Omicron balancing act Germany’s leading coronavirus expert has expressed optimism that his country could expect a “relatively normal” winter in 2022, after data from other countries firmed up the impression that infections with the Omicron variant could be milder than Delta. Christian Drosten, who heads up the institute of virology at Berlin’s Charité hospital, told public broadcaster ZDF that Omicron had the potential to take the pandemic into an “endemic situation”, where the virus that has brought the world to a standstill could be more comparable to a common cold or flu virus. Of course, it is a good situation if you have a virus that no longer makes you ill but transmits easily so that it can seek out and find all of the immunity gaps among the population and still trigger regular updates in immunity. Nonetheless, the coronavirus expert said he expected indoor mask-wearing mandates and an updated top-up dose of a vaccine to be necessary to protect vulnerable people over the course of the coming year. Germany was at a particular disadvantage because it had a higher percentage than other European countries of people who had neither attained immunity through vaccination or infection with the virus, Drosten said. We have too many unvaccinated people in Germany, especially over 60. And those are of course seriously at risk. More on this story here: Germany buoyed by data from abroad amid Omicron spread Almost one in five frontline ambulance staff in Wales are off sick or isolating with the numbers expected to continue to grow over the next week or so. Jason Killens, the chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust, said that 322 people were off because of Covid – around 12% of frontline staff. Adding in “normal” sickness absenteeism, the number off work rises to around 17%. Killens told the Guardian: We are starting to feel the pinch because of the absence rate. We are expecting that to grow over the next 10 days. More armed services personnel are joining the ambulance service in January, bringing the number driving on the frontline up to around 250, with more doing backroom roles. Killens said the service had its most numbers of referrals from the NHS 111 service on Monday and Tuesday. The pressure is also still being increased by delays in patients being admitted, leading to queues of ambulances at hospital A&amp;E departments. We expect it to get very challenging in the next 10-14 days. Some patients are waiting much longer than we would like. One in 25 people in England had Covid last week, rising to one in 15 in London, official figures have revealed. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated 4% of people in the community in England had Covid in the week ending 23 December – about 2,024,700 people. The week before, about one in 35 people in England were estimated to have had Covid. The study revealed infections have increased across all regions of the UK as the Omicron variant continues to fuel record numbers. “The highest rates of infections were seen in London, where one in 15 would have tested positive, and the lowest in the north-east of England, where one in 45 would have tested positive for Covid-19,” the report notes. Infection levels also rose in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the most recent week, with the latest estimates suggesting that for all three countries about one in 40 people had Covid in the week ending 23 December. The study also reveals that Omicron is now the dominant variant in England and Scotland. “Infection levels have continued to increase across the UK, with England’s increase driven largely by London, which has the highest rate of infection seen in this survey,” said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey. “Omicron is now the dominant variant in both England and Scotland, and has been growing rapidly in Northern Ireland and Wales,” she added. “We’ve also seen infections rise in all age groups, with school-aged children and young adults seeing the highest rates.” Boris Johnson must be ready to restrict social mixing to stop hospitals being overwhelmed by an Omicron-driven surge in Covid cases, a senior NHS leader has said. The rapid spread of the new variant means the prime minister may have to introduce “tighter restrictions, at real speed” to reduce the number of people falling ill with Covid. But any new curbs would take two weeks to cut the number of people needing hospital treatment, added Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers. His comments came as a leading scientist predicted that the sharp increase in Covid infections seen in recent days means that the NHS will be overwhelmed “quite quickly”. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), warned exposure to only “a whiff of infected breath” could lead to catching the Omicron variant. He also said that mingling during new year celebrations may well lead to a further increase in those testing positive. Read the full story here: UK must be poised to introduce swift Covid curbs, says NHS leader The UK has become “one of the first in the world” to approve the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 antiviral after it was found to help prevent the virus from multiplying in at-risk sufferers, PA reports. A potentially “life-saving” treatment called Paxlovid has been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for use among adults who could be vulnerable to coronavirus due to age, weight or a prior chronic illness. The decision comes after the regulator found the drug - which can be taken at home - was safe and effective at reducing the risks of being admitted to hospital and death in people with mild to moderate coronavirus infection and who are also at an increased risk of developing severe disease. In a clinical trial in high-risk adults with symptomatic coronavirus infection, it was found to reduce the risk of being admitted to hospital and of death by almost 90%. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: The UK has been a world leader at finding and rolling out Covid-19 treatments to patients. This is further proved by the MHRA being one of the first in the world to approve this life-saving antiviral. The booster campaign, testing and antiviral defences ensure our country is in the strongest possible position to deal with the threat posed by Omicron as we head into the new year. Developed by Pfizer, Paxlovid is an antiviral medicine with a combination of active ingredients, PF-07321332 and ritonavir, that works by inhibiting a protease required for virus replication. This prevents it from multiplying, keeping virus levels low and helping the body to overcome the viral infection. The two active substances of Paxlovid come as separate tablets that are packaged together and taken together, twice a day by mouth for five days. Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: Today we have given our regulatory approval for Paxlovid, a Covid-19 treatment found to cut Covid-19 related hospitalisations and deaths by 89% when taken within three days of the start of symptoms. We now have a further antiviral medicine for the treatment of Covid-19 that can be taken by mouth rather than administered intravenously. This means it can be administered outside a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage. I hope the announcement today gives reassurance to those particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, for whom this treatment has been approved. For these individuals, this treatment could be life-saving. Based on the clinical trial data, MHRA said it had found Paxlovid is most effective when taken during the early stages of infection and so recommends its use as soon as possible and within five days of the start of symptoms. It has been authorised for use in people aged 18 and above who have mild to moderate Covid-19 infection and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. Such risk factors include obesity, being over 60, diabetes mellitus, or heart disease. Ben Osborn, country manager at Pfizer UK, said: This milestone is an important moment in our continued fight against Covid-19, offering the NHS another possible treatment option as cases continue to rise. This at-home therapy, shown in clinical trials to reduce hospitalisations and save lives, has the potential to lessen the devastating impact of a virus that has now taken over five million lives globally. Almost forgot to say, good morning from New Orleans! I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next eight hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share - your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The number of NHS hospital staff in England absent due to Covid has nearly doubled since the start of the month, new figures show. PA reports that some 24,632 staff at NHS hospital trusts were ill with coronavirus or having to self-isolate on Boxing Day, up 31% from 18,829 a week earlier and nearly double the 12,508 at the start of the month. The new NHS England data comes after separate figures showed that the number of Covid patients in hospital in England had climbed to 11,452 on Thursday, the highest level since 26 February. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS is facing a “perfect storm” of rising Covid hospital admissions and illness alongside increasing numbers of frontline workers being off sick. The NHS is putting in plans to step up once again for patients with the new Nightingale surge hubs, extra support from community services and virtual wards, but there is no doubt the whole system is running hot. While the government seems determined not to increase restrictions in England, it is vital we all behave in ways that will not exacerbate an already dangerous situation. NHS England national medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the health service is “on a war footing” and minimising absences on the frontline would be “essential” in the coming weeks. We don’t yet know the full scale of rising Omicron cases and how this will affect people needing NHS treatment but, having hit a 10-month high for the number of patients in hospital with Covid while wrestling with sharply increasing staff absences, we are doing everything possible to free up beds and get people home to their loved ones - and in the last week hundreds more beds were freed up each day compared to the week before. The NHS is on a war footing, and, while staff remain braced for the worst, with Covid absence for NHS staff almost doubling in the past fortnight, keeping as many colleagues as possible at work on the front line and minimising absence, will be essential in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, ministers have been warned they must be ready to apply restrictions “at pace” as the NHS puts itself on an emergency footing to deal with a possible surge in patients with Covid. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said trust leaders recognise that the UK government’s threshold for introducing extra measures in England “hasn’t been crossed yet” but that additional capacity is being created in case hospital pressures increase. Even if extra restrictions are put in place to control the Omicron variant, it will take two weeks to reduce the hospital admission rate, he said. Hopson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It is the government who sets the rules on restrictions, not the NHS, and we know that the government has set a high threshold on introducing new restrictions. So, on that basis, trust leaders can see why the government is arguing that, in the absence of a surge of seriously ill older patients coming into hospital, that threshold hasn’t yet been crossed. But we still don’t know if a surge will come, and indeed we are exactly talking about the preparations we are making for that surge right now. So, in terms of restrictions, I think we are in exactly the same place we’ve been for the past fortnight, which is the government needs to be ready to introduce tighter restrictions at real speed should they be needed. So-called Nightingale hubs are being established at some hospitals to deal with a “super-surge” in patients with Covid in a move that Hopson said would require the NHS to “go into an emergency mode” amid staff shortages, partly due to high coronavirus infections. He said recently retired health workers and volunteers would be asked to staff the hubs, which would be used for patients “who are effectively over the worst” and being readied for discharge. It came as a leading scientist said it is likely that the NHS will be overwhelmed by the spread of Omicron. Prof Peter Openshaw, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Breakfast: I think we haven’t quite reached the threshold that was set by government in terms of the NHS being overwhelmed, but it looks like that will be reached quite quickly. What I’m very concerned about is our NHS staff, my dear colleagues who have worked so, so hard all through the repeated waves of this infection. How are they going to cope? The World Health Organization has issued a message of hope while urging renewed action for the year ahead. WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “With the curtain closing on 2021, we are faced by a somber milestone, and a stark choice. The power is in our hands to change the course of the Covid-19 crisis once and for all.” South Africa, the first country to report the Omicron variant, says a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. UK prime minister Boris Johnson claims Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, in his new year’s message. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in England is up from 7,166 on Christmas Day, to 11,452. That is the highest figure since February. A huge number of people in England are not turning up for their Covid vaccine appointments, health leaders have said, saying as many as 40% of bookings are missed. Amid a shortage in the UK, National Pharmacy Association chairman Andrew Lane said more lateral flow tests are being distributed to pharmacies but supply is “still very patchy.” Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, has said “In terms of restrictions, I think we are in exactly the same place we’ve been for the past fortnight, which is the government needs to be ready to introduce tighter restrictions at real speed should they be needed. It is worth remembering that it does take about a fortnight for any new restrictions to affect the level of hospital admissions, so the pattern of hospital admissions for the next fortnight has already been set.” Schools and parents across Wales are preparing for some children to return to home and online learning when the new term begins. First minister Mark Drakeford said teacher and staff illness meant some pupils would return to home learning with decisions would be made by individual schools and councils, rather than the Welsh government. Hogmanay in Scotland will be marked for a second consecutive year with restrictions in place on the hospitality sector. Pubs will be able to stay open provided they have table service in place, but there will be no nightclubbing. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has praised healthcare workers in her new year’s address, and said “this is not the Hogmanay we all wanted and hoped for. But I believe that we can still look ahead to 2022 with optimism.” Israel’s health minister Nitzan Horowitz said the country will extend the offer of a fourth vaccine dose to elderly people in care facilities, citing their high exposure and vulnerability to infections. Hong Kong authorities have discovered cases of infection of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the community, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said. It marked the first local cases in about three months. Daily Covid cases in New South Wales, Australia, almost doubled overnight, raising pressure on the state’s health system. The Victorian and New South Wales governments are scrambling to organise the distribution of rapid antigen tests to vulnerable people amid short supply, confusion over who should use them and skyrocketing Covid case numbers. A US woman has told how she confined herself to an aeroplane toilet cubicle after testing positive for Covid halfway through a flight from Chicago to Iceland. New Zealand has eased rules on public gatherings in time for New Year’s Eve after a scare over community cases of the new Omicron variant. That is it from me, Martin Belam. I will see you here next week, and in the meantime I wish you all the best for the new year. Lucy Campbell will be here shortly to take you through the rest of the day. A couple of statistics derived from the NHS England figures that have been released this morning. Dan Bloom, a former colleague of mine at the Mirror, points out that the number of patients in hospital with Covid in England is up from 7,166 on Christmas Day, to 11,452. That is the highest figure since February. The Spectator have a slightly different take on this, with their data journalist Michael Simmons highlighting that “a third of Covid positive hospital patients in England are not primarily being treated for Covid.” This is a matter of some contention between those who say Covid cases risk overwhelming the NHS, and those that argue that a significant proportion of those in hospital “with Covid” only have it as a side issue, and it isn’t the primary reason they are occupying an NHS bed. In fact, much earlier this morning on Sky News, Chaand Nagpaul, who is chair of the Council of the British Medical Association, was asked about this. He had said: Whilst the proportion of people who end up in hospital as a result of Omicron is smaller, we’re definitely seeing significant increases. And the trouble is that those increases in hospitalisation mean that other patients – and there are 6 million people are on a waiting list at the moment, it’s a record for the NHS, 312,000 have been waiting more than 12 months – it means that they can’t then be treated in hospital because their beds have been occupied by other patients. You know, 25,000 patients were admitted with Covid in a four week period before Christmas, those are 25,000 beds that could have been available for other patients. He was then asked to clarify whether that was 25,000 people admitted with Covid, or 25,000 people in hospital who now have Covid, which isn’t quite the same thing. Dr Nagpaul said it was a good question, but he didn’t have the data. The argument here boils down to, on the one hand, if you are not in favour of further restrictions or precautions, arguing that incidental cases of Covid caught in hospital mean the numbers being admitted with Covid are over-stated and the NHS isn’t under as much pressure as people claim. On the other hand, the argument runs that these people are still in NHS beds and, presumably, need to be moved into more Covid-secure wards, be treated as Covid-positive, and have the potential to still get seriously ill with the novel coronavirus. Opposition parties in Wales have been calling for the Labour-led Welsh government to publish the advice from scientific advisors it used to introduce the “alert level two” restrictions Wales is living under. It has now published two reports from its Technical Advisory Group (TAG) that show that the advice changed significantly between 15 and 17 December. A TAG report dated 15 December said introducing very strong alert level four restrictions (measures such as staying local and non-essential shops shutting) would have a “material effect” on reducing the peak of cases. It said anything below alert level four would have “some dampening effect” but may not prevent “material harm to NHS and care services” and added it was “not advisable” to start off with “light touch” mitigations. Then a report dated 17 December said no matter what measures were taken peak cases would far exceed previous heights. Significantly, it said the size of the peak would be similar whether Wales moved to alert level two or four for a maximum of two weeks, the only difference being the timing of the peaks. Being in alert level four could delay peak hospitalisations from mid-late January to early February 2022. The report concluded that if restrictions were going to be applied for two weeks only, there may be “negligible benefit” but a “high cost” of imposing stricter rules. However, if bringing in restrictions for four weeks, alert level four “could have a significant impact”. A huge number of people in England are not turning up for their Covid vaccine appointments, health leaders have said, saying as many as 40% of bookings are missed. The revelation comes as the government claimed to have met its coronavirus booster jabs target, and that every adult in England had been offered a top-up shot. The NHS Confederation said it was “encouraging” to see people coming forward and getting their Covid-19 jabs but that it was receiving reports that some sites were only a third full. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said it had been informed by some primary care leaders that people were not showing up to as many as 40% of their scheduled bookings. “It is encouraging to see people still coming forward for their first and second doses, as well as the massive achievement on boosters,” he said. “However, cases of Omicron are rising rapidly … Health leaders are worried about the level of illness and demand that their staff across the NHS could have to respond to in January and so, it is vital that everyone who is eligible takes up the offer of a jab or booster shot.” Read more of Sarah Marsh’s report here: Huge numbers of people in England ‘not turning up for Covid booster jabs’ Schools and parents across Wales are preparing for some children to return to home and online learning when the new term begins. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said teacher and staff illness meant some pupils would return to home learning with decisions would be made by individualschools and councils, rather than the Welsh government. He told BBC Wales: “We’ve asked schools to prepare for how they can reopen and have children back in the classroom - what level of protections do they need to build in for that? “But in some places, because teachers are ill and other school staff aren’t able to be there, they will have to plan for some period where some children will have to be taught remotely again.” Drakeford has told people thinking of travelling to England from Wales for New Year’s Eve celebrations to “think consciously and carefully,” but is not asking people to remain in Wales, where nightclubs are closed and pubs and restaurants are operating under restrictions. “If you are travelling, make sure you have taken a lateral flow test before you go and think about the people you will be mixing with when you return,” he said. Leaders of a group of protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra, Australia are closely linked to a complex network of anti-vaccination and conspiracy groups which have been accused of spreading misinformation in Indigenous communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico. There have been a series of demonstrations by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti-vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at Old Parliament House over the past days. Among the protesters are Indigenous land rights activists, anti-vaccine groups and so-called sovereign citizens. The latter is a fringe conspiracy group rooted in antisemitism and organised around a haphazard collection of pseudo-legal beliefs broadly grouped around the notion that modern government is an illegitimate corporation. Before the fire on Friday, a piece of paper was taped to a door at Old Parliament House labelled a “notice of acquiescence by default”. It was addressed to, among others, “The Australian Commonwealth de facto Corporate Administration” and contained a garbled set of legalese mirroring sovereign citizen beliefs. Read more of Michael McGowan’s report here: Old Parliament House fire protesters linked to anti-vaccine and conspiracy groups My colleagues Alfie Packham and Rachel Obordo have spoken to three people about their plans for New Year’s Eve, posing the question – is it time to self-isolate or to party? If you were thinking of heading out to celebrate New Year’s Eve tonight, this quote from Nervtag’s Prof Peter Openshaw on BBC Breakfast might give you pause for thought. PA Media quote him saying: Omicron is so infectious. We’re lucky really that it wasn’t this infectious when it first moved into human-to-human transmission. We’ve had several iterations of this virus going through different stages of its evolution. It has ended up being so infectious that it almost needs just a whiff of infected breath and you could get infected. We’re in a relatively good position in countries like the UK but I think you have to remember that in many parts of the world the vaccination rates are only about 5%, and they’re being exposed to this very infectious virus with very little protection. Omicron spread through Europe has sent Spain’s infection rate spiralling to record highs and decimated reservations at restaurants that had pinned their hopes on holiday season trade. Reuters spoke to Juan Lozano, head waiter at the La Querida restaurant in Madrid’s Pozuelo neighbourhood, which was almost fully booked in early December. He said that now just four tables out of La Querida’s two dozen booked on New Year’s Day. “We all thought... we’d be able to make some money and pay off many things that are overdue,” he said. Unlike other Spanish regions, which have imposed capacity limits, mandatory COVID passes and even a curfew in Catalonia, Madrid has not introduced any restrictions on eating out and socialising. But restaurants are still feeling the pinch. “The outlook is horrendously bad,” said Lozano, insisting that the government must give more support to the sector. He complained that state-backed soft loans were not enough. “People say ‘can’t you get a state credit?’ Yes but that’s a debt I have to pay back, isn’t it?” Part of the reason that the airwaves in the UK this morning have featured a lot of chatter that things aren’t so serious with the Omicron variant is because The Times lead their front page today with a story “No need for more Covid curbs, say NHS chiefs”. They opened: NHS chiefs do not believe that the threshold for new Covid-19 restrictions has been crossed despite a surge in hospital admissions. The number of patients with the coronavirus on wards in England rose to 11,452 yesterday, the highest since February and up 61 per cent in a week. While concerned by the increase in admissions, NHS leaders have been reassured by the fact that serious illness among the elderly has not risen significantly. They then quoted Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, saying: Although the numbers are going up and going up increasingly rapidly, the absence of large numbers of seriously ill older people is providing significant reassurance. But they are aware that this may change after the Christmas period. Trust CEOs know that the government has a high threshold to cross before it will introduce extra restrictions and can see why, in the absence of that surge of severely ill older people, that threshold hasn’t been crossed yet. Hopson has been asked about this on the BBC Radio 4 programme this morning, and this is what he said, according to PA Media (with my emphasis on the two key lines): It is the Government who sets the rules on restrictions, not the NHS. We still don’t know if a surge will come, and indeed we are exactly talking about the preparations we are making for that surge right now. So, in terms of restrictions, I think we are in exactly the same place we’ve been for the past fortnight, which is the government needs to be ready to introduce tighter restrictions at real speed should they be needed. And just to make the point that that is somewhat different to a headline that states NHS leaders think there is no need for more curbs - they may be needed at pace if the evidence warrants it. And just one more important point, I think - it is worth remembering that it does take about a fortnight for any new restrictions to affect the level of hospital admissions, so the pattern of hospital admissions for the next fortnight has already been set. Amid a lot of optimistic noises about evidence of the “mildness” of the Omicron variant and the modest rise in hospitalisations compared to cases so far in the UK, Professor Peter Openshaw, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), has struck a more cautious note this morning on BBC Breakfast. PA Media quote him saying: The latest figures show extraordinary rises in infection rates and this is before we’ve had time to see the full effect of what’s happened over Christmas. The people currently who are very sadly dying of Covid were probably infected on average about 35 days ago, so this was really before Omicron really started to transmit. It’s therefore too early to say what the impact of Omicron is going to be on more severe disease. It’s mostly been circulating in children, in people in contact with children, and it’s now going to spread into older adults at much higher risk of severe disease and those with pre-existing illnesses. I’m very, very glad that a very large majority of those have been triple-vaccinated because that gives you very good levels of protection, admittedly probably not for good but at least for a while. Here’s a little bit more detail from Reuters on the moves in Israel to offer a fourth vaccine shot. Dan Williams reports that health minister Nitzan Horowitz said today the country will extend the offer of a fourth shot to elderly people in care facilities, citing their high exposure and vulnerability to infections. An Israeli hospital administered fourth shots to a test group of health workers on Monday, in what it called the first major study into whether a second round of boosters will help contend with the Omicron coronavirus variant. Results are expected within two weeks. A health ministry expert panel last week recommended that Israel offer a fourth shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech to medical workers and those over 60 or with compromised immune systems. You may recall British prime minister Boris Johnson’s words from 12 December, when he told the UK in a televised address: A fortnight ago I said we would offer every eligible adult a booster by the end of January. Today, in light of this Omicron emergency, I am bringing that target forward by a whole month. Everyone eligible aged 18 and over in England will have the chance to get their booster before the New Year. There then ensued a minor kerfuffle about the exact semantics of that. It certainly seemed to give the impression in some quarters that the prime minister was promising those booster jabs would be administered to everyone who wanted one, not just offered, although as you can see it was very tightly worded. The government’s own Covid dashboard indicates that as of 29 December, 58.3% of those aged 12 and above have had a third booster jab. Bipasha van der Zijde is a marketing and communications adviser at KIT Royal Tropical Institute, and she writes for us today that we can vaccinate 70% of the world against Covid by mid-2022: According to the WHO vaccine strategy, published in October, the goal is to have 70% coverage across the world by June 2022. How can this target be achieved? Will freeing up intellectual property rights, often cited as a possible solution, bridge the widening gap? For a country to start producing vaccines from scratch would be a massive challenge. According to Benjamin Ongeri, a health supply chain specialist with Crown Agents in Kenya: “Countries like Kenya have begun this journey by targeting the final filling of vaccine vials locally which is still quite challenging given the need for state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plants that will guarantee safe production with no chance of contamination.” A lot more will be required in terms of technology transfer and building the expertise needed to fully produce vaccines locally, these cannot be achieved in the short to medium term. The answer lies in global funding mechanisms such as Covax – provided they can guarantee a pre-planned availability of vaccines. More equitable distribution of the jabs on a structural basis with longer shelf lives will allow for realistic and efficient planning. Read more here: Bipasha van der Zijde – We can vaccinate 70% of the world against Covid by mid-2022. Here’s how Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, has said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the use of extra capacity hubs at hospitals would be a recognition that there was an “emergency” situation needed to deal with Covid-19 admissions. PA Media quotes him saying: The hubs are there to have super-surge capacity on top of that, so we really would be in an emergency if we were having to use them and therefore we would have to use an emergency staffing model, because we are very clear in the NHS: we don’t have the staff, the existing staff, to be able to staff these beds, so we would have to go into an emergency mode. The important thing to understand is that what we would be using these hubs for - we wouldn’t be using these hubs for the most critically ill patients. What we would be doing is using them for patients who were effectively over the worst, heading towards discharge for home Earlier Dr Azeem Majeed, the head of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, cast some doubt on the ability to staff the hubs that were announced by NHS England yesterday. He told Times Radio: We saw when these hubs were established in March and April last year when the NHS struggled to find the staff to man those hospitals. Hopefully those won’t be needed, but if we do need those extra beds it will be a struggle to find the staff to deal with those patients - I’m not quite sure where those staff will come from given the fact hospitals are struggling now with their current workload. NHS England has said it is creating new small-scale “Nightingale” facilities with up to 100 beds each at eight hospitals across the country. The first sites will be at Preston, Leeds, Birmingham, Leicester, Stevenage, St George’s in London, Ashford and Bristol. In the UK, National Pharmacy Association chairman Andrew Lane said more lateral flow tests are being distributed to pharmacies but supply is “still very patchy”, and he expects the test packs to be picked up “within the first few hours” of them being delivered today. He added that pharmacy staff are facing abuse from patients frustrated by being unable to find a test. PA Media quote him telling BBC Breakfast: I spoke to the managing director of Alliance Healthcare who are our wholesalers that distribute the tests into pharmacies, and she assured me that they are putting out two million a day and we are starting to see that come through. It is still very patchy though, so I will say that not every pharmacy today will have a box but most pharmacies in the country will be having a box so we just ask the public to persevere, and also treat us with respect. We have had a lot of abuse over the last couple of weeks when the tests haven’t been there, but teams are doing their very best to help the public with this. A box will contain, I think, 54 tests and many of our members are reporting that that box is gone within the first couple of hours of arriving within the pharmacy. In December 2019 the World Health Organization was told of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. My colleagues Ashley Kirk and Pamela Duncan have produced these charts which show how Covid-19 has spread across the world since then. Hong Kong authorities have discovered cases of infection of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the community, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said. It marked the first local cases in about three months. Chan told reporters, including Marius Zaharia of Reuters, that one of four air crew members testing positive after their return to Hong Kong had breached home quarantine rules by going to a restaurant, where he passed the virus to his father and a client sitting at another table. Hong Kong had not recorded any coronavirus cases spread by community transmission since October. Schools in Wales are being asked to prepare for the possibility of reopening in January for remote learning. Yesterday First Minister Mark Drakeford explained in an interview with Wales Online that: The first two days of term are planning days. What the education minister Jeremy Miles has asked schools to do is to plan for two possible futures: the one in which children can still be in the classroom, where there are sufficient staff to be there to be able to provide face-to-face learning, but to maximise the protection that can be put in place inside the classroom to keep students and staff as safe as possible. But we recognise that there will be some schools where, because Omicron is so transmissible, there will be staff who will be ill so it won’t be possible for every child to be in the classroom and therefore that a return for some students for a shorter period of time as possible to online learning may have to be there as well. This morning Cathy Owen reports for Wales Online that Laura Doel, director of head teachers’ union NAHT Cymru, has described remote learning as a “last resort”, and called for tests to be prioritised for schools. She said: The availability of staff is the biggest threat to education in January. Without the workforce fit and well, learners cannot go back to the classroom. If regular LFTs are to be part of the package of mitigations it is vital that schools have a supply ready for reopening. Another doctor, Dr Azeem Majeed, head of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, has also been on the airwaves in the UK this morning to say that NHS workers are struggling to access Covid-19 tests, and the government should prioritise key workers when distributing them. PA Media quote him telling Times Radio: I struggled to get a test recently. I am required to test twice a week as an NHS worker but when I log on to the online site, there’s often none in stock. It’s not just NHS staff but other key workers too, such as social care workers, police, fire service and so on, who need these tests as well so it is worrying that they’re in such short supply at the moment. My view is that people in key groups, whether they’re healthcare workers or other key workers like public transport should be prioritised to ensure our NHS can function, our schools can function, that our society can function well. Testing capability is also making the headlines in Australia. Ben Butler reports for us: The Victorian and New South Wales governments are scrambling to organise the distribution of rapid antigen tests to vulnerable people amid short supply, confusion over who should use them and skyrocketing Covid case numbers. Amid a national shortage of the tests, both governments said they were working out how best to distribute tens of millions of kits they have ordered, most of which will not arrive until the end of January. NSW and Victoria have watered down previous commitments to provide free tests after a national cabinet meeting with the federal government on Thursday. Adding to the confusion, on Friday morning the prime minister, Scott Morrison, issued a statement removing a requirement that confirmed Covid cases who are in isolation but don’t have symptoms take a test on the sixth day. This directly contradicted statements, also made on Friday, by the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and Victoria’s health minister, Martin Foley, that a day-six rapid test was required. Read more of Ben Butler’s report here: NSW and Victoria unable to explain how Covid rapid antigen tests will be distributed to vulnerable Chaand Nagpaul, who is chair of the Council of the British Medical Association, has been on Sky News this morning in the UK outlining what he sees as one of the significant issues with the lack of availability of lateral flow or PCR tests in the UK at the moment – the knock-on effect for staffing in the NHS. He said: We’ve seen up to about a three times increase in staff absence from either infection or isolation in some London hospitals. Now that’s creating huge pressure on the system, when we already are short-staffed at the busiest time of the year. And to add to that problem, we now have a situation where many staff cannot get their lateral flow tests, or a PCR test, which means they can’t return to work. Because what they need to return to work is to demonstrate a negative lateral flow test on day six and seven, which was specially introduced so that we can shorten the period of isolation. So this is creating enormous problems for us. And for the workforce that remains, they’re having to carry out the work of their absent colleagues. And that’s adding additional strain and stress, and patients are therefore going to suffer as a result. Hogmanay in Scotland will be marked for a second consecutive year with restrictions in place on the hospitality sector. Pubs will be able to stay open provided they have table service in place, but there will be no nightclubbing. In her new year message, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has praised healthcare workers, saying: Throughout this year, our health and care workers have continued to do an absolutely magnificent job. And those working on our vaccination programme have provided all of us with an incredible service. Thanks to their efforts – and also thanks to the sacrifices of people right across the country – earlier this year businesses were able to reopen. The Omicron variant is a very significant threat. It means that at the moment, we need above all to keep each other safe. We all need to stay at home, far more than we would want to at this time of year. And we have asked that you minimise new year socialising as much as you can. So this is not the Hogmanay we all wanted and hoped for. But I believe that we can still look ahead to 2022 with optimism. Queensland in Australia is due to change travel restrictions into the state despite a surge in fresh Covid cases and criticisms the new requirements are “pointless” in states with large outbreaks. From 11.59pm on Friday 31 December, travellers entering Queensland will be required to return a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) result within 72 hours before travel, rather than a negative PCR test. The change in rules comes as the state recorded 3,118 new cases overnight, with the number of active infections rising to 11,697. Evidence of a negative test result has to be uploaded to the Queensland Health website when applying for a border pass, with applicants making a declaration the information is correct. However, the change raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of test results, as unlike PCR tests, the tests are not performed by trained professionals or analysed by and reported to a central authority. Police commissioner Katarina Carroll said on Wednesday that from January those caught lying about a RAT result on their border declaration would face a heavy fine. Read more of Royce Kurmelovs’ report here: Queensland’s new travel rule labelled ‘pointless’ as state faces fresh Covid surge A lot of the noises coming from politicians and health experts in the UK seems cautiously optimistic across much of the media this morning. One concern though is the continued shortage of Covid tests, which may impact people’s ability to test themselves before going out tonight. To give you an idea of the availability issue, one web developer Russ Garrett has been monitoring the situation on the government’s own booking website, and the picture looks pretty grim from the last few days. Hello, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over from Samantha Lock. Here’s a recap of the latest Covid figures for the UK. Over the last seven days there have been nearly 1 million new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK – 984,147. Cases have increased by 45.1% week-on-week. There have been 701 deaths recorded in the last week. Deaths have decreased by 10.6% week-on-week. Hospital admissions have increased by 32.3% week-on-week. At the latest count on the UK government’s own dashboard, there were 11,898 people in hospital in total, of whom 868 are in ventilation beds. There’s some considerable caveats over those numbers though, due to data collection issues over the holiday period. With the constraint on the availability of tests, that record number of new cases may be an undercount. Nevertheless, the large number of cases is yet to translate into a significant increase in deaths or hospitalisations, which many will see as a positive sign and a vindication of the decision in England not to impose significant new Covid restrictions. The World Health Organization has issued a message of hope while urging renewed action for the year ahead. WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: With the curtain closing on 2021, we are faced by a somber milestone, and a stark choice. The power is in our hands to change the course of the Covid-19 crisis once and for all.” In a statement titled ‘My hope for ending the Covid-19 pandemic’ Tedros outlined a series of resolutions including a global target of vaccinating 70% of people in all countries by the middle of 2022, building a stronger global framework for global health security and investing in stronger primary health care. I believe that if we can make progress on these goals, we will be gathering again, at the end of 2022, not to mark the end of a third year of pandemic, but to celebrate a return to pre-Covid norms, when we gathered with our families and communities to celebrate together and cherish each other’s company and love.” In series of video messages shared to Twitter, he added: If we end inequity, we end the pandemic, and end the global nightmare we have all lived through. This will be the year we end it [the pandemic] … When health is at risk everything is at risk.” If you’ve just joined us here’s a quick rundown of the latest developments: UK prime minister Boris Johnson claims Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, in his new year’s message. South Africa, the first country to report the Omicron variant, says a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. Daily Covid cases in New South Wales, Australia, almost doubled overnight, raising pressure on the state’s health system. Israel has approved a fourth vaccine shot for vulnerable and immunocompromised people, becoming one of the first countries to do so. China is set to impose new import restrictions over virus contamination fears in a move that has worried foreign businesses providing goods to the world’s largest market for food and drink. South Korea said on Friday it will extend stricter social distancing rules for two weeks until 16 January. The curbs ban gatherings of over four fully vaccinated people, and require restaurants, cafes and bars to close by 9pm and movie theatres and internet cafes by 10pm. A US woman has told how she confined herself to an aeroplane toilet cubicle after testing positive for Covid halfway through a flight from Chicago to Iceland. New Zealand has eased rules on public gatherings in time for New Year’s Eve after a scare over community cases of the new Omicron variant. New York City will go ahead with New Year’s Eve celebrations in Times Square as planned despite record numbers of Covid-19 infections. Foreign revellers on Indonesia’s resort island of Bali have been warned they could be deported if they are caught violating Covid-19 health rules during New Year celebrations. US health experts are urging Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks due to the rising wave of Covid cases led by the Omicron variant. Hello and thanks for joining us for our final Covid blog of 2021. I’m Samantha Lock and I’m certainly hoping for a more promising new year ahead and end to the pandemic. UK prime minister Boris Johnson claims Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, in his new year’s message. “We can say one thing with certainty - our position this December the 31st is incomparably better than last year,” Johnson said, while admitting there was still anxiety about the Omicron variant and growing numbers of hospital admissions. However, he hailed the success of the government’s vaccine programme as the “one overriding reason” that tougher restrictions were not needed in the face of daily case numbers hitting record levels. “Precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all,” he said. More promising news has also emerged from South Africa, the first country to report the Omicron variant. Health officials say a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. “All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level,” a statement from the special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said. New cases detected in the week ending 25 December fell 29.7% compared to the previous week, government data showed. Daily Covid cases in New South Wales, Australia, almost doubled overnight, raising pressure on the state’s health system. Cases have likely exceeded 25,000 a day, a month earlier than the government was predicting a fortnight ago, an acceleration likely to bring forward the strains on the health system, experts say. The NSW government reported 21,151 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, almost a 90% jump on the previous day’s tally. Kerry Chant, the state’s chief health officer, said in a video briefing it’s “likely” the increase is higher than reported. Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller at Monash University said tests were probably catching about 80% of actual cases, meaning NSW will already be at the 25,000 cases a day rate flagged by health minister Brad Hazzard on 15 December. Read the full story here. The World Health Organization has shared an optimistic message ahead of the New Year. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, infectious disease epidemiologist and WHO Covid-19 Technical Lead, said: We can take the death out of Covid-19 and we can also reduce the spread. It will end. This pandemic will end. I’m incredibly hopeful for 2022 in the fact that we can regain control over this.” Germany is reporting a daily rise of 41,240 confirmed coronavirus cases and 323 deaths, according to recently released data from the Robert Koch Institute. China will impose new import restrictions from Saturday in a move that has worried foreign businesses providing goods to the world’s largest market for food and drink. Under laws set to kick in on 1 January, all producers of food shipped to China will have to register with the customs authority. The extra hurdle was previously required only for products posing potential health risks, such as seafood. But now coffee, alcohol, honey, olive oil, chocolate and several other products will also be scrutinised, Agence France-Presse reports. On New Year’s Day, “the import curtain will fall”, Alban Renaud, a China-based lawyer with the firm Adaltys, told AFP. Food companies and importers have already been battered by control measures included in Beijing’s strict zero-Covid strategy, with China linking the virus to food ever since a Beijing outbreak last year was blamed on imported salmon. Products entering China are now subject to extra screening and repeated disinfection, with products often banned when a Covid outbreak is discovered at the point of packing overseas. The World Health Organization has said the chances of Covid-19 being transported in food are slim. South Korea said on Friday it will extend stricter social distancing rules for two weeks amid a persistent surge in serious coronavirus infections and concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant. The government reinstated the curbs on 18 December, six weeks after easing them under a “living with Covid-19” scheme, as record-breaking numbers of new infections and serious cases put a huge strain on the country’s medical system. The extension is also aimed at bracing for a further spread of Omicron cases by using the time to secure more hospital beds and encourage a booster vaccine shot campaign, Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said. “We should reserve sufficient beds that can cover some 10,000 cases a day, and we should also speed up booster shots and children’s vaccinations,” he told an intra-agency meeting. The curbs, which will be effective until 16 January ban gatherings of over four fully vaccinated people, and require restaurants, cafes and bars to close by 9 pm and movie theatres and internet cafes by 10pm. Unvaccinated people can only dine out alone, or use takeout or delivery services. South Korea also cancelled its traditional midnight bell-ringing ceremony. A US woman has told how she confined herself to an aeroplane toilet cubicle after testing positive for Covid halfway through a flight from Chicago to Iceland. Marisa Fotieo, a teacher from Michigan, said her throat began to hurt halfway through the trip so she went to the bathroom to perform a rapid Covid test which confirmed she was infected. “I just took my rapid test and I brought it into the bathroom, and within what felt like two seconds there were two lines [indicating a positive test],” Fotieo told NBC News. Sharing the news over TikTok, Fotieo posted a short video from inside the cramped quarters, writing: “POV you test positive for Covid while over the Atlantic Ocean.” Read the full story here. Stock markets in Asia are looking mixed today with the Nikkei, Australia’s ASX200 index and Kospi in Seoul all down. This is despite the Nikkei finishing at its highest point since 1989 – just before its bubble burst – in Thursday’s session. It was more positive in China and Hong Kong where all the induces were up helped by positive figures about China’s giant manufacturing sector and an easing of commodity prices. New Zealand has eased rules on public gatherings in time for New Year’s Eve after a scare over community cases of the new Omicron variant. The country is set to lead the world’s celebrations of the new year at midnight on Friday and crowds will be allowed to gather in Auckland for the first time since August to join in the party after the city’s Covid traffic-light settings were moved from red to orange. New Zealand is traditionally one of the first countries to bring in the new year before time differences usher in midnight elsewhere but the festivities had been threatened by tight coronavirus restrictions in place for months. Under orange settings, the bars, restaurants and cafes that enforce vaccine pass requirements can remove crowd size limits and the requirement to sit down, allowing people to dance the night away. Read the full story here. New York City will go ahead with New Year’s Eve celebrations in Times Square as planned despite record numbers of Covid-19 infections. Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed the news on Thursday, saying the city’s high Covid-19 vaccination rate makes it feasible to welcome masked, socially distanced crowds to watch the ball drop in Times Square. We want to show that we’re moving forward, and we want to show the world that New York City is fighting our way through this. We’ve got to send a message to the world. New York City is open.” City officials previously announced plans for a scaled-back New Year’s bash with smaller crowds and vaccinations required. Other US cities such as Atlanta have cancelled New Year’s Eve celebrations, New York City reported a record number of new, confirmed coronavirus cases — almost 44,000 — on Wednesday, according to New York state figures. Foreign revellers on Indonesia’s resort island of Bali have been warned they could be deported if they are caught violating Covid-19 health rules during New Year celebrations, authorities warned on Thursday. Bali immigration office head Jamaruli Manihuruk warned that health rules must be observed in an interview with AFP. Get ready to be kicked out.” Bali’s governor has barred carnivals, fireworks and gatherings of more than 50 people over the Christmas and New Year period. Malls, restaurants and cafes must shut by 10pm, and only operate at 75% capacity. Bali has taken a tough stance on tourists who violate Covid-19 protocols. Almost 200 tourists were deported from Bali in 2021, Manihuruk said, with seven booted out for violating health protocols. Indonesia has been seriously hit by the coronavirus pandemic. As of Wednesday, it had reported more than 4.2 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, and more than 144,000 deaths. Bali alone reported more than 110,000 confirmed cases with over 4,000 deaths. Vaccination rates remain relatively low and country is vulnerable to new outbreaks. US health experts are urging Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks due to the rising wave of Covid cases led by the Omicron variant. Dr Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told MSNBC: We are going to see the number of cases in this country rise so dramatically, we are going to have a hard time keeping everyday life operating. The next month is going to be a viral blizzard,” he added. “All of society is going to be pressured by this.” Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, also warned cases will likely rise throughout January. The governor of Louisiana, where hospitalisations have more than tripled in the past two weeks, said January would be “very challenging”. “We are still at the very beginning of this current surge,” John Bel Edwards told a news conference on Thursday. “January is going to be very, very challenging.” The warning comes as the United States reached a record high in Covid-19 cases for the second day in a row. South Africa has lifted a nighttime curfew on people’s movement with immediate effect, believing the country has passed the peak of its fourth coronavirus wave driven by the Omicron variant. The government removed the midnight-to-4am curfew based on the trajectory of the pandemic, vaccination levels and available capacity in the health sector, the government said on Thursday. A statement from a special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said: All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level. While the Omicron variant is highly transmissible, there has been lower rates of hospitalisation than in previous waves.” Data from the Department of Health showed a 29.7% weekly decrease in new cases detected in the week ending 25 December, the government said. Hospital admissions have declined in eight of South Africa’s nine provinces. South Africa, with close to 3.5 million infections and 91,000 deaths, has been the worst-hit country in Africa during the pandemic on both counts, and was where the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was first detected last month. The country is at the lowest of its five-stage Covid-19 alert levels. Israel has approved a fourth vaccine shot for vulnerable and immunocompromised people, becoming one of the first countries to do so, amid a surge in Covid in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The country also received its first shipment of Pfizer’s anti-Covid pills. Health ministry director-general Nachman Ash told reporters: Today I approved giving the fourth vaccine for immunocompromised people. I did this in light of studies that show the benefit of the vaccine, including the fourth vaccine, to this population, and in light of the fear they are more vulnerable in this outbreak of Omicron.” Health authorities reported on Thursday more than 4,000 new cases, a high not seen since September. Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said Israel was in “a fifth wave”, with most cases probably related to the Omicron variant. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel, which was among the first countries in the world to offer a third shot to the general public, would be a trailblazer for the fourth jab. “Israel will lead the way in administering a fourth vaccine to the Israeli people,” he said. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we count down the final hours until 2022. Regions across the world are battling to stem a surge in Covid infections driven largely by the Omicron variant. However South Africa, the first country to report the variant, appears to be bucking the trend. Health officials say a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. “All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level,” a statement from the special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said. New cases detected in the week ending 25 December fell 29.7% compared to the previous week, government data showed. Meanwhile in the United States, health experts are urging Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks due to the rising wave of Covid cases led by the Omicron variant. “We are going to see the number of cases in this country rise so dramatically, we are going to have a hard time keeping everyday life operating,” Dr Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told MSNBC. “The next month is going to be a viral blizzard,” he added. “All of society is going to be pressured by this.” Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, also warned cases will likely rise throughout January. Here’s a quick summary of the latest Covid developments: The number of people to die from Covid in Eastern Europe has reached 1 million, as Russia climbed above Brazil to become the country with the second-highest deaths behind the US. South Africa said the country had passed its Omicron peak without a major death surge, offering hope to countries hit hard by the mutated variant. France reported 206,243 new confirmed Covid cases, a tally above 200,000 for the second day running. The UK reported 189,213 new Covid cases, smashing Wednesday’s record-breaking tally of 183,037 positive tests. The UK is dogged by a shortage of tests, as Wales assists England with 4m tests amid fears of New Year’s Eve celebrations turning into breeding grounds for the virus. Scotland’s first minister urged people to avoid household mixing after a record high of nearly 17,000 cases. India fears it is entering a new wave after cases surge, as confirmed Omicron cases also climb. Portugal cuts Covid isolation from ten days to seven, after the World Health Organization said on Wednesday slashing isolation was a trade-off between transmission and economic concerns. Germany will drop quarantine demands for UK travellers from 4 January after seeing its own Omicron cases jump above 3,000 recently. Malaysia detected 3,997 positive Covid cases, with the number among survivors of its recently deadly floods rising to 442 in total. Japan recorded over 500 new infections for the first time in two months. Five Bulgarian regions moved from yellow to red zones as the country recorded 3,449 new infections, a 139% jump on two weeks ago. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all people should avoid cruises, following a rise in onboard Covid cases in a major blow to the industry."

          "bodyText": "Rural readers are in for a bumper crop of established and emerging writers festivals taking place in country regions throughout 2022, a harvest that also offers plenty of flavour to city-dwelling book lovers seeking literary-themed getaways. Jerilderie-born author of The Dressmaker, Rosalie Ham, says events in the bush have always provided a great excuse for a reunion of like minds. Her extensive literary circuit all began with an invitation to talk at a writers festival in country Victoria. “Shepparton was home territory and I felt reassured about my first festival, but was nervous that someone would accuse me of writing mean things about them, or small towns, or that someone would ask me a question I couldn’t answer,” she says. “I arrived hours too early, my car loaded with every swish outfit I owned, and watery with nerves. I walked to the festival venue from the motel and bumped into an old neighbour, was given a plate of food and a glass of wine, then seated at a table with some Shep locals. “I watched how writers were just people in the green room but turned into performers when they stepped on to a stage. When it was my time to present I knew the audience had come to hear and enjoy, and that I had something to offer.” ‘Basically a big celebration’ In Ham’s experience, rural writers festivals are compact and less frantic. “Everyone knows everyone in country areas so it’s a bit of a reunion, a strengthening of bonds and a happy place to be. “There’s one main street and limited selection for meals, so there’s no point keeping your guard up or pretending you don’t see the romance or fantasy writers. By the end of day one you’ll be besties and have learned something.” She says she has never been approached while taking time out in a country town but “a couple of ladies once waited outside my loo door to have me sign their book”. One remote literary event required a memorable flight. “I didn’t recognise anyone in the boarding lounge but we started sharing ‘looks’ when we realised how tiny the plane was,” she says. “The pilot had to deliver the safety instructions on his knees. Conversation was impossible and the plane shuddered, dipped and rattled its way over lifeless, parched farming country below. It was a great leveller, and we were all relieved to squash into the waiting minibus. Then it drove off without our luggage, so had to chuck a uey. From that point on we were all inseparable.” For its general meeting in Alpha, Queensland, the Isolated Children’s Parents’ Association set up a city of tents. “They were all exactly the same, army-base neat, a gift pack waiting on each neatly made-up stretcher,” Ham says. “People also slept in horse floats and caravans. There were speeches, visiting dignitaries, local celebrities, a band, a dance, a bar – basically a big celebration that ran seamlessly over three days. “It was one of the most impressive efforts at community cooperation that I’ve ever been part of.” Ham also travelled to a Isolated Children’s Parents’ Association event at Hatfield, in the NSW Riverina: “We drove past a deserted corrugated shed under a huge bald tree in the middle of a vast flatness, and someone said, ‘That’s where you’re doing your talk tomorrow.’ “It was an all-girl meeting, and the next day the hall was surrounded by a hundred or more four-wheel drives, the ladies were fixing a clogged toilet and kids hung from or perched on every branch from top to bottom of the huge tree. “Inside the shed was like the produce hall at the Royal Melbourne Show, the noise of discussing, swapping information, catching up and laughing deafening. As expected, the day featured an impressive line-up of speakers, delicious food and ran without a hitch.” ‘The world is small’ Ham’s breakout novel The Dressmaker and its screen adaptation introduced the world to seamstress Tilly Dunnage, who returns to her fictitious hometown Dungatar and unleashes an epic tale of retribution. This portrait of rural Australia, now extended in the sequel The Dressmaker’s Secret, usually sets country tongues wagging. “When I talk about small communities I see the body language shift, people nodding and nudging their friends, and I can feel the hard gazes of those who have something to say. “Once someone said, ‘My best friend’s dad was a crossdresser, he owned the local frock shop,’” Ham says, referencing fashionista Sergeant Horatio Farrat, the character played by Hugo Weaving in the film of her book. According to Ham, it was this recognition and empathy that caused The Dressmaker to hit its mark well before the film came out. “Most rural folk are curious, a skill that’s necessary to succeeding in an environment that changes often yet stays the same,” she says. “Country people meet the unexpected and are accepting and tolerant, quite unlike the general cliche stereotype we see so often.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Vintage couture is often a hallmark of Ham’s appearances at country events. The film of The Dressmaker was made by her childhood friend Sue Maslin, and they travelled far and wide in the wake of that film to festivals and rural occasions. “Women came wearing something they whipped up 50 years ago that has stood the test of time, or their mother’s 1950s frock, even their grandmother’s vintage couture,” Ham says. “The blokes dug out their dad’s wedding suit. “There’s an underground movement, a vast cult of sewers, men and women, who tenderly care for their sewing machines and gather in large numbers all over Australia to stitch and socialise, compete and learn.” Ham says she enjoys meeting readers at literary events because they remind her book lovers are a tangible, discerning group; plus she keeps them in mind as she writes. “You also learn to be on your best behaviour at all times because the world is small,” she says. “You never know who you’ll run into.” Country writers festivals 2022 Literary events are taking place across regional and country Australia in 2022.

          "bodyText": "Leading health bodies are urging the federal government to defer “mayhem” changes to Medicare Benefits Schedule telehealth arrangements that would hit vulnerable patients as Covid cases surge. The changes, due to come into effect on 1 January, will restrict phone consultations for a long list of specialist items in favour of video conferencing or face-to-face appointments. The Clinical Oncology Society of Australia (COSA) president and medical oncologist, Prof Fran Boyle, said the timing of the changes was “appalling” considering the dramatic increases in Covid cases across the nation. She said the changes to MBS item numbers, intended to help people with cancer and other illnesses, would limit access to care for vulnerable demographics, particularly in remote areas. Telehealth services were dramatically expanded as a temporary Covid measure in March last year, to reduce community transmission and protect patients and health care providers. Pre-Covid, telehealth was used in a limited way for people living in rural and remote areas to access specialists via video conferencing facilities at health centres. On 13 December, the Department of Health announced $106m would be provided over four years to support continuing telehealth services as a permanent fixture in the Australian health system, a move broadly welcomed by health bodies. Days later, it was announced 128 telehealth items would end from the new year on the recommendation of the MBS Review Taskforce. Boyle said she only became aware of the changes two weeks out when they were publicly released. “They made their own quiet plan,” she said. She said most of her patients would be “hit like a hammer” when the changes came into effect. “Most people have no clue it’s about to happen,” she said. “We will have to reorganise a week of patients, which is a stress they don’t need. “It looks like they’re giving everybody something – you can keep telehealth as a specialist service without a distance requirement, but only if it’s done by video. “What’s going to be a major problem for patients this coming week is the phone consultations will no longer have the medicare item number they’d be expecting from the last year.” Boyle said “overwhelmingly” patients took up phone consultations as video added a “layer of complexity” and wasn’t an option for many – notably older people and others with limited access to technology and reliable internet in regional and rural Australia. And, with cases doubling in NSW almost every day, she said patients would be “very worried” about coming back into clinics. “They had only just started getting back their confidence,” Boyle said. “I can bet you they won’t want to next week and we won’t want them to either. The people in the country who are still the most vulnerable to Covid are people with cancer, because they really struggle to get immunity even with two or three vaccines. “It was an OK plan if there was no virus and it was business as usual, but business cannot be usual for cancer patients. These people are anxious enough already about their own vulnerability, the timing couldn’t be worse.” Boyle said the one item remaining for phone consultations with cancer specialists – a “rarely used” item number for brief conversations with a patient you already knew – was a “small concession”. “Sometimes a backflip is required and I’m pretty sure they know how to do that now,” Boyle said. The Australian Medical Association president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said “acknowledging we are still in a pandemic” would have seen the availability of item numbers extended, not reduced. “The limitation of a whole series of numbers might be justifiable in a post-pandemic world but it’s going to make the provision of medical care during this extreme outbreak in NSW that much more difficult,” he said. “We’ve repeatedly suggested while the pandemic is here there should be full access to the measures brought in at the start of the pandemic. That’s certainly not transpired.” Khorshid said the AMA had been in negotiation with the federal government for a “long time” and had been supportive of access to phone items, while the health department had been “very much of the mind” they should be limited. “Presumably with concern they’ll cost more money,” he said. “We’ve made it very clear by removing phone items you’re creating inequity in the community. “People least able to access videoconferencing are often people with the most health needs – rural and elderly Australians. “Patients will have almost no awareness, it’s very little notice and very much last minute.” Cancer Australia data indicates only 2% to 5% of monthly specialist services were delivered by telehealth video call in the first part of 2020, compared with 10% to 24% via phone. A recent study on patient satisfaction with telehealth consultations similarly found patients undergoing phone appointments were more likely to continue with the service than those who used videoconferencing. The lead researcher Dr Andrew Parsonson said lack of infrastructure and technical difficulties with the videoconferencing technology may have been key barriers to overcome the scaled implementation of consultations via video. Rare Cancers Australia, a consumer advocate group, said it was also “deeply concerned” about the restrictions of telephone consults. “Cancer disproportionately impacts older Australians who are not as technically proficient as younger patients,” chief executive Richard Vines said. “Denying them access to telephone consultation is heartless. “The video conferencing facilities currently available at some of the major cancer centres are neither reliable nor intuitive. On each of the last four occasions when my wife has attempted remote consultation we have needed to revert to the telephone for effective communication.” Breast Cancer Network Australia said it was “too soon” to remove telehealth items from the MBS and called on the federal government to defer the changes as Covid cases place increased pressure on the health system. The network’s director of policy, advocacy and member support, Vicki Durston, requested a deferral to the changes to provide more time for clinicians and consumers to have a “seat at the table” to inform decisions that affect cancer care. “This is of particular concern to our network of people with breast cancer who have relied heavily on telehealth over the past two years for their treatment and follow-up care,” she said. The health department was approached for comment."

          "bodyText": "And so here we are: among the dark, blustery, not so cold days of between-Christmas-and-new-year. A time to say goodbye to 2021, the year everyone hoped would be better than 2020, and that wasn’t, really. The year many hoped would mean the end of the pandemic, though the one certainty of early 2022 is the Omicron variant. This moment of the calendar – curiously inert for those whose work pauses at this time of the year – offers for many a precious kind of deep inactivity. This year, the British are not entering a prolonged and complete lockdown as we did when 2020 slipped into 2021, but still, in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, there are many restrictions on the extent to which people may gather together, and in England, those alert to the dangers are broadly following suit voluntarily. The time, in short, is one of retreat; for some, loneliness. The temptation is to switch on the TV and to revel in the teeming joys of all that the bafflingly myriad streaming services have to offer. Christmas movies – all the way through the spectrum from Die Hard to Love Actually, according to taste – are available at the click of the remote. For some, it’s a time to finally binge-watch Succession; or to sit down in front of a classy adaptation of a family classic, like the BBC’s entertaining Around the World in 80 Days. But solace comes in other ways too, ones that are easy to forget amid the seasonally guiltless possibilities of TV immersion. Company and comfort can come through reading, and, in particular, the reading of wintry, frosty books. There are many stories that readers turn to again and again at this time of year, some of them at least supposedly for children. Philip Pullman’s modern classic Northern Lights has its culmination in the icy far north where the aurora borealis dances, ruled over by polar bears and witches. Susan Cooper’s 1973 story for young readers, The Dark Is Rising, is for some grown-ups an annual ritual, to be begun on the eve of the solstice, 20 December, when the story begins, and continued in real time until its end on Twelfth Night. The tale is set in the unmagical semi-rural locale of Windsor and Slough. But for young Will, who turns 11 on the shortest day, his life is about to become one of enchantment and danger. The world around him is to be submerged in the deepest, longed-for, but perilous snow. The forces of dark will do battle with the forces of light, and Will is to play his part. Cooper, who as an undergraduate attended lectures by JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, drew on Arthurian tales, and British and English folklore, to invest her chosen landscape with a rich stratigraphy of story. Her book also has a fond relationship with the 1935 children’s novel The Box of Delights by John Masefield – poet laureate and, briefly, a Guardian leader writer. It is another child’s story, drawing on British mythology, that takes place in deep snow – and in which those benign-seeming theological students out carolling might not be all that they seem. The Box of Delights itself is a thrilling, magical mechanism that can take you anywhere you desire. It is a metaphor for the act of reading itself – the power of story to transport a person anywhere, out of isolation, into thrilling new worlds far away from the anxieties that attended the limping, wintry end of 2021 in Britain."

          "bodyText": "My friend Terence O’Malley, who has died aged 79, was an inspirational teacher who became a passionate campaigner for the rights and welfare of the people of Afghanistan, and chairman since 2000 of Safe, the Irish aid organisation for Afghanistan. Terry was fired by a deep sense of injustice at the neglect by foreign powers of their former battleground in Afghanistan. In 2001, a month after the September 11 attacks, he wrote in the Irish Times of that neglect and of the aid efforts that had been hampered by a failure to grasp local nuances of behaviour and custom. The exceptions occurred when aid workers “who had spent many years working among the Afghans … knew and understood Afghan tribal customs and identified with them and were privileged to have Afghans as close friends”. In that spirit (and for comfort) he wore local dress when visiting remote communities on horseback, immersed himself in the culture – and made friends. He put his trust in Afghans and sought partnership with local NGOs, initially helping to educate young people for the reconstruction effort, later laying more emphasis on direct aid for rural development projects. The rights of Afghan women were a key concern. Terry aided Mary Akrami, who founded the first women’s shelters in Kabul. He was equally intent on creating the conditions for change, knowing that a Safe-funded school where girls would study alongside boys was a gateway to their liberation. Terry was born in Oldham, Greater Manchester, the son of Marion (nee Hilton) and George O’Malley. George’s job with ICI took the family to County Dublin when Terry was five and he was schooled at Midleton College, Cork, the High School Dublin and Trinity College Dublin, where he studied science and mathematics. Already he was drawn to the east: embarking for India straight after university, he spent six happy years managing tea estates in Assam. He and Patricia Daybell were married in Dibrugarh, Assam, in 1968 – they had known each other for years in Ireland. Back in Ireland, they worked shoulder to shoulder at Aravon preparatory school, south of Dublin, where Terry was headteacher for 20 years from 1977. The enthusiasm and sense of adventure that had taken him to India, and led him to get involved in Safe (Support for Afghan Further Education) in the 1990s, were part of what made Terry a gifted educator. Long before science became part of the Irish primary school curriculum, his pupils were engrossed in breeding locusts in the classroom – to name one award-winning project. He drew the children into his own passion for cricket and other sports, for drama, music and much more. Behind his old-school gravitas and pursuit of high standards lay a belief in education in the fullest sense of the word, and a warm, deep and thoroughly modern rapport with his pupils, in many cases lasting long after they had left school and until his final days. He is survived by Patricia, his daughters, Kate, Clare and Lucy, son, Jamie, his sister, Barbara, and seven grandchildren."

          "headline": "The best recent science fiction, fantasy and horror – reviews roundup",
          "bodyText": "The Actual Star by Monica Byrne (Voyager, £20) In her second novel, Byrne braids together three storylines, each set a thousand years apart. The final days of 1012 are depicted through the experiences of three royal siblings in the early post-classical Mayan era; in December 2012, Leah, a 19-year-old mixed race American, makes the journey of a lifetime to Belize; and in 3012, as the last of the icecaps disappear, the end of the diluvian age is celebrated all over the world. The entire population has been reduced to around 8 million, most of whom are always on the move and own no more than they can carry. A way of life forced on climate refugees has become the guiding philosophy of near-universal religion LaViaja, credited to Saint Leah, believed to have been the first person to reach Xibalba, the mystical world beyond this one. This is an incredibly ambitious and thought-provoking work. Termination Shock by Neal Stephenson (Borough, £20) Stephenson opens about 10 years in the future, on a day when the air in Houston is too hot to support planes. This means the private jet flown by the queen of the Netherlands must be diverted, causing some unexpectedly helpful additions to her entourage on the way to a meeting with a Texas billionaire who has a radical plan to cool the planet. How it could work, how it does work, why not everyone is pleased by this privately financed feat of geoengineering and how they might foil it comprises the plot. As usual, Stephenson writes at length and in detail about everyone and everything. At its best, his style creates an immersive depth, but sometimes it goes too far; as his Dutch queen would agree, when she has tidal surges “explained to her at a level of detail that would have rendered most royals catatonic”. But such moments are the exception in an absorbing speculative fiction about our climate crisis. The Book of Sand by Theo Clare (Century, £12.99) A small group of people find themselves in a dangerous desert world, where they are told that their only hope of survival is to treat each other as family. They are tasked with searching through a string of deserted cities for “the Sarkpont” that will allow them to escape. Failure means a terrible death inflicted by terrifying creatures they call the Djinn. Their story alternates with that of 17-year-old McKenzie, an American high school student obsessed by weather patterns and deserts, who begins to question everything she thought she knew. The two strands eventually come together in a way that is both shocking and satisfying. Theo Clare is a pseudonym for the thriller author Mo Hayder: she completed the first two novels in a planned series before her death last July from motor neurone disease. Hayder’s books were memorably disturbing studies of violence, but here she offers something more positive. Yes, there is constant danger, and the characters have to fight to survive, but the joys to be found in friendship and the power of mutual support are themes running through this compelling, absorbingly different quest fantasy. Hare House by Sally Hinchcliffe (Mantle, £14.99) The unnamed narrator of this modern gothic begins her story with the accidental killing of a hare. The creature’s significance will be clear to anyone familiar with legends of shape-shifting witches, and sets the tone for Hinchcliffe’s eerie and subtle second novel. The narrator, formerly a teacher in London, looks forward to peaceful solitude in the small cottage she has rented on a remote Scottish estate. But much as she enjoys her solitary explorations of the beautiful countryside, she is plagued by the sour, disapproving woman in the adjoining cottage, and irresistibly drawn to the big house, where her handsome landlord lives with his troubled young sister. Tension mounts after a heavy snowstorm downs power lines and closes roads. This deliciously chilly tale dodges the expected outcome and maintains a delicate balance between psychology and witchcraft right to its disturbing end. The Last Adventure of Constance Verity by A Lee Martinez (Jo Fletcher, £8.99) For 27 years Constance Verity has led a life of fantastic adventure, solving crimes, uncovering conspiracies, saving lives, even travelling through time and space. But she’s fed up now, and wants nothing more than a normal life, a regular boyfriend and even a boring job. She decides to track down the fairy godmother whose gift set the course of her life and force her to undo the spell. Of course this is no easy task, with danger round every corner, but she’s never failed yet. This very funny, enjoyable fantasy from 2016 is being published for the first time in Britain along with a sequel, Constance Verity Saves the World. A film adaptation is in the works."

          "bodyText": "Pick of the week Young Adult Charlize Theron’s underused talent for comedy is seen to full effect in Jason Reitman’s cutting 2011 film. Her YA author, Mavis, returns to her childhood Minnesota town with the half-baked notion of seducing ex-teenage sweetheart Buddy (Patrick Wilson) away from his wife and baby. Reluctantly abetted by ex-schoolmate Matt (a touching Patton Oswalt), she puts her plan into action by playing her old college rock mixtapes, drinking too much and acting like the “psychobitch prom queen” she once was. Grass-is-greener delusions and the debilitating effect of youthful trauma reverberate as Theron storms through suburbia, a magnificent car crash of a character. Friday 7 January, 11.25pm, BBC One *** The Sound of Music Sneaking into the festive schedule in time for the dregs of the mulled wine, Rodgers and Hammerstein’s nun-on-the-run musical makes its welcome, perennial appearance. Julie Andrews, coming off the back of Mary Poppins, is a natural as Maria, the novice governess whose real calling is turning the seven Von Trapp children into a happy family of choristers. Christopher Plummer has more gravitas than charm as the stern father, and the looming Nazi peril is at a family-friendly level, but the songs are the clincher – Edelweiss still wrings out a quiet tear. Saturday 1 January, 2.20pm, BBC One *** Cast Away There are few actors who could carry an entire film by themselves – and then make you want more of them – but Tom Hanks is that guy in Robert Zemeckis’s 2000 drama. His FedEx executive, Chuck, is stranded on a desert island in the remote Pacific Ocean after his cargo plane crashes, with only a volleyball for company (which he names Wilson and personalises with a bloody handprint for a face). Chuck’s initial mishaps and despair give way to practicality and acceptance – the seven stages of grief, in effect – all orchestrated deftly by Zemeckis. Sunday 2 January, 6.05pm, Channel 5 *** The Peanut Butter Falcon Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz’s 2019 film is an engaging adventure with more than a touch of the Huckleberry Finns about it. But the most impressive thing about it is the agency it gives its co-lead character, would-be wrestler Zak (Zack Gottsagen), who has Down’s syndrome. Stuck in an old people’s home because there’s nowhere else to put him, Zak makes his escape and hooks up with Shia LeBeouf’s dodgy fisherman, Tyler. Yes, their river trip together is a learning experience for Tyler but it is equally so for Zak, who grabs his newly won independence with both hands. Monday 3 January, 10pm, BBC Two *** Starred Up The title refers to the procedure where a juvenile offender is moved to an adult prison. Jack O’Connell’s cocky Eric has that dubious honour due to his violent behaviour, but his new home also contains his dad (Ben Mendelsohn) who is a lifer. O’Connell is a livewire presence here, holding his own against Mendelsohn’s hardman act. David Mackenzie’s edgy drama reveals the powder keg that a prison run on rules both legal and illegal can be, fuelled by a fractious father-son relationship. Monday 3 January, 11.15pm, Film4 *** A Quiet Place Part II Here’s more of the same horror from director John Krasinski and star Emily Blunt – but the first film’s triumph of nerve-tingling tension is worth repeating. After a flashback to the origins of the alien invasion, we take up with Blunt’s newly widowed Evelyn and her children, Regan (Millicent Simmonds), Marcus (Noah Jupe) and that crying baby. Cillian Murphy’s lone wolf Emmett mixes up the family dynamic a bit, but silence is still golden – and deaf Regan the key to survival – as the group discover signs of human life amid the sound-sensitive ETs. Friday 7 January, 12.40pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** The Trial A convincing adaptation by Orson Welles of Franz Kafka’s novel, about an office worker accused of an unnamed offence who becomes lost in a nightmare of bureaucracy as he tries to clear his name. Anthony Perkins brings the nervous energy of Norman Bates to the role of Josef K, and Welles uses his usual limited budget to great effect (not least by dubbing most of the actors himself), throwing Perkins into a disconcerting world of pan-European architecture and people – Jeanne Moreau and Romy Schneider among them. SW Friday 7 January, 10.50pm, Talking Pictures TV"

          "bodyText": "Well, that is it for the blog for today – and for the year! It’s been a big one, and I know I speak for the whole Guardian Australia staff when I say thank you so much for being here with us throughout 2021. From the insurrection in the US, to mice plagues, Cop26 and now Omicron. Through lockdowns and Australia’s political #MeToo movement, we are so thankful you have walked with us. To every one of our readers, I want to say you are what makes us, why we do what we do and why we go into the new year with hope. Before we go, let me recap the big stories today: NSW recorded 21,151 new Covid cases and six deaths, Victoria 5,919 cases and seven deaths, Tasmania 137 cases and Queensland 3,118, South Australia 2,093 cases and four deaths, Western Australia one new case and the ACT 462. Queensland police asked revellers: Don’t party too hard tonight. Testing sites in South Australia and Victoria closed due to extreme heat. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee said changes to testing, tracing, isolating and quarantining were “pragmatic”. The NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said actual case numbers were likely to be higher than reported. Cricket Australia confirmed Travis Head had tested positive to Covid, ruling him out of the Sydney Ashes Test. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said a third of cases in Victoria were Omicron and there was a national shortage of rapid antigen tests. South Australia said it would drop entry testing requirements for domestic travellers. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, maintained the state was in a “strong position” despite rising case numbers. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a change to isolation time – there will be no day six rapid antigen test for confirmed cases in isolation. The Northern Territory introduced indoor masks after recording 60 Covid cases. The Greens senator Lidia Thorpe was rebuked for appearing to back protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra. Two Tasmanian jumping castle victims were farewelled at funerals. And with that, there is a drink with my name on it, so I am putting this blog to bed. Stay safe, don’t make your resolutions too hard – we’ll see you tomorrow! Leaders of a group of protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra are closely linked to a complex network of anti-vaccination and conspiracy groups which have been accused of spreading misinformation in Indigenous communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico. There have been a series of demonstrations by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti-vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at Old Parliament House over the past days. Read the full story here: The Victorian and New South Wales governments are scrambling to organise the distribution of rapid antigen tests to vulnerable people amid short supply, confusion over who should use them and skyrocketing Covid case numbers. Amid a national shortage of the tests, both governments said they were working out how best to distribute tens of millions of kits they have ordered, most of which will not arrive until the end of January. NSW and Victoria have watered down previous commitments to provide free tests after a national cabinet meeting with the federal government on Thursday. Read more here: Police have confirmed one man is dead after part of the cliff at Victoria’s Bells beach collapsed earlier today. The victim is aged in his 20s and was part of a group of six that got stuck after the 30-metre cliff face gave way at about 2.15pm. A man and a woman also sustained non-life-threatening arm injuries and were taken to hospital in Geelong. Emergency crews originally said four people were injured but the number was revised. The beach is an internationally renowned surf spot, which up until the Covid pandemic held the annual Rip Curl Pro competition. With Australian Associated Press. Further breakthrough Covid cases have been detected in the Frozen The Musical company at Her Majesty’s Theatre in Melbourne. As a result, all performances are cancelled up to and including 2 January. The show is expected to return on 5 January. All ticket holders will receive an automatic refund. From AAP: Coronavirus cases have been recorded on remote King and Flinders Islands off Tasmania as the state registers another record daily infection tally. The state registered 137 new cases on Friday, bringing its number of active infections to 520. “Confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been identified on King and Flinders Islands,” acting public health director Julie Graham said. “Both cases are interstate travellers who received positive test results after arriving. They are both in isolation.” The two islands, which are situated in Bass Strait, have a combined population of about 2,500 people. Public Health is conducting tracing and will notify anyone who has been a close contact. Dr Graham said it was an important reminder that people should check-in at locations and wear a mask indoors as part of public health orders. In facts that just hit you in the face, one of our data journalists Josh Nicholas just sent me this tweet. He added a note: “NSW is less than double the NZ pop.” Cool cool cool. The New Year’s Eve matinee of Moulin Rouge! The Musical came to an abrupt mid-show halt today when one member of the company received a positive test result for Covid during the show. The curtain was rung down in Act II. An announcement was made to the audience that the show could not proceed and that everyone should leave the theatre immediately. Contacted for clarification, a spokesperson for Global Creatures, the show’s producer said: “Due to an abundance of caution, we made the decision to discontinue this afternoon’s performance of Moulin Rouge! The Musical after a positive Covid-19 test result within the wider company was made known to us.” Moulin Rouge cast and crew are tested regularly. There will be an update regarding future performances as soon as possible, the statement said. Cast member Ryan Gonzalez, who plays Santiago, has also posted on Instagram that he is at home isolating. NSW health authorities are working to contain the outbreak of Covid in aged care facilities. Of about 70 such centres in western Sydney alone, almost 50 have reported positive cases or have staff who have tested positive, a senior health official tells the Guardian Australia. Some are easier to contain where there is no transmission. A committee convenes to decide which centres will be locked down to limit the spread. The state’s residual contact tracing operations are targeted at high-risk places such as aged and disability care and Indigenous communities, as we reported earlier this week. Prior to 5pm, authorities had already counted more than 11,400 cases since midnight in NSW, and will likely exceed 20,000 today, the official said. The total may double that to 40,000 before peaking. (The midnight to midnight rate was more than 22,000 compared with the 21,151 number reported by NSW Health today that counts 8pm to 8pm.) Eastern suburbs of Sydney were among the biggest clusters of new cases. In recent days, though, the highest rate of positives to tests has been in the Hunter Valley of the state, reaching as much as 40% of those being tested. How much of an impact on the health system will follow this surge remains unclear, of course, with authorities hoping the lower severity of Omicron compared with the Delta variant will limit the numbers requiring intensive care or ventilators. The AFP has announced it will lead a joint investigation with ACT to identify who was responsible for the protest at Old Parliament House yesterday. Those who break the law will be arrested and charged. The taskforce will use the AFP’s world-leading forensics and technological capability to identify and locate those responsible for damaging commonwealth property, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The statement says they have interviewed a number of people and will have an increased presence there in the coming weeks. Sending my thoughts to the good people of Avalon – you do a lot of good in this country and you do not need this NYE nightmare. Work colleagues of confirmed cases, not just people who live together, may be classed as close contacts if a significant transmission event occurs, according to expert health advice cited by Scott Morrison to overhaul Covid-19 rules in Australia. Newly published advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee also went beyond health factors to justify the “pragmatic” changes to testing and isolation rules. It said it was a response to fast-increasing case numbers and “the living with Covid policy approach”. The expert advisory panel – which brings together all state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly – said the changes would support “public health sustainability, social cohesion and economic recovery”. Yesterday someone was telling me how Australians are obsessed with the weather. But when you have a cyclone (about to hit) at one end and a total fire ban at the other, I think that obsession is more than warranted. Australian Christian minister Bill Crews tweeted this earlier. It’s a toasty end to 2021 for many parts of southern and inland regions of Australia. So far, the hottest place in Australia on 31 January is in Jervois, about 350km north-east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The mercury there topped 42.2 degrees. The populations bearing the brunt of the heat are mostly in Victoria, with Melbourne reaching 37.4C and the state’s top temperature so far touching 40 degrees at Avalon, to the city’s west. South Australia also nudged 42 degrees, with the state capital Adelaide exceeding 38C. Sydney was a mild 28.1 degrees at its top while Brisbane’s top so far of 25.8 degrees came soon after 8.20am, local time. WA, which has a bit more of the day to go, recently reached 41.1C at the attractively named Mount Magnet. While 2021’s year-end warmth is impressive, much of the country was relatively damp over the year and that typically meant temperatures on the cool side. Here are some of the year’s highlights: The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has issued the following New Year message: 2021 has been a really tough year where people have been isolated, often for long periods of time, from their loved ones and their friends. So let’s hope 2022 brings health and happiness for all and a much easier time. Have a happy new year and I wish you all the best for 2022. Scott Morrison has issued the following message for the New Year: Happy New Year, Australia! Despite the tough times we’ve been through these past few years, we can always be thankful in Australia that we live in what we know is the best country in the world. And it’s not just the physical beauty of Australia, it’s who we are as a people. It’s the care we show for each other that has been so richly on display during the many trials we have been through this past year. It’s our freedom and our preparedness to stand up for that freedom when it counts. It’s our unique sense of the fair go and the responsibility and obligations we know we have to each other and our country, that’s part of the fair go. We’re a quietly confident people with an optimistic spirit. That is why, despite the pandemic, despite the floods, the fires, continuing drought in some areas, the cyclones, the lockdowns, even mice plagues, Australia is stronger today than we were a year ago. And we’re safer. We have one of the lowest death rates and the highest vaccination rates from Covid anywhere in the world. And we have one of the strongest advanced economies in the world to come through Covid – there’s more people in work, more apprentices in training, a secure credit rating and businesses investing in their future with confidence. That gives us confidence to face what lies ahead. Our work in 2022 is to continue to keep our economy strong, to keep Australians safe, to care for our country and work even harder to keep Australians together. Our plans are to ensure Australians grow together, not apart. To ensure that especially rural and regional parts of our country share in the same benefits and opportunities as in our cities. This summer you can play your part in keeping Australians safe by going out there and getting your booster shot and ensuring that children aged five to 11 go and get their vaccinations as well. In 2022 we are looking forward. It’s like the kangaroo and the emu on our Coat of Arms – they never take a backwards step. Now as we keep supporting each other, Australia, we will be even stronger, even safer and always together. There’s a lot to do in 2022. Happy New Year, Australia! There are reports audience members at this afternoon’s performance of the musical Moulin Rouge in Melbourne were asked to leave midway. We’ll find out what is going on and update you. Testing sites in Victoria are closing due to severe heat. From AAP: Two 11-year-old Tasmanian jumping castle victims have been farewelled on New Year’s Eve at separate funeral services in the state’s north-west. The lives of Addison Stewart and Chace Harrison were celebrated in Devonport on Friday. They were among six children who died while enjoying end-of-year celebrations at Hillcrest primary school on 16 December. Addison has been remembered as a “mother hen” and best friend to her brother and sister, who loved singing and dancing, dogs and food. Her favourite treat, Nutella, was placed prominently on a table at the service. Her father, Nathan, also made sure she shared his sporting passions – AFL club Essendon and Supercars team Dick Johnson Racing. “I was on a mission to turn her into my little tomboy,” said her father, who placed a tiny Bombers AFL guernsey on the lectern. Her small coffin was in aqua, with mourners also wearing her favourite colour. “Farewell our beautiful baby Bomber,” her father said. Addison I want to let you know that my children’s book that you had some input in, I will try my hardest to get that finished and published to honour your memory. Earlier at the same Devonport venue, Chace was farewelled with family and friends encouraged to wear Western Bulldogs or Golden State Warriors colours to celebrate his life. He passed away in hospital three days after the 16 December tragedy, the last of the children to die after a freak gust of wind picked up the castle and several inflatable zorb balls. Chace has been remembered in funeral notices as a much-loved big brother and son with a “cheeky grin” who was often involved in “fun-loving antics”. His parents, Teresa and Craig, wrote: Our hearts are broken. Our world has changed forever. Our love for you will always remain the same. The new infection in Western Australia is a close contact of a recent case and is in hotel quarantine. New South Wales daily cases have likely exceeded 25,000 a day, a month earlier than the government was predicting a fortnight ago, an acceleration likely to bring forward the strains on the health system, experts say. The NSW government reported 21,151 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, almost a 90% jump on the previous day’s tally. Kerry Chant, the state’s chief health officer, said in a video briefing it’s “likely” the increase is higher than reported. Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller at Monash University, said tests were probably catching about 80% of actual cases, meaning NSW will already be at the 25,000 cases a day rate flagged by health minister Brad Hazzard on 15 December. From AAP: Greens senator Lidia Thorpe has been met with a sea of criticism after appearing to endorse a protest at Old Parliament House in which the doors of the historic building were set on fire. The blaze burnt the front doors of Canberra’s heritage-listed building, causing “tragic” and potentially irreparable damage, according to Museum of Australian Democracy director Daryl Karp. The fire broke out amid a protest at the entrance and also caused extensive damage to the portico. Police confirmed officials had agreed a small smoking ceremony could take place as part of a peaceful protest but said it got “a little bit out of hand”. Senator Thorpe retweeted footage of the fire and wrote: “Seems like the colonial system is burning down. Happy New Year everyone.” The tweet has since been deleted. Deputy Nationals leader David Littleproud said her reaction was “disgraceful”. For politicians to sit there and encourage this, it is not responsible, it is disgraceful, and they should consider their position in the Australian parliament. Aboriginal Tent Embassy activists distanced themselves from the protest, saying a smoking ceremony that took place did not have knowledge or consent from the embassy council. Aged and Community Services Australia is calling on the federal government to model how the new testing requirements will impact the aged care workforce. In a statement, ACSA chief executive Paul Sadler said the aged care workforce was already experiencing a shortfall and was now approaching crisis, given the pressures of two years of the Covid pandemic. The new year is bringing unprecedented challenges for the aged care system, and the lesson of the past two years is the government must minimise the risk by planning now. National cabinet yesterday moved to ease the strain on the overburdened state and territory testing systems but it must now ensure the stretched aged care system isn’t unintentionally pushed to the brink. The reality of the current greater circulation of Covid in the community is that it’s already resulting in an increase in staff who become Covid-positive or must isolate at home in states and territories with high community transmission. Providers must have adequate government support to maintain a workforce that can continue providing high-quality care and services and help protect residents, their families and staff, while furloughing Covid-affected staff. Chris Minns, the NSW Labor leader, did a doorstop earlier. Here a few things he had to say: The truth of the matter is, we do need to live with Covid, but that doesn’t mean that we live without government. There’s an important role for the New South Wales government to run at the moment, in terms of policy development and action. Now, I think that it’s clear that the government’s decision to scrap QR codes and mask mandates midway through December was the wrong decision. It’s led to a situation where Christmas has been cancelled. It’s had a big impact on the New South Wales economy. You’ve got a situation where pregnant women are waiting five and six hours to get PCR tests, and it’s clear the government was not prepared for the large increase in numbers over the last six or seven days. We’re at a delicate point – we’re calling on the NSW premier to be clear with the people of the state; clearly articulate what the plan is. Recognise there’s a role for government in advising the people of the state what decisions need to be made, what their obligations are and what the government’s next moves are. Seven players from the Melbourne Stars Big Bash League team have tested positive. Gunner says there is no end date yet for the mask mandate. It will apply for high schools but not primary schools. Gunner says 24 people currently in hospital are these none are in ICU. There are 2787 tests done in the NT yesterday. That is down a third on yesterday. But the cases are up by more than 60%, so 33% reduction in tests but a 60% increase in cases. There are currently 536 close contacts; 471 have been contacted and [are] isolating; 273 of these have returned a negative test. Gunner tells people to “mask up” tonight. We want you to go out. We want to have as much fun as you can. But we need you to do this as safely as possible. That’s why you need to check in. That’s why we need you to wear a mask at all times while you’re indoors, except when eating, drinking, [and] one-and-a-half metres away from all others. The Northern Territory will introduce an indoor mask mandate after recording 60 new Covid cases. The NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, is speaking now: There are 11 cases that we believe are community transmission. There are 15 cases which are still under investigation for cases [in] the area we believe one of these people was infectious, but all in the community. Hello everyone, this is Cait Kelly. A big thanks to Mostafa for taking us through the morning. I will be sending off 2021 with you – what a wild, weird year it has been! First up, the official statement from NSW on ditching the day six PCR test for confirmed cases: And with that I will hand over the blog to the ever-capable Cait Kelly. Thanks for reading, and have a happy new year. Prof Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist from the University of South Australia, has been on ABC News discussing the surge in case numbers, saying that “things are getting out of hand.” Prof Esteman said the easing of restrictions in NSW likely sparked the surge, and hoped case numbers would peak before coming down in January. In NSW we are not seeing it going anywhere near the peak yet. So numbers will keep going up at an exponential rate unless something else happens. Modelling, as least for South Australia, has put the likely hospitalisation rate at 5%. Now, when you are starting to get 20,000 cases a day, that’s an awful lot of people going into hospital every single day. And taking up beds that other patients need. So I think states and territories are going to struggle ...Yes, Omicron is much, much milder which is a wonderful thing, but with sufficient numbers of cases then you will start getting hospitalisations going up. And the other thing that no one mentions is the elephant in the room – long Covid. And we have our politicians saying oh, look it doesn’t matter if cases go up because hospitalisations aren’t. I’m sorry, but it does matter if cases go up because there will be a reasonable proportion of those cases ending up with long-term health problems. It appears the ABC’s 7.30 will be gearing back up in 2022 earlier than expected, most likely due to the surge in Covid case numbers: The Antipoverty Centre has urged the government to reverse its decision to adopt changes to testing and isolation with regards to close contacts. It says the changes throw society’s most vulnerable communities under the bus and weren’t made in the name of public health, but for economic reasons. Jay Coonan of the Antipoverty Centre called the National Cabinet’s decision “heartless” and said it meant the poor will die at “even higher rates than we did last year”: During soaring cases and rolling lockdowns in 2021 those without paid work were excluded from any financial support. People in the lowest-paid jobs were confronted with the choice to starve or go to work and risk their own and their loved ones’ health. The results spoke for themselves: people in the poorest parts of the country were nearly four times [more] likely to die of Covid than those in wealthy areas. With the complete rejection of public health measures to help keep the virus at bay, our governments have unanimously decided that business and industry lobby groups’ concerns are more important than our lives. Back to NSW, with Perrottet again urging people not to line up for PCR tests unless a RAT test returns a positive result or people are directed to get tested by NSW Health. Capacity and wait times have been a key issue this week, and Perrottet has doubled down in asking people to avoid queuing up unless absolutely necessary. So my message today for people across our state is: if you are not required to be tested with a PCR test, don’t line up, because you will be taking the place of somebody who is required by NSW Health to receive that PCR test. I understand that’s a change and that will take some time to adjust ... The direction we provided as a government in the circumstances of an unvaccinated population [was] to go out there and get tested. But today, as we move through this next phase in line with the position of the national cabinet, if you do not need a test, if you are not required to by NSW Health, please do not line up. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just issued the following statement – a “national cabinet update”: Further to National Cabinet on 30 December 2021, and following further consultation with the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Health Officers, leaders have also agreed to remove the requirement for a Day 6 RAT for confirmed cases in isolation. If confirmed cases remain symptomatic, they should remain in isolation. Anyone with symptoms will continue to seek a PCR test. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has stepped up for his presser, and has repeated that he thinks the state is in a “strong position” considering its high vaccination rate. Perrottet says NSW will get through this outbreak on the back of the “effort and spirit of the people of our state”. (Not government policy, apparently.) I know and understand that many people across our state today are anxious. But just like the challenges of the last two years, we will get through this challenge as well and come out stronger the other side. And we’ll do that because of the effort and the spirit of the people of our state. We have made enormous sacrifices over the last two years, enormous sacrifices over this year as well, with many people not being able to say goodbye to their loved ones. It has been an incredibly challenging year, but we stand here today in an incredibly strong position as we head into 2022 because of the efforts and the sacrifices and the great spirit of the people of New South Wales. Marshall has addressed why his state is adopting a different definition of close contacts to the rest of the country (except for WA). He says South Australia is a “different phase of the overall disease”. So, in South Australia now, you’re a close contact if you’re a household or intimate partner, or those two exceptional circumstances in South Australia: if it is related to a vulnerable cohort – for example, an aged care facility [or] Aboriginal community, where there’s no logic in narrowing that down, because those two communities are more likely [to develop] higher-level illness. And the other one, of course, is where we do have an identified transmission site. South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, has announced the state has dropped any testing requirements for people looking to enter the state. He also announced that travellers will no longer need to use the EntryCheck SA app, as well as no longer needing a rapid antigen test before entry. It was not a good use of our resources at the moment, and so the EntryCheck requirement has been removed. The rapid antigen test requirement has been removed. But we are asking all of those people coming from interstate into South Australia to observe exactly the same situation that we require of all South Australians, and that is to monitor their symptoms and to take action should they develop any symptoms. South Australia has reported another record daily increase in case numbers, reporting 2,093 new cases overnight. Sadly, four deaths were reported. There are now 44 people in hospital with the virus, with four in ICU. South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said the jump in case numbers was “in line with the very steep increases we’re seeing across the country”. It is a further increase on yesterday, and obviously this would seem to be linked to activities that occurred on or around Christmas Day. This is one of the reasons why we had to move very, very quickly on Boxing Day to try to slow the growth, the exponential growth, of positive cases here in our state because we know that many of those people ultimately end up in hospital and in ICU. Foley has continued, saying that RATs should be widely available and free, and seemingly taking a swipe at the federal government for refusing to do anything about the shortage: We prioritise those that are most at risk in the community, and we’ll work though those that are most at risk in the economy, the healthcare system. ... $10, $15, $20, sometimes $25 a pop is prohibitive for many families. And we think there’s a really important role for government to lead and to partner with the wider community in the provision of the tests. We think they should be free. We think they should be widely available. Foley has addressed the discussions around rapid antigen tests today, acknowledging there is a “national shortage” of the tests, and that they are hard to get, regardless of government procurement. The Victorian health minister is being peppered with questions about the tests, saying he feels for those trying to get their hands on the tests. He says free and accessible tests are important in a pandemic response. I know the private sector is equally procuring record amounts, and we’ll work closely with all parts of the community to get those rapid antigen tests out as a pillar of our testing system heading into the future. Victorians have come to I think rightly see testing as a key part of ongoing public health response. Free testing is a critical part of that. But at the moment we are really facing some challenges right across the country. And we’ll work through those challenges as quickly as we can whilst acknowledging the frustrations that that is creating for families and Victorians for a while. Queensland has seen a huge jump in case numbers, reporting 3,118 new cases overnight. A man in his 50s is in the ICU with the Delta variant. There are now 11,697 active cases in the state. Victoria’s Covid-19 commander, Jeroen Weimar, has warned that the severe heat Melbourne is facing today and tomorrow will affect health staff taking PCR tests, and has asked people to avoid getting tested if possible. He said authorities are doing a “site by site assessment” in light of the forecast heatwave, with temperatures in Melbourne looking to peak at 38C today. We’re expecting to peak temperatures of 38 degrees in Melbourne and in other parts of the state. As a result of course, we are doing a site by site assessment of our testing system where we particularly have outdoor testing facilities. We are closing some of those sites as the temperature in those parts starts to rise. You’ll appreciate of course that our staff have been out there for weeks and months on end ... in full PPE, and the temperature in our outdoor testing tents is increasingly 10 degrees above the ambient temperature outside. Equally we do not want to see people waiting for long hours in cars in exceptionally hot weather. So please, you only need to get a PCR if you have symptoms or if you have tested positive on a rapid antigen test. Cricket Australia has released a statement which outlines that batter Travis Head will remain in Melbourne, and that he will not be available for the fourth test: Australian batsman Travis Head has tested positive to Covid-19 following a routine PCR test. Head is asymptomatic and will remain in Melbourne and isolate with his partner for seven days in line with Victorian Government Health requirements. He will be unavailable for selection for the fourth Vodafone men’s Ashes Test, starting at the SCG on January 5. The remainder of the Australian squad, their families and the support staff have undergone PCR and RAT tests this morning. Both the Australian and England squads are expected to separately travel to Sydney as planned today. As a precautionary measure Mitchell Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis have joined the Australian squad as additional cover. Victorian health minister Martin Foley has stepped up for the daily Covid update, and has said that roughly a third of new cases in the state have contracted the Omicron variant. He says he expects the new variant will become the vast majority of cases in the “near future”. The minister also confirmed that the state had adopted the new close contact definition set out after national cabinet yesterday. Building on the below reports, Cricket Australia have confirmed that batter Travis Head has tested positive. Mitch Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis have been added to the squad in the interim. In a statement, CA have said Head is asymptomatic and that they hope he will be available for the fifth test: As part of our testing procedures, we are PCR testing players, their families and our support staff daily. Unfortunately, Travis returned a positive Covid-19 result earlier today. Thankfully, he is asymptomatic at this stage. We anticipate that he will be available to play in the fifth Vodafone men’s Ashes Test in Hobart. We are grateful to our exceptional medical staff for all the work they have done throughout this series and we will continue to work with and support the players, their families and staff from both teams. Reports are emerging of an Australian batter testing positive, meaning the virus has now infected both Ashes camps in the lead up to game four. The Australian is reporting the Australian side have delayed their flight to Sydney amid reports of the diagnosis. The flight was due at 12.35pm, but has been delayed as authorities scramble to work out if other players have been infected. The English side has already seen seven positive cases among their camp. It comes after reports of 14 cases among the Melbourne Stars team. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant has given a video update, and said that while case numbers are currently very high, it is “likely” actual case numbers are higher: Whilst we’re reporting 21,151 cases in the community, it is likely that the case numbers are higher than that. There is a lot of transmission of Covid occurring in our community and so the risk of transmission and acquiring Covid is high. NSW Health has deleted and re-uploaded their Covid figures this morning, changing the number of people in hospital. The initial figure had it at 763 in hospital, which represented a small jump over yesterday’s numbers. But the updated number is 832, a significant jump in hospitalisations. The number of hospitalisations yesterday was 747, which means there were 85 new hospitalisations overnight, not the initially reported 16. NSW Health has tweeted the latest figure without providing any comment on the issue, so it is unclear where the mixup comes from. Lastly, this is what the AHPPC recommended about isolation and quarantine requirements “in a high case-load environment”: In a high case-load environment, there is a need for a modified, risk-based approach to quarantine and isolation settings. AHPPC advises that the isolation period for Covid-19 cases should be standardised regardless of vaccination status to a length of 7 days. Household contacts or those identified as being at risk of significant transmission should quarantine for 7 days after last exposure to a case regardless of vaccination status and then, subject to a negative test on day 6, monitor for symptoms for a further 7 days and repeat testing if these occur. Other contacts who have been potentially exposed to a case but who are at lower risk of infection should monitor for symptoms and have RAT or PCR test if these occur. All contacts should wear a mask when outside home, monitor symptoms and avoid visiting high risk settings for 14 days following exposure to reduce their risk of transmission to others. If RAT tests are positive, these should be followed by a positive PCR test to confirm the diagnosis. You can read the full statement here. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) says the existing settings for testing were “placing considerable pressure on available laboratory resources”. Its statement says: In a higher caseload environment where resources are strained, public health resources and clinical vigilance need to be directed to identification of cases most at risk of infection and/or severe disease, and settings where there are people at risk of severe disease. And here’s what the AHPPC says about the management of contacts of Covid-19 cases (note it goes beyond household contacts to allow for possibility of workplace contacts if there’s a high transmission event): Detailed follow up of individual cases and identification of all individuals with whom they have been in contact is not possible with high caseloads. Given significant levels of population exposure and consequent disruption to social and business functioning, it is also not desirable if large numbers of contacts are quarantined. Therefore, household or household-like contacts are the key group who should be required to quarantine as these individuals are the most likely to develop disease. These will be defined, except in exceptional circumstances, as those who usually live with or who have stayed in the same household as a case during their infectious period ... In addition, where a significant transmission event has been documented those who were at this site or venue may be determined to be close contacts. This may include worksites. The advice further adds: There is still risk of transmission based on the nature of exposure for other contacts (such as in social, educational or workplace settings) who have had less extensive exposure to a case ... This group will not be required to quarantine, except in exceptional circumstances, and may be required to undertake other behaviours to decrease their risk of transmission to others. The AHPPC also says that for the effective control of outbreaks, “different management approaches will be needed for contacts in closed, high-transmission settings”, particularly where vulnerable individuals are concerned, such as residential aged care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The health advice that went to national cabinet yesterday argues the changes to testing and close contact definitions are “pragmatic” in “a high case environment and the living with Covid policy approach”. A statement by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) - which brings together all state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly - was published overnight. It includes a lot more nuance than Morrison’s comments at the post-national cabinet press conference. It is also interesting how the expert health panel justifies the changes, pointing to issues with community adherence and economic recovery. The AHPPC notes “current and expected future high caseloads necessitate a change in public health actions including policies and processes for test, trace, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) to support public health sustainability, social cohesion and economic recovery”. The advice says the effectiveness of TTIQ declines as case numbers in Australia increase: The AHPPC acknowledges that public health efforts may not identify considerable numbers of cases and may not manage a significant proportion of the transmission risk. Public health efforts will be required to focus on highest risk and rely on individuals and workplaces to manage their own risk. Consequently, the AHPPC stresses that the proposed changes will likely limit the ability of TTIQ to suppress transmission of COVID-19 at a population level but taking a focused outbreak approach can reduce the impact on the most vulnerable in our community. Welfare recipients should get free access to rapid antigen tests, according to the Australian Council of Social Service, which has branded the federal government’s failure so far to adopt such a measure as “irresponsible and callous”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said yesterday the government would not be making the rapid tests free, though he said “concessional” arrangements for those on low incomes and pensioners were being worked on. He did not give further details. The Acoss president Peter McNamara said on Friday: We are very concerned that people relying on income support payments just can’t afford $70 for a rapid antigen test kit, leaving them unable to assess their risk from Covid-19 for themselves, their families and the community. It is irresponsible and callous of the federal government to fail to make provision for up to three million people already struggling to survive below the poverty line. Especially when we have evidence that people living in the lowest socioeconomic group have experienced almost four times as many Covid-19 deaths as people in the highest income group. We know that the hardest hit by Covid-19 and all variants are people who are homeless, people with disabilities, First Nations people, especially those who live remotely, the elderly [and] single parent households. McNamara also called for “greater clarity of information from the NSW and Victorian governments” on how people in these states can access free rapid antigen tests. Those states initially said they would provide rapid tests for free, but were contradicted by Morrison’s announcement yesterday that no such policy would be adopted. The Omicron variant has “created a significant speed bump for the economy” due to problems with testing and staff shortages, BIS Oxford Economics’ chief economist for Australia, Sarah Hunter, says. But she says the rollout of vaccines and boosters means health outcomes are a lot better than last year and the chances of a return to hard lockdowns has been reduced. “The reintroduction of some rules and restrictions will weigh on consumer spending,” Hunter said. The challenges around test results and travel is a very tangible example of this, and some people may not feel comfortable going to settings that are likely to be crowded. We’re also starting to see the impact on some businesses, where staff shortages are being created because individuals are having to go into isolation due to contracting Covid or being a close contact. She said similar effects have been felt in the UK and Europe, where countries have been forced to relax isolation rules to keep essential services including healthcare and the food supply operating. Despite soaring case numbers globally, very few countries have had to revert to a hard lockdown to protect their healthcare system, and so the drag on the economy will be much less pronounced than earlier in the pandemic. ... The vaccine is also a key reason why consumers and businesses feel more confident about the outlook. The protection it provides gives people confidence to at least start to return to normal, through increased travel, spending on services etc, and this response will also be a critical driver of positive momentum through the first few months of 2022. Sixteen testing sites across South Australia have had to shut down for part of the day today due to severe heat. A number of metropolitan sites will be closed for a majority of the day, opening between 6.30am and 10.30am, and then again between 5.30pm and 8.30pm. These hours are expected to remain the same on Saturday as the heat persists. The temperature is forecast to hit 39C on Friday and 37C on Saturday. With the state maintaining its reliance on PCR tests, these reduced hours will no doubt affect wait times at testing sites. Tasmania has set a new record for daily cases, reporting 137 new infections overnight. There are currently 520 active cases in the state, with zero patients currently in ICU with the virus. Health program director at Grattan Institute, Stephen Duckett, was on Sky News this morning, and labelled the federal government’s move to redefine a close contact as a “political decision”, not a public health decision. Duckett said the changes had “nothing” to do with transmissibility, and everything to do with “managing PCR testing facilities”: The reason they chose to change the definition of a close contact was nothing to do with transmissibility. In fact it’s the reverse of what should have been done if you’re worried about transmission. Omicron is more transmissible, not less transmissible, it’s more transmissible than Delta. What it was about was managing the PCR testing facilities; in my case I waited in line longer than I had been exposed. So it was entirely about managing the testing. Nothing about the risk to the whole population. China’s foreign ministry has responded to reports that the Australian Department of Defence has not recommended scrapping a Chinese company’s long-term lease over the Port of Darwin. Earlier this week, the Australian newspaper reported that a Defence review had found there were no national security grounds sufficient to recommend a government intervention to overturn the 99-year lease to Chinese company Landbridge. The newspaper reported the cabinet’s national security committee had not yet taken any action, because there was no formal recommendation from Defence for a national security intervention, but the Morrison government was still reviewing the matter. The Australian government has yet to formally confirm the outcome. But when asked about the report, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told a regular press conference in Beijing overnight: “The economic and trade cooperation between China and Australia is mutually beneficial and win-win in nature. The Chinese government encourages Chinese enterprises to conduct investment cooperation overseas in line with market principles, international rules and local laws. “Australia should stop overstretching the concept of national security and provide a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises operating in the country.” In response to another question about closer cooperation between Australia and Japan, including over China’s growing military pressure against Taiwan, Zhao told the press conference: “What we need in the Pacific is the joint efforts of countries in the region to uphold peace, not attempts to drum up the so-called ‘threat’ theories or stir up trouble. All moves against the tide are doomed to fail.” Talk about party poopers. Queensland police acting chief superintendent Chris Stream was on the Today show on Channel 9 this morning, urging NYE revellers to go easy tonight. “Don’t party too much – it’s been a hard year for many people,” he said, paradoxically. Plan ahead. Watch your alcohol consumption in relation to the Covid-safe deployments. We ask you to maintain masks and physical distancing. If you’re going to areas and it’s crowded and you can’t physically distance, look for another area. Yesterday, NSW police took a similar stance, saying they will be launching their usual crowd control operation, and will be monitoring “responsible activity on the road”. NSW police minister Paul Toole yesterday said police would be “out in force”: Police will be out in force on our roads and at events, not just in Sydney, but right across the state to make sure everyone rings in the new year safely. In some perhaps mildly positive news, the South African government has announced overnight that the country has “passed its Omicron peak”. The New York Times is reporting the South African Medical Research Council saying the peak of cases took four weeks, and began declining in two weeks. Fareed Abdullah, from the council, said its speed was “staggering”. The speed with which the Omicron-driven fourth wave rose, peaked and then declined has been staggering. Peak in four weeks and precipitous decline in another two. This Omicron wave is over in the city of Tshwane. It was a flash flood more than a wave. He said the rise in deaths over that period was small, and in the last week was “marginal”. Now obviously, there are many, many caveats to add to this, including differences in vaccine uptake, infectious spread, government policy and so on, but there is at least some light somewhere in the world. It is also worth pointing out that the Omicron variant’s spread in South Africa preceded Australia’s, peaking at more than 23,000 cases a day in mid-December. But cases have been falling for two weeks, currently averaging 11,500 cases a day. I would like to break up the pretty bad news with someone pulling a wheelie at a press conference yesterday: I have to agree, more wheelies at press conferences please. Adding to those numbers, I wanted to list here the hospitalisations. NSW reported another 16 hospitalisations overnight, with 69 people currently in the ICU. Victoria reported 32 hospitalisations overnight, with 54 people still in ICU. Victoria has also reported an increase in case numbers, this time reporting 5,919 new cases – up from 5,137 yesterday. Sadly, seven people died overnight. Another daily record for NSW, and another significant jump in Covid cases, with 21,151 locally acquired infections overnight. There was also a jump in deaths, with six people sadly losing their lives. So, it appears South Australia will resist the changes to the definition of close contact the national cabinet agreed to yesterday. In a Facebook post earlier this morning, the premier, Steven Marshall, lays out his government’s definition of close contacts. Marshall says a close contact will be a: Household and household-like contacts and intimate partners. Those who have been in a setting where there has been significant transmission of Covid-19 (and there has been greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact). Those in high-risk communities/settings/workplaces where someone has tested positive to Covid-19 (and there has been greater than 15 minutes of face-to-face contact). That is different to the definition introduced by Morrison, under which a close contact is someone who lives with or has been in a “household-like” situation with a confirmed Covid-19 case for at least four hours. Marshall also refused to drop the reliance on PCR tests, saying close contacts will still need to get an “initial” PCR test and another one on day 6, or “immediately if symptoms develop”. Yesterday, Morrison had said a RAT was enough for close contacts to be able to tell if they were still positive or not. South Australia joins Western Australia as seemingly the only two states refusing to adopt the new changes. So, I wanted to just zero in on the conversations surrounding rapid antigen tests this morning. Chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, Dean Whiting, told the Guardian all providers want is clarity. It doesn’t matter to us whether they’re free, subsidised or other some other thing. What we as an industry have been more concerned about is having a clear role for rapid testing in managing infections, in keeping the economy going and in keeping people safe. In a sense I don’t think we really care if they are free or not in terms of supply of the tests, as long as there is a clear position from governments on the role of the tests. The industry doesn’t have a position because we sell to the government for market price and we don’t care if they are free or not. I am on the record saying that if they were free it would improve access and equity in testing and access to tests. But that isn’t a point about market supply. President of the Pharmacy Guild, Trent Twomey, also told the Guardian they had not been lobbying: So our representation to them [the federal government] has always been that there needs to be a hybrid system, because it may only be $10 or $15 a test and yes, that may be a lot cheaper than a PCR test. But $10 or $15 per person per household twice in a seven-day period is still not affordable for some low-income earners. This, of course, all comes after Scott Morrison told reporters yesterday the reason RATs aren’t free is due to suppliers’ “concerns.” You can read more on this with reporting from Michael McGowan, Ben Butler and Luke Henriques-Gomes at the link below: Good morning and happy New Year’s Eve to all. Mostafa Rachwani here with you to take you through the morning’s news. We begin with the prime minister Scott Morrison, who yesterday announced changes to the definition of close contacts after a national cabinet meeting. The changes include shortening isolation periods for positive cases and restricting close contacts to someone who has been with a confirmed case in a home-like setting for more than four hours. The changes became active from midnight last night, with thousands now free to leave isolation. The new definition comes with a new standard for testing so that close contacts need to only get a rapid antigen test, with the hopes this will ease congestion on PCR testing sites. It comes after Morrison refused to provide rapid antigen tests for free to the general public, citing concerns by suppliers. But industry groups have denied pressuring federal and state authorities to abandon a commitment to provide free kits. More than 21,300 new Covid cases were reported yesterday across Australia, a new daily record for the country, with multiple states reporting record numbers. Meanwhile, New Year’s Eve plans appear to be going ahead in major cities, with some authorities in Melbourne and Sydney encouraging revellers to come out for the occasion, in spite of surging case numbers."

          "bodyText": "While western countries scramble with their booster rollout to deal with the Omicron wave, only 8.4% of people in low-income countries have had at least one Covid vaccination dose. The gap in the vaccination rates between high- and low-income countries is wider than ever. We cannot keep turning a blind eye to it. The vaccines being distributed to African countries under the Covax scheme are often close to expiry and their delivery is ad-hoc at best. In Nigeria, where only 2% of the population is fully vaccinated, they just had to destroy more than a million vaccines that were close to expiring. Nigeria is not the only country struggling. In Ghana, where 7.4% of the population is vaccinated, Fred Osei-Sarpong, representative of the World Health Organization said: “The receipt of vaccines with a short shelf life puts excessive pressure on the staff and makes it difficult to adequately plan for effective vaccine delivery.” These short shelf lives seriously impede the delivery of vaccines to rural areas. We have worked with Benjamin Ongeri, health supply chain specialist with Crown Agents in Kenya – where 7.2% of the population is fully vaccinated – on the delivery of medicine for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). He says: “There are enormous challenges in getting medicines to the last mile. We know this from years of working with NTDs. It is very hard to reach people who are most affected since they are vulnerable, often marginalised, and live in remote locations with poor roads and infrastructure.” The same challenges have slowed the uptake of Covid vaccines. And this is exacerbated by the fact that these vaccines require cold (or ultra-cold) chain logistics infrastructure that is often nonexistent in these areas. It also doesn’t help that the vaccines mainly being administered in Africa are those the west has decided not to accept. “In Ghana, at the initial stage of the vaccine rollout, a high demand was generated,” said Osei-Sarpong. Then there were no vaccines. The break in the rollout affected communication efforts and this gap created the space for misinformation and rumours to thrive. According to the WHO vaccine strategy, published in October, the goal is to have 70% coverage across the world by June 2022. How can this target be achieved? Will freeing up intellectual property rights, often cited as a possible solution, bridge the widening gap? Neither Osei-Sarpong nor Ongeri believes it is the answer. For a country to start producing vaccines from scratch would be a massive challenge. According to Ongeri: “Countries like Kenya have begun this journey by targeting the final filling of vaccine vials locally which is still quite challenging given the need for state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plants that will guarantee safe production with no chance of contamination.” A lot more will be required in terms of technology transfer and building the expertise needed to fully produce vaccines locally, these cannot be achieved in the short to medium term. The answer lies in global funding mechanisms such as Covax – provided they can guarantee a pre-planned availability of vaccines. More equitable distribution of the jabs on a structural basis with longer shelf lives will allow for realistic and efficient planning. “With the provision of funds for operations and the availability of vaccines, Ghana will be able to strategise and meet the coverage set by WHO,” says Osei-Sarpong. Added to common elements such as the lack of sufficient vaccines with adequate shelf life, each country has its own unique set of circumstances that lead to a low vaccination rate. So, with funding made available, each country can tailor their efforts to combat those circumstances and make sure the vaccines can reach the last mile. In Kenya, Ongeri says they need the resources to undertake door-to-door vaccination campaigns as they do for childhood immunisation. Where there exists a well-functioning delivery system, nations have high vaccine delivery rates. Kenya, for example, has an estimated 80% coverage for childhood vaccines. In Ghana, it’s above 90%. The goal set out by the WHO may not be as unreachable as it appears. It is not just in the interest of the countries with a shortage of vaccines that urgent action needs to be taken. As the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said: “None of us is safe until we all are.” Bipasha van der Zijde is a marketing and communications adviser at KIT Royal Tropical Institute"

          "bodyText": "If the holiday period has left you in need of some calm, the Small Pilgrim Places Network might have the answer. Founded by the late Reverend Jim Cotter, the network consists of meditative places, gardens, holy wells, ruins, churches and open spaces in England and Wales that are “small, simple, welcoming and inclusive”. The network’s online directory lists more than 70 places, from an ancient church carved from a quarry crag to woodland sanctuaries and tiny labyrinths. Here are 10 favourites: all are free to visit and most are open to the public, although in some cases advance notice is required. Saint Michael de Rupe, Brent Tor, Tavistock, Devon Brent Tor is a rock outcrop on the western edge of Dartmoor that soars 330 metres above sea level, and perched on the summit, surrounded by the remains of iron age earthworks, is the tiny church of Saint Michael de Rupe (“Saint Michael of the Rocks”). This ancient sanctuary dates from the 13th century when, according to legend, “Hugh the Merchant” endeavoured to build a church at the highest visible point after surviving a shipwreck nearby. Overlooking Dartmoor, the Tamar Valley and Bodmin Moor, Saint Michael de Rupe is always open, and is reached by clambering up the tall hill – while, of course, keeping an eye on adverse weather conditions. Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire Carved into the rock face above the River Nidd, half a mile from the 12th-century market town of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag is thought to have been completed in 1408 by “John the Mason” who, according to legend, built the chapel after his son survived a rock fall. It was probably conceived as a wayside shrine for pilgrims and local quarry workers, and its entrance is guarded by an austere stone knight, who is mentioned in William Wordsworth’s poem Effusion in the Pleasure-Ground on the Banks of the Bran, Near Dunkeld. Visit the chapel and explore its intricately carved interior by walking up Abbey Road, a stone’s throw from Knaresborough high street, itself a noteworthy site for pilgrimages. The Chapel of Our Lady of the Crag is open in summer from 2pm to 4pm, and at other times a visit can be arranged by contacting chapel volunteers. The Labyrinth, Windsworth, Looe, Cornwall Crop circles have long captivated UFO-watchers, but the source of this earthen etching is a little less mysterious: in 2009 local landowner Caroline Petherick set about carving a Celtic-influenced spiral pattern, adjacent to a scenic coastal footpath. The “sevenfold labyrinth” offers gorgeous views over the seashore, and Petherick, who dabbles in dowsing, picked the site for its location at the cross-section of two “energy lines”. Adventurous ramblers can find it by walking east, at mid to low tide, along the shore for a mile from Millendreath, climbing about 20 metres up a shale slope with the aid of a thick knotted rope, then walking a very steep path for a quarter of a mile. Alternatively, they can email Caroline, who runs the Windsworth guest house, and access thesite via her garden. Hedd Wen Peace Place, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire In the gardens of a house in the small village of Llanfoist, on the edge of the Brecon Beacons, is a statue of Sadako Sasaki, a Japanese girl who was in Hiroshima when it was bombed and folded hundreds of origami cranes in her hospital bed when she was dying, 10 years later, of radiation-induced leukaemia. Sculpted by Hazel Reeves, the statue was erected as a “focus, in a quiet space for reflection, healing and renewal” and stands opposite a “peace wall”, where written prayers for peace hang in the gardens. Hedd Wen is the female spelling of the pen name taken by Welsh-language poet Hedd Wyn, who was killed on the first day of the battle of Passchendaele in 1917, and the private gardens, whose name means “tranquil place”, can be visited by walking about 35 minutes from Abergavenny station along the River Usk and through the Castle Meadows; visitors just need to email in advance. Hawkwood Woodland Sanctuary, near Stroud, Gloucestershire Hidden in 10 acres of woods on the Hawkwood estate, half an hour’s walk from Stroud, the Hawkwood Woodland Sanctuary is a cabin resembling the cross-section of a pointy hat. A small group meets regularly for meditation between 8.30am and 9am every Wednesday, but the public can visit any time, provided you notify reception in advance. The estate is home to a “centre for future thinking” and runs regular courses and retreats. The grounds include a walled garden, a natural spring, an organic farm, ponds, wetlands, a labyrinth and the occasional beehive, and views extend as far as the Forest of Dean and south Wales. Saint Margaret’s church, Wichling, Kent Completely off grid and powered by historic gas lights, this remote Saxon church in the North Downs is mentioned in the Domesday book and contains Roman bricks and tiles. To access this wildflower-ensconced “eco church” on the edge of Kent’s Wichling Wood, ramblers can follow footpaths through farmland from nearby Lenham (an Ordnance Survey map or app is advised); or it is a six-mile drive from the A2. Music is played with medieval folk instruments during church services from spring to autumn, when it is open to visitors every day. Winter opening times are more limited: it is worth checking on the St Margaret’s website. Back in Lenham, there are a few cosy pubs where you can quench your thirst. Saint Tanwg, Llandanwg, Gwynedd In Hiroshi Teshigahara’s 1964 Japanese New Wave drama, Woman of the Dunes, the titular woman is doomed to spend day after day shovelling away the sand encroaching on the entrance of her home. Saint Tanwg, the “Church in the Sands”, has repeatedly been rescued from a similar fate, having been dug out of the sandbanks on a semi-regular basis over the centuries. One of the oldest places of continuous Christian worship in Britain, Saint Tanwg dates from AD425 but was probably built on the site of an earlier temple. The interior contains remnants of a gothic window, plus traces of medieval wall paintings and a Celtic cross from the ninth century. Saint Tanwg is usually open daily, but occasionally shuts in poor weather. It is on the 870-mile Wales Coast Path (or a short walk from the Llandanwg request stop between Barmouth and Harlech on the Cambrian Coast Railway Line). Saint Andrew’s church, Winston, Darlington Had Dominic Cummings’s eyes not supposedly betrayed him on his trip to Barnard Castle, he might have spotted Saint Andrew’s church, high on a ridge over the River Tees in Winston. On clear days the tranquil spot offers views far into North Yorkshire. Building buffs might be interested to know that prolific South Shields-born architect John Dobson re-arranged the church, originally built in 1245, in the Victorian era. It is a Grade I medieval building, one of two listed churches called Saint Andrew in the area (the other’s down the road in Aycliffe). Along with its peaceful location and gorgeous views, it boasts three lancet windows in the chancel with very fine “grisaille” glazing dated from the 1860s. From October to Easter, Saint Andrew’s is open every Saturday 9am-5pm; visits can also be arranged by phoning 01325 730392. Saint Winwaloe, Gunwalloe, Cornwall Everyone loves a good peninsula, and the forking tongue of the Lizard in Cornwall, lashing at the sea with its serpentinite-bearing rock, is particularly striking. This most southerly point on the British mainland has one of the mildest climates in the UK, and is packed with natural beauty, from the unspoiled beaches of Kynance Cove to the clear waters of Frenchman’s Creek. A coastal footpath north from sandy Poldhu Cove leads to the ancient church of Saint Winwaloe, the “Church of the Storms” – the only one in Cornwall that’s on a beach – built atop the remains of a sixth-century monastery. In addition to its beautiful surroundings, the site contains an engraved Cornish cross and a font dating back to Norman times. Saint Winwaloe is usually open daily. Saint Tecwyn, Llandecwyn, Gwynedd Constructed on top of a burial place thought to have been in use 2,500 years ago, this is a remote, picturesque Victorian church that offers spectacular views. Adventurous walkers can reach it with a long hike based on a bronze age route through the Snowdonia foothills, or a shorter journey from Llanfihangel-y-traethau, a few miles south-west of Llandecwyn – a traditional pilgrimage called “Saint Tecwyn’s Way. It is also reachable by road or rail: it’s signposted off the A496 and close to Llandecwyn railway station request stop. Whichever way you travel, you’ll be treated to vistas of Snowdon, Cardigan Bay, the Dwyrd estuary and the Rhinog mountains. Saint Tecwyn and its simple interior is open daily for visitors, and private “quiet days” can be arranged for individuals or groups with notice. If you’re in the area, don’t miss Pen Llandecwyn, the tiny 203-metre hill between Saint Tecwyn and Llyn Tecwyn Uchaf, which surely wins a participation trophy for being the 2,033rd-highest peak in Wales."

          "headline": "Old Parliament House fire protesters linked to anti-vaccine and conspiracy groups",
          "bodyText": "Leaders of a group of protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra are closely linked to a complex network of anti-vaccination and conspiracy groups which have been accused of spreading misinformation in Indigenous communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico. There have been a series of demonstrations by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti-vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at Old Parliament House over the past days. On 22 December another fire was lit at the entrance by the same group of protesters. A protester posted video of that fire on Instagram with the caption: “These Doors are Coming Down Either Way”. Among the protesters are Indigenous land rights activists, anti-vaccine groups and so-called sovereign citizens. The latter is a fringe conspiracy group rooted in antisemitism and organised around a haphazard collection of pseudo-legal beliefs broadly grouped around the notion that modern government is an illegitimate corporation. Like many other threads of conspiratorial thinking, sovereign citizens have enjoyed a confused renaissance during the pandemic. When footage began emerging during the early stages of Covid-19 of people asking police bizarre questions at border stops or describing themselves as a “a living woman” to Bunnings employees, it was largely as a result of sovereign citizen-inflected beliefs. Before the fire on Friday, a piece of paper was taped to a door at Old Parliament House labelled a “notice of acquiescence by default”. It was addressed to, among others, “The Australian Commonwealth de facto Corporate Administration” and contained a garbled set of legalese mirroring sovereign citizen beliefs. Intertwined with the protesters were various fringe anti-vaccination groups as well as members of the “freedom movement” which has pushed anti-lockdown protests during the Covid-19 pandemic before morphing into a catch-all conspiracy movement. Attempts by elements of the conspiracy movement to influence Indigenous groups have been well documented. As the Age has previously reported, some of those movements have been active in promoting misinformation in remote Indigenous communities. In September the Guardian revealed a group had attempted to push ivermectin into the remote regional town of Wilcannia during a Covid outbreak there. There is no evidence that ivermectin has any beneficial effect as a Covid treatment, and it may be harmful in some circumstances. Leaders of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, established in 1972, condemned the actions that led to Thursday’s fire. “The actions of such protestors conducting a ‘smoking ceremony’ was done so without the knowledge, consent or mandate of the embassy council and traditional owners responsible for the regulation of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy,” it said in a statement. There were claims following the fire that it may have been the result of a smoking ceremony that got out of hand, or as a result of police using pepper spray to disperse the crowd. However, footage on social media showed that the fire was well lit before police arrived at the scene, and ACT police told the Age the pepper spray used was water-based and did not contain an accelerant. Footage taken by protesters themselves shows many of them celebrating after the fire began to engulf the front of the building. The protests were widely condemned by political leaders. Scott Morrison said it was “disgraceful”. “I’m disgusted and appalled by the behaviour that would see Australians come and set fire to such a symbol of democracy in this country,” the prime minister said on Thursday. But the Greens senator Lidia Thorpe, the party’s first Indigenous representative, wrote on Twitter: “Seems like the colonial system is burning down. Happy New Year everyone.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She later deleted the tweet, and the party’s leader, Adam Bandt said: “Greens don’t want to see the planet burning or Old Parliament.” However, he did not publicly criticise Thorpe nor has she apologised for the comment. Old Parliament House now houses the Museum of Australian Democracy. Its director, Daryl Karp, called the fire “tragic” and said damage to the building was potentially irreparable. “To actually be closed, and to be closed because of violent protests is really tragic,” she told the ABC on Friday."

          "headline": "Aboriginal groups fear Covid outbreaks inevitable after changes to close contact definition",
          "bodyText": "Indigenous health groups have lambasted national cabinet’s move to narrow the definition of a close contact as the “wrong decision”, amid concern over the possibility of outbreaks in remote communities with comparatively low vaccination rates. With some PCR testing sites overwhelmed and a widespread shortage of rapid antigen tests, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Thursday leaders had agreed to a change that will see fewer people required to get tested and those who are positive released from isolation sooner. In the Northern Territory, which announced a record 60 cases on Friday, the chief minister, Michael Gunner, said he would introduce an indoor mask mandate in response to the rising infections. There are 24 people in hospital and none in intensive care, figures released on Friday showed. However, Gunner also said the NT would liberalise its definition of a close contact to focus on “household contacts” rather than possible exposures at other sites. “We know New South Wales and the east coast are in a different situation to the territory, but a lot of decisions made by [national cabinet] will work for the territory and can be applied here,” he said. John Paterson, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance of the NT, told Guardian Australia the new close contact definition adopted by national cabinet was the “wrong decision”. “We’ve got a fast-moving virus that’s spreading itself through the entire community,” he said. “It’s a matter of if not when it gets into our most vulnerable, remote, sickest population in some of those communities throughout the Northern Territory, and throughout Australia I should add.” While vaccination rates across Australia are some of the highest in the world, Indigenous leaders fear there are still pockets where rates are lagging. In some regions of Queensland, the fully vaccinated rate among Aboriginal people over 15 years old was still hovering between 55% and 70% on 21 December, according to Department of Health data. Paterson also pointed to reports that the Palm Island Aboriginal shire council this week uploaded a grim image to social media of a white shipping container that it said had been received from Queensland Health. It said it was to be used as a temporary morgue if required and was the “starkest reminder yet that locals are at serious risk of illness and death from Covid”. “That’s frightening stuff,” Paterson said. “I’ve had people texting and sending messages that it’s (the easing of Covid guidelines) causing huge anxieties in remote communities.” Outside Darwin, the vaccination rate in the Northern Territory among Aboriginal people over 15 years old was also about 70%. Paterson said communities in the Barkly local government area, which includes Tennant Creek, which was recently in lockdown, and remote communities in the Alice Springs LGA were among those he was worried about. “What’s worked for us effectively in the Northern Territory … is we were able to identify where those close contacts were: the venues, the communities, airports, wherever,” Paterson said. “If you were on a plane and sitting two rows from a positive case you were alerted and had to go and get tested. That was a very effective public health strategy of informing the broader community of close contacts.” Gunner said on Friday that since the NT changed its border rules “the vast majority of transmission has been enclosed household contacts”. “It makes sense to direct our resources into household contacts,” he said. Gunner said people who test positive would need a negative PCR test on day six to be released from isolation. No such requirement now exists in NSW. Gunner said unvaccinated close contacts would also be required to isolate for 14 days, rather than seven. He also indicated that the government might consider other measures to flatten the curve, including lockdowns. “At this stage though we think the indoor mask mandate is a proportionate response,” he said. Vaccination levels among Indigenous Australians are well in excess of 80% in almost all regions of NSW and Victoria, which have so far been hardest hit by the virus. But they are much lower in South Australia, where cases are rising significantly, and only between 45% and 60% in most regions of Western Australia, which plans to keep its borders shut until next year. Dr Jason Agostino, a medical adviser to the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, said before the close contact definition was changed there had already been twice the rate of infection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, a reference to figures compiled in October. “What I’m fearing is that [Indigenous communities] will be hit hardest,” he told ABC Radio on Friday morning. “We have unacceptable levels of crowded housing and people with chronic diseases that start at a younger age, along with in particular in Queensland and South Australia, lower rates of vaccinations. “That mix means more infections as well as more severe disease. As we get out into our rural and remote communities, the capacity to deal with severe disease is really limited.”"

          "bodyText": "Since Brexit, saying you represent the people against the establishment has been one of the most effective moves in British politics. In a country with little respect for politicians but still some reverence for voters, however erratic or flimsily based their opinions, invoking the people is one of the few reliable ways to achieve political momentum. Despite the fact that in parliament, the press and much of business the Conservatives and their allies are the establishment – and have been since at least 2010 – this populist rhetoric has mostly been used by the right. However out of touch and contemptuous of democracy his government is in practice, Boris Johnson claims to speak for the people at every opportunity. In recent years Labour has rarely dared to do likewise, except during the most energised moments of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, such as his campaigning “for the many” in the 2017 election. The party has been too lacking in confidence, too inward-looking – and simply too unpopular – to argue that its views and those of the country are in harmony. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour rarely assumes that its periods of success represent British politics in its natural state. So the fact that this month Keir Starmer has started talking about “the national interest” and “the British people”, and trying to associate his party with them, feels significant. It suggests that after more than 18 months of cautious and defensive leadership – much of it taken up with sidelining colleagues and policies supposedly too radical for the public – Starmer finally believes that Labour can speak for the nation without being ridiculed. “We are a patriotic party,” he declared in a TV broadcast supporting the Covid booster campaign, sitting behind a large, would-be prime ministerial desk with a union flag beside him. “The Labour party that I lead will always act in Britain’s best interests.” The clear implication – left unspoken because this was a broadcast officially about public health – was that the Conservatives have much less honourable, more partisan motives. With Boris Johnson in Downing Street, this has become a pretty easy argument to make. So blatantly have his policies been designed to reward friends and punish enemies that even some voters who once tolerated, or even admired, his shameless brand of Conservatism have become repelled. Unlike previous slumps in support for his government, which mainly benefited the Liberal Democrats, many of these Tory voters now appear to be switching to Labour. For the first time under Starmer, this month Labour has achieved large enough leads over the Tories in the polls for a narrow win at the next election – or a hung parliament leading to a Labour-led coalition – to be more than a remote possibility. In the past, a Labour leader adopting expansive patriotic language has sometimes been a sign of an imminent electoral breakthrough. During a campaign broadcast before the party’s great victory at the 1945 election, Clement Attlee argued that, unlike the Tories, Labour represented “a good cross-section of the nation”: both rural and urban Britons, employers and employees. Labour’s share of the vote at that general election and the next two was not far short of 50%: huge by today’s standards, and large enough to justify Attlee’s claim. During the early years of Tony Blair’s leadership, Labour was almost as popular, and he often talked about “the people” reverently but also a little proprietorially – as if only he and his party understood or could carry out their wishes. Like Attlee, Blair led a government whose initial breadth of support right across England, Scotland and Wales was on a scale that makes Johnson’s supposedly decisive electoral mandate in 2019 look narrow. One way to interpret Starmer’s still rather opaque leadership is as an attempt to apply the methods of the Blair and Attlee eras to today’s world. Starmer’s stern, rather formal manner, austere suits and haircut, and talk of a “shared national duty” all suggest a Labour politician from the 1940s. Meanwhile his recruitment of New Labour veterans such as Yvette Cooper and Deborah Mattinson and his bash-the-left approach to party management imply that Starmer still has faith in the controlling centrist politics of the 00s. Given that these are the only two periods when Labour has achieved lasting dominance (Harold Wilson’s election wins in the 1960s and 1970s were much less decisive), taking Blair and Attlee as role models seems reasonable, on the face of it. The fact that both led relatively competent governments with substantial domestic achievements – at least until they got involved in too many foreign wars – is also likely to appeal to Starmer. If he becomes prime minister, in what will probably be tough circumstances, he will be desperate to prove to voters that chaotic 21st-century government is a purely Conservative phenomenon. But there is also a danger for Starmer in trying to sound and act like Blair and Attlee. It risks drawing attention to the great difference in strength between their political positions as Labour leaders and his. Only a few months ago, much of the talk at the Labour conference was about who was going to replace Starmer, after months of bad election results and personal ratings, bodged Labour reorganisations and barely noticed policy launches. Inside as well as outside the party, Starmer was widely written off as a wooden and uncharismatic figure, unsuited to top-level politics: “a plodder”, as someone who has had decades of dealings with Labour put it to me. Starmer’s performance has improved a little since. He is more aggressive in his attacks on the Conservatives, using franker words such as “corruption” and allowing flashes of anger to enliven his usually too controlled courtroom manner. And he seems more confident, as if relieved that his painstakingly assembled case against the government is finally being heard. Yet most of his limitations as a politician have not gone away. The improvement in Labour’s position is not because he is doing his job much better, but because the government is doing its even worse. And when he declares that only his party can serve “the people” and “the national interest”, he echoes not only Blair and Attlee but also other, less successful Labour leaders, such as Neil Kinnock, who often seemed to assert their patriotism not from a position of strength but of weakness: in a vain attempt to convince the Tory press and sceptical voters that Labour was respectable and not an alien threat. A more assured and rooted party – which was able to explain why Britain would benefit from regular rather than occasional left-of-centre governments – would not have to perpetually prove its right to exist. Will Starmer end up as one of Labour’s patriotic failures? The jury is still out. Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Covid transmission risk not limited to household contacts, Australian health panel warns",
          "bodyText": "Work colleagues of confirmed cases, not just people who live together, may be classed as close contacts if a significant transmission event occurs, according to expert health advice cited by Scott Morrison to overhaul Covid-19 rules in Australia. Newly published advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee also went beyond health factors to justify the “pragmatic” changes to testing and isolation rules. It said it was a response to fast-increasing case numbers and “the living with Covid policy approach”. The expert advisory panel – which brings together all state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly – said the changes would support “public health sustainability, social cohesion and economic recovery”. The AHPPC warned that previous testing rules were “placing considerable pressure on available laboratory resources”. On Friday New South Wales reported a record high 21,151 confirmed Covid cases, while Victoria reported 5,919, Queensland 3,118 and South Australia 2,093. The prime minister called for a “reset” to Australia’s pandemic response, describing the more infectious Omicron variant as a “game changer”. He said after a national cabinet meeting on Thursday that most states and territories would adopt a newly agreed definition of a close contact – with relatively Covid-free Western Australia a notable exception. But South Australia announced it would stick with a broader definition of close contacts. Morrison had said a close contact “is a household contact or household-like of a confirmed case only” – except in exceptional circumstances. “A household contact is someone who lives with a case or has spent more than four hours with them in a house, accommodation or care facility setting,” Morrison told reporters. However, the AHPPC statement appears to be more nuanced and does not mention the four-hour timeframe. The advisory group said in its statement: “Household or household-like contacts are the key group who should be required to quarantine as these individuals are the most likely to develop disease. “In addition, where a significant transmission event has been documented, those who were at this site or venue may be determined to be close contacts,” it added. “This may include worksites. Worksites and businesses are strongly encouraged to have business continuity plans in place to ensure workplace health and safety is achieved and outbreaks can be contained as quickly as possible.” The AHPPC said there was “still risk of transmission based on the nature of exposure for other contacts (such as in social, educational or workplace settings) who have had less extensive exposure to a case than household-like contacts”. “This group will not be required to quarantine, except in exceptional circumstances, and may be required to undertake other behaviours to decrease their risk of transmission to others,” it said. Morrison told reporters that the change to close contact definitions “and the complete abolition of the casual contact notion” would have a positive impact on staff shortages, particularly in the health system. But the AHPPC statement said other contacts who had potentially been exposed to a case but who were at lower risk of infection should monitor for symptoms and have a rapid antigen or PCR test if these occur. “All contacts should wear a mask when outside home, monitor symptoms and avoid visiting high-risk settings for 14 days following exposure to reduce their risk of transmission to others.” The AHPPC also warned that for the effective control of outbreaks, “different management approaches will be needed for contacts in closed, high-transmission settings, particularly when there are a large number of individuals at risk of developing severe disease”. This would include outbreaks in residential aged care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said his state would continue to define close contacts as not merely “household and household-like contacts and intimate partners”. The definition would also cover “those who have been in a setting where there has been significant transmission of Covid-19 (and there has been greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact)”. The SA announcement was interpreted as a departure from the nationally agreed definition. But it does not appear to clash with the AHPPC advice published overnight. Marshall told reporters on Friday he did not believe national cabinet had agreed on the four-hour cutoff. He said people needed to be aware “that you can still catch this disease if you’re not living with somebody, or in an intimate relationship” – and should monitor for symptoms. “That’s just a fact and people need to be aware of the risks associated with Omicron.” Dr Chris Moy, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said on Friday the national cabinet announcement was a “party trick” that meant fewer potentially infectious people would be identified as a close contact. Moy said on Twitter the move “defies the reality of who will actually become infectious, and unknowingly accelerate the propagation of Covid through the community”. But Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at the Australian National University, said the changes were a “reasonable” response to the current situation. “We don’t need zero Covid rules – what we need is practical rules that get the vast majority of people who are high risk [and] keep them away from others, but not expect that we’ll have zero risk,” Collignon told the Seven Network. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This disease is actually in the society, it’s going to be here for years to come. We need to adapt the rules so that we don’t, in fact, lose huge amounts of the workforce for little extra benefit.” Kelly said Omicron was “very transmissible” and there was “no doubt” case numbers would continue to rise. But he said data from South Africa – which had “the longest and most extensive experience” of the new variant – indicated a 73% decrease in severity of disease compared with Delta."

          "bodyText": "Thank you for joining us on today’s live blog. We will be closing this page down but please follow the latest Covid developments on our new live feed here. Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, Boris Johnson has said in his new year’s message. The UK prime minister admitted there was anxiety about the Omicron variant and growing numbers of hospital admissions, and urged those who had not been vaccinated to get their jabs. There was “one overriding reason” that tougher restrictions were not needed in the face of daily case numbers hitting record levels, he said – people “heroically, voluntarily and in almost incredible numbers heeding the call to get vaccinated”. Johnson was buoyant about the speed of the booster rollout, saying it was “precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all”. Read the full story here. Quebec healthcare workers exposed to Covid-19 may have to go to work sooner than expected if staffing levels in the Canadian province’s facilities reach a critical point. Quebec’s health minister, Christian Dubé, made the announcement earlier this week, explaining that in a worst-case scenario the province would have no choice but to insist that isolating employees return to work. Cases of the Omicron variant have surged in the province: on Thursday, a record-breaking 14,188 new cases were reported, with 939 Covid patients currently in hospital and 138 in intensive care. The Quebec newspaper La Presse reported that hospitals in the province were getting close to activating the contingency plan. Read the full story by Guardian reporter Tracey Lindeman here. Israel has approved a fourth vaccine shot for vulnerable and immunocompromised people, becoming one of the first countries to do so, amid a surge in Covid in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The country also received its first shipment of Pfizer’s anti-Covid pills. Health ministry director-general Nachman Ash told reporters: Today I approved giving the fourth vaccine for immunocompromised people. I did this in light of studies that show the benefit of the vaccine, including the fourth vaccine, to this population, and in light of the fear they are more vulnerable in this outbreak of Omicron.” Health authorities reported on Thursday more than 4,000 new cases, a high not seen since September. Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said Israel was in “a fifth wave”, with most cases probably related to the Omicron variant. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel, which was among the first countries in the world to offer a third shot to the general public, would be a trailblazer for the fourth jab. “Israel will lead the way in administering a fourth vaccine to the Israeli people,” he said. A US schoolteacher says she spent five hours in voluntary self-isolation in a plane’s toilet after testing positive for Covid on a flight to Iceland a few days before Christmas. Marisa Fotieo says she performed a rapid test after noticing her throat hurt while travelling from Chicago to Reykjavik, in Iceland, on 20 December. The test confirmed she was infected and so she remained in the toilet for the rest of the flight, with flight attendants providing food and drinks. It was not immediately clear whether she had had to present a Covid-19 test before boarding the flight. “It was a crazy experience,” Fotieo, who is from Michigan, told NBC News. “[There were] 150 people on the flight, and my biggest fear was giving it to them”. Fotieo shared the experience in the plane’s bathroom in a TikTok video that has been viewed more than 4 million times. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we count down the final hours until 2022. As I’ll be reporting to you from Sydney for the next few hours here’s a quick rundown of how Covid is currently unfolding across Australia. The state of NSW has recorded another 21,151 new Covid-19 cases and six deaths while Victoria has recorded 5,919 cases and seven deaths - up from 5,137 yesterday. South Australia is refusing to adopt the new close close contact definition proposed by prime minister Scott Morrison on Thursday. Other changes Morrison introduced include shortening isolation periods for positive cases and restricting close contacts to someone who has been with a confirmed case in a home-like setting for more than four hours. The changes became active from midnight last night, with thousands now free to leave isolation. The new definition comes with a new standard for testing so that close contacts need to only get a rapid antigen test, with the hopes this will ease congestion on PCR testing sites. Here’s a round-up of today’s Covid news from around the world. The number of people to die from Covid in Eastern Europe has reached 1 million, as Russia climbed above Brazil to become the country with the second-highest deaths behind the US. South Africa said the country had passed its Omicron peak without a major death surge, offering hope to countries hit hard by the mutated variant. France reported 206,243 new confirmed Covid cases, a tally above 200,000 for the second day running. The UK reported 189,213 new Covid cases, smashing Wednesday’s record-breaking tally of 183,037 positive tests. The UK is dogged by a shortage of tests, as Wales assists England with 4m tests amid fears of New Year’s Eve celebrations turning into breeding grounds for the virus. Scotland’s first minister urged people to avoid household mixing after a record high of nearly 17,000 cases. India fears it is entering a new wave after cases surge, as confirmed Omicron cases also climb. Portugal cuts Covid isolation from ten days to seven, after the World Health Organization said on Wednesday slashing isolation was a trade-off between transmission and economic concerns. Germany will drop quarantine demands for UK travellers from 4 January after seeing its own Omicron cases jump above 3,000 recently. Malaysia detected 3,997 positive Covid cases, with the number among survivors of its recently deadly floods rising to 442 in total. Japan recorded over 500 new infections for the first time in two months. Five Bulgarian regions moved from yellow to red zones as the country recorded 3,449 new infections, a 139% jump on two weeks ago. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all people should avoid cruises, following a rise in onboard Covid cases in a major blow to the industry. That’s all from me, Jem Bartholomew in London, for today. I’ll be back in the new year. Do get in touch with tips and stories via email or on Twitter for then. Bye for now. South Africa said on Thursday the country had passed its Omicron peak without a major death surge, the New York Times reports, which will offer heavilyhit countries a glimmer of hope as Covid case records are broken across the world. The Times reports: “We’ll be in for a tough January, as cases will keep going up and peak, and then fall fast,” said Ali Mokdad, a University of Washington epidemiologist who is a former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist. While cases will still overwhelm hospitals, he said, he expects that the proportion of hospitalized cases will be lower than in earlier waves. ... There are many caveats. The case figures might have been distorted by reduced testing during the holiday season. And many people in the most affected area had some measure of immunity, either from vaccination, prior infection or both, that might have protected them from serious illness. However, research teams in South Africa, Scotland and England have found that Omicron infections more often result in mild illness than earlier variants of the coronavirus, causing fewer hospitalizations. Malaysia detected 3,997 positive Covid tests on Thursday, local media the New Straits Times reports, a 6% drop on the 4,262 on Thursday two weeks ago. The country’s R rate is currently 0.95. About 98% of Malaysia’s adult population is double-vaccinated, and 17% of the total population has been boosted. Deadly floods have hit Malaysia in recent days, with at least 48 people dead after the worst floods since 2014. There are fears the virus could hit survivors. Officials said on Thursday that Covid cases among flood victims stands at 442 people confirmed so far. In Japan, 502 new Covid cases were confirmed on Wednesday, up from 159 on Wednesday two weeks ago and exceeding the 500 mark for the first time in over two months. Japan narrowed its definition of an Omicron “close contact” on Tuesday, the Japan Times reports, amid concerns it would run out of quarantine facilities. The new rules bring Omicron in line with the definition for other Covid cases: on a plane, two rows in front of and behind where the infected person was sitting. Health minister Shigeyuki Goto said the decision was based on infections data. (Japan’s government previously expanded the definition of in-flight close contacts of people infected with Omicron to all passengers, later deciding they must all quarantine for 14 days at special facilities.) The Japan Times also has an interesting article on the human cost of its strict border controls. Japan pulled up its drawbridge amid the emergence of the Omicron variant, with the measures being extended by prime minister Fumio Kishida after their initial end-of-December expiry date. “What’s most stressful is the vagueness of the timeline,” said Kiki Lee, a 23-year-old exchange student from China. Lee, a first-year graduate student at Keio University, is unable to recieve scholarship funds as they it require her to be physically present in Japan. In the meantime she’s paying full tuition for remote classes. Michael Bugajski, 35 and from the US, has lived in Japan for over five years. Bugajski has lost his father, sister-in-law and her newborn infant since the pandemic began, but he couldn’t fly home to attend their funerals. “To hold onto the people you have, and to mourn for the people you don’t anymore. … If I’m looking forward to anything it’s just to have that moment,” Bugajski said. Read the full story here. Bulgaria detected 3,449 new Covid cases in the past 24 hours, public broadcaster BNT reports, a 139% increase on the 1,443 cases recorded on Thursday two weeks ago. Bulgaria’s chief state health inspector, Angel Kunchev, said on Thursday the country should brace for a sharp increase in infections in early January, the Sofia Globe reports. Kunchev added that Omicron, despite appearing milder, could lead to greater hospitalisations and have a “devastating effect” on the health service and economy if it provokes a “tsunami” of infections. Five Bulgarian regions have been re-classified from yellow to red zones – Blagoevgrad, Kyustendil, Plovdiv, Haskovo and Silistra – based on the prevalence rate per 100,000 people on a 14-day basis. The nationwide 14-day morbidity rate is now 293.59 cases per 100,000 people. Bulgaria has reported 30,819 deaths from Covid-related causes, according to a Reuters tally. The eastern Europe’s Covid death toll climbed above 1 million on Thursday, Reuters said. Bulgaria has the lowest vaccine rate in Europe, with an estimated 26% of adults double-vaccinated. The UK health secretary Sajid Javid is being urged to ensure National Health Service (NHS) workers are prioritised for Covid tests or risk a “devastating” impact on patient care, The Guardian reports. Pressure is being piled on by the British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors. The BMA warned that the system for ensuring NHS staff receive tests was “not working”. It said its members were reporting problems with obtaining PCR and lateral flow tests, despite healthcare workers supposedly being given priority for both. The BMA’s chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: Being unable to get the tests means staff may not be legally allowed to work and, at a time of acute workforce shortages and winter pressures, this could be devastating for the care that can be given right across the NHS. It follows the Welsh government’s announcement on Thursday that it had lent an additional 4 million lateral flow testing kits to England to help alleviate the supply squeeze across the border, bringing the total offered to 10 million. My colleagues have the full story here. Ukraine recorded 5,930 positive Covid tests on Thursday, a 40% decrease on the 9,918 new cases on Thursday two weeks ago. Ukraine’s most recent wave peaked in early November, with daily cases sometimes rising above 25,000. Recent infections have receded but Omicron threatens to spark a new epidemic. A further 278 people died from Covid-related causes, local media Ukrinform reports – a 27% decrease on the 383 deaths two weeks ago. Ukraine has recorded 95,690 deaths from Covid-related causes. A Reuters tally on Thursday found eastern Europe’s Covid deaths has now risen above 1 million. The UK reported 189,213 new Covid cases in the past 24 hours, smashing Wednesday’s record-breaking tally of 183,037 positive tests. Thursday’s new infections represent a 116% rise on the 87,565 new infections reported two weeks ago today – which was itself then a record-breaking daily tally. A further 332 people died from Covid-related causes on Thursday, a 127% climb on the 146 deaths recorded two weeks ago. It comes after a scarcity of Covid tests in the UK has sparked concern over New Year’s Eve celebrations, which prime minister Boris Johnson confirmed in recent days would go ahead, with no new restrictions until at least the New Year. Peter Openshaw, who sits on the UK government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said: “It’s very worrying indeed.” He added: We know the situations in which transmission happens and fortunately I don’t think we are facing the sort of lockdown that was necessary in order to cope in the very earliest part of this year. But we do know that crowding together in poorly ventilated spaces, particularly if you are shouting over loud music and so on, is absolutely perfect in terms of transmitting this very, very highly transmissible virus. Poland detected 14,325 new Covid cases in the past 24 hours, a 35% decrease from the 22,096 infections on Thursday two weeks ago. Poland experienced spiking cases in late November and early December, with daily infections receding in recent weeks. But Omicron has driven fears of a new wave. A further 709 people died from Covid-related causes on Thursday, according to local media Polskie Radio – a 20% rise on Thursday two weeks ago. Poland has now recorded 96,415 deaths from the virus. A Reuters tally on Thursday found Eastern Europe’s Covid deaths had reached 1 million people. Poland’s health minister, Adam Niedzielskion, on Thursday announced a “fundamental reform” of Polish hospitals, with draft legislation planning to “professionalise hospital management”, he said. France will allow people from the UK to drive through as they return to EU countries, suspending a ban on British people returning to their homes in the EU after spending the holidays in the UK. The UK government clarified: “The French authorities confirmed on 30 December that UK nationals who are resident in other EU member states and who have travelled to the UK for the Christmas period will be able to transit France over the New Year period in order to return home to their country of residence.” “Transit for less than 24 hours in the international zone of an airport is listed under ‘essential reasons’ to travel,” the UK government guidance added. The number of people to die from Covid in eastern Europe has reached 1 million, according to a tally from Reuters. It follows Russia climbing above Brazil to become the country with the second-highest death toll, behind the US, with over 835,000 pandemic excess deaths. Russia said 87,527 people died from Covid-related causes in November, its deadliest month since the pandemic began. (The Reuters count includes Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine.) Omicron has yet to batter eastern Europe – as it currently is western Europe – but there are fears it might spark another wave imminently. Germany will drop quarantine demands for UK travellers from 4 January. Previously, even double-vaccinated people needed a negative test to enter and then had to quarantine for 14 days. The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said it was a “welcome development”. Germany has now reported thousands of Omicron cases. Uwe Janssens, who heads the German Society of Internal Medicine and Intensive Care, told German media DW infections caused by the highly-mutated strain will dominate in Germany in the weeks to come. “It can be assumed that the omicron variant will certainly dominate in January, like in the other countries such as Great Britain, Norway, Denmark and Portugal,” Janssens said. Here’s a look at the UK’s record-breaking tally daily Covid infections yesterday in context. Ministers will be keeping keen eye on hospitalisations in the coming days and weeks. UK Covid figures for Thursday are delayed, the government’s data portal says, until around 8pm GMT. This is Jem Bartholomew taking over from my colleague Lucy Campbell for the next few hours. Do get in touch with tips and stories from around the world via email or on Twitter. France reported 206,243 new confirmed Covid cases in a 24-hour period on Thursday, a tally above 200,000 for the second day running. The record of 208,099 was set just the day before, on Wednesday, as the health minister, Olivier Véran, warned of a “tsunami” of infections. At the beginning of December, there were fewer than 50,000 daily cases. One month before that, the daily data broke the 10,000 threshold for the first time since mid-September. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people should avoid cruise travel regardless of vaccination status, following a rise in onboard Covid cases, in a major blow to the industry that has been ravaged by the pandemic. The CDC on Thursday raised its Covid travel health notice level for cruise ships to 4, its highest warning level. “Even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants,” the health agency said. With several cruise ships already on the seas, the CDC said the passengers should get tested three to five days after their trip ends, and self-monitor for Covid symptoms for 14 days. The CDC has investigated or started an investigation into Covid cases on more than 85 ships already. It had eased its warnings for cruises by a notch from the highest level in June after cases had eased. As New Year’s Eve approaches, further changes are being made to coronavirus measures in different UK nations. Both Wales and Northern Ireland have announced a cut to self-isolation rules, the same as has been introduced in England. The PA news agency has broken down how Covid measures currently compare in the four nations. Northern Ireland On Thursday, it was announced the self-isolation period for confirmed Covid-19 cases will be reduced in Northern Ireland from 10 days to seven in line with England. The new rule will be subject to negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven, will apply retrospectively and take effect from Friday. It has already been announced that nightclubs will be closed on New Year’s Eve, while dancing will also be prohibited in hospitality venues. This will not apply to weddings. People must remain seated for table service, while table numbers will be limited to six. Ministers have also agreed that sporting events can continue with no limits on capacity, while the work-from-home message is being bolstered and legislation introduced to require social distancing in offices and similar workplaces. The guidance is for mixing in a domestic setting to be limited to three households. The first minister, Paul Givan, said on Thursday following a virtual meeting of the Stormont executive that no further restrictions would be introduced at this time, but that the executive would continue to assess the data as more information emerged. Wales The Welsh government also announced on Thursday that the mandatory isolation period for people who test positive with Covid-19 will drop from 10 days to seven, subject to two negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven. Initially the new rule was to be introduced on 5 January, but it will now come into force on Friday. Current rules in Wales state groups of no more than six people are allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants. Licensed premises can offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected, and 2-metre social distancing rules are in place. Nightclubs have been closed since Boxing Day and there is a requirement to work from home wherever possible. A maximum of 30 people can attend indoor events and a maximum of 50 people at outdoor events. People attending weddings or civil partnership receptions or wakes are also being told to take a lateral flow test before attending. Scotland Events have 1-metre social distancing and are limited to 100 people standing indoors, 200 people sitting indoors and 500 people outdoors. One-metre physical distancing is in place in all indoor hospitality and leisure settings. Table service is also required where alcohol is being served. Since 14 December, people have been asked to reduce their social contact as much as possible by meeting in groups of no more than three households. Allowing staff to work from home where possible has become a legal duty on employers. Care home visits have also been limited to two households. England On Monday, it was announced that no further coronavirus restrictions would be imposed in England until the new year, meaning the country has the most relaxed rules in the UK. However, Covid passes for entry into nightclubs and other venues have been in place as of 15 December. This applies to indoor events with 500 or more attendees where people are likely to stand or move around, such as music venues, certain outdoor events, such as music festivals, and any events with 10,000 or more attendees. Face coverings have also been made compulsory in most indoor public settings, as well as on public transport, and people have been told to work from home if they can. If a person in England has tested positive or has symptoms, they can stop self-isolating after seven days instead of 10 days if they receive two negative lateral flow test results on days six and seven. Those who are unvaccinated close contacts of positive cases must still isolate for 10 days. England’s guidance is that people should work from home if they can. Anyone who cannot work from home should continue to go in to work but is encouraged to consider taking lateral flow tests regularly. There were winners and losers as work patterns transformed during the pandemic - and perhaps forever - with repercussions for city centres and society as a whole. My colleague Joanna Partridge reports: The Welsh government has come to the aid of Westminster by lending England 4m lateral flow tests, as ministers scramble to secure supplies from around the world. There has been a surge in demand for Covid tests as people try to comply with advice to limit the spread of the Omicron variant by ensuring they do not have the virus before socialising. But by 9am on Thursday, home delivery slots for lateral flow tests were unavailable on the gov.uk website. Pharmacies have also complained about patchy supplies of lateral flow kits. The Welsh government has agreed to loan four million more tests to the NHS in England, bringing the total the country has given England to a total of 10 million. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said: Wales has a significant stock of lateral flow tests, sufficient to meet our needs over the weeks ahead. In a letter to MPs, the health secretary Sajid Javid said the supply of lateral flow devices (LFDs) was being tripled in January and February from a pre-Omicron plan of 100m to 300m a month. “To respond to anticipated demand over the coming few weeks we are buying hundreds of millions more LFD tests, bringing new products on board and accelerating their deployment to the public,” he said. But “in light of the huge demand for LFDs seen over the last three weeks, we expect to need to constrain the system at certain points over the next two weeks to manage supply over the course of each day, with new tranches of supply released regularly throughout each day”. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, previously urged people in England heading out for New Year’s Eve festivities on Friday to get tested. Prof Peter Openshaw, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said the conditions at a New Year’s Eve gathering were “perfect” for spreading coronavirus. The UK Health Security Agency said on Wednesday that 8m lateral flow test kits would be made available to pharmacies by New Year’s Eve. Germany announced it would in early January lift strict travel rules introduced amid fears over the Omicron variant, AFP reports. All countries currently listed in the “virus variant” category, including the UK and several southern African nations, will be reclassified as “high risk” from 4 January, said government health agency, the Robert Koch Institute. The change eases a ban on entry for travellers who are not German residents or citizens, instead allowing anyone to enter as long as they observe quarantine and testing rules. Germany introduced its “virus variant” travel category in a bid to stop new variants that have not yet spread widely on its territory. Only citizens and residents of Germany are permitted to enter from a “virus variant” country and are subject to a two-week quarantine, regardless of whether they are fully vaccinated or can provide a negative Covid test. By contrast, anyone double-vaccinated can enter from a high-risk country as long as they provide a negative test on arrival. Travellers from high-risk areas are exempt from quarantine if they have been fully vaccinated. Germany has so far recorded 16,748 cases of Omicron but the real number is thought to be much higher due to delays in reporting over the Christmas period. The health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said on Wednesday that he expects a significant rise in the number of Omicron cases in Germany within “in a few weeks”. Russia has overtaken Brazil to have the world’s second-highest death toll from the coronavirus pandemic, behind the United States, data from Russia’s state statistics service and Reuters calculations showed on Thursday. The statistics service, Rosstat, said 87,527 people had died from Covid-related causes in November, making it the deadliest month in Russia since the start of the pandemic. Russia’s overall pandemic death toll reached 658,634, according to Reuters calculations based on Rosstat figures up to the end of November and data from the coronavirus task force for December, overtaking Brazil, which has recorded 618,800 deaths. The death toll in the United States is higher, at 825,663 people, according to a Reuters tally, but its population is more than twice as big as Russia’s. Reuters calculations also showed Russia recorded more than 835,000 excess deaths since the beginning of the outbreak in April 2020 to the end of November, compared to average mortality in 2015-2019. Some epidemiologists say that calculating excess deaths is the best way to assess the true impact of a pandemic. So far, Russia’s death toll has not been affected by the Omicron variant and was mostly caused by a surge of infections in October and November, which health authorities blamed on the Delta variant and a slow vaccination campaign. On Thursday, Russian authorities ordered hospitals to get prepared for a possible surge in Covid cases. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which represents NHS community pharmacies in England, says some pharmacy staff are being verbally abused when stocks of lateral flow tests run out, following “exceptionally high” levels of demand. Alastair Buxton, the PSNC’s director of NHS services, said: Public demand for test kits remains exceptionally high, and despite UKHSA delivering some two million tests to pharmacy wholesalers on some days, this is still falling short of demand. Pharmacies are restricted to ordering one carton of tests per day, with not every pharmacy able to have one every day, and they say that any stock that does arrive is handed out very quickly given the constant demand. Members of the public being directed to pharmacies for tests are rightly frustrated when they cannot get them, but it’s concerning that some pharmacy teams say they are still being verbally abused when this happens. Pharmacies are getting as much stock as they can, and while we too are frustrated by this ongoing situation, we would ask people not to take their annoyance out on pharmacy teams: they are doing their best to meet demand in impossible circumstances, alongside providing other important healthcare services. Scotland’s health secretary has admitted the country is likely to miss its target of getting 80% of the eligible population boosted by the end of December, despite a concerted effort to promote the booster programme. Humza Yousaf told BBC Scotland an “exceptionally high” number of people would need to come forward for their booster or third vaccinations in the final hours before New Year’s Day to hit the 80% target. He estimated that on Thursday morning the government was 120,000 people short of that target despite repeated calls on Scots to get “boosted by the bells” – a reference to the bells that traditionally ring out at midnight on 31 December to welcome in the new year. He said: Our target was always to get to as close to 80% as we possibly could, we could get to 80% because the capacity is absolutely there, it will really be dependent on how many people come forward today and tomorrow. NHS Scotland data published at 2pm on Thursday showed that 2,944,977 booster or third vaccinations had been administered in Scotland, and the daily figures suggest the rate has slowed down during the Christmas holidays. Yousaf urged those who had not yet been boosted to book appointments in January, to continue the programme. He said there was plenty of capacity. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, told MSPs on Wednesday some people had missed appointments because they had either caught Covid or were self-isolating as close contacts. When the target of boosting nearly all UK adults by the end of December was first set by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, on 12 December, Yousaf had been quite sceptical it could be achieved. He said it would prove “extremely challenging” and would require diverting NHS staff to vaccination clinics, calling in military support and using trainee doctors and private firms to achieve it. Several days later Sturgeon said the revised target was to give 80% of eligible adults a booster by New Year’s Day. Nicola Sturgeon has again warned people to avoid mixing with other households after Covid cases in Scotland hit another record high of nearly 17,000 new cases, and hospitalisations increased by nearly 20% in one day. The first minister urged Scots to behave very cautiously in a series of tweets after 16,857 new cases were reported – equivalent to 27% of all tests taken yesterday. The NHS data showed 810 people were in hospital with Covid, an increase of 19.3% on yesterday’s figures, and the highest daily total since early November. Warning people about the risks of social mixing on Hogmanay, Sturgeon tweeted: Another nine deaths were reported of people with confirmed Covid, taking the total under that measure to 9,845, but the number in intensive care fell slightly by two to 49. Hospitalisations peaked in Scotland in late January 2021, at 2,053 cases. Scotland’s rolling seven-day average is now 11,838, compared with a recent low of 2,532 in late November. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish health secretary, confirmed in a BBC Scotland interview on Wednesday night it was unclear how many of those patients had been hospitalised because they had Covid, or were found to be positive after being admitted for another reason. Interviewed on The Nine, Yousaf was pressed on whether evidence from English hospitals which suggested only about 50% of patients with Covid had been admitted because of the virus was true for Scottish hospitalisations. The minister said the Scottish government was waiting for corroborated data from Public Health Scotland before disclosing those figures. Yousaf was unable to say how many patients in intensive care had the Omicron variant, but said statisticians were working on releasing that data. Portugal has cut the mandatory isolation period for people who test positive for Covid but are asymptomatic from 10 days to seven, even as new infections hit record highs. The move, which also applies to high-risk contacts, came after health experts urged the government to rethink its policy amid concerns that the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant and lengthy quarantines could paralyse the country. “This decision is aligned with guidelines from other countries and is a result of a technical and weighted consideration, given the incubation period of the now predominant variant, Omicron,” the DGS health authority said in a statement. Portugal’s decision follows similar moves in other countries like Spain and the UK, where several industries reported disruption as staff had to isolate even if they weren’t showing symptoms. The Portuguese island of Madeira on Wednesday also decided to cut mandatory isolation for asymptomatic people who test positive to five days, as well as for people who have close contact with confirmed cases. Daily coronavirus cases have risen in Portugal this week, peaking at a record 28,659 on Thursday, due to the fast-spreading Omicron and amplified by an increase in mass testing. Although the number of infections has skyrocketed, deaths and patients in intensive care units are not growing exponentially. Portugal has one of the world’s highest Covid vaccination rates, with around 87% of its 10-million population fully inoculated. DGS registered 16 deaths on Thursday, up from Wednesday’s 12, while the number of patients in intensive care units fell to 144 from 151. In late January, the number of daily deaths exceeded 300 and there were more than 900 patients in intensive care. The number of people with Covid in hospitals in Wales has increased to 446 - 49% higher than last week, the Welsh government has said. It has also announced that from Friday, people who have tested positive for Covid will have to isolate for seven rather than 10 days to help get people in critical jobs back to work. In a written statement, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the public health situation in Wales had deteriorated with the seven-day case rate at more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people across Wales. Cases are highest among 20- to 39-year-olds. The first minister said hospitalisations remained lower than in previous waves, but these too are starting to increase. However, Wales is not seeing a rise in the number of patients with Covid-19 needing critical care. Drakeford said Wales had a “significant stock of lateral flow tests, sufficient to meet our needs over the weeks ahead” and was loaning millions of tests to England. On the isolation rules, Drakeford said: People who have tested positive for Covid-19 must self-isolate for seven days. On days six and seven of their self-isolation period they should take lateral flow tests and if these tests – taken 24 hours apart – are positive, they should continue to self-isolate. We are bringing the change forward because the balance of harms has changed and the rising number of cases has begun to have an impact on the number of people, in critical jobs, who are excluded from the workplace because of self-isolation. Southern has cancelled trains to and from London Victoria for two weeks as a result of pandemic-related staff shortages. Disruption to rail services has been worsening over the Christmas period while industrial action continues. Southern has now announced that none of its trains will run to or from London Victoria until 10 January owing to “coronavirus isolation and sickness”. London Victoria is one of the UK’s busiest stations, and is normally connected by Southern to locations such as Brighton, Eastbourne and Portsmouth. Many other operators in addition to Southern have cancelled trains owing to the pandemic. They include Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Greater Anglia, London North Eastern Railway, Northern, ScotRail, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales. The suspension of Southern’s London Victoria services means it will not serve Clapham Junction, Wandsworth Common or Battersea Park. More on this story here: Southern cancels London Victoria trains for two weeks over Covid The Tories in Wales are trying to ratchet up the pressure on the Labour-led Welsh government to publish the scientific evidence behind its post-Christmas Covid restrictions. They point out that little has been seen of Welsh ministers and are calling for them to also publish the latest figures of people with Omicron in hospital and NHS staff absence rates The Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said: Over the past week, I’ve heard more from the prime minister, Sajid Javid and even Nicola Sturgeon but Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay have been nowhere to be seen. The fact we are still waiting on the government to publish the scientific advice behind the recent restrictions is quite frankly appalling. Pope Francis has cancelled his traditional New Year’s Eve visit to the Nativity scene in St Peter’s Square over concerns of spreading coronavirus among the gathered crowds, AFP reports. The pontiff is normally met by wellwishers when he visits the crib on 31 December, after presiding over the end-of-year Vespers and chanting of the Te Deum prayer. But the Vatican said in a diary note on Thursday that “the event will not be held, to avoid gatherings and the subsequent risks of Covid-19 infection”. Francis, 85, on Wednesday held his weekly general audience as usual in the Paul VI hall in the Vatican, with masks and social distancing. But as elsewhere in Europe, Italy - and by extension the Vatican City State - is facing a surge in coronavirus cases fuelled by the Omicron variant. Earlier I posted an entry about seven European countries barring Turkish travellers. Reuters said that story was based on a travel guidance table from Turkey’s civil aviation authority (SHGM), which has been updated to remove references to such bans. The story has now been withdrawn by Reuters and has been removed here too. You may have to refresh the page. Indian authorities started to impose stringent rules on Thursday to prevent mass gatherings at new year parties and public venues to combat a surge in Covid infections, even as top leaders led large political rallies, Reuters reports. Night curfews have been imposed in all major cities and restaurants ordered to limit customers. However, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the home minister, Amit Shah, presided over public rallies in northern states with footage from the events showing thousands of people gathered in open grounds to hear their speeches. Last week an Indian court urged Modi’s government to suspend political rallies and election campaigns in poll-bound states amid the rising number of Omicron cases. Elections to the state assembly in Uttar Pradesh, home to over 220 million people, is a key battleground for Modi and opposition parties because of its size and because the performance of political parties there will be a barometer for the 2024 national elections. Final dates for polls are yet to declared but all political parties have launched their campaigns, disregarding social distancing. The country reported 13,154 new Covid cases and 268 deaths in the last 24 hours, the federal health ministry said, with urban centres reporting a big rise. Cases of Omicron infections rose to 961. Police in the financial capital Mumbai prohibited public gatherings of five or more residents until 7 January as it recorded a sharp rise in cases with 2,510 infections, the highest daily increase since May, local authorities said. “It is being seen that social gatherings are going on in an unrestricted manner with people flouting all social distancing norms... we are trying our best to control the spread of the virus,” said Rajesh Tope, the health minister of the western state of Maharashtra of which Mumbai is the capital. Tope said the next 48 hours were critical for authorities to prevent an escalation of fresh Covid cases. While the government in the capital, New Delhi, closed cinemas, schools and gyms, state leader Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday held a public rally to celebrate victory in local polls in neighbouring Chandigarh city. An Indian newspaper, Mint, quoted Paul Kattuman, professor at the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge which has developed a Covid-19 India tracker stating that new infections will begin to rise in a few days, possibly this week. “It is likely that India will see a period of explosive growth in daily cases and that the intense growth phase will be relatively short,” said Kattuman. Now Christmas is over, the key to understanding the next part of the pandemic will be the number, and length, of hospitalisations, writes Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, in the Guardian today. An extract reads: How the next few weeks – never mind the next few months – play out in the UK is still far from clear. Even though the Omicron variant appears to be less severe than Delta, and for many the infection is just a mild, cold-like illness, that is clearly not the case for all. Ultimately the amount of pressure on the NHS will depend on how many people become ill enough to be admitted to hospital and that will depend on how high infection rates go, especially in the older age groups. If, as was the case in South Africa, cases increase very rapidly, peak and fall rapidly then the pressure on the NHS may be short-lived and manageable. But the epidemic in the UK may not follow what happened in South Africa. So where does this leave us with knowing how to best manage as we move beyond new year? It all depends on how much pressure Omicron will place on the health service at its peak and how long that period of high demand lasts. We probably won’t know until a week or so after the holiday period what is likely to happen in January and beyond. You can read the full piece here: Now Christmas is over, how bad is the Omicron situation in England? The UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, has warned MPs he may need to “constrain” the Covid testing system over the next fortnight, as demand for lateral flow kits surges. Ministers have repeatedly encouraged members of the public to test themselves using a lateral flow device (LFD) before attending gatherings or meeting vulnerable relatives. However, test kits have repeatedly been unavailable online in recent days, and many pharmacies have complained of being unable to secure them. Labour has accused the government of presiding over a “shambles”, with many members of the public struggling to obtain tests despite ministers putting testing at the centre of efforts to control the spread of Omicron. Demand for the tests has also been boosted by a change in quarantine rules that allows people to emerge from self-isolation after seven days instead of 10, as long as they carry out two negative lateral flow tests. In a letter sent to MPs on Wednesday evening, Javid acknowledged the intense strain being put on the system as cases of the Omicron variant continue to increase, with 183,037 new infections recorded on Wednesday. He wrote: In light of the huge demand for LFDs seen over the last three weeks, we expect to need to constrain the system at certain points over the next two weeks to manage supply over the course of each day, with new tranches of supply released regularly throughout each day. Javid reiterated the advice that the public should take a test “when engaging in activities that carry the greatest risk, and before coming into contact with people at risk of serious illness”. He said MPs should suggest that constituents unable to source testing kits online or find any at their local pharmacist, should, “see whether their local authority is distributing tests” or seek them out at local community facilities, such as libraries. Read the full story here: Lateral flow tests to be ‘constrained’ over next two weeks, warns Sajid Javid Martti Ahtisaari, Finland’s former president and Nobel peace prize winner, is in hospital after testing positive for Covid for a second time, AFP reports. The 84-year-old former mediator of international conflicts first contracted the illness in March 2020. “President Ahtisaari is doing well under the circumstances, but is being treated in hospital,” his foundation said on Thursday. The president of Finland from 1994 until 2000, Ahtisaari was awarded the Nobel prize in 2008 for his work to end conflicts in Indonesia, Namibia, Northern Ireland and the Balkans. Suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, he announced his withdrawal from public life in September. The former UN diplomat oversaw negotiations for reconciliation in 2005 between the Indonesian government and GAM rebels as well as Kosovo’s path toward independence. Three-quarters of people across the UK with new cold-like symptoms are likely to have Covid but exponential case growth seems to have stopped, scientists have said. According to new analysis, the Zoe Covid study estimates that 75% of people experiencing new cold-like symptoms are likely to have symptomatic Covid-19, PA reports. That is up from about 50% last week, with the study reporting that the data was showing a fall in the number of non-Covid “colds” and a rise in symptomatic Covid infections. It also said the incidence figures show there are currently 192,290 new daily symptomatic cases of Covid in the UK on average, based on test data from up to three days ago. That is up 33% from the 144,284 reported last week. The study also found that while the rise in cases appeared to be slowing in the 0 to 55 age groups it was “rising sharply” in the 55- to 75-year-old groups. It said this was “worrying” because this older age group was more at risk of needing hospital treatment. Dr Claire Steves, a scientist on the Zoe study app, said that while the number of daily new symptomatic Covid cases was more than double what it was this time last year, exponential growth appeared to have stopped. But symptoms such as a sore throat, headache, and runny nose needed to be added to the government list of Covid symptoms as soon as possible, she added. The number of daily new symptomatic Covid cases are more than double what they were this time last year and we are just a day or two away from hitting over 200,000. However, the exponential growth in cases appears to have stopped, and the rise is more steady. Hospitalisation rates are thankfully much lower than this time last year, but they are still high, especially in London. It’s good news to see that fewer people are newly sick than a few weeks ago. However, the fact that 75% of new cold-like symptoms are Covid, and the classic symptoms are much less common, means the government advice needs to be urgently updated. We want to see symptoms like sore throat, headache and runny nose added to the list as soon as possible. The new figures, published on Thursday, come after a new record was set for the daily number of Covid cases on Wednesday, as all four UK nations reported their figures for the first time since Christmas Eve. The Zoe study also found there were 78,748 new daily symptomatic cases in the vaccinated population – those with at least two doses – across the UK, up 40% from 56,346 last week. It estimates that on average one in 32 people in the UK currently have symptomatic Covid, rising to one in 30 in England. In Wales it is one in 41, in Scotland it is one in 51, and in London one in 16 have symptomatic Covid, it added. The Zoe study incidence figures are based on reports from around 840,000 weekly contributors. Seven European nations have barred Turkish passengers from entering their countries as the Omicron variant spreads, according to travel guidance by Turkey’s civil aviation authority (SHGM). Daily Covid cases in Turkey have reached their highest level since April this week, surging to nearly 37,000, but the number is still significantly below figures reported in parts of Europe. The SHGM’s Covid-19 travel guidance, last updated on 28 December, said the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Croatia, Iceland and Switzerland would no longer accept Turkish passengers. It said Turkish passengers would need to show proof of vaccination when entering Portugal or Sweden. “Entry cannot be made from our country,” the SHGM list said for the seven European countries, without elaborating. The SHGM also updated travel restrictions for Iraq and Iran, saying passengers travelling to the two countries may be subject to 14-day quarantine upon entry, while other travellers would need a negative PCR test. It was not immediately clear when the new restrictions were put in place or how long they would be in effect. The Netherlands announced a snap Christmas lockdown earlier this month, which will be reviewed on 14 January. Other countries have seen record number of coronavirus cases in recent weeks, working to balance restrictions while keeping economies running. Turkey has said it was not considering new restrictions for the moment, instead urging citizens to ramp up personal measures and get vaccinated. Ankara launched a nationwide rollout of its domestic Covid vaccine, Turkovac, on Thursday [see 11.26am.]. Three in 10 local authority areas in the UK are recording their highest rate of new Covid cases since mass testing began in summer 2020, new analysis shows. The areas include around three-quarters of authorities in north-west England, nearly two-thirds in the West Midlands and almost half in the East Midlands. But no London boroughs are on the list, while only a tiny number of areas in the south-east and eastern England are at record levels, suggesting the latest surge in cases may have peaked in these parts of the country. In a similar survey in the week before Christmas, two-thirds of local authorities in London were reporting record case rates. The new figures, which have been compiled by PA Media, show that: 29 of the 39 local authorities in north-west England now have record Covid-19 case rates, led by Barrow-in-Furness (1,554.1 cases per 100,000 people), Bury (1,489.7) and Warrington (1,471.4). Other areas at record levels include Blackpool, Bolton, Liverpool and Wigan. In the West Midlands, 18 of the 30 local authorities are seeing record rates, led by Stafford (1,178.7), Lichfield (1,119.9) and Cannock Chase (1,085.9). 17 of the 40 local authorities in the East Midlands have record case rates, including Chesterfield (1,189.4), Leicester (1,036.3) and Lincoln (1,087.5). London still has the highest local rates in the UK, accounting for nine of the top 10 and 17 of the top 20. Lambeth has the highest rate of all, 2,415.4, though this is down week-on-week from 3,029.1. Only one of the 11 local authorities in Northern Ireland is currently not at a record high: Armagh City, Banbridge &amp; Craigavon. Northern Ireland also has the highest rate of the four UK nations (1,310.2), followed by England (1,226.0), Wales (1,150.4) and Scotland (1,068.2) - all of which are record highs. Figures are for the seven days to 25 December, as data for more recent days is still incomplete. In total, 112 of the 377 local authority areas in the UK (30%) are recording their highest Covid case rates since mass testing was rolled out across the country in May and June 2020. Figures for case rates in the early months of the pandemic are not directly comparable, as only a small number of people were being tested, mostly in hospitals and care homes. The contrast between the south and east corner of the UK, and the rest of the country, reflects the way the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has spread in recent weeks – in particular how London was the first area of the UK where Omicron became the dominant variant. Of the 112 local authority areas with record case rates, only two are in south-east England (Cherwell and Worthing) and four are in eastern England (Bedford, King’s Lynn &amp; West Norfolk, Mid Suffolk and South Norfolk). In Scotland, 11 of the 32 local authorities are seeing record rates, along with eight of the 22 authorities in Wales. In addition, 11 of the 21 local authorities in Yorkshire and Humber are at record levels, plus two of the 12 authorities in north-east England. The number of deaths involving Covid registered each week in England and Wales dropped slightly ahead of Christmas, though it is too soon to see any impact in the figures of the current surge in Covid-19 cases, PA Media reports. A total of 755 deaths registered in the week ending 17 December mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is down 1% on the previous week and is the lowest number of deaths since the week to 15 October, when the total was 713. Deaths have remained at a low level throughout the latest wave of cases, with the weekly total between roughly 700 and 1,000 for the past few months. By contrast, 8,433 deaths involving Covid were registered in England and Wales in the week to 29 January, at the peak of the second wave of the virus. The rollout of vaccines has played a major role in keeping the number of deaths across the UK at a relatively low level since the second wave. It is too early to tell if the surge in cases caused by the Omicron variant is affecting the number of Covid deaths, however. Due to the typical length of time between infection, hospital admission and death – two to three weeks – the impact of the current record levels of cases will not be evident until January at the earliest. The latest ONS figures also show that 60 care home resident deaths involving Covid in England and Wales were registered in the week to 17 December, down slightly from 65 the previous week. In total, 44,466 care home residents in England and Wales have had Covid-19 recorded on their death certificate since the pandemic began. The figures cover deaths of care home residents in all settings, not just in care homes. Overall, 174,392 deaths have now occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, the ONS said. The highest number on a single day was 1,485 on 19 January 2021. During the first wave of the virus, the daily toll peaked at 1,461 on 8 April 2020. Within weeks, the Omicron variant has fuelled thousands of new Covid hospitalisations among US children, raising new concerns about how the many unvaccinated Americans under the age of 18 will fare in the new surge, Reuters reports. The seven-day average number of daily hospitalisations for children between 21 and 27 December is up more than 58% nationwide in the past week to 334, compared with about 19% for all age groups, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. Fewer than 25% of the 74 million Americans under 18 are vaccinated, according to the CDC. Omicron cases are expected to surge even faster across the US as schools reopen next week after the winter holiday, experts cautioned. Doctors say it is too early to determine whether Omicron causes more severe illness in children than other coronavirus variants, but that its extremely high transmissibility is one key factor that is driving up hospitalisations. “It is going to infect more people and it is infecting more people. We’ve seen numbers go up, we’ve seen hospitalisations in kids go up,” said Dr Jennifer Nayak, an infectious disease expert and paediatrician at the University of Rochester Medical Center. What we are seeing is that children under five remain unvaccinated so there’s still a relatively large population of children who are naive, so they have no pre-existing immunity to this virus. Even in New York City, which has some of the highest vaccination rates in the country, only around 40% of 5- to-17-year-olds are fully vaccinated compared with more than 80% of adults, city health data shows. There is no authorised vaccine for US children under the age of five. Hospitalisations in NYC of people aged 18 and younger increased from 22 the week starting 5 December to 109 between 19 and 23 December. Children under five represented almost half of the total cases. Hospitalisations of people 18 and under in the entire state were at 184 from 19 and 23 December, up from 70 from 5 to 11 December. Other parts of the country are also seeing a surge in cases among children. Ohio has seen a 125% increase in hospitalisations among children 17 and under in the past four weeks, according to data from the Ohio Hospital Association. Florida, New Jersey and Illinois have witnessed an increase of at least double in the seven-day average daily hospitalisation of underage patients with the coronavirus over the past week, CDC data shows. Young children have far lower vaccination rates than other age groups, with some families hesitating to introduce a new vaccine to their youngest members. Fewer than 15% of US children aged 5-11 have been fully vaccinated since the Pfizer/BioNTech jab was authorised for that age group in late October, federal data shows. Doctors said the more severe Covid symptoms they are seeing in hospitalised children this month include difficulty breathing, high fever, and dehydration. “They need help breathing, they need help getting oxygen, they need extra hydration. They are sick enough to end up in the hospital, and that’s scary for doctors, and it’s scary for parents,” said Rebecca Madan, a paediatric infectious disease specialist at New York University’s Langone Health hospital system. The surge in cases occurred as schools closed for the winter holidays. Before the vacation, more than a thousand classrooms have been either fully or partially quarantined due to outbreaks, according to New York City data. The city said it will open schools for about a million children as planned on 3 January, following the district’s winter recess. Research has shown that a substantial amount of transmission among children tends to happen outside of schools. But Madan and others expect a new rise in cases among children from holiday gatherings, which could disrupt classroom attendance. Good morning from New Orleans. I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next eight hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Prof Peter Openshaw, who sits on the UK’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) has warned the conditions at a New Year’s Eve gathering were “perfect” for spreading coronavirus, and said a lack of availability of testing in the UK was “very worrying indeed”. At the time of writing, there were no lateral flow tests available for delivery from the UK government website. Scotland and Wales still had bookable PCR tests, but Northern Ireland had “very few available” and no region of England had any available. NHS England confirmed that it was creating new small-scale “Nightingale” facilities with up to 100 beds each at eight hospitals across the country. The health service said it had asked trusts to identify empty spaces to accommodate beds in places such as gyms or teaching areas. NHS managers are aiming to create up to 4,000 beds as surge capacity if needed. Prof Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said he feels “most worried” about unvaccinated people. “Those who are unvaccinated remain at risk here in the UK and in other countries around the world, so that perhaps needs to be our focus.” Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts has said staff absences due to Covid-19 were “clearly now having a significant impact” across the whole economy and parts of the health service. Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, has repeated calls for action over viral disinformation about vaccines being spread online. She said “It’s becoming an issue for the whole of society, who might now be facing further restrictions or huge pressure on the NHS because there are people who are choosing not to have the vaccine because of myths and misinformation that they are being fed online.” Coronavirus infections set new one-day highs in six of Canada’s provinces, prompting several provinces to impose more restrictions in hopes of containing the spread of the omicron variant. In Australia, fewer people will be told to get tested for Covid, with most states backing a much narrower definition of a close contact, as a record 21,000 new daily cases were recorded nationwide. Americans are again facing a stay-at-home New Year’s Eve as US political leaders and senior health advisers have urged people to scrap party plans and avoid larger public events as daily cases of Covid-19 break all previous records. India is on the threshold of a potential new wave of coronavirus – probably fuelled by the Omicron variant. Cases have surged by 86% in the Indian capital New Delhi in 24 hours, and doubled in Mumbai in the same period. Health leaders in eastern European countries with low vaccination rates like Romania are warning of a January wave of infections after the holiday period. The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that reducing mandatory isolation periods for people with Covid-19 was a trade-off between controlling transmission and keeping economies up and running. Michael Ryan told a news conference “If people shorten the quarantine period, there will be a small number of cases that will develop disease and potentially go on to transmit, because they have been let out of quarantine earlier. But that will be a relatively small number, and a lot of people who won’t transmit will also be released from that quarantine.” Armed police in Jingxi, in southern China, have paraded four alleged violators of Covid rules through the streets, state media reported, a practice that was banned but which has resurfaced in the struggle to enforce a zero-Covid policy. That is it from me, Martin Belam. I am off to host our silly Thursday quiz. Lucy Campbell will be here shortly to bring you the rest of the days news on Covid from the UK and around the world. US airline JetBlue has said it is reducing its schedule through to 13 January by about 1,280 flights due to a surge in crew members falling sick from the Omicron coronavirus variant. Carriers have been canceling hundreds of flights every day in the United States since Christmas Eve as they grapple with staff shortages due to Covid infections and bad weather in parts of the country. “We expect the number of Covid cases in the north-east, where most of our crew members are based, to continue to surge for the next week or two,” JetBlue’s spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “This means there is a high likelihood of additional cancellations until case counts start to come down.” The chairman of the Royal College of GPs has criticised “mixed messages” over the supply of Covid tests in the UK after the health secretary was quoted as saying there was a global shortage. Prof Martin Marshall said the demand for tests had gone up “dramatically” as people seek to check their Covid status before socialising or coming out of isolation. PA Media quote him telling Times Radio: It does seem to be that there’s some mixed messages here because the secretary of state said yesterday that there was a global shortage because demand globally in most countries for testing has gone up massively. But we’re also, as you say, told by the UK Health Security Agency that there’s a local logistics problem of delivering to pharmacies and delivering to the warehouses that supply the online suppliers of the testing. The government advice is reasonably clear about what people need to do before they’re allowed to socialise, before they’re allowed to release after self-isolation, but there’s no point in having that advice if as GPs we know we’re no longer able to help patients to actually act on that advice, and that’s a big issue for us. The Spectator has firmly nailed its colours to the mast that Omicron is going to be milder and lead to fewer and shorter hospital admissions than previous coronavirus variants. One of its data journalists, Michael Simmons, has extracted this chart from numbers included in recent Sage documents, which paints an optimistic picture of shorter hospital stays since December for patients who survive a Covid hospitalisation. As with the numbers from the UK dashboard earlier, I suspect this chart will either confirm you in your beliefs that the UK government and the devolved authorities have been over-reacting to a mild new Covid strain, or will do little to persuade you that the health service isn’t already under pressure with a potentially huge wave of hospitalisations still coming as the UK continues to rack up record daily case numbers. This will be a familiar sight to anybody who has been trying to book a rapid lateral flow test from the government website in the UK, and it is the state of play again at the moment. Officials and experts in low-vaccinated eastern European countries are anticipating a post-holiday explosion of Omicron-fuelled Covid-19 cases in much of the region. Adriana Pistol, the director of Romania’s National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases, warned on Wednesday that the country could see a peak of 25,000 new daily cases during the expected next wave. Romania is the European Union’s second-least vaccinated member nation. Noting that roughly 60% of Romania’s people over the age of 65 or living with chronic diseases remain unvaccinated, Pistol said: “Even if the Omicron strain does not have the same level of severity ... the health system will be overloaded anyway and reach levels recorded this year in October.” Stephen McGrath reports from Sibiu in Romania for Associated Press that Romania saw huge lines at borders before Christmas as hundreds of thousands of citizens flocked home, many from the west. The government started requiring travellers to complete passenger locator forms as of 20 December to help track infections, but Pistol said many had failed to fill them out. Only 40% of Romania’s population of around 19 million have been fully inoculated. “It’s very clear that the fifth wave will probably hit us in January,” Dragos Zaharia, a primary care doctor at the Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumology in Bucharest, said. “We just hope that there will be fewer deaths, fewer severe cases, and fewer hospital admissions.” Our community team are interested to hear from people living in the UK who were against getting the Covid vaccine but subsequently decided to get inoculated. They’d like to hear why you did not want to get the vaccine initially, and which factors ultimately changed your mind. You can find more details here: Tell us – have you changed your mind on getting vaccinated against Covid? PA Media is also carrying some quotes this morning from Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts. He said staff absences due to Covid-19 were “clearly now having a significant impact” across the whole economy and parts of the health service. NHS experience suggests that the impact varies considerably depending on how many staff are isolating, driven by local community infection rates; ability to rapidly source temporary replacement staff; and ability to flex existing staff to cover work of those who are absent. For example, some NHS ambulance trust CEOs are saying their current staff absence rates mean significant numbers of ambulances off the road, given the need to have appropriately trained staff in each ambulance. It was “obviously a particular issue for NHS trusts if they can’t provide right quality of care due to Covid absences” and he added that if the pressures continued to rise then so would calls to reduce the self-isolation period to five days. The head of the Oxford Vaccine Group has said he feels “most worried” about unvaccinated people amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Prof Andrew Pollard said developers had begun “first steps” towards preparing for modifying vaccines to combat future strains of coronavirus but that the “focus” should be on those who have still not received a first dose. “I actually feel most worried today about the unvaccinated people, whether they’re here in the UK or elsewhere in the world, because we do have now a variant which spreads remarkably effectively so it’s going to be finding many of those unvaccinated people in the weeks ahead,” PA Media quote him telling BBC Breakfast. “Those who are unvaccinated remain at risk here in the UK and in other countries around the world, so that perhaps needs to be our focus.” “One thing we have to do is to continue monitoring what happens as new variants emerge,” he added. “There is still a lot of work to do. There are people in many countries who are still not vaccinated. We have some countries where that is still due to supply constraints because there’s more doses to be distributed; in other countries it’s around addressing vaccine hesitancy.” There are concerns over the availability of tests in the UK this morning from Prof Peter Openshaw, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). He said the conditions at a New Year’s Eve gathering were “perfect” for spreading coronavirus. Asked about the prospect of untested people mixing due to a shortage of lateral flow devices, PA Media quoted him telling BBC Radio 4’s Today: I think it’s very worrying indeed. We know the situations in which transmission happens and fortunately I don’t think we are facing the sort of lockdown that was necessary in order to cope in the very earliest part of this year. But we do know that crowding together in poorly ventilated spaces, particularly if you are shouting over loud music and so on, is absolutely perfect in terms of transmitting this very, very highly transmissible virus. Just a quick one from Associated Press here, that French Open finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova has tested positive for Covid-19, casting doubt on her place in the Australian Open beginning on 17 January. The 30-year-old Russian confirmed she has the coronavirus and is isolating after arriving in Australia on Tuesday. “I was fully vaccinated and was preparing for the start of the season in Dubai,” Pavlyuchenkova said on social media. “But we live in a very difficult and unpredictable time. Right now I am in complete isolation, in a special hotel and following all the protocols under the supervision of doctors. Now it’s important to take care of yourself and the health of others. I’ll be back on court when it’s safe for everyone.” In the UK, Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Lucy Powell, has appeared on Sky News, repeating calls for action over viral disinformation about vaccines being spread online. She said: As we are seeing huge differences now in terms of hospitalisation rates and deaths between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, it’s absolutely critical that we really do now clamp down on some of this misinformation that’s been spread so widely and virally online, as it can do online in a way that it can’t do on broadcast or in the print media. We’ve got to do more to tackle this urgently now, so that we can get to those hard to reach people to get those vaccinations. It’s becoming an issue for the whole of society, who might now be facing further restrictions or huge pressure on the NHS because there are people who are choosing not to have the vaccine because of myths and misinformation that they are being fed online. In response to the scenes in Milton Keynes yesterday where anti-vaccine activists stormed a Covid testing centre, Powell said: Well, I would like to see the police being very tough for those that … I wouldn’t even call them protesters. I think they were people who were very aggressively getting in the way of those doing their duty, working incredibly hard, our NHS staff who spent Christmas not taking holiday, not being with friends and families, in order to vaccinate others, and they’re being very aggressively disrupted by these individuals and by these so called anti-vaxxers. I was just having a look at the government website to book a PCR test in the UK, and already it seems stocks are low again across all regions of England, with none available in the north east of England. Tests are currently available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Overnight Andrew Madden has reported for the Belfast Telegraph on the latest situation in Northern Ireland. He writes: On Wednesday the Department of Health reported a further 14 Covid-related deaths and 22,972 new cases of the virus in the five days from midnight on December 23 to midnight on December 28. This is an average of around 4,600 cases each day, well above the previous daily record of 3,286. In Belfast alone, 4,195 cases were confirmed over the five-day period. Hospitals across the region are at 94% capacity, with the South West Acute Hospital operating over capacity. It came as the PHA published new arrangements regarding PCR testing to “protect the testing system in Northern Ireland and ensure availability of testing for those who need it”. Fully-vaccinated close contacts will no longer have to take a PCR test. Instead, they will be advised to take a lateral flow test as soon as possible. Read more here: Belfast Telegraph – New Northern Ireland rules for PCR testing as demand outstrips supply due to rise of Omicron Fewer Australians will be told to get tested for Covid, with most states backing a much narrower definition of a close contact, as a record 21,000 new daily cases were recorded nationwide. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, cited “some very practical problems” caused by the more infectious Omicron variant – including the huge strain on the PCR testing scheme that had been at the centre of Australia’s response for two years. Speaking after a snap national cabinet meeting on Thursday, Morrison called for a “reset” because it was unfeasible to “have hundreds of thousands of Australians or more taken out of circulation based on rules that were set for the Delta variant”. The changes come on the same day the OzSage group of scientists and economists warned that a “let it rip” and “defeatist” approach to Covid would disrupt the health system and be felt most by vulnerable groups. Read our full report: Fewer Australians to have Covid tests as national cabinet agrees to new definition of close contact Here’s a reminder of the news overnight that NHS England is looking to set up new “pop-up” Covid facilities. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Aubrey Allegretti report: NHS England confirmed that it was creating new small-scale “Nightingale” facilities with up to 100 beds each at eight hospitals across the country. The health service said it had asked trusts to identify empty spaces to accommodate beds in places such as gyms or teaching areas. NHS managers are aiming to create up to 4,000 beds as surge capacity if needed, with work on the first tranche, in temporary structures, starting this week. A number of huge temporary hospitals, called the “Nightingales”, were built in exhibition halls in the first wave of the pandemic but were dismantled without being used to capacity. The new approach will ask for surge capacity to be built in the grounds of hospitals to make it easier for staff to move between new and old sites and keep patients closer to diagnostics and emergency care. The first sites will be at Preston, Leeds, Birmingham, Leicester, Stevenage, St George’s in London, Ashford and Bristol. Read more here: Hospitals in England asked to look for up to 4,000 emergency Covid beds Coronavirus infections set new one-day highs in six Canadian provinces Wednesday, prompting several provinces to impose more restrictions in hopes of containing the spread of the omicron variant. Associated Press report that the biggest jumps were in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which are the country’s most populous provinces. Quebec reported more than 13,000 new cases in the previous 24 hours, Ontario had 10,436 and British Columbia listed 2,944. Manitoba, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador also set new records. British Columbia announced it is delaying the full return to classrooms after the Christmas break to give school staff time to implement enhanced health measures. Staff and students whose parents are health workers will return to schools 3 January or 4 January as planned. All other students return 10 January. In the UK, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has issued a report based on its latest survey of nurses, which suggests that 57% of respondents were either thinking about leaving their job or actively planning to leave. The general secretary of the RCN, Pat Cullen, has just been on Sky News. She was asked about NHS England plans for pop-up centres to deal with Covid cases, and said: You can set up all the hubs that you wish to set up. But if you don’t have the nursing staff to actually care for the patients that are going to be placed in those hubs, that places more challenges on the nursing workforce. The nurses that are already providing the critical care in hospitals will be spread even more thinly across those areas, unless there’s another plan to staff those beds and care for those patients. On the current morale in the nursing profession in the NHS, Cullen said: Each and every nurse has paid a massive price over the last number of years. Ahead of the pandemic there were 50,000 nursing vacancies in the NHS in England. And then on top of that, we now have a situation where thousands of nurses are off isolating. So you can imagine what it’s like for those nurses that are still getting up, as we speak this morning, to start a thirteen-fourteen hour shift, caring for patients with a depleted workforce, and knowing that there’s no end to it. It’s just relentless, and the words that they say to me on a daily basis are it has become intolerable. And, you know, throughout my 37-year nursing career, I never thought that I would see a report issued today that shows 57% of our workforce wishing to leave the profession. That certainly was never something that I thought I would see in my time. Americans are again facing a stay-at-home New Year’s Eve as US political leaders and senior health advisers have urged people to scrap party plans and avoid larger public events as daily cases of Covid-19 break all previous records. In New York, attendance at the Times Square celebration known as the Ball Drop – in essence, tens of thousands of people watching a 12-foot geodesic sphere inlaid with Waterford crystals descend a long pole – has been capped at 15,000, down from pre-pandemic 60,000, with organizers encouraging revelers to watch it on TV or online. Attendees must be fully vaccinated and wear masks. The changes are meant to “keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year”, outgoing mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. In Chicago, the Illinois governor, Jay Pritzker, has not yet imposed restrictions or shut down the city’s traditional fireworks show. But he warned Chicagoan this week that “Omicron and Delta are coming to your party”. “You need to think twice about how many people will be gathered together, keeping social distancing if you’re at a party. And if you can’t, leave,” he added. San Francisco has canceled its fireworks show over the Bay for the second year in a row. Mayor London Breed told residents that “we must remain vigilant in doing all we can to stop the spread of the Covid-19 Omicron variant”. Read more of Edward Helmore’s report here: US cities scale back New Year’s Eve events and urge people to scrap parties India is on the threshold of a potential new wave of coronavirus – probably fuelled by the Omicron variant. Cases have surged by 86% in the Indian capital New Delhi in 24 hours, and doubled in Mumbai in the same period. Although the absolute numbers remain low in both cities, the sharp rise is striking and is alarming officials. By late November, India’s capital was recording about 40 fresh infections a day. On Wednesday, it recorded 923. The last time it had recorded such a figure was in May. The surge has prompted fresh restrictions in all public places yet huge rallies for elections in February continue to be held by all parties. The rise has injected more urgency into the efforts to vaccinate the 108 million adult Indians who have yet to receive even one jab. So far, though, doctors have seen very few serious cases. The vast majority are asymptomatic or with very mild symptoms from which they are recovering fast. Nor is there any pressure yet on hospitals. Around 97 per cent of the 21,518 beds in Delhi earmarked for covid patients remain vacant, anecdotally suggesting the variant is more transmissible but less virulent. Doctors say that protection through natural infection during India’s second wave, when the Delta variant raged across the country, is probably another reason for the low impact. Hello, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over from Samantha Lock in Sydney. I often start my live blogging shift with a recap of the latest numbers in the UK from the government’s Covid dashboard. There are some heavy caveats around them this morning, however, with widespread reports of a lack of availability of testing kits. Over the last seven days there have been 914,723 new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK. Cases have increased by 41% week-on-week. There have been 516 deaths recorded in the last week. Deaths have decreased by 34% week-on-week. Hospital admissions have increased by 13% week-on-week. At the latest count on the UK government’s own dashboard, there were 8,246 people in hospital in total, of whom 842 are in ventilation beds. I suspect you will look at those numbers and they will confirm what you already thought – either that cases are running very high and there should be more restrictions immediately, especially in England, or, that the level of deaths and hospitalisations remain low enough that people should be free to go about their business as they see fit. Armed police in Jingxi, in southern China, have paraded four alleged violators of Covid rules through the streets, state media reported, a practice that was banned but which has resurfaced in the struggle to enforce a zero-Covid policy. The four men were accused of smuggling people across China’s closed borders, and on Tuesday they were led through the streets wearing hazmat suits and bearing placards showing their name and photos. The state-run Guangxi daily reported the action was designed to deter “border-related crimes”. A common practice during the Cultural Revolution, public shaming has long since been banned in China, and the Communist party-affiliated Beijing News said the Jingxi incident “seriously violates the spirit of the rule of law and cannot be allowed to happen again”. Read the full story here. The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that slashing the mandatory isolation period for people with Covid-19 was a trade-off between controlling transmission and keeping economies up and running. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference: If people shorten the quarantine period, there will be a small number of cases that will develop disease and potentially go on to transmit, because they have been let out of quarantine earlier. But that will be a relatively small number, and a lot of people who won’t transmit will also be released from that quarantine. So it is a trade-off between the science and being absolutely perfect in what you try to do, but then having the minimal disruption that you can possibly have to your economy and society - and governments are struggling to find that balance.” The WHO’s guidelines on quarantine are, for symptomatic patients, 10 days after symptom onset, plus at least three additional days without symptoms; and for asymptomatic cases, 10 days after a positive test. Ryan said the average incubation period so far has been around five or six days - but there was a range. The likelihood of someone developing symptoms after five, six or seven days goes down exponentially, he explained, adding that it was then for governments to make the judgement call on when to allow people out of isolation. “There is some data to suggest that the incubation period for Omicron may be shorter, but there will still be a very wide range,” he said, stressing that this was based on very limited studies. “It would be advisable at this point if we don’t see huge shifts, huge moves in reducing control measures for Covid-19 purely on the basis of initial or preliminary studies.” Fearful of the economic impact of keeping so many people at home and a lack of staff due to long isolation times, some governments are looking at shortening the period that people have to isolate if they are Covid positive or have been exposed to someone who is positive. Spain announced it will reduce the quarantine period for people who have tested positive for Covid-19 to seven days from 10, even as new infections hit record highs. Italy said will scrap self-isolation rules for those coming into contact with someone testing positive for coronavirus providing they have had a booster shot, have recently recovered or been vaccinated. The move comes after health experts urged the government to rethink its policies amid worries that the spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant could paralyse the country by forcing millions to stay at home. Earlier this week US health authorities also released new guidance shortening the isolation period for people with a confirmed infection to five days from 10, so long as they are asymptomatic. In England, people who receive negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven of their self-isolation period – with tests taken 24 hours apart – no longer have to stay indoors for a full 10 days. Australia on Thursday narrowed its definition of close contacts of coronavirus cases and relaxed requirements for Covid-19 tests, as daily cases topped 20,000 for the first time in the pandemic, in a bid to relieve pressure on testing sites. The rules are being relaxed to stop asymptomatic people being forced into isolation, especially in healthcare, hospitality and airlines, and cut long lines of people forced to get PCR tests for interstate travel or because they have been at a public site with a confirmed case. Prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters: With Omicron, we cannot have hundreds of thousands of Australians and more taken out of circulation based on rules that were set for the Delta variant” From Friday, Morrison said “close contacts” will be redefined as people who live in the same household with an infected person. They would have to isolate for seven days and would only have to get a PCR test if they have Covid-19 symptoms. Hello and welcome back to our live Covid blog. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest coronavirus developments as they happen. Countries across Europe are reporting a record high number of infections as authorities scramble to stem the surge. The UK, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Ireland and Greece all reported new case records this week, while cases in the US also hit a new high. Despite the surge in cases, countries across the world are easing isolation and testing rules. Spain reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days from 10 after businesses expressed fears the Omicron surge would leave them with mounting staff shortages. Italy scrapped the isolation period for people who have received three shots of a Covid vaccine and are subsequently exposed to someone who has tested positive. In England, people who receive negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven of their self-isolation period – with tests taken 24 hours apart – no longer have to stay indoors for a full 10 days. In light of these decisions, the World Health Organization cautioned that slashing the mandatory isolation period for people with Covid-19 was a trade-off between controlling transmission and keeping economies up and running. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said it is not “advisable” to reduce Covid controls and warned that governments need to be “careful” about reducing restrictions. Speaking at a WHO press conference on Wednesday, Dr Ryan said: Even with the previous variants, most people will incubate and show symptoms or be positive within that first six days or so, and the chances then of being positive or transmitting the disease after that are lower – but it is then for governments to make that judgment call of when to allow people out of a quarantine situation with extra tests. The most important thing at this moment is we need to be careful about changing tactics and strategies immediately on the basis of what we’re seeing in early Omicron data.” The UK reported another record rise with more than 183,000 daily Covid cases on Wednesday. More than 90% of community Covid cases in England are the now Omicron variant, according to the latest data from the UK Health Security Agency. Paris, France, is set to reimpose wearing face masks outdoors again in this week in a bid to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, police said on Wednesday. Anti-vaxxers stormed a Covid testing centre during a ‘freedom’ rally in Milton Keynes, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre. Argentina reported a daily record of 42,032 new cases on Wednesday. France registered a national and European record for new infections reporting 208,000 coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. The German health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said on Wednesday that the number of new Covid cases has been under-reported and the actual incidence rate of infections is about two or three times higher than the officially reported figure. More than 44,000 people in the US could die of Covid-19 in the next four weeks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Portugal reported a new record of 26,867 Covid cases over the last 24 hours on Wednesday, up from 17,172 the previous day, although daily deaths dropped to a fraction of early 2021 peaks. Cuba will give booster shots to its entire population in January, according to a report in state-run media."

          "bodyText": "Normally the summer Olympics are the pinnacle event for me to cover, but this year was not at all normal and I decided to give Tokyo a miss. Not only did my family not want me going, there were other factors to discourage me, not least the new rules that meant I might have very limited access. So instead my year was dominated by football, the peak being the final of the Euros at Wembley, a game that brought the country to a standstill and became one of the most-watched moments in British television history. West Bromwich Albion v Arsenal, The Hawthorns – 2 January 44mm lens 1/1600 f4.5 ISO 4000 My year started off in a very cold fashion with a trip to the Hawthorns, the highest professional league ground in the country. Despite the freezing conditions I loved it. It is pretty rare to shoot a football match in snow, thanks to either modern heated pitches melting it, or the games getting called off due to safety concerns for spectators. Back in January that obviously wasn’t the case as all games were being played behind closed doors. It was quickly apparent that the home side probably wished it had been postponed. They lost 4-0 to Arsenal, a dismal performance indicative of their season as a whole. The reason I like this picture is the bleakness of it all. Heavy snow falling in an empty stadium as all 10 outfield West Brom players, each one separate from the other, trudge back to the centre circle after conceding a goal. A very black and white image – perhaps a Christmas card for a Wolves fan? Ealing Trailfinders v Saracens, Trailfinders Challenge Cup – 16 January 400mm lens 1/2500 f4 ISO 640 In mid-January this special challenge match was the only senior men’s rugby game in Britain as all the others had been cancelled for Covid reasons. Ealing are a Championship team, in the second tier of English rugby, and Saracens were just about to start their season at this new level following their demotion from the Premiership. Most rugby matches I usually cover are in large stadia with tall stands circling the pitch. This wasn’t the case at Ealing and most of the pitch was bathed in low winter sun. Shooting backlit was beautiful, all I needed was the play to come near me into the right patch of light. For ages it seemed stuck at the other end, time ticking by and the sun rapidly descending. Eventually a maul formed where I needed it and I managed to get a few frames before clouds rolled in and everything went dark. Arsenal v Manchester United, Emirates Stadium – 30 January 560mm lens, 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000 It was injury time at the end of this very dull 0-0 draw back in January. I was cold and had very few decent pictures. Suddenly the Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette launched himself at the ball across the back of Harry Maguire and flipped over in mid-air. It just goes to show you never know when something might happen to brighten up your day. Spurs v Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – 4 February 105mm lens 1/1250 f4.5 ISO 4000 One of the advantages of working in an empty stadium with a game played behind closed doors is that it gave me opportunities to put remote cameras in places I normally wouldn’t be allowed to, such as here in the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, on stairs right at the top of the massive South Stand. While I was down at pitch-level, I was setting off this camera up there. I love the view looking down on the goal, all neat symmetry and perfect lines. Even the groundsman with rubber gloves on, ready to pick up a loose ball from behind the goal, is standing right in the middle. As Jorginho stepped up to score a penalty for Chelsea, the only goal of this game, all the elements lined up perfectly. This frame is also a reminder of the pandemic age of football, a time when the game carried on without fans. England v Italy, Twickenham – 13 February 560mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 2500 The England captain Owen Farrell gets a fist in the face during his side’s 41-18 victory over Italy in the Six Nations. International rugby is such a hard, physical sport with a lot of close confrontations such as this. It is at moments like these that I often like to go in tight on the action with a very long lens. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it does not. Wales v England, Principality Stadium – 27 February 145mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 Normally for this game, which has always been one of my favourite fixtures, the Principality Stadium would be full of baying red-shirted fans. It is a perfect ground for rugby which, when full, crackles with intensity and passion. The Six Nations game there in February felt very surreal, the empty seats covered with giant waterproof sheets, one of which bore a fire-breathing dragon. I could not help but imagine what the noise would have been like as Wales won 40-24. Lawrence Okolie, World cruiserweight boxing champion – 6 April 50mm lens 1/125 f1.6 ISO 400 In 2012 Lawrence Okolie weighed 19 stone and was working in a McDonald’s at London Victoria station. It was the final day of the London Olympics and in a break from flipping burgers he watched Anthony Joshua winning the heavyweight boxing gold medal on TV. The following day Okolie quit his job and vowed to be a boxer. In early April I went to photograph the 28-year-old from Hackney just a few days after he became the WBO world cruiserweight champion. I decided to photograph Okolie in the tiny gym at the bottom of his garden in Essex, cradling his newly-won world champion belt. Rachael Blackmore wins the Grand National, Aintree – 10 April 28mm lens 1/2500 f11 ISO 1250 In the hour before every Grand National there is always a buzz among the photographers at the course. Everyone asks “where are you going?” or “what’s your plan?” This year was no different and I remember talking to Steve Cargill, a racing specialist, as we headed out on to the track. In unison we both said: “What if Rachael wins?” and realised our goals were very similar, we had to be at the finish in case Blackmore created history and became the first female jockey to win the world’s most famous steeplechase race. I had photographed her success at Cheltenham the previous month, where she was crowned leading jockey, so knew she was in terrific form. Sure enough her horse, Minella Times, carried her to victory at Aintree. It was a real pity that spectators were not there to witness it, just a few owners watching on. It was quite eerie afterwards as she enjoyed the moment while at the same time caring for her horse, dousing it with water while the TV screen replayed her historic win in the background. Arsenal fans protest, Emirates Stadium – 23 April 70mm lens 1/2000 f4.5 ISO 500 For a couple of weeks of the Premier League season in April and May it seemed the news agenda was not being set by matters on the pitch but rather what was occurring outside grounds. It was the time of fans’ protests, justifiably angered by six clubs announcing their intention to join a new European Super League. This radical proposal, which would have caused havoc to the game, came along when fans had been locked out for months. At Arsenal the fans’ grievances were directed squarely at the club’s owner, Stan Kroenke. Before a home match against Everton hundreds gathered. I went back inside the ground after photographing the demo. The game, in front of no fans, was desperate. Arsenal lost 1-0 but no one seemed that bothered with the result – the bigger news had been made outside. Manchester City win the Premier League – 11 May 16mm lens 1/400 f4 ISO 3200 Once I saw Caglar Soyuncu scoring the winner for Leicester at Old Trafford, I knew the most important pictures on that May evening would be taken on the other side of Manchester. United’s defeat meant City had won the Premier League. So I quickly got in the car after the final whistle and headed over to the Etihad. Sure enough hundreds of City fans descended on their ground to celebrate the title victory. One of them, pictured here, played up beautifully for the cameras, holding a can of lager and a flare in one hand, while smoking a rollup in the other. England v New Zealand, first Test, Lord’s – 5 June 840mm lens 1/1600 f5.6 ISO 800 There are times in Test cricket that are, let us just say, not quite as interesting as others. The third day of the first Test had been wiped out by rain, and the match was meandering towards a draw on the fourth afternoon. My mind started to wander. I had noticed, unusually for Lord’s, that quite a few pigeons had been pecking away at the square. This sort of bird activity I have always associated with the Oval. Anyway, I thought I would try to create a picture with them. Slowly a number started to congregate on a patch not far from the wicket being used. Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, played a shot then shouted for a run. The pigeons took off in unison, all apart from one, who stubbornly stayed put. England v New Zealand, second Test, Edgbaston – 10 June 115mm lens 1/1250 f7.1 ISO 800 When the England players came out at Lord’s for the national anthems before the first Test in early June, they all wore black T-shirts with slogans on the back. It was a moment, designed by the ECB, as a show of unity with people of all backgrounds. These slogans mentioned ageism, ableism, transphobia, homophobia and religious intolerance. I decided for the second Test in Edgbaston to try to show the players wearing these T-shirts together so I went up to the TV gantry to shoot down on to the backs of the England team. It was only after taking the picture that I realised something was missing – why no mention of racism on any of the shirts? Then, just a few months later, the story of Azeem Rafiq and his treatment at Yorkshire made the headlines and I could not help but think back to this picture. England v Germany, Euro 2020 last 16, Wembley – 29 June 23mm lens 1/1600 f4.5 ISO 2000 Raheem Sterling scores the first goal for England against Germany in their knockout match at the Euros. It may have been less than half-full but I cannot recall Wembley ever sounding louder than at that moment. For all the matches at Wembley during the Euros, only 16 photographers were allowed pitchside due to Covid regulations and I felt very privileged to be there. However, rules that had prevented us from putting remote cameras right next to the net had been relaxed. It was great to be back shooting pictures such as this, after a Premier League season where these sort of cameras had been banished to behind the advertising boards. Emma Raducanu, women’s singles fourth round, Wimbledon – 5 July 400mm lens 1/1600 f3.5 ISO 4000 I wish I had been there in New York when Emma shocked the sporting world by winning the US Open. This image, taken at Wimbledon in July, is not a nice picture and I did not like taking it but sometimes you have to photograph what is the story of the day. The reason I am including it in this selection is to show what an amazing transformation Raducanu had in just a few months. From breathing problems and having to withdraw from her last-16 match at Wimbledon to winning the US Open as a qualifier without losing a set – remarkable. Euro 2020 final, Wembley – 11 July 400mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 4000 The England manager, Gareth Southgate, consoles Bukayo Saka after missing the final penalty in the shootout, handing Italy the Euros title. When I look back at this picture now it stirs up so many feelings, mainly of sadness, but also of pride and hope for the future. When I am actually at a game like this, I deliberately try to divorce myself from too much emotion. This is easier said than done but somehow putting a camera in front of my face helps keep my equilibrium and gets me to focus on what needs to be done. In this case it was to show the heartbreak for England as they missed out on winning a first title in 55 years. Once I saw Saka miss and then wander back towards the centre circle I stayed focused on him, ignoring the Italian celebrations. The 19-year-old buckled into the arms of his manager, burying his head deep into Southgate’s shoulder. For one split moment their legs matched each other, united in their despair. The symbolism struck me immediately. Southgate, having missed a decisive penalty for England at Wembley in the 1996 Euros, knew exactly the anguish Saka was going through. He seemed to wrap his arms round the player in a protective manner knowing exactly the sort of abuse that was heading the young player’s way. Collin Morikawa, Royal St George’s, Sandwich – 17 July 61mm lens 1/2000 f22 ISO 320 It had been 10 years since I had photographed The Open. This picture was one I definitely could not have taken in 2011. Thanks to my current cameras having a silent function, I can now take pictures during the swing whereas a decade ago, without a silent shutter, that was forbidden. Now I can be up close to the player, just a few feet away in this case, and fire the shutter at any time. Royal St George’s was quite hard work for pictures this year, but one thing was in the photographer’s favour – the beautifully sunny weather. As Sandwich is the southernmost venue on the Open roster it also meant the sun set earlier than those courses in Scotland or northern England. This enabled me to get pictures such as this, as Morikawa, on his way to winning the title, teed off at the 18th on Saturday evening with the low sun sat perfectly behind him. With my shutter firing throughout his swing I manage to capture the beautiful bend of the club just before he hit the ball. England v India, The Oval – 5 September 41mm lens 1/2500 f 5.6 ISO 400 The classic view of this ground for photographers has always been across the pitch to the gas holders behind but, due to building work both inside and outside The Oval, that is no longer possible. However a very different view has now opened up, one from high on top the new M.A.R. Galadari stand. It is spectacular up there, a bird’s eye view of the pitch with the cluster of skyscrapers in the Vauxhall development shooting upwards. This image shows a small boy in Indian team kit as he peers over a wall, intent on watching every little moment of play, seemingly oblivious to the backdrop. Cristiano Ronaldo scores, Old Trafford – 11 September 168mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 800 Manchester United’s home game against Newcastle in September was about one man. T-shirts for sale outside the ground proclaimed this match as “The Second Coming of CR7”. It seemed a foregone conclusion that once Freddie Woodman, the Newcastle keeper, had spilled a shot just before half-time, you-know-who would be there to pounce on the rebound. One swing of the golden-studded boot and, 12 years after scoring his previous goal for Manchester United at Old Trafford, Cristiano Ronaldo had scored again. Anthony Joshua’s ring walk at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – 25 September 155mm lens 1/500 f2.8 ISO 6400 As he walked out of the tunnel to defend his world heavyweight titles against Oleksandr Usyk, Joshua turned around to adoring fans and tapped his glove on his heart. Looking uncannily like Muhammad Ali in his pristine white gown, the British boxer seemed confident and relaxed, soaking up adulation from the phone-wafting spectators. They were all in for a very uncomfortable night as Usyk defeated a lacklustre Joshua. Even though there is hardly any light where this photo is taken, what is there is very soft, a perfect balance from tunnel, television and phone. London Marathon – 3 October 300mm lens 1/640th f2.8 ISO 6400 This marathon has always been one of my favourite events to cover. After last year’s elite-only race, it was great to see 40,000 runners on the capital’s streets again. Instead of going to the finish or one of the famous landmarks, I decided to do something a little different, going to a location that is very unglamorous but notorious for being incredibly hard. Just about at the 24-mile marker, where the dreaded “wall” often kicks in, are a series of tunnels under railway stations. These can produce dramatic variations in light and in this picture, of the leaders in the elite men’s race, I exposed for the dark conditions just as the runners entered the tunnel. Normally photographers like a dark background to show off the action but in this case it’s the opposite. Outside the tunnel went white, producing this very graphic and unusual athletics image. New York Jets v Atlanta Falcons, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – 10 October 24mm lens 1/3200 f7.1 ISO 1000 For the first time in two years, the NFL was back in London as the Falcons hosted the Jets. One aspect of the sport I like, and which often makes good pictures, is the way the home team are announced and they run out to a big fanfare, often through fireworks. I positioned myself in the corner from where the Falcons players would emerge. The obligatory dry ice started to pump all around me (quite a weird feeling) and then just before the big moment, the sun popped out from behind a cloud. Rather than shooting with the players running towards me, I spun round and shot them backlit, dashing away from me through the swirling smoke. Frankie Dettori, Newmarket – 11 October 50mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 400 In early October the writer Simon Hattenstone and I went to Frankie Dettori’s house near Newmarket to do an interview that was timed for the release of his new book, Leap of Faith. I have photographed Dettori winning countless big races over the years and to see his trademark flying dismount off the most powerful of horses has always been a tremendous thrill. Before the shoot I asked Dettori to change into riding gear, so fair play to him for putting on the colours he wore to such great success on his favourite horse, Enable. After doing a few formal portraits just to warm him up, I steered him round to a paddock where I knew he had a couple of miniature donkeys called Pip and Plum. Well it had to be done. I asked him to pop on to Plum’s back and he obliged. Plum wasn’t having any of it and off Frankie came, stumbling as he exited. We all cracked up with laughter. From now on I don’t think I will ever watch his flying dismount the same way again. Newcastle fans v Spurs, St James’ Park – 17 October 35mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 This was a pretty momentous day for Newcastle as they played their first game under their new Saudi owners. St James’ Park was buzzing with fans’ hope and anticipation. I was positioned in front of the Gallowgate End, Newcastle’s traditional home end, where almost everyone wears black and white. For the first few minutes of the game, and as the ball was at the other end of the pitch, I turned round and focused on a fan in the front row, decked out in a headscarf. Then Newcastle scored. The place erupted, a sense that all those years of despair had been left behind and here was a different Newcastle. Spurs went on to win the game 3-2. Marcus Smith, England v South Africa, Twickenham – 20 November 400mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 4000 As the final whistle blew just moments after he had kicked a last ditch penalty, England’s new rugby union superstar celebrated beating the world champion Springboks. Marcus Smith was the figurehead for a much-changed England team this autumn. They emerged from a desperately poor Six Nations campaign earlier in the year to beat Tonga, Australia and South Africa in consecutive weeks. I am looking forward to seeing a lot more of Smith in the coming years. Not just for his inspired play but also because his hair flying everywhere makes for great pictures. Twickenham is a great place for shooting rugby, especially under lights. The backgrounds go nicely dark and because the crowd is so far back, the players stand out even more. Sir Geoff Hurst, Cheltenham – 2 December 85mm lens 1/1600 f1.8 ISO 400 In early December I went to Cheltenham to shoot a portrait of the England football legend and the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final. It was Hurst’s 80th birthday just a few days later and Donald McRae had conducted a poignant interview with him that had revealed some of the tragedies and hard times he had suffered alongside his many achievements. It turned out to be a rather bizarre photo session in a local park near Hurst’s home. The first thing he said to me, after seeing my various bags of kit, was “You going on holiday? This is just a quick snap isn’t it.” He quickly warmed up after chatting about how he did Joe Wicks’ workouts in this very park. I took him past the swings and on to a spot near a duck pond, an area I thought would be a bit quieter. It was not. A constant stream of dog walkers passed by quizzically looking at us. Eventually one stopped and asked Hurst: “You seen George and the kids today?” He turned to her and replied: “No. He may have flown over with them to the other pond.” Our national hero then proceeded to have a chat with this woman about the whereabouts of the park’s resident swan and its cygnets. I am sure she had absolutely no idea who he was. Hurst also told me that a few days earlier another woman came up to him and said: “I know who you are. You’re Glenn Hoddle,” to which Geoff said “Yes I am” and walked off. World Masters Cyclo-Cross Championships, Ipswich – 3 December 24mm lens 1/1250 f2.8 ISO 4000 What makes someone in their seventies travel right across the world in the middle of a pandemic to race their bike through mud and freezing rain? When I saw the 2021 UCI World Masters Cyclo-Cross Championships were being held in East Anglia, I could not resist having a look. The conditions were pretty grim, very dark and overcast, but it could have been a lot worse. It has been many years since I photographed cyclo-cross and I had forgotten what a brilliant but tough sport it is. I came away with the utmost respect for all the competitors even if I thought they were slightly mad. West Ham’s winner against Chelsea, London Stadium – 4 December 200mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 2000 It was late in this hotly contested London derby, the two teams level at 2-2, when the West Ham left-back Arthur Masuaku swung an intended cross into the Chelsea penalty box. Somehow the mishit swerved in the air, deceiving the goalkeeper Édouard Mendy, who dived in despair. The ball flew into the top corner of the net. West Ham had won and their push to the top four of the Premier League had continued."

          "headline": "Will Australian university campuses ever be the same again post-pandemic?",
          "bodyText": "After two years of online learning, it wasn’t only students who were looking forward to farewelling “Zoom university”, many staff were also hopeful of a return to campus and a bit of normality in 2022. “Being surrounded by students who are passionate about this thing that you’re passionate about as well is energising,” Tito Ambyo, a journalism lecturer at RMIT, says. “And now, especially if you’re in a classroom where students don’t turn on their video cameras, it’s tiring.” But what counts as “normal” on university campuses has changed during the pandemic – and a return to campus doesn’t necessarily spell relief for teaching staff. As international students began arriving in Australia in December for the first time since closed borders locked them out of the country in March 2020, many faculty members were busily planning the adoption of hybrid teaching models next year, with both in-person and online learning. The National Tertiary Education Union says the proliferation of dual learning is leading to the exploitation of university staff, who aren’t being adequately compensated for the extra time and effort they are putting in to cater to both in-person and online students. The union’s president, Dr Alison Barnes, says a union survey showed the pivot to online learning has led to significantly increased workloads and an increase in unpaid hours. That, combined with a lack of support from universities, has affected the work-life balance of teaching staff as well as their ability to disengage during non-work hours. “Members have reported increased stress and anxiety, and many have suffered from workload burnout,” Barnes says. Socialising is a workplace skill Staff have other concerns too. Ambyo partially attributes his online teaching fatigue to the amount of extra time he spends looking at screens, but he also worries about how to protect the intellectual rights of teaching materials shared online amid increasing casualisation and job cuts. “[The university] basically can kick you out and use your online teaching materials,” he says. “I think there’s also that fear of what that mean[s] for the future of our careers.” Elizabeth Brogan, a nursing lecturer at University of Technology Sydney says online teaching also makes it difficult for relationships to develop between students, which could in turn prevent them from acquiring the skills they should gain from their time at university. “[Students] don’t build those peer-to-peer relationships where they can talk to their friends in the classroom,” says Brogan, adding that interpersonal communication skills are part of the nursing undergraduate curriculum. “Nursing is a very social workforce,” she says. Brogan is also concerned that not all students have good internet connections, which can create accessibility issues. There are benefits to online teaching too. Ambyo has found it better for engaging introverted students. And he says digital technology can enrich teaching content. Diarmuid Cooney-O’Donoghue, a tutor in Asia-related subjects, agrees, saying it’s more convenient for students to access materials and notes, while he can use tools like Zoom breakout rooms to guide students in discussions. A PhD candidate researching academic freedom and the Chinese Communist party’s influence on Australian campuses, Cooney-O’Donghue says online tutorials can also encourage international students to join discussions on sensitive topics. “When you’re discussing human rights in China or something like that, if it’s in person, there’s no way to hide,” he says. “But if it’s online, you can blank out who that person is, and there are advantages for those students to be able to discuss something without having their identity revealed.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Nevertheless, Cooney-O’Donghue doesn’t think the benefits of online teaching outweigh what is lost from in-person interactions. “I just think it’s much harder to give good feedback to students when they are not in class,” Cooney-O’Donghue says. “You don’t know who they are, and often students don’t engage as much.” Jan Sam, a Melbourne resident and psychology student has found online learning a double-edged sword. Sam, a 23-year-old Malaysian international student living with disability, found the lockdown significantly increased their difficulty in walking. In March, when in-person tutorials were available in their subjects, Sam chose to continue studying online as they worried about their safety when traveling to campus. But online learning created a new accessibility issue for Sam, who has auditory processing disorder: they couldn’t follow what lecturers were saying on pre-recorded lectures without closed captions, and couldn’t immediately understood tutors’ instructions on Zoom. Sam hopes online learning will still be an option as universities embrace the new Covid normal, albeit with some improvements. “If online learning is continued, there should be closed captions. There should be subtitles so that students can read what the tutor and the lecturers are saying.” If it’s all online, why go to a local uni? Education experts say regardless of online or in-person classes, higher education teaching should be tailored to the needs of students. Andrew Norton, a professor in the practice of higher education policy at ANU, analysed results of the Student Experience Survey, a federal government initiative. It shows “only fairly small declines” in satisfaction with questions related to teaching during Covid-19, he says. “I think part of the problem is online teaching that is carefully planned and has all the right technology is actually pretty good,” Norton says. “But what a lot of students experienced last year – probably to a lesser extent this year – was courses that were supposed to be delivered on campus for a couple of weeks were delivered online instead.” Norton says reductions in government funding for higher education may encourage universities to offer bigger classes, which could push them to turn to online teaching to reduce costs. Glenn C Savage, an associate professor of education policy at the University of Western Australia, says universities need to offer more support for teaching staff to develop online teaching skills. “I think universities are becoming much more aware that there’s online learning, and then there’s good online learning, and they’re very different things,” says Savage. As they adopt a hybrid of online lectures and in-person tutorials, Savage says universities risk losing students. “If things move too much online, and students lose that connection to the materials, space of the university campus and so on, I think students will start thinking, ‘Why do I go to my local university when I can go to another university?” The chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, says before the pandemic, Australian universities were already providing both face-to-face and online courses. “That blend of a rich range of options will continue, with high-quality teaching and exceptional student experience very much at the centre of any decision.” • This story was amended on 31 December 2021 to remove a reference to Curtin University scrapping in-person lectures entirely. It has not done so."

          "headline": "‘Carbon bomb’: Queensland reveals big jump in land clearing",
          "bodyText": "Queensland landholders are clearing the equivalent of about 1,000 MCGs a day, including endangered ecological regions, according to state government data that raises new doubts about the accuracy of Australia’s carbon emissions claims. The Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (Slats) for 2018-19 showed landholders cleared 680,688 hectares of woody vegetation, or about 0.7% of Queensland’s total. • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Improved accuracy of remote sensing make precise comparisons with earlier years difficult. The government had said the 2017-18 clearing rate was 392,000 hectares. About 84% of 2018-19 land clearing destroyed vegetation that was at least 15 years old, the new report said. The great bulk of the deforestation, or 88%, involved land with less than 50% tree cover. The report said 3% was in ecosystems “identified as of concern”, while less than 1% of the clearing involved endangered ecological communities. Stuart Blanch, a WWF Australia conservation scientist, said the figures were “a real shocker”, deliberately released ahead of New Year’s Eve to stir up the least attention. The data also suggests Australia’s carbon emissions are worse than reported, he said. “It’s a carbon bomb for the Queensland and federal governments because it shows we are vastly underestimating carbon emissions from land clearing,” Blanch said. “That’s going to really jeopardise our net zero commitments and any 2030 abatement targets. “We’re a massive land-clearing nation. Queensland has got the vast majority of it, and the vast majority of that is for beef.” Guardian Australia sought comment from the Palaszczuk and Morrison governments. In its 2021 projections update, the federal government predicted Australia’s carbon emissions in 2030 would be 30% below 2005 levels, beating the 26-28% reduction pledged at the 2015 Paris climate summit. That estimate, though, included recent years when the land sector was deemed to have absorbed more carbon dioxide than it released. In 2019, for instance, the sector contributed a net negative 25m tonnes of CO2 equivalent, that report said. Blanch, though, said Queensland’s new dataset, which assessed changes in vegetation down to 10 sq metre satellite imagery, were three times more accurate than that used to compile the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory figures. In 2018, for instance, the federal government estimated 2018 national land clearing to be just under 370,000 hectares, well shy of the 680,000-plus hectares reported by Queensland alone in 2018-19. As Guardian Australia reported last month, an analysis by Queensland researcher Martin Taylor showed earlier technology used to compile Slats was already detecting large areas of land clearing that was not picked up by the federal survey. Glenn Walker, a senior campaigner for Greenpeace, said the Slats data was “extraordinary, horrifying figures” that showed Australia remained one of the world’s fastest deforesting nations. “Behind these figures are millions of killed and maimed native animals like koalas and huge amounts of carbon emissions from burning and rotting trees,” Walker said. “Clearly the current laws aren’t working and the beef sector isn’t taking this issue seriously. This should be a huge wake-up call to act fast before we lose more precious bushland and wildlife.” The new data also indicate changes by Queensland Labor to tighten land-clearing regulations eased by the former Liberal National government under Campbell Newman were failing, Blanch said. Areas deemed to be so-called “category X” that remain excluded from the 1999 Vegetation Management Act accounted for just over 70% of the total cleared area, the government said. Costly efforts to reduce the amount of silt washing into the Great Barrier Reef region also appear to be undermined by the land clearing. About one-third of the 2018-19 deforestation, or 217,419 hectares, occurred in catchments flowing into the reef region. About 85% of that clearing remains exempt from the law changes introduced by Labor in 2018 as category X, Blanch said. The report also showed remnant clearing increased by 58% in the important Brigalow Belt in 2018-19 from the previous year to 35,550 hectares. “The Brigalow Belt supports the highest bird diversity of any bioregion in Australia and is home to at least three species of reptiles that do not occur anywhere else in the world,” Blanch said. “So the spike in clearing here is particularly heartbreaking. “It’s very disappointing the Queensland government sat on this data. They knew it was bad news and they buried it.” The deputy premier, Steven Miles, said on Thursday a group of scientific experts would be assembled in early 2022 to better understand the study results and find ways to help avoid clearing or whether other measures were needed."

          "bodyText": "Industry groups have denied pressuring federal and state authorities to renege on a commitment to provide free rapid antigen tests to Australians. This is despite Scott Morrison’s claims the decision to allow “private market” operators to provide the kits was the result of concern from suppliers. Following Thursday’s national cabinet meeting, the prime minister announced that, although the New South Wales and Victorian governments had committed to provide free RAT tests to the community, they would now only be made available to certain sectors of the community, such as those in aged care. “But for all other casual uses – you would just like to get a test or something like that – well, that is what the private market is for,” Morrison said. During his press conference Morrison suggested the decision not to provide them to the wider community free of charge was as a result of “concern” from suppliers that the tests would be made free. “[W]e believe as a result of making this change, and being very clear about who is being provided with a public test and who is not, all the private industry who gave us that advice this week, they can go now, they can book their supplies, they can get them on the shelves and not have any concern that somehow a new policy will come in and tests will be handed out to anyone who wants one,” he said. “It was agreed today that will not be the policy in Australia. Rapid antigen tests will be provided publicly at those testing centres for those who require one according to the rules I have set down and have been taken out of national cabinet today.” But the head of the peak body for manufacturers and suppliers of rapid tests, told Guardian Australia the industry did not have a position on whether they should be free or not, saying all providers had asked for was certainty about a “clear role” for the products during Australia’s pandemic response. “It doesn’t matter to us whether they’re free, subsidised or other some other thing,” said Dean Whiting, the chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, a group which represents about 70% of rapid antigen testing suppliers in the country. “What we as an industry have been more concerned about is having a clear role for rapid testing in managing infections, in keeping the economy going and in keeping people safe. “In a sense I don’t think we really care if they are free or not in terms of supply of the tests, as long as there is a clear position from governments on the role of the tests. The industry doesn’t have a position because we sell to the government for market price and we don’t care if they are free or not. “I am on the record saying that if they were free it would improve access and equity in testing and access to tests. But that isn’t a point about market supply.” Similarly, the president of the Pharmacy Guild, Trent Twomey, said his group had not lobbied the government on the issue. “That’s not a conversation he had with us,” he said. Twomey said access to RATs “shouldn’t depend on whether or not I’ve got a disposable income and I can afford to buy them”. “So our representation to them [the federal government] has always been that there needs to be a hybrid system, because it may only be $10 or $15 a test and yes, that may be a lot cheaper than a PCR test,” he said. “But $10 or $15 per person per household twice in a seven-day period is still not affordable for some low-income earners.” Guardian Australia contacted both major supermarket providers, Woolworths and Coles, to ask whether those companies had urged the government not to make the tests free. Coles declined to comment, but in a statement Woolworths denied seeking to influence the government’s distribution of the tests. “How governments distribute the rapid antigen tests is a matter for them and we have not sought to influence those decisions,” a spokesman for the grocery giant said. Instead, a source with knowledge of the talks between industry and governments said supermarkets did not lobby for the position. Instead, it was proposed by state and federal governments, which did not want to pay for the supply required to make the tests free for all, and agreed to by both supermarkets and pharmacies. States have been scrambling to make bulk orders of rapid antigen tests in a bid to ease pressure on overwhelmed PCR testing clinics, with both NSW and Victoria confirming large orders of the RATs in recent days. In NSW, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, said as recently as Wednesday that the state government had bought a total of 50m rapid tests to be distributed for free from the end of January. But on Thursday Morrison said all states had agreed to distribute them in a more targeted way. He told media that certain industries such as health and education would be provided with the tests, as well as people who had been identified as close contacts of positive cases. “In addition to that, we’re looking at vulnerable groups of people, particularly Indigenous populations, especially in remote areas, and are looking at how we will do this in schools, so they will be a role for public provision in these circumstances,” he said. Despite that, though, an expression-of-interest form for businesses circulated by the NSW government suggests it is still considering reimbursing businesses for test kits if they are provided free to residents. “To ease the pressure on Covid-19 testing clinics, we are exploring options to provide all residents with free rapid antigen self-testing kits,” the form states. “We are taking expressions of interest from businesses that would like to be involved in the rollout of these tests. These tests must be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). We may ask successful suppliers to source, deliver and/or provide these tests free of charge to the residents of NSW. We will cover the costs to you.” In its statement, Woolworths said it had been in discussions with the NSW government over the distribution of the tests. “We want to play a constructive role in the supply of rapid antigen testing alongside governments,” a spokesman said. “We’ve already offered to support the NSW government with its rapid antigen rollout plans and would be happy to do so for other states and territories if it’s helpful.” The decision not to widely supply rapid antigen tests was criticised by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with president Michele O’Neil telling the Guardian that “nobody should be excluded from accessing rapid antigen tests because of their income or their postcode”. “Workers have been calling on the prime minister to provide greater support on rapid antigen testing, but today he has thrown them to the wolves,” she said. “Scott Morrison is putting the interests of private business above public health by refusing to make rapid antigen tests free and widely available.”"

          "headline": "Navy to dismantle sunken cargo ship on Thames holding unstable explosives",
          "bodyText": "An operation to remove the masts from a sunken cargo ship in the River Thames, containing 1,400 tonnes of unstable explosives onboard, will involve Royal Navy specialists. It is believed that if the unexploded ordnance on the SS Richard Montgomery were triggered it could lead to the nearby oil and gas facilities in Sheerness being damaged, the Daily Telegraph reports. A Ministry of Defence report said an explosion “would throw a 300 metre-wide column of water and debris nearly 3,000 metres into the air and generate a wave 5 metres high”. The ship has remained a hazard in the shipping waters around Sheerness since it sank on 20 August 1944. Its cargo of explosives in the forward holds has not been unloaded. Masts from the wreck of the SS Richard Montgomery, beached in the sands below, have been pictured poking above the water. A no-entry exclusion zone extends around the wreck and a local port owner is responsible for marking it with warning notices attached to the masts. Protective buoys circle the ship. The MoD was supporting the Department for Transport, which in turn has a contractor that will undertake the mast removal process over a two-month period. MoD-assured experts were due to assess the best way of surveying the area, identify any objects of interest, decide which of those objects need further investigation, and ensure that the mast removal work can be undertaken as safely as possible. Two Royal Navy specialists had been tasked with providing specialist survey and identification advice and expertise. A recent Department for Transport survey found the ship’s three masts were deteriorating and in a poor state. The MoD had warned that the unexploded ordnance could detonate if any of the ship’s masts collapsed. Previously the ministry had offered to pay £5m to any company that was able to safely remove the masts. Peel Ports, which operates Sheerness docks, is responsible for marking and guarding the wreck. The seabed was surveyed in October to check for spilled explosives before the dismantling of the masts begins. An MoD document reportedly seen by the Telegraph said that in the worst case the masts collapse or removal operation could cause “an explosion impacting the local area including the nearby oil and gas facilities in Sheerness leading to mass damage and potential loss of life”. A spokesperson for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the risk of a major explosion was “remote”. Built in Jacksonville, Florida in 1943, the Richard Montgomery was originally used to take vital supplies to Europe and it sailed across the Atlantic in convoy. The ship went aground on a sandbank after the captain was ordered to anchor off the Great Nore. The water was too shallow and the ship got stuck as the tide fell. Attempts to unload the vessel were abandoned after stevedores and navy divers faced treacherous weather conditions and greater danger as the ship settled. After years of sonar surveillance, divers were again employed on site during a 2003 survey which involved an ultrasonic hull thickness analysis. An up-to-date assessment of the level of seabed support of the wreck was obtained and the status of a large crack in one of the main holds was obtained. In 2013, a hull thickness survey was repeated. This story was amended on 30 December 2021. An earlier version described the cargo vessel SS Richard Montgomery as a warship."

          "headline": "How the pandemic transformed the world of work in 2021",
          "bodyText": "Of all the predictions on your 2021 bingo card, who had employees being fined for going into the office? Workers in Wales now face that threat since the tightening of Covid regulations amid the spread of the Omicron variant, with a possible £60 penalty for failing to work from home. That is just one of many examples of how the pandemic has transformed the world of work this year – and perhaps for ever – for city centre employers, their staff and the service industry that depends on them for trade. Out of office Most white-collar workers are ending 2021 back where they began – hunched over laptops on kitchen tables, in spare rooms or even garden sheds. Yet this deja vu obscures a big change: it has been demonstrated to many employers that staff can do productive work from home, a hotel room or even a poolside lounger in another country, and don’t necessarily need to be in a city centre office. As lockdown restrictions eased during the spring, many companies started to trial a hybrid model, permitting staff to split their time between the office and another location. Across a range of sectors, many of the UK’s largest office occupiers have shifted to this middle-way working pattern, from the big four accountancy firms to major tech companies. Deloitte’s 20,000 UK employees were told in June they could decide “when, where and how they work” following the success of remote working during Covid. Very few large corporates now expect staff to return to their desks for five days a week, with the exception of some major investment banks, who have been the loudest proponents of the return-to-office mantra. The end of the space race Remote working in 2021 also offered companies a chance to downsize their offices and slash their rent bills. Capita, one of the major providers of outsourced services to the UK government, announced in the spring it would close more of its offices to make bigger cost savings. Sir Martin Sorrell’s advertising and marketing firm, S4 Capital, told investors in the summer it had “terminated a number of office leases”, adding it was developing its hybrid office model to suit its workers, who it described as “digital natives”. Meanwhile NatWest said it expects just 13% of its 64,000 staff to work full time in its offices in future. A third of the bank’s employees will be allowed to live and work anywhere in the UK and will only have to attend a NatWest building twice a month. Winners and losers Working parents, people with caring responsibilities, and some disabled workers are among those who have welcomed the widespread shift to flexible working, which they have long demanded. However, employment experts warn that, without proper monitoring, the switch could worsen workplace gender inequality. Traditionally, more women have requested flexible working than men, and analysts caution that employers will have to ensure that those who attend the office less frequently do not miss out on opportunities for promotion. A fifth (22%) of workers worry home working could affect their promotion prospects, according to a recent survey for stockbroker AJ Bell. The poll also found the burden of childcare among home workers still falls disproportionately on mothers, with more than a third (36%) of women with children under 16 reporting they do the lion’s share of childcare during work hours, compared with 19% of men. There is also concern about the effect on pay. Evie, an executive assistant from Essex who did not want to give her surname, has enjoyed working from home, but said she was being offered lower salaries by prospective employers than before the pandemic. “It’s been said to me in an interview [the salary was lower] because I’d be working from home and wouldn’t have to commute,” she said. “It’s definitely a game a few employers are playing. They’ll get you to sign the contract, but when restrictions change and we go back to the office, I know they won’t put the money up.” The working week Once the slow and steady return to the office began in the spring, it became clear that workers were ditching their commute on Mondays and Fridays. In a national trend, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday became the busiest days of the week for office visits, according to regular analysis during 2021 by real estate consultancy Remit Consulting. “The pattern so far during the pandemic has been for Thursdays to be as busy as Wednesdays, and sometimes busier,” said Lorna Landells of Remit Consulting, adding that Friday was slipping behind as an office day. If this change becomes permanent, it will have lasting implications for transport companies and the city-centre service businesses – from sandwich shops and coffee bars to hairdressers and dry-cleaners – who depend on passing trade. Some companies and some countries – including the governments of Spain and Scotland – are considering going further, and taking a fresh look at four-day week through pilot schemes. Durham-based online bank Atom is one of the few employers which has taken the leap. It moved all of its 400 staff to a four-day week, with no change in salary, at the start of November. The company said its operations and customer service have not been impacted by the change, although it had seen a 500% surge in job applications. “Our adoption of a four-day working week has been a huge success, and we are proud of how well our employees have adapted,” said Anne-Marie Lister, Atom’s chief people officer. “We firmly believe that a four-day week is the future of work for many.” Staff walkout For some, the future of work means handing in their notice. In what has been termed “the great resignation”, more than a quarter of workers reported they were actively planning to change jobs in the coming months. Having stayed in posts where they were unhappy during the height of the pandemic, employees have begun to look for new roles, according to a survey of 6,000 workers by the recruitment firm Randstad UK. Others have been spurred on to look for a new employer by high levels of job vacancies and higher pay offers from those desperate to recruit. For now, power looks to be in the hands of employees – not their employers – and they know what they want: more flexibility about where and when they work. Many will benefit from a better work-life balance, but the repercussions for city centres and society will be felt for some time to come."

          "bodyText": "And with that, we are going to end Thursday’s blog. Before we go, let’s recap the big stories from today: NSW recorded 12,226 new Covid cases and one death, Victoria 5,137 cases and 13 deaths, Tasmania 92 cases, Queensland 2,222, the ACT 253, South Australia 1,374, the Northern Territory 37 and Western Australia one. The national total was 21,343 new cases. A child under two who was Covid-positive died in South Australia. Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty after sex-trafficking trial in New York. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told people to “avoid the mosh pit” this New Year’s Eve amid rising cases. The independent expert group OzSage released a set of Covid policy recommendations, saying it was “deeply concerned” by the spike in case numbers. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, took aim at the prime minister, Scott Morrison, over the shortage of rapid antigen tests. Old Parliament House was set alight by protests linked to “sovereign citizen” groups. The prime minister said Omicron was a “game changer” after national cabinet met. National cabinet agreed on a new definition of “close contact” and said Covid testing centres would provide rapid antigen tests. The PM also said free rapid antigen tests will only be provided for those who meet “close contact” criteria. More than 50% of eligible people have had their booster shot. Tasmania announced it would drop PCR tests for interstate arrivals. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said WA agreed “in principle” to national cabinet’s new definition of close contact. Another act pulled out of Sydney festival over Israeli embassy sponsorship. And that is it! We will see you tomorrow for the last blog on the last day of the year. And we have a statement from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about the national cabinet meeting. Here are some lines from it: Omicron case numbers continue to increase in Australia and globally. Omicron continues to show greater infectivity than the Delta variant, but with less severity. Prof Kelly noted that a recent study from South Africa has confirmed a 73% reduction in severity of disease with Omicron compared with Delta. Total active cases in Australia have reached over 110,000 cases. However, hospitalisation, ICU and ventilation case numbers remain low and within anticipated capacity. There were 1,481 cases in hospital, 122 cases in ICU with 51 of those requiring ventilation. These numbers are remaining relatively constant. National cabinet has agreed to Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) advice to reset TTIQ in the context of high case numbers and the Omicron variant, so that Australians can continue to live with Covid-19. The revised approach is complementary to the importance of vaccinations including boosters and existing public health and social measures. Specifically, national cabinet agreed to revised definitions for who is a close contact, how they are isolated and testing arrangements. The Australian Medical Association has released a statement following the national cabinet decision to adopt a new definition of who is a close contact. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said narrowing the definition to household contacts will lock in very high transmission rates and accelerate the outbreak of Omicron. “We will miss so many more cases with this new, more narrow definition of a close contact,” Khorshid said. “Anyone catching Omicron in a restaurant or pub for example and who are asymptomatic won’t know they’re infected and could pass the virus on to more vulnerable people. “The change will help to preserve testing capacity and should limit the number of furloughed health workers, but it will come at the cost of accelerating the outbreak.” Khorshid said hospitalisations would rise in the coming weeks because of the high case numbers. The AMA called for the release of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee’s (AHPPC) advice and modelling that supports the national cabinet decision. “Without the release of AHPPC’s advice, it is very difficult for us to share the prime minister’s confidence that this move will assist in keeping Australians safe and healthy.” Cricket referee David Boon will be out of action for the Sydney Test after testing positive for Covid. In a statement, Cricket Australia announced Boon was in hotel quarantine: The ICC match referee for the Vodafone men’s Ashes series, David Boon, has tested positive to Covid-19 following a PCR test,” the statement read. Steve Bernard, a member of the International Panel of ICC Referees and based in NSW, will take over as match referee for the fourth Ashes Test match, starting on January 5 at the SCG. It is anticipated that David Boon will return to the role for the fifth Test in Hobart, starting on January 14. He is asymptomatic and fully vaccinated, including having a booster. Boon will remain in Melbourne and in line with Victorian state government health guidelines will continue quarantining for 10 days. Opera Australia’s much-loved New Year’s Eve performance of La Bohème is cancelled due to a Covid outbreak. In a statement, CEO Fiona Allan said: Enormous thanks to everyone at the company who have worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to get us back on stage but I don’t think any of us could have foreseen just how fast Omicron would spread and the effects it would have on the industry. As disappointing as this news is, both for our performers and for our audiences who we know were very much looking forward to attending NYE, we must now turn our full attention to opening the summer season on Tuesday 4 January. Opera Australia is contacting New Year’s Eve ticket holders, who have paid upwards of $269 a seat, to offer credit vouchers and full refunds. On Wednesday, Guardian Australia learned there were more than 20 positive Covid cases at Opera Australia across the performing company. Opera Australia is scheduled to present full seasons of La Bohème, Turandot, Otello, The Marriage of Figaro and La Juive from 4 January-26 March. Here’s yesterday’s story: More sporting fixtures have fallen victim to the surge in Covid infections, the latest being Thursday’s Big Bash League meeting of the Perth Scorchers and the Melbourne Stars in Melbourne, because of a positive case in the Stars camp. Saturday’s A-League Men’s game between Western Sydney Wanderers and Western United has also been called off, as has the A-League Women’s match between Melbourne City and Newcastle Jets, scheduled for Sunday. The A-Leagues said in a statement an unspecified number of City players had tested positive but were not feeling unwell, while the cases causing the men’s postponement were in the Western United squad. Despite a rash of cancellations the governing body continues to insist the season will continue. When’s a good time to release some bad data... how about the eve of New Year’s Eve? So today, the Queensland government has published the delayed Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) that covers land clearing for the 2018-19 year. During those 12 months, landholders cleared 680,688 hectares. It’s a bit tricky to compare with previous years – such as the 392,000 hectares reported cleared in 2017-18 – as the remote technology has been improved. Still, it appears that Queensland is clearing a lot of land. The 2018-19 tally amounts to about 3,800 times the size of Melbourne’s CBD, or more than 2,400 times Sydney’s. “This report is a carbon bomb that threatens to blow up the commitments to net zero emissions by 2050 made by the Queensland and Australian governments,” Dr Stuart Blanch, WWF-Australia conservation scientist, said in a statement. “It shows clearing has likely been significantly under-reported in previous reports. The latest SLATS data was compiled using satellite images that are three times more accurate than the previous imagery and cover much more of the state. The data provides a new national best-practice standard that all governments and industry should adopt,” Blanch said. To give the amount some context, Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory estimated landclearing in the 2018 calendar year was about 370,000 hectares nationwide. In that year, the commonwealth government also claimed the land sector was a net sink in the order of more than 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide. As Guardian Australia reported a couple of months ago, there is good reason to think Australia’s statistics underestimate the amount of landclearing that is going on. Today’s figures from Queensland are only going to add to those concerns. Another act has withdrawn from the 2022 Sydney festival in protest against Israeli embassy sponsorship. Today the intercultural dance company Marrugeku pulled its performance of Jurrungu Ngan-ga [Straight Talk] out of the festival program. The company put out the following statement: We took this decision in light of Sydney festival’s actions to seek and retain funding from the state of Israel. It is our responsibility to ensure that the strong voices within Jurrungu Ngan-ga: First Nations Australians, people seeking asylum alongside allied settler artists from diverse backgrounds, can perform with clear liyan (spirit and wellbeing). It is critical that the dancers will be heard, particularly in these circumstances as Jurrungu Ngan-ga embodies the essence of solidarity. The company added: With that in mind we respectfully ask that the festival review their decision to return the funding for the sake of community harmony, the cultural safety of artists and the benefit of our audiences. The show will still run at Carriageworks from 26-29 January, just not under the umbrella of the festival. Tickets issued through festival will be cancelled and refunded by the festival, and punters can secure new tickets here. As Guardian Australia has previously reported, a number of acts have pulled out of Sydney festival over the $20,000 sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy to stage a production of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin’s Decadance by the Sydney Dance Company. The protests have been backed by a coalition of Arab and pro-Palestinian organisations (including the Arab Australian Federation, Greens for Palestine, Independent Australian Jewish Voices, Jews against the Occupation Sydney, the Sydney representative for BDS and United Australian Palestinian Workers) and assorted artists and academics. Yesterday Karla Dickens pulled her work Return To Sender out of the festival. Other artists to have withdrawn include Blake prize-winning artist Khaled Sabsabi, Malyangapa and Barkindji rapper Barkaa, South Asian dance company Bindi Bosses, the Arab Theatre Studio, the Bankstown poetry slam and journalist Amy McQuire. Here is a breakdown of all the new cases today: NSW recorded 12,226 cases Victoria recorded 5,137 cases Queensland recorded 2,222 new cases South Australia recorded 1374 new cases Tasmania recorded 94 new cases The ACT recorded 252 new cases The Northern Territory recorded 37 new cases Western Australia recorded one new case The national total for Thursday: 21,343 new cases. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr has released a statement after nat cab. Here are a few lines about rapid antigen tests from it: NSW will provide around 1 million RATs at cost to the ACT from 17 January 2022. We have more RATs on order to respond to the evolution of testing arrangements in the context of higher case numbers and community transmission. National cabinet has also agreed to work on a concessional RAT supply arrangement to provided highly subsidised tests to low-income households. Further details will be provided in the coming weeks. Victoria has closed some testing sites because of the heat. McGowan is asked if WA will adopt the new close contact definition before 5 February. He says: In this morning’s meeting there is wide acceptance, in particular from the prime minister, that Western Australia is different. And we don’t have large numbers of cases. In fact, we have one case today. NSW had 11,000. So we are in a very, very different position to the other states. Which is why our testing, tracing isolation and quarantines ystems are all still working. Overthere, they have all collapsed. So that’s why we are able to hopefully eliminate this, because our systems are still working. And so we will adopt those rules around close contacts at some point in time in the future when necessary, if we get to high caseloads. So that’s the agreement of the meeting this morning. Obviously it wouldn’t be, in my view, it wouldn’t be before February 5. McGowan says the positive case in now in hotel quarantine. He is a 27-year-old male backpacker. He’s a close contact of an existing case. He shared a bathroom with that person. He is not vaccinated. It’s believed he was infectious in the community. So therefore there is a range of exposure sites we have published already, and probably more will be published shortly. McGowan: Looking forward, if we keep getting vaccinated, getting our third doses, if we learn the lessons from other jurisdictions that have allowed the virus to spread, it means we will be in the best possible position to safely reconnect with the rest of the world. Everyone wants to move forward and move forward safely. If we stick together do the right thing by each other, by checking in, getting vaccinated, following the public health advice, we will all get through this. McGowan: At a point in the future if we need to move to the national settings, that is what we will do. But like I have always said, WA is in the best possible position because we can monitor the situation in other states, learn from it, and ensure WA is best placed to transition and ease border controls at the right time. It’s a concerning time right now around the country. Everyone is ready – sorry, everyone is ready for this pandemic to be over. But it’s showing no signs of slowing down. We have asked a lot from the public over the past two years in order to rise to the challenge in terms of behaviour, vaccination and, frankly, patience. And I can understand why some would be tired, especially after the boiling hot week that we’ve had. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. If we can eliminate this outbreak, we can get back to the way of life we have enjoyed without any public health restrictions for the rest of the school holidays, hopefully – something I think we would all enjoy. McGowan is now talking about national cabinet. Today’s meeting addressed a range of issues, specifically an updated definition of close contacts and the future use of rapid antigen tests. It was widely acknowledged at the meeting that Western Australia is in a very different position compared to other states and territories. That becomes more and more obvious each and every day. While WA has agreed in principle with the changes to testing and close contacts, these new settings will only be implemented in Western Australia at a later stage. To be clear, the settings agreed at national cabinet today are for jurisdictions with a high-caseload environment, with thousands of daily cases. Western Australia is not in that position. McGowan is announcing an assistance package for businesses and artists impacted. Firstly small businesses impacted by the public health measures will soon be able to apply for a grant of up to $12,500. Sole traders will also be eligible for a grant up to $4,400. Those one-off grants are open to eligible businesses, including creative and performing arts, catering, rental and hiring services, and other hospitality businesses. These businesses will need to demonstrate a reduction in turnover of at least 30% compared to the same 11-day period from last year. Nightclubs that have been forced to close are eligible for a one-off $20,000 grant. McGowan says 26,696 vaccines were administered yesterday. This was pushed by a spike in visitors to state-run clinics, particularly for third doses. Which we know is very important in the fight against Omicron. Yesterday’s surge in vaccinations means 92% of our population aged 12 or above have now had their third dose. And 84% have had two doses over 12. These numbers are very encouraging. Remember as soon as you were eligible for your third dose you should immediately get it done. McGowan: Yesterday we did 5,181 Covid tests. As of this morning, 720 close contacts in total have been identified, 40 of whom are yet to be tested. Of the 40 yet to be tested, 31 were patrons from the Perth mess hall event. As I said yesterday, a number of attendees will not be able to be located by WA police, due to false or misleading contact information provided. In addition, 488 casual contacts have now been identified, with 328 yet to be tested. If you have been identified as a close or casual contact or if you have been to an exposure site, especially the Perth mess hall event, we need you to come forward immediately. We need you to do the right thing and get tested now. Premier Mark McGowan: I can advise that overnight WA has recorded one new local case of Covid-19. That case is a 27-year-old male backpacker. So far we know he was a close contact of an existing case. He shared a bathroom with that person. That man is not vaccinated. It is believed he has been infectious in the community, so therefore there are further exposure sites. These are Dominos pizza East Fremantle on December 28. BP on Queen Victoria Street, in Fremantle on December 28. Portside Boulders climbing gym in O’Connor on December 27. And farmer Jack Spearwood on December 26. Specific times and further exposure sites will be released publicly as soon as possible. We are now jumping over to WA. Visitors to Tasmania will no longer need a PCR test to enter the state from January 1 onwards. Travellers will have to return a negative RAT test 24 hours prior to travel to Tasmania. Fyles: There is two more cases associated with a birthday party event in Darwin on December 23. So yesterday I reported on a nine-year-old girl that had tested positive. And so these two other cases attended that same event in Darwin on December 23. There is four more cases where I don’t have the details. The contact tracing is under way. They are today’s cases and I want to reiterate we saw a significant increase in the test number – 3,600 versus 1,600 yesterday. We have 37 cases in the NorthernTerritory reported in the last 24 hours. So it is disappointing to have 37 cases but the good news is that that rate of spread is still low in terms of those positive cases. Fyles: Eight cases are household contacts of a case that we reported from Christmas Day in Katherine. All of those contacts I understand were in isolation. One of the cases is a known household contact from Tennant Creek – a female in her 20s. So those cases are the eight and the one from Tennant Creek are linked to our ‘regional cluster’ that we’re referring to it as, and that takes the total number for that cluster to 163 cases. Additionally, we have a number of cases. I will provide some details on them to Territorians. One of them is a worker in the centre for national resilience. But they are the contact of an interstate traveller. So a household contact has recently returned from interstate and the cause of that transmission is under investigation. One of them is a nurse at Royal Darwin Hospital and we have contact tracing under way for that case. Two of them are US marines that recently arrived at Robertson barracks from Queensland. Additionally we have a worker that is at the Groote Eylandt mine that arrived into the Territory yesterday. I understand and we have been able to identify the close contacts in that case. There is eight other cases which are interstate arrivals into the Northern Territory. And there is a further nine cases which are household contacts of recent interstate arrivals. We are just jumping to the Northern Territory, where health minister Natasha Fyles says there are 37 new cases. Before I go to the details around those cases, I need to notify Territorians we have seen a significant increase in testing in the last 24 hours. We saw 3,625 tests conducted in the territory. Yesterday’s figures were reported against around 1,600 tests. So we have seen more than double the tests and that accounts for this increase in cases. Some big changes ahead. To recap: Leaders at nat cab have agreed to revise the definition of a close contact. So that is now someone who has been more than four hours with a confirmed positive case in a house, accommodation or care-facility setting. The states can determine exceptional circumstances where more people have to isolate - so, suspected super-spreader events. Positive cases have to isolate for seven days, with a test on day six. Close contacts have to isolate for seven days and have a PCR test if they are symptomatic. A close contact who is asymptomatic must have a rapid antigen test. Lastly, the PM was asked if he had a response to the protests this morning and the damage to Old Parliament House. I am disgusted and appalled by behaviour that would see Australians come and set fire to such a symbol of democracy in this country. I just think it is appalling and I think it is disgraceful, and I think that the authorities should act swiftly in accordance to the law and people should face consequences of their actions. This is not justified. This is not how Australia works. We have a rule of law in this country and people should obey it. And as we come into this New Year and as we reflect on many things of the past 12 months, it has been a tough year for so many Australians, and we still think of the six families in Tasmania. It has been really tough, but we live in one of the greatest countries in the world. We enjoy freedoms here. We enjoy a healthcare system. We enjoy freedoms that few countries enjoy to the same extent that we do and have over such a long period of time. So, while Australia has had a tough year, there is still a lot to celebrate by the simple fact that we are Australians and we live in Australia. Frewen reminds people that the booster eligibility has been brought forward. We went from six months to five months and that brought a number of million extra people back in, and as I have said, on the first of January we go from 4.1 million to 7.6 million. That is a large amount of people in a very short space of time, but the numbers are progressing well, and we will ramp up to January. Both New South Wales and Victoria, have committed to getting their clinics back up to 300,000 doses a week, which is where we were at the height of the rollout. So once we get nationally back up to the high levels ... we will get through people. Reporter: 43% of those eligible for boosters have not had their boosters yet? Morrison: The rate of dosage for boosters is running at six times the rate of first doses when we started, and at around twice the rate of second doses, so the booster rate is actually running significantly faster than we have seen in the last two doses of the vaccination program. I also make this point: that when someone becomes eligible, that does not mean that they are overdue, OK? I would encourage people to do it as soon as hey can, but by the end of January, general, we will have close to 16 million people. You can’t vaccinate 16 million people on one day, but there is no shortage of vaccines. There is 20 million vaccines here in Australia. That is enough to boost 80% of the Australian population, and more coming over the course of the first half of this year, so there is no shortage of supply. This is why we, again, stressed today the need to get the state clinics up and running and that is exactly what they are doing, and to get ourselves off at the world record rates we had in October – when we were running at 300,000 a day on some occasions – that is where we want to get back to. But to do that you need all cylinders firing. General John Frewen is asked by Guardian Australia’s Daniel Hurst about the booster rollout in aged care facilities. Frewen says: We have been focused on aged care facilities, and of the slightly over 2,500 aged care facilities at the moment, we have done already a visit to about 1,500 of those. The eligibility has shifted, of course, so more have become due this year. Some of them are scheduled in January. We are now trying to move them to 1 January. The remainder will fall in the second half of January and we are well engaged with the vaccine providers to get them all scheduled in the second half... Hurst: Does that mean 1,000 aged care facilities have not been visited for boosters yet? Frewen: They had not been eligible so they are becoming eligible now and we have plans in place to visit them as soon as possible. Kelly is asked if these changes will accelerate the outbreak. We will have more cases. There is no doubt about that. This is a way of coping with that last caseload. It is about using the resources we have wisely, and I will leave others to their own opinion. Morrison is asked if he can ensure these changes won’t result in more lives lost. He says: I am confident that this is the best way to manage the Omicron pandemic. That is what I am confident about. Reporter: What personal responsibility will you take? Morrison: It is the same that I have taken all through this pandemic as prime minister. Every single day, when I first stood before you here, and Australia was one of the first countries in the world to call it the pandemic – two weeks before the World Health Organisation. Each and every day I have focused on this pandemic to ensure that we have got the best possible settings that we can have, so I do take responsibility for the decisions we have taken I do take responsibility for the fact that Australia has one of the lowest death rates in the world, that we have one of the strongest economies coming through the pandemic, and we, indeed, have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. These are all of my responsibilities. Morrison is asked about people struggling to get a rapid antigen test. If you are not symptomatic and not a close contact, then go home. That is the first way. That is the first way to be able to ensure that we keep those queues down. In terms of the supplies in the private market, in pharmacies and shops, supermarkets and places like that, what is important is they have the certainty that they know that governments aren’t all of a sudden going to go round and start providing these free to anybody and everybody. We will be providing them only where it is recommended to us that they need to be provided... for our aged care workers or in those high-risk settings, or indeed what we hope to arrange for schooling when we go back to school next year. Otherwise, people can go get those in the private market. Morrison is asked about NYE. The prime minister says: What I would like people to do tomorrow night is enjoy the evening. I would like them to be looking forward into 2022 and looking forward confidently. Because Australia’s feature is bright. What I would like people to do tomorrow night is exercise common sense and follow all the normal precautions that we have been talking about. We have been living with this virus now and the virus has been around us now for two years. And we understand a lot more about it than we previously did and we understand how it is transferred. I would expect people to show appropriate caution, commonsense, treat each other with a sort of respect for their health, as well in terms of how they are engaging with them, and enjoy a beautiful, hopefully, summer evening all around the country as we move from 2021 into 2022. Chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly says that “the booster program is absolutely crucial” to fighting the virus. The second one is public health and social measures. Wearing masks, as you all are today, that is very important, one of the other things that are in place and are a matter for the states and territories. The third one is tests, trace, isolate and quarantine ... And make sure that those people that are the closest contacts are getting rapidly diagnosed, rapidly isolating and therefore protecting the rest of the community. That is the absolute key piece. Morrison is asked what pressure these changes might put on the hospital system. He says: What we’re dealing with is a different variant that has a high volume with lower severity illness. And we have done endless rounds of modelling over the last many months about the impacts on the hospital system. And so it really does become an issue of the proportion of total number of cases that end up in serious illnes, that put pressure on hospital system. And these are the issues that of course are being worked through the medical expert panel and the chief medical officer. What I want to make very clear today is the definition we have adopted today has actually come forward from the chief medical officer, which I strongly agree with. It is a practical definition to deal with the circumstances of the new period and maximise the resources we have available to deal with a pandemic. We have significant resources to do that, more than most countries around the world. Hence why we have one of the best responses and outcomes from Covid anywhere in the world. Morrison is asked about the Therapeutic Goods Administration approving rapid antigen tests. He says: As I said yesterday, that we have current applicants who have had their products withdrawn by the FDA in the United States. There will be some who will be out there selling their wares. The only way they will have anything approved by the TGA is if they comply with the requirements of the TGA, they provide the data that the TGA insists on providing. There are a number of applicants who haven’t provided that. And of course you wouldn’t expect them to be approved in those circumstances. Morrison is back up: What is in South Australia, I want to stress, while they are adopting the definition of close contact from midnight tonight, they are continuing with a 10-day rule in South Australia. Nothing is further changing on the isolation arrangement in South Australia, but the definition of a close contact is, as I have said today. In relation, something Lieutenant General Frewen just mentioned, just because someone becomes eligible for a booster does not mean that if they have not had a booster by that day they are overdue. That is something that has been pedalled out there which is not accurate, it is not true. You become eligible from a particular date. And from that date, we encourage people to go and have the booster. Frewen says there are 16 million doses of mRNA vaccines sitting in storage. There will of course be areas where demand outstrips the immediate ordering. And we continue to work with all of the providers to get either urgent deliveries to them or work local redistribution. We urge any [one] who is running low on supply, please contact the vaccine operation centre and we will make sure we get additional vaccine to you as quickly as we can. January will be a big month. General John Frewen is up: As of yesterday, 2.3 million of the 3.9 million eligible people have had their boosters, which represents around 57%. There were 149,000 vaccines administered yesterday ... Pleasingly, 60,000 of those vaccines were delivered through pharmacies, which is a record for pharmacies – the first day that pharmacists have delivered more than GPs. Kelly says the good news is that the virus is less severe: The other key element of this is we need to protect our PCR testing for where the best bang for buck is. We have seen over the last week an increase in the positivity rate from around 1%, which is what we have seen throughout the pandemic, to almost 5%, and even higher in some states. That demonstrates to me that we are not getting to the people that we need to get to, in terms of PCR testing, hence that risk-based approach for who we want to come forward for PCR testing. Chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly: It is a different virus, very different from previous versions of the virus we have seen over the last two years. What is the difference? We know it is very transmissible – it is at least as transmissible as Delta. And is transmitting fast in the community, as we have seen – 110,000 active cases now in Australia, and that is continuing to rise. I expect will continue to rise ... It is less severe. I think that is becoming very clear now. We have had good news overnight, there was a paper that I read from South Africa, which is a different country to us in various ways, but they have had the longest and most extensive experience of this particular form of the Covid-19 virus, the Omicron variant. They are seeing a 73% decrease in severity. And that is becoming very clear now, in terms of their measures of severity with this virus. That is similar to what we’re seeing in Australia. Morrison says nat cab is trying to get the balance right. That is with Omicron, we cannot have hundreds of thousands of Australians or more taken out of circulation based on rules that were set for the Delta variant. We need rules for the Omicron variant, so that we can keep our economy working and get people in jobs, we can keep Australia open, and we can focus the resources that we have on the tasks that are most urgent. At the end of the day, get your booster, monitor your symptoms, check in where you are going and use common sense to manage your health responsibly and that of your family. Morrison says there are some changes to isolation requirements for healthcare workers at next week’s national cabinet meeting. In addition, we will be looking at the issue of concessional access in the private market to rapid antigen tests, working with the states and territories on that issue. They are responsible for the rapid antigen test that are being distributed in their testing centres; the commonwealth looks after aged care and a number of high-risk settings. We will continue to do that. Specific orders are in place and stocks are on the way here to a number of the states, including the federal government. Morrison says some vulnerable groups will still be able to access them. Where possible, particularly for vulnerable groups, we would seek to do those through the pharmacy network and through the private network, and that would bedone through a registration system similar to how we manage things like the PBS and things of that nature which pharmacy is very used to dealing with. But for all other casual uses, you would just like to get a test or something like that, well, that is what the private market is for. Morrison says the RATs will be free only if you meet the criteria. Anyone else who would like to get a rapid antigen test, well, go to your pharmacy or the supermarket or the warehouse, big suppliers, where, we believe – as a result of making this change and being very clear about who is being provided with a public test and who is not, all the private industry who gave us that advice this week – they can go now. They can book their supplies, they can get them on the shelves and not have any concern that, somehow, a new policy will come in and tests will be handed out to anyone who wants one. It was agreed today that will not be the policy in Australia. Rapid antigen tests will be provided publicly at those testing centres for those who require one according to the rules that I have set down, and we have taken out of national cabinet today. Morrison says he knows this is a big change to how we have rolled the last two years. I know this is a bit different to what you have been hearing over the last couple of years. That is the gearchange. That is the reset. That is what we need people to really understand, and I know it is a change from what has been said, but dealing with Delta is very different to dealing with a Omicron, and to ensure that our public health systems work as effectively to keep as many people are safe as possible, that is why we need to make this change. Morrison says this will reduce the pressure on testing centres. Which means we will be able to increase the turnaround time of these tests, getting results back to those who need to take them. In addition to that, it will also free up, we hope, a lot more workforce that is currently being focused on these tests to be able to be supporting the other priorities for managing the pandemic. In particular, the boosting clinics and centres or administering the vaccine. Morrison says RATs will be provided at testing centres. We will transfer over the next few weeks from PCR to these rapid antigen tests with, at the state testing centres, over the next couple of weeks. Some large states will be moving to get those rapid antigen tests to those testing centres as soon as they can and that will happen over the next few days and the next few weeks. If you are eligible for a rapid antigen test and there is one stay at that time, you will be given one. You will go home, take it and follow those rules. If that is not a rapid antigen test there then we will still give you a PCR test in the transition. Morrison says if that’s not you - do not go and get tested. If you don’t fulfil this definition of a close contact then there is no need for you to be in that line. You should go home. Goto the beach, go and do what you want to do. Read a book in the park. Follow all the normal, common sense things that you would do, monitor your symptoms, follow the Covid-safe practices, make sure you have booked for your booster, do all of those sorts of things but there is no need for you to be in that line. Morrison: So, to summarise, if you are a confirmed case, seven days. On the sixth day, you have a rapid antigen test and if that is [negative] after seven days, you can go back into the community. If you are a close contact, you get a rapid antigen test. If that returns a negative, you still remain in isolation for those seven days and you have a rapid antigen test again on day six. If you are a close contact and you are symptomatic, go and get a PCR test. If you are a close contact that returns a positive rights test, go and get a PCR test. Morrison: So, if you are symptomatic, and that goes for anyone who is symptomatic, by the way, if you are symptomatic, then at the right test is a PCR test. A close contact who is asymptomatic does not have symptoms, must have a rapid antigen test, and if positive, they must then have a PCR test. In that case, they become a confirmed case and the rules that apply to confirmed cases apply to them. Now, close contacts that return a negative test, they must remain isolated for those seven days because symptoms and other things can present later. And that is seven days from their date of exposure to the person who is a confirmed case, and they also will have a rapid antigen test on day six. Morrison: Now, a confirmed case would isolate for seven days from the date. So someone who actually has Covid, from the date that they took the test, they would have to isolate for seven days and have a negative rapid test, a rapid antigen test, on day six, prior to being able to leave isolation after seven days. A close contact that is symptomatic must have a PCR test, still. The definition is as follows: Similar to what I said to you yesterday -except in exceptional circumstances, a close contact is a household contact, or household like, of a confirmed case only. A household contact is someone who lives with a case or hasn’t spent more than four hours with them in our house, accommodation or care facility setting. So, you are only a close contact if you are, effectively, living with someone or have been in an accommodation setting with someone for more than four hours with someone who has actually got Covid - is not someone who is in contact with someone who has had Covid. Nat cab has agreed on a new definition for close contact with some states chnaging that now while others will follow. It will come into effect in New Wales, Victoria, Queensland, SouthAustralia and here in the ACT. Tasmania will follow on the 1 January, and the Northern Territory and Western Australia will be making announcements, particularly the Northern Territory, in the next few days to confirm how they will be moving to these new definitions. Morrison says national cabinet has agreed on “very practical way forward” that recognises that states and territories are in different stages. There is increasing evidence of reduced severity of overgrown, which is welcome news. Today there are 122 people in ICU and there are 51 people on ventilators, actually less than the number I mentioned to you yesterday. We are saying that the severity of this illness, the impact, particularly on those in hospital, in the most extreme illness situations, is remaining relatively constant, and that is an experience we are seeing in other countries as well. When’s a good time to release some bad data? How about the eve of New Year’s Eve? So today the Queensland government has published the delayed statewide landcover and trees study (SLATS) that covers land clearing for the 2018-19 year. During those 12 months, landholders cleared 680,688 hectares. It’s a bit tricky to compare with previous years – such as the 392,000 hectares reportedly cleared in 2017-18 – as the remote technology has been improved. Still, it appears that Queensland is clearing a lot of land. The 2018-19 tally amounts to about 3800 times the size of Melbourne’s CBD, or more than 2,400 times Sydney’s. “This report is a carbon bomb that threatens to blow up the commitments to net zero emissions by 2050 made by the Queensland and Australian governments,” Dr Stuart Blanch, a WWF-Australia conservation scientist, said in a statement. It shows clearing has likely been significantly under-reported in previous reports. The latest SLATS data was compiled using satellite images that are three times more accurate than the previous imagery and cover much more of the state. The data provides a new national best-practice standard that all governments and industry should adopt. To give the amount some context, Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory estimated land clearing in 2018 calendar year was about 370,000 hectares nationwide. In that year, the commonwealth government also claimed the land sector was a net sink in the order of more than 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide. As Guardian Australia reported a couple of months ago, there is good reason to think Australia’s statistics underestimate the amount of land clearing that is going on. Today’s figures from Queensland are only going to add to those concerns. Scott Morrison says: Omicron is a game changer. It has been in the country for just over a month. We have taken the care to ensure that we are understanding it as best we can, examining the impact on our hospital system to ensure we are recalibrating in the right way so Australia can continue to live with this virus. OK we are jumping to the PM now. Finally, Marshall says there was a “large discussion” at national cabinet regarding the use of rapid antigen tests. All states agreed to transition away from PCR tests and towards rapid antigen tests: It is fair to say that there are increasing numbers now coming into Australia. No state will be giving these away free of charge. This is completely against public health advice, except in circumstances with particularly vulnerable communities. Some states spoke about there might be a particularly vulnerable cohort that they want to administer these to in a reasonably rapid period of time. But we all agreed that we will be making a transition to more people using the rapid antigen tests and getting out of the lineups for a PCR test. Marshall says two-thirds of all the people lining up for PCR tests in South Australia are asymptomatic. These people, really, quite frankly, should not be in the line unless they were close contacts of somebody who was a positive case. We really do want to free-up our capacity for testing for those people who have symptoms and over the next 24-48 hours we will look at putting new directions in place to make it very clear to every single person in South Australia that we really want to test people that have symptoms or are close contacts of those people that have symptoms. So just a bit of advance warning that we will be significantly tightening up on that. Marshall says the national cabinet also discussed the time close contacts and positive cases should isolate. As of the next 24-48 hours, South Australia will move to 10 days for people who are Covid-positive and seven days for those people who are close contacts. If they are unvaccinated, it will remain at 14 days. Marshall turns to the national cabinet. He says three critical things were discussed - the first being the standard definition of what a close contact is: Now, you might recall if we go back several months ago, we were very, very keen to get everybody that was a close contact or a casual contact into isolation to stop the spread. We were pursuing, at that point, an elimination strategy so that we did not put our state into lockdown, like we saw in New South Wales, in Victoria and the ACT. We have a completely different strategy [now]. It is completely different variants, and we are in a very, very different stage at the moment, so we are looking to suppress the transmission of this disease, and take the appropriate action for this stage of this particular variant. Today, we agreed that we would, very significantly, narrow the definition of a close contact. This will, essentially, [mean] the people who are a household or intimate contact with a positive case. And also, each state will look at exceptions, or exceptional circumstances, in their state. South Australia has recorded 1,374 new cases overnight. There are still 37 people being treated in hospital. Marshall says numbers are likely to “bob around” for some time. South Australian premier Steven Marshall is speaking now following national cabinet. He says a Covid-positive child aged under two has died: A Covid-positive child under the age of two has, sadly, passed away. This is still being determined as the cause of death. Obviously, we will refer this to the coroner. It is similar to the 95-, 94-year-old woman that we reported the other day,[where] we knew that she passed away with Covid but not necessarily of Covid, so we will need to do that investigation. But very sad news that a child under the age of two, Covid-positive, has passed away. Perrottet is asked what the point of QR codes is now that the system of contact tracing is changing and more and more people are becoming infected. He says: Obviously there was a lot of debate and discussion as we opened up, we planned to remove QR codes in low-risk settings, we kept them and mandated them at high-risk settings to allow ... our health teams to track and trace those cases. There was concern, and hearing from public feedback that was very comfortable with the QR settings we brought them back in a limited way ... As we learn to live alongside the virus, the utility of those QR codes over time will completely dissipate. Mike Bowers, photographer at large for Guardian Australia, has been down at Old Parliament House surveying the damage. He says traditional owners at the tent embassy are frustrated and attempting to keep media from the site. Perrottet says the “substantial investment” the state has placed into its health system gives him confidence NSW will be able to cope with rising case numbers. Which, keep in mind, jumped by more than 100 hospitalisations in the past 24 hours: We always said as we open up case numbers would increase and we’ll expect that continue to occur as we live along the virus. What’s incredibly pleasing is we still have capacity in our health system ... that is the measure of success as the key metric for us, not the case number itself. Please expect as we open up, case numbers will increase. New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet is speaking now on 2GB. He says restricting the definition of close contacts is a “more balanced approach” that “suits the circumstances” we are currently facing. The government has released a response condemning the fire at Old Parliament House on behalf of the minister assisting the prime minister and cabinet, Ben Morton. Read it in full here: Criminal damage has no place in our democracy. Australia is one of the leading democracies in the world and the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House has become a physical symbol of the strength and success of our Australian democratic system. We have led the world in the development of our Australian democratic system. Our democratic success is based on the principles of freedom, respect, fairness and equality of opportunity. Millions across the world can only but dream to live in and have the opportunities afforded to them that come with living in a liberal democracy like Australia. No system of government is perfect. In our democracy the freedom to peaceful protest is one that we can and should celebrate. Today’s actions at Old Parliament House were not peaceful. The resulting damage undermines the message that peaceful protesters seek to deliver. As minister responsible for Old Parliament House I was reassured by the chair of Old Parliament House that at the last board meeting, the board was fully briefed by management on planning and preparations for these protests and the board was satisfied with the planning and preparations. The protection of the building is paramount and given the live operational issues, management have made decisions based on advice from security agencies. Disappointingly, but necessarily, visitor access has been restricted at times. It is the government’s expectation that all illegal activity should be dealt with by the police and the courts to the full extent possible. I thank the first responders. They should not have to put themselves in harm’s way to deal with the fire. The damage to the building will be fully restored back to its original condition. Before we hear from the prime minister, it’s Caitlin Cassidy back with you for the next little while. Caits coming in from all angles today. Scott Morrison is due to address reporters at Parliament House in Canberra at 3.10pm AEDT. This has not been independently verified by Guardian Australia but there are a lot of reports the protesters today are a “sovereign citizen” group. From AAP: The ACT has reported 253 new cases of Covid-19, beating its previous high – set two days earlier – by a single case. There are six people in hospital, with no one in intensive care or requiring ventilation. The new cases bring the territory’s tally of active cases up to 1,134. The infections were picked up alongside almost 4,000 negative tests returned. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, is expected to address the media at 3pm after Nat-Cab. We are not sure what time the PM is speaking yet. ACT police have released a statement into the fire at Old Parliament House. Here it is in full: There has been ongoing protest activity at the front of Old Parliament House throughout the past fortnight. Old Parliament House was evacuated earlier today after protestors started a fire at the front doors of the building - this was quickly extinguished by ACT Fire &amp; Rescue. A police investigation into the cause of the fire has commenced. Old Parliament House will remain closed until further notice. Australians may have to receive two or even three Covid jabs each year to maintain defences against the virus if early results on the efficacy of booster shots turn out to be a useful guide. Weekly data published just before Christmas by the UK’s Health Security Agency shows the effectiveness of both the Pfizer and Moderna boosters against symptomatic diseases is lower for the Omicron than the Delta variant across all periods after the injection. The analysis included 147,597 Delta and 68,489 Omicron cases in the UK. The agency stressed the “results should be interpreted with caution due to the low counts and the possible biases related to the populations with highest exposure to Omicron (including travellers and their close contacts) which cannot fully be accounted for”. This is a thread from Twitter user Isabelle AI who says healthcare workers in Sydney are exhausted, and begs the PM and premier to visit the front line. ACT police are expected to hold a press conference about the fire at Old Parliament House soon. I want to point out again – we don’t know what’s happened today or why the fire started. Huge queues for booster shots in Sydney. Protesters on the scene say the police approached the smoking ceremony, spraying pepper spray which then resulted in the fire. I really want to stress that we haven’t yet been able to confirm any of the claims. We are getting more information for you and have put these accusations to ACT police. To be clear - we are not sure exactly what has happened at Old Parliament House this morning, or what the context for the protest is. We are chasing the information and will bring you more detail when we have it. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, also called for caution regarding the push to narrow the definition of a close contact. When asked about the federal government proposal to narrow the definition, Albanese said it would make sense to have national consistency, and a “commonsense approach” should be taken. But in order to achieve that, as well, we do need to deal with people’s anxieties. When we had a lifting, for example, of the QR codes, and people not being notified, what occurred was that a range of people just chose to then not go about their normal way of life and to withdraw from activity. So we need to be cautious about this. Albanese said the national cabinet should review the matter thoroughly, “and we want to see the states bring their public health advice”. All we’ve heard so far is Scott Morrison’s view about this. We want to hear the approach that state governments think should be taken to this. But what we do urge is there needs to be consistency, there needs to be clarity and certainty and common sense, because businesses and the Australian people in individual states and across the country are really struggling with this hodgepodge of constantly changing rules and definitions. Albanese pivoted to a broader critique of Morrison (with an election due by May), declaring that the Prime Minister “can’t continue to just come up with a new slogan in order to get the headline every week”. This prime minister needs to do something other than go to a focus group this morning and get a definition about ‘shake and bake’ ... This prime minister speaks about personal responsibility. This is the guy who won’t take responsibility for his job, whose most common phrase is ‘it’s not my job’ when asked about things that clearly are the job of the Australian prime minister. OK, we can confirm the fire at Old Parliament House is now out. ACT Fire and Rescue were called at 11.45am, and the crew found the two front doors alight. The building was evacuated and fire crews put the blaze out. ACT Police are now handling the incident. We know that a large number of protesters had been at the site just before the blaze. More to come on this as we have it. From AAP: Tens of thousands of revellers are still expected to flood Melbourne for New Year’s Eve celebrations, despite record Covid-19 infections. Melbourne lord mayor Sally Capp said it was undeniable celebrations have taken a hit from the pandemic - normally hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city and an entertainment drawcard has been cancelled. However, she assured those who have tickets to four event zones in the city, open to the double-vaccinated only, that there was still plenty to enjoy. “Within the celebration zones, there is family-friendly entertainment, more than 115 artists will be dazzling and delighting the crowds, there is a 9.30pm fireworks show, particularly for families and children,” she told reporters. Streets will be closed for outdoor dining, families can bring a picnic and there will be alcohol-free zones. “Post the 9.30pm show, we move more into glitter balls, DJs and dancing as people look forward to heralding the end of 2021 with a midnight firework show across those four celebration zones,” she said. However, the pandemic’s ongoing impact on freight, logistics and workplaces’ ability to train staff also means the city of Melbourne has cancelled its drone swarm at Docklands as part of its New Year’s Eve celebrations. It is hoping the drone event provider, Celestial, can deliver the spectacle in January. We know emergency services are now at Old Parliament House. Videos are being shared online – we will bring you more information as we have it. Several journalists on Twitter are reporting that Old Parliament House in Canberra is on fire. We are trying to find out more for you now and will keep you updated. Hello everyone, this is Cait Kelly. I’ll be taking you through the second half of the day. Here’s some weather for you first up. It’s going to be hot, hot, hot over the next few days. The Queensland press conference has just ended, and with that, I will pass the blog on to Cait Kelly. She will bring you all the latest developments, including what comes out of national cabinet, due to meet at midday. Back to Queensland, and Gerrard says this is “the best time” for the state to be experiencing a pandemic. The weather is warm, Queenslanders have had the opportunity to get vaccinated, and school is off for summer: This is the first time Queenslanders will experience the true pandemic ... if we are going to experience the pandemic, then January is probably the best time to be experiencing it, because it’s warm ... and schools are on holidays. This is the time to be having a pandemic. Over in South Australia, Steven Marshall will have more to say later in the day after national cabinet meets. Gerrard says the “vast majority” of people who acquire Covid while fully vaccinated will experience a relatively mild illness. But “even if only a tiny proportion of a large number of people needs to go to hospital ... that’s still a large number”. Gerrard says “certainly” tens of thousands of cases will be detected in the state, and the definition of close contacts needs to change or “the country won’t function”. If we continue to use our current settings, then all of us will be in quarantine, and the state won’t function. Turning to the Torres Strait, Gerrard says there are 11 cases in Thursday Island and one case in the rural town of Cherbourg overnight. Lockdowns are not being considered at this point but the community will be consulted. He says “we are not going to stop the Omicron virus” but there are some things that can slow its spread – like mask-wearing and working from home if you can. Gerrard says there are five things to do if you test positive to Covid-19: Self isolate and tell those you live with to self isolate and get tested. Answer health care questions you are asked when called by a health worker. Tell the people you’ve been in contact with to get tested and quarantine. Ensure you have supplies of food and medications for a fortnight. Look after yourself and keep a symptom diary. To hospitalisations in Queensland, and there are 1,809 cases receiving care in their homes, and 103 cases in hospital. But it’s difficult to work out what proportion are there for treatment and symptoms and what proportion are there for other reasons. There are at least 29 people receiving treatment for Covid in hospitals. Gerrard says: Even if you’re vaccinated there is a significant chance you will acquire this illness in the coming weeks. Queensland’s chief health minister Dr John Gerrard is up, breaking down today’s figures. He says case numbers will continue to rise, but vaccines work, and will hopefully keep intensive care admissions low: Trying to relay this message in a balanced manner is quite difficult ... if I can just take you back and compare what’s happening now with 2020. To the end of June 2020 in Australia there were 8,566 Covid cases diagnosed, so about the same number as we’ve seen in Queensland since the borders opened just over two weeks ago. Associated with that 8,566 cases last year were 204 intensive care admissions and 30 deaths. In Queensland so far since this latest wave, we have seen no intensive care admissions and there have been no deaths reported. It is likely in the coming days there will be intensive care admissions ... the really big issue though in trying to balance this message is we’re not going to be talking about 8,000 cases in a few weeks, we’re going to be talking about tens of thousands of cases ... but the good thing is the vaccines are working and they’ve been clearly demonstrated to work. Grace has announced Queensland’s numbers. There were a record 2,222 Covid cases detected in some 30 local government areas, a slight jump on yesterday’s record figure. There are now 8,586 active cases in the state. The good news is there is nobody being treated in intensive care. Further north, Queensland education minister Grace Grace is speaking in Brisbane now to provide a Covid update while also announcing funding for kindergarten services in the state. Tasmania has reported 92 new Covid cases overnight – almost a doubling of cases in one day – as well as new hospitalisations for the first time since the borders reopened to hotspots. Three people are now in hospital, with one admitted for an unrelated medical reason. There are now 386 active cases in the state. Back to politics, and Daniel Hurst has brought us some more of federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese’s comments this morning. Albanese says people are “crying out for clarity and certainty” and says the prime minister, Scott Morrison, should stop passing the buck. Albanese used a media conference in Adelaide this morning to demand outcomes from today’s national cabinet meeting (which is due to begin at midday AEDT). Albanese said: The truth is that there’s so much uncertainty out there. What we need out of today’s meeting is some clarity. Because people are anxious. People are worried, people are voting with their feet by not going out, by not going to restaurants, by not undertaking activity that they normally would in the lead-up, particularly, to New Year’s Eve. What we need from today is some national leadership that has been sorely lacking. We need national leadership when it comes to the rollout of the booster. Too many people still can’t get an appointment for their booster. The prime minister needs to explain why it is that it’s four months in between the second shot and the booster shot in a week’s time, but that is reduced to three months down the track at the end of January. Is that just because of capacity constraints? Albanese called for certainty regarding the rollout of boosters to people in aged and disability care. He also took aim at Morrison over shortages of rapid antigen tests: What we’ve seen is state government step up into the void, like the Andrews government, because of the failure of leadership from the Morrison government. Once again, Scott Morrison yesterday, when he appeared at a media conference, spoke about it not being his job. Well, it is his job, and he should do it. As prime minister of the country, we need certainty when it comes to the testing regimes as well and certainty when it comes to the need for isolation. That is what business is crying out for, clarity and certainty. And that is what the population is crying out for as well. But from a prime minister, who’s always playing catch up, always waits until an issue becomes a crisis before there’s any movement whatsoever, and then always is looking for someone else to blame. There is a wait time of between eight and nine hours at Victoria Park to get a Covid test: In lighter news, eBay has revealed some shocking statistics on unwanted Christmas gifts this year. Some 108 pre-loved items were listed every minute on Boxing Day, apparently (do not trust this information). I’m not sure how they knew specifically what was being listed was an unwanted gift, but either way, this year, eBay data shows that people in NSW and VIC were the most likely to flip their unwanted gifts to make some cash. (As our lifestyle editor Alyx Gorman wisely pointed out, if they were unwanted gifts they would also be listed as “new”, not “pre-loved”.) Three of the top five postcodes for selling pre-loved items on Boxing Day on eBay belong to Victoria, namely to Werribee, Melbourne CBD and Dandenong, while Sydneysiders in Baulkham Hills/Bella Vista and Ryde/Putney/Denistone East round off the top five. The top five unwanted gifts were women’s clothing (never buy clothes for your partner), books, trading cards, DVDs and Blu-Rays and coins (coins?). Two coins were listed every minute on Boxing Day, which seems insane. OzSage says our health system was stretched before Covid, and has now had its capacity eroded by staff resignations and a blowout in waiting lists. The impact of the “sheer number” of Omicron cases at this time of year could be “enormous”: The rapid rise in Omicron cases may mean we are only days away from seeing higher hospitalisation and ICU admissions than during the peak of Delta ... NSW recognises the overload of the hospital system and is already warning the community not to expect access to hospital care. One week ago, NSW Health advised people under 50 years to care for themselves at home, without access to Hospital in The Home. This week, they have revised the age cut off to anyone under 65 years. This is the ultimate in “personal responsibility” – where citizens are left without access to healthcare and to sort out their own Covid care, as well as do their own contact tracing whilst sick with Covid-19. Consideration should be given to support for people found Covid-19 positive who are in caring roles. The consequence of this policy is that people may die at home when their lives could have been saved by proper timely healthcare. Without the safety net of regular contact from medical services the unintended consequences are likely to be more ambulance callouts and emergency department presentations. OzSAGE ... found that there were a disturbingly high number of deaths of relatively young people with COVID-19 at home between July and October 2021. ... We remain deeply concerned that people with preventable and treatable complications of Covid-19 may die at home in NSW, without access to even the support of Hospital in The Home. OzSage says the messaging that we are “all going to get Omicron” that has been coming out of NSW also ignores the vulnerable in our society, who remain at increased risk of severe illness: The “let it rip” strategy and defeatist narrative that “we are all going to get it” ignores the stark lived reality of the vulnerable of our society. Despite three doses of vaccine, some patients with cancer and other immunosuppressed people have substantially reduced protection against Omicron. Similarly, people with co-existing health conditions (estimated to be 50% of the adult population) are at increased risk of illness. The impacts of a fragmented testing system and disrupted health system will be felt most by our elderly, lower socio-economic groups, First Nations people, people with disability and regional populations ... A fatalistic approach will be fatal for some people. On the limiting of close contacts, OzSage says they have previously outlined the ongoing importance of contact tracing and QR codes, particularly as nightclubs and restaurants can be the sites of super-spreading events, which we have seen with Omicron: The proposed change to the definition of a close contact is to reduce testing and resources and is not based on sound public health principles. Close contact definitions need to be based on risk. Risk is related to the amount of exposure to virus-laden aerosols. Risk is not limited to arbitrary four-hour time frames within households. ... The rhetoric that case numbers ‘do not matter’ is incorrect - particularly in the face of the Omicron variant. Daily case numbers are now 10 times higher than during the Delta wave and may be 100 times higher in January. Even if hospitalisation rates are lower with Omicron compared to Delta, a halving of hospitalisation rates with a 10-fold or 100-fold increase in cases will still translate to a high burden on the health system. So even though hospitalisation rates are lower with Omicron than the previous Delta wave, hospitalisations and ICU occupancy are still on a “steeply rising trend”, which we saw today in NSW when hospitalisations jumped by more than 100 overnight. The trajectory of observed data suggest that hospitalisation and ICU occupancy are on a steeply rising trend and anticipated to exceed earlier peaks quite soon. In other words, optimistic assumptions about the impact of the Omicron variant on hospital admissions are unrealistic. Introducing a narrower close contact definition when the test positivity rate is currently 13% in NSW is unlikely to improve the burden on the health care system and will instead fuel the outbreak. Limiting the amount of testing reduces pressure on the test and trace system in the short term but will worsen the health system burden, because it will result in chains of transmission that could otherwise have been stopped. Back to the document released by OzSage today, and they’ve detailed some lengthy criticisms about testing in NSW, the risk of Omicron spreading and redefining close contacts. OzSage says testing in NSW is “failing”, with many people turned away after waiting hours in queues, and testing centres shutting at a time we should be testing more, not less: There are unacceptable delays in testing results being sent. Worse, there have been &gt;1000 infected people who were sent a negative test result by mistake, and this problem has not been addressed in a transparent fashion. Rather than investing in expanded testing capacity, the response of government is to restrict access to testing by changing the definition of close contacts and allowing PCR test to only family contacts, health workers and a few other groups. This will reduce our surveillance capacity for new variants and give falsely low case numbers. In addition, the test positive rate is 13% in NSW compared to &lt; 2% during the Delta wave – telling us we need more, not less testing. OzSAGE says rapid antigen tests are “unaffordable” for low-income people and families, given the need to test multiple times and the severe shortage nationwide: RATs ... cannot serve as the backbone of the public health test and control system. The results are not reported to the government, so people who test themselves and self-manage their Covid-19 will not be counted in official case numbers. There is unknown reliability of individual RAT brands with the Omicron variant, as a nasal swab (the usual method) is less likely to be positive than a throat swab. There has been no messaging to advise people on swabbing both the nose and throat when doing a RAT. There should still be a requirement for a PCR testing after a positive RAT. We are disturbed by the repeated messaging that only symptomatic people should get tested, when 40-45% of transmissions are asymptomatic, and even in people who develop symptoms, the peak of infectiousness is in the two days before symptoms begin. The false reassurance of the messaging will result in more cases of viral transmission that otherwise would have been prevented. China has labelled prime minister Scott Morrison joining social media app TikTok as a double standard, AAP’s Alex Mitchell reports. Morrison has previously warned Australians about the Chinese-owned app and said it “connects right back to China”, but he joined on Christmas Eve. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Morrison’s choice of social media apps was “his own business”, but added Australia should not discriminate against Chinese companies: I need to reiterate that the Australian side should follow the principle of openness and market rules, stop abusing the concept of “national security” or applying double standard to serve its interests, and provide a fair, open and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. Australia banned Chinese-owned tech giant Huawei in 2018 and has also cancelled a number of infrastructure deals citing security issues in China. The prime minister posted two TikTok videos on Christmas Eve and has amassed more than 33,000 followers. On the criticisms the AMA has raised regarding the proposal to narrow the definition of a close contact, Hunt says he respects “there are many views”. This is what the president Dr Omar Khorshid said yesterday evening: Back to Hunt – he says his motives after the next election are “to be a dad”. He also responds to criticism of the government’s handling of rapid antigen tests, saying the TGA wasn’t too slow to approve the tests. Prior to national cabinet, the advisory group OzSage has released a series of recommendations on Covid policies. It says it remains “deeply concerned” about rising Covid numbers in NSW, arguing the decision to remove restrictions as Omicron surged has “cost us dearly”: We now have over 12,000 cases a day in NSW, a testing system that cannot keep up with demand and a health system so burdened that citizens are being told they may not be able to access healthcare. Staff stand downs will continue to escalate and effect more and more people. That includes supply chains, logistics and every part of civil society. All models to date assumed good testing capacity and adequate contact tracing. Without these, case numbers will blow out further. At this point in time there is no publicly available modelling to support a National Plan that is based on public health principles which will protect our hospital systems from collapse. OzSage, a group of experts in epidemiology, health and economics, recommends: A transparent and open investigation into why a private pathology provider issued falsely negative test results to infected people and provide a solution to prevent this happening again. Procuring commonwealth RAT supplies, making them free or subsidising the cost as well as a national notification system for positive RATs. Disseminate information to labs and community about the need for nose and throat swabs for detection of Omicron, as nasal swabbing alone is less accurate. Avoid misleading messaging that tells asymptomatic people they do not need to test. Anyone who has been in close contact should test, regardless of symptoms or location of the contact. Prepare surge health workforce capacity. A fit-for-purpose hospital in the home model and a palliative care plan, and stronger delivery of booster doses at facilities and greater oxygen supplies. Medical advice and current modelling that forms the basis of a state or national Covid-19 response should be publicly available. Transparent reporting of infected people self-caring at home. Deaths at home should be monitored and reported weekly. Isolation times should be no less than seven to 10 days depending on the risk balance for the workforce. Education to overturn the “we are all going to get it” messaging and enable the public and businesses to use simple prevention measures. Hunt says “immense progress” has been made on isolation requirements for close contacts. “Practical ways to ensure we don’t have large numbers of workforce on furlough”. A reminder, the Australian Medical Association and others have raised concerns at the proposed reduction of who is defined a “close contact”, arguing we should instead be expanding PCR tests and it will allow the virus to spread. Turning to New Year’s, Hunt’s sage advice is to “avoid the mosh pit”. We’re back on Covid, and Hunt says the commonwealth will deliver 5m Covid-19 vaccines and boosters between now and the end of January. He says it may take the workforce “a little more time”, because state-run facilities need to boost capacity. The reduction between vaccine intervals is due to be reduced from 4 January. The health minister Greg Hunt is speaking now, and it isn’t Covid related. Instead, Hunt is announcing a new bowel cancer treatment on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. From the new year, the medication Braftovi (encorafenib) will be available for patients with severe colorectal cancer. Interrupting Covid transmission briefly to bring you quite an extraordinary claim about the 2032 Olympic Games from federal government frontbencher Stuart Robert: In an interview last night on Sky News Australia, Robert suggested people should vote for the Coalition to protect the Summer Olympics in Brisbane and south-east Queensland. The Olympics have bipartisan support and were strongly backed by the Queensland Labor government. Speaking to Gary Hardgrave, Robert invoked the spectre of the Greens: In terms of the Olympics in the south-east corner, the way we protect it, the way we ensure that Queensland is ready for it, is to ensure we’ve got a Coalition government. The organisation committee, if you like, the corporate structures of 50/50 with the state and the commonwealth, that will go very well. As long as that good balance is there between the state and the commonwealth, simple answer, Gary, don’t vote in a Labor-Green government. It will not fare well, like it didn’t fare well last time. Wait times for Covid tests in the ACT have reduced since the Christmas rush. As of this morning, the Garran and Kambah testing clinics had a one hour wait time, Nicholls had a 35 minute wait time while the Mitchell drive-through testing clinic had a wait time of 1.5 hours. The Garran testing centre has been prioritising tests for close and casual contacts, and people with symptoms. Greg Hunt will be up in the next 15 minutes. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese spoke in Adelaide this morning ahead of this afternoon’s national cabinet meeting: The prime minister says he is changing gears, but the truth is he has stalled the recovery. The truth is that there is so much uncertainty out there stop what we need out of today’s meeting is some clarity. Over in New York, the jury in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell has reached a verdict and found her guilty on five of six counts. Read more on the verdict here: And you can follow our live blog on the case here: Also concerning is the testing positivity rate. Some 12.58% of tests in NSW came back positive in the latest reporting period. In Victoria, 6.33% of tests returned positive results. Turning to hospitalisations, there have been more than 100 people hospitalised with Covid overnight in New South Wales. There are 395 people in hospital with Covid in Victoria, including 55 in ICU, which is staying relatively stable. But there’s been quite a significant jump in NSW. There are now 746 people being treated in hospital, and 63 in ICU. Yesterday there were 625 hospitalised. Victoria’s case numbers have also come in and 5,137 new Covid-19 infections have been detected. That’s quite a jump from 3,767 yesterday. Sadly, 13 lives have been lost overnight. New South Wales case numbers are in – and it’s another daily record. There have been 12,226 new Covid cases recorded in the state, and one death. AMA president Dr Omar Khorshid has echoed Nancy Baxter’s concerns that redefining a close contact to someone who has spent four hours in a household with a case will accelerate the outbreak. He says resources would be better spent improving PCR availability. We also have confirmation the national cabinet meeting is due to start at midday. Chris Silverwood, head coach of the English cricket team, will miss the fourth Ashes test. It’s shaping up to be a hot New Years Eve across Victoria, with severe heatwave conditions in place across the state. If you’re gathering outdoors be sure to find some shade. Health minister Greg Hunt will be speaking at the Mount Martha Lifesaving Club at 9.45am this morning. Meanwhile, Darwin has been rocked by a large earthquake that hit near Timor-Leste and Indonesia early this morning. The Bureau of Meteorology says there’s there’s no tsunami threat to Australia. Read the full report here: I wish I had more good news for you today, but unfortunately an endangered pygmy hippo calf has died at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo just a month after her entry into the world. She was found unresponsive on Christmas Eve, while preliminary findings indicated a potential heart defect. The hippo was known as a “little watermelon on legs”, and may she rest in peace. Here’s some more comments from Nancy Baxter this morning, who expressed concern at the proposed changes to the definition of a close contact. Good morning, We are limping towards the finish line of the year – just one more day to go. Caitlin Cassidy here to guide you through this morning’s news – and all eyes are on the national cabinet who will be holding a snap emergency meeting today to grapple with rapidly rising Covid cases across the country. New South Wales recorded a dramatic jump in Covid cases yesterday, detecting 11,201 infections and three deaths, while Victoria recorded 3,767 cases and five deaths. It was the first time cases have jumped beyond 10,000 in a single state and a national record for Covid infections. There are predictions daily case numbers could rise beyond 100,000 in the coming weeks. The prime minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday announced the national cabinet meeting, which will focus primarily upon settling a uniform national definition of close contacts. Under the proposed definition, a close contact will be dramatically changed to be someone who has spent four hours or more with a confirmed case in a household or household-like setting. Prof Nancy Baxter, the head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health, told ABC radio this morning the definition wasn’t fair and would overwhelm our healthcare systems. It comes with testing centres overwhelmed amid shortages of rapid antigen tests, which have doubling in price in some stores amid concerns of price gouging. Let’s get stuck in."

          "bodyText": "Back in 2008, I lived in New York. I wasn’t a total stranger to North American winters – my stepmother is from Michigan, and the one and only time she persuaded me to go on a family sledging outing I was so cold I bailed and went back to sit in the car, like the moody teenager I most definitely was. But I’d never been on the continent for an entire winter. I bought a gigantic army surplus parka and resigned myself to months of wading through freezing slush, alternated with sitting in my studio apartment at night with the windows open because the ancient radiators had one setting: on. That was until I read an article in the New York Times travel section about upstate getaways. The mere mention of a charming B&amp;B overlooking the Delaware River, where you could watch nesting eagles on a nearby bluff while sipping cognac, was all it took. Manhattan’s dreary ice-bound streets slipped away momentarily, and I imagined myself on that very deck. I was in a long-distance relationship at the time, and what, I reasoned, could be more romantic than such a weekend? It was February, the very worst part of winter, and any twinkle of New York City’s seasonal cheer had well and truly died. My boyfriend was due a visit, and I was ecstatic at the prospect of a trip out of the city. We would go somewhere a hundred times more romantic than my apartment (which housed the world’s smallest and most uncomfortable bed), a thousand times more interesting than the corner diner, and a million times more nurturing than the intersection of Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. I could see it all: the icy river threading its way below the B&amp;B’s deck, the eagles soaring majestically above us, me and my boyfriend holding hands and laughing in the snow, pink-cheeked and very much in love. The B&amp;B was remote. It was technically in a hamlet. Even better, I thought. The trip there involved taking a train from Penn station to the nearest town, then hiring a car to drive the rest of the way. No problem. I should have been alerted to potential trouble ahead when reports of snow and ice storms in the region started coming in. When I phoned the B&amp;B to confirm we would still be coming, they seemed surprised and told us everyone else had cancelled. Being English, this didn’t occur to me. But as I now know, American weather is different. As the train headed north, it got quieter and quieter. Soon, we were the only passengers. It was absolutely freezing, and we were ill-equipped. We made it to the end of the line, picked up the cheapest hire car on offer, and proceeded to drive to our destination. Or rather tried to drive. With no snow tires on our crappy tin box, we slid all over the icy roads, some of which featured terrifying drops on either side. I genuinely thought we were going to die. I had a panic attack, crouched in the footwell of the passenger seat, which I tried to alleviate by chanting. I have no idea what, but probably something like: “Oh God, please don’t let us die out here.” My boyfriend was stoically silent as he attempted to navigate the unfamiliar terrain and not kill us both. At least that’s how I remember it. He may have told me to shut up and let him concentrate on driving, and he would have been perfectly in his rights to do so. Somehow, we made it the 18 terrifying miles to said charming, and yes, very remote, B&amp;B, and we were indeed the only guests there. A captive audience, it turned out. The place was run by a gay couple, one of whom was sensibly still back in the city. The remaining proprietor took a keen interest in us, plying us with cocktails and nibbles. Relieved not to be in the death car any more, and emboldened by alcohol, I naively enquired how we could obtain dinner – thinking that given the magnitude of the weather disaster we were experiencing, we would generously be offered some sort of sustenance. “There’s a pizza place a few miles away. They don’t deliver,” he said. Upon realising we would have to get back on the road, I am unashamed to say I cried. And I can’t even drive. So we took a deep breath and went up to our room to freshen up, for we were starving and after a near-death experience pizza sounded just the ticket. Either the walls of the B&amp;B were thin or the physics of sound travelling were affected by the absence of any other guests, but right there in our room, we could clearly hear the proprietor on the phone to his partner – and he was telling him everything about us. What I was doing in New York, what my boyfriend’s job was, how we had travelled to the B&amp;B, how we had asked for dinner … If things weren’t uncomfortable enough before, they certainly were now. But we duly went to the pizza place, which was charming and wood-panelled, and we lost ourselves in food and wine. The next morning, we started afresh. It was romantic, even if we felt like hostages. There was crisp, blinding white snow all around, beautiful valleys and the Catskill mountains. We went to an outdoor store, got properly equipped with snow-boots and warm hats, and went for walks: crunching through snow, marvelling at the views and the fresh air. We made a short, Blair Witch-style film; we had a lot of sex. And we saw baby eagles through the telescope on the deck set up to view the nest – an amazing sight that I will always cherish. The kicker to all this romance came at cocktail hour on the second and last night, however. I had relaxed somewhat into our hostage situation, and my guard was down. If our host didn’t know literally everything about me from the first cocktail hour, he certainly did now. He sidled up to me as I was helping myself to some more spiced nuts. “Honey,” he said, “he is never going to marry you. Never.” I was too taken aback and too polite, young and English to say anything much at all. I tried to casually shake it off, but his words burned into me. I didn’t tell my boyfriend. Long-distance relationships are hard. We had been fighting a lot. But I loved my boyfriend with a fiery intensity, and was planning to go back to the UK and move in with him. He was seven years older than me, with a grownup job, a grownup house, and generally a life I hoped I could be part of. He represented stability, success – and yes, I did want to get married, although I don’t remember telling our host that, and certainly not in front of my boyfriend. I felt ashamed somehow – caught out, as if my desire for solidity, for togetherness, for marriage was emblazoned on my forehead. But of course he was right. Our relationship ended up an utter fireball of disaster. There were breakups, there were reunions, and eventually I left him. But still, we’ll always have the Catskills."

          "bodyText": "Hello and thanks for following along. We will be closing today’s Covid blog but you can keep up with all the latest coronavirus news here. Paris, France, is set to reimpose wearing face masks outdoors again in this week in a bid to slow the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, French police said on Wednesday. The mandate will apply from Friday to everyone over the age of 11 except those inside vehicles, cyclists, users of two-wheeled transport like scooters and those doing sport, Paris police HQ said in a statement. France reported a new record-high daily Covid-19 case total of 208,000 on Wednesday as Omicron drives infections up after Christmas. “I wouldn’t call Omicron a wave anymore... I would call it a tidal wave,” said French Health Minister Olivier Veran. The government has announced new restrictions including an extension on the closure of nightclubs and encouraging more remote working. However it has so far shied away from mass closures or lockdowns seen in other EU countries such as the Netherlands. Hello it’s Samantha Lock here taking over from my colleague Leonie Chao-Fong. As I’m reporting to you from Sydney here is a snapshot of how Covid is unfolding across Australia. Victoria has recorded 5,137 new Covid-19 cases and 13 deaths while NSW recorded 12,226 new cases and one death. Prime minister Scott Morrison has pinned responsibility for sourcing RATs on the states ahead of a national cabinet meeting today where premiers are expected to make a national definition of a close contact. Confused anti-vaccine protesters entered a test-and-trace centre in Milton Keynes, England on Wednesday, appearing to believe it was a coronavirus vaccine centre, where they were filmed shouting abuse at staff and appearing to steal equipment. Video shared on social media showed the group of several dozen activists, led by former Ukip candidate Jeff Wyatt, walking through the facility holding signs encouraging people not to get vaccinated and criticising the BBC. Wyatt, a former deputy leader of the far-right For Britain Movement, addressed crowds at a rally held before the storming of the Covid-19 testing site, where he claimed there are “millions” of like-minded anti-vaccine activists who have “woken up”. Piers Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, could not be seen in the footage but was pictured attending other stops during the so-called Freedom Rally including an invasion of the Milton Keynes Theatre. Protesters were filmed walking towards the NHS test-and-trace centre while a man on a loudspeaker claims that it is where the “vaccine rollout” is taking place as activists walk by a sign that reads “Testing”. Other demonstrators are heard shouting “disgrace” and “shame on you” as staff appear to run away and take shelter in offices. Read the full article here: Today’s reported figure surpasses the country’s previous all-time high of 41,080 cases recorded in May. Argentina’s health ministry also reported a further 26 deaths in the latest 24 hour period, Reuters reports. “We are at a very high level of contagion ... in the federal capital and Greater Buenos Aires the situation is serious,” local doctor Rodrigo Salemi told television. New York City is exhausted, beleaguered and riddled with coronavirus thanks to the Omicron variant, according to the New York Times. The state reported a record high of 67,000 positive cases on Tuesday and a steady increase in hospitalisations over the past week. One New York City subway line was suspended today and many others were running with delays because so many workers were off sick. At least 20 testing centres were closed because of staffing shortages and nearly one in three paramedics are currently off sick. More than 110,000 people have tested positive just since Christmas Day, and in some neighbourhoods in the city, the positivity rate is approaching 30%. Libya has confirmed its first cases of the Omicron variant, health officials said. The National Center for Disease Control did not provide any further details including the number of people who were found to have the variant. The centre reported 665 new cases and nine deaths in the latest 24-hour period, bringing the country’s total to 387,540 cases and 5,685 deaths. France has registered a national and European record for new coronavirus infections as the Omicron variant fuels a surge in cases across the continent, with multiple countries hitting new highs. France on Wednesday reported 208,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, up from its previous record of almost 180,000 set the day before. “This means that 24 hours a day, day and night, every second in our country, two French people are diagnosed positive for the coronavirus,” said the health minister, Olivier Véran. “We have never experienced such a situation,” he said, calling the increase “dizzying”. He said the situation in France’s hospitals was already worrying because of the Delta variant. Although the “massive wave” of Omicron cases had yet to have an impact on the healthcare system, he said it would inevitably do so eventually. The UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Greece have all reported new case records this week, while beyond Europe the rolling seven-day average of new cases in the US hit a high of 267,000 on Tuesday, with Omicron accounting for 59% of these. Read the full article by my colleagues Jon Henley and Angela Giuffrida here: More than 44,000 people in the US could die of Covid-19 in the next four weeks, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) showed at least 821,251 people have died of Covid-19 in the United States. The CDC forecast, published today, estimates that could rise to 866,000 deaths reported by 22 January. The forecast could mean an average of up to 1,800 deaths per day, up from a current average of 1,523 each day, CNN reports. The CDC included projections indicating that the quickest rise in deaths may happen in early January, with the average slowing after 22 January. Ireland has confirmed 16,428 new cases today, representing the country’s highest daily figure since the pandemic began. The previous record was 13,765 cases reported on 25 December. As of 8am on Wednesday, 568 people were in hospital with the virus, 93 of whom are in intensive care. That is a sharp rise on 378 people in hospital on 25 December. In a statement, Ireland’s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, said: All of the latest epidemiological indicators are a cause of concern. Given the very high levels of transmission nationwide, every individual should consider themselves potentially infectious, and strictly adhere to the public health measures. It comes as Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said that infections fuelled by the Omicron variant will remain very high for the “next few days” but should peak “in the next week or so”. Turkey recorded 36,684 new cases today, the highest number of daily infections since 29 April, health ministry data showed. The country also recorded a further 142 deaths from the virus. Today’s reported caseload is more than 4,500 up from the previous day when 32,176 cases were reported. Tuesday also marked the first time the country exceeded 30,000 daily cases since 19 October. “Due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, it can be seen we are now entering a rising trend,” Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter yesterday, urging people to get vaccinated and receive their booster shots. Last week, Turkey’s domestically developed Covid-19 vaccine, Turkovac, received emergency use authorisation from Turkish authorities. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over from Lucy Campbell to bring you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. We’ll start in Belgium, where theatres, cinemas and concert halls are set to reopen after a court ruling found that entertainment venues were being unfairly singled out amid new restrictions intended to stem the spread of the Omicron variant. The move followed protests by the cultural sector angry that it was being made to close its doors while bars and restaurants were allowed to keep working. On Tuesday, the country’s highest administrative court suspended the decision to shut down the cultural sector, ruling that the government had not shown “how cultural venues are particularly dangerous to human health and life in so far as they promote the spread of the coronavirus, to the extent that it is necessary to order their closure.” In a statement today, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo said: “We continue to follow closely the evolution of the pandemic in our country where Omicron is dominant.” A leading figure at the World Health Organisation has said it is not “advisable” to reduce Covid controls, including self-isolation periods, as increasing case numbers spiral across the globe. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, warned that governments need to be “careful” about reducing restrictions in the light of the Omicron variant. At present in England, people who receive negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven of their self-isolation period – with tests taken 24 hours apart – no longer have to stay indoors for a full 10 days. But calls are growing on the UK government to cut this further after the US slashed its self-isolation period to five days for asymptomatic people when the US Centres for Disease Control said most transmission of the virus happens in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop. Speaking at a WHO press conference on Wednesday, Dr Ryan said: Even with the previous variants, most people will incubate and show symptoms or be positive within that first six days or so, and the chances then of being positive or transmitting the disease after that are lower – but it is then for governments to make that judgment call of when to allow people out of a quarantine situation with extra tests. The most important thing at this moment is we need to be careful about changing tactics and strategies immediately on the basis of what we’re seeing in early Omicron data. ‘Oh, it’s less severe’ – maybe it’s not; ‘It’s more transmissible’ – maybe it is, but we have to wait and see if the vaccines work or they don’t work, we have to wait and see, and I think it will be advisable at this point if we don’t see huge shifts, huge moves in reducing control measures for Covid-19 purely on the basis of initial and preliminary studies. On Tuesday, Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers – the membership organisation for NHS trusts in England – said many in the health service now fear staff shortages caused by people isolating could represent a “bigger challenge” than the number of patients needing treatment for Covid. In a statement on Wednesday, he said: Given the current pressures on NHS services due to staff absences, trust leaders are keen that everything possible is done, as quickly as possible, to maximise rapid safe return of staff to work. That includes ensuring appropriate timely access to both PCR and lateral flow testing, both of which are currently proving problematic for some trusts. Others have emphasised a need for an evidence-led approach. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation – a membership body for organisations that commission and provide NHS services – acknowledged staff absence “is a huge issue for the NHS right now”, but said the case for amending isolation rules further needs to be made clear. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Taylor said: The government, with scientific advice, has to make an assessment of the balance of risk here, but it’s important to recognise that there are risks to anything that we do, and if we were to reduce to five days that would have to be based on very clear evidence that it is not going to increase the rate of infection. Healthcare unions have lambasted Québec’s decision to allow some asymptomatic workers infected with Covid to stay on the job, even as an infectious disease specialist warned more Canadian provinces may be forced into similar steps as Omicron surges. Québec said on Tuesday it had no choice but to allow some essential healthcare staff to continue working instead of isolating at home after testing positive, to prevent staff shortages from crippling healthcare services. A number of unions said they are worried the decision will put healthcare networks under further strain, and workers and patients at risk. “The network is not prepared to face the risks of the government’s decision to bring asymptomatic infected staff back to work. Right now, we are not even able to test staff in their workplace,” said Réjean Leclerc, president of the Fédération de la santé et des services sociaux, which represents 120,000 public and private sector healthcare workers in the province. Leclerc called for better testing for workers and improved ventilation in hospitals. “We cannot subscribe to this decision which endangers the health and safety not only of our members, but above all of the vulnerable people to whom they must provide essential care and services,” the Alliance of Professional and Technical Personnel in Health and Social Services said in a social media post. The union represents 60,000 workers in public health and social services institutions across Québec. Provinces across Canada, including heavily populated Québec and Ontario, are reporting new daily Covid case records as the highly infectious Omicron variant takes hold, forcing ten of thousands of people into isolation. Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto, said on Wednesday other provinces were likely discussing similar measures to help tackle staffing shortages in hospitals. “Every jurisdiction in the northern hemisphere is dealing with the same problem. The clear reality is we will not be able to function by keeping everyone isolated for 10 days,” he said. Morris said he was not aware of other jurisdictions allowing infected healthcare staff to work, but noted that Norway had already shortened its isolation period during a wave of the Delta variant earlier this winter. US health authorities on Monday also shortened the recommended isolation time for Americans with asymptomatic cases of Covid to five days from the previous guidance of 10 days. Spain has also reduced its self-isolation period from 10 to seven days, even as the number of new infections recorded in the country hits record highs. *I’m grateful to reader Ed for flagging this. Here is my colleague Nicola Davis’s full report on the UK’s latest reported figures, which is the first time since 24 December that data on daily case numbers has been made available for all four nations. The UK has reported another 183,037 Covid cases and a further 57 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the government’s coronavirus dashboard. That is a new record high and more than 50,000 higher than the previous record. The caseload figure breaks down to 138,287 new infections in England, 15,849 in Scotland, 5,929 in Wales, and 22,972 in Northern Ireland. The reported figures for Northern Ireland within that data set cover a 5-day period. The figures reported on Wednesday are compared to 138,831 infections and 19 fatalities recorded in the 24 hours prior. Italy reported another fresh record daily tally of Covid cases on Wednesday, with new cases hitting 98,030, up from 78,313 a day earlier, the health ministry said. The number of coronavirus-related deaths fell to 148 from 202 on Tuesday. Italy has registered 137,091 deaths linked to Covid since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after the UK and the ninth highest in the world. The country has reported 5.85 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid - not including those in intensive care - stood at 10,578 on Wednesday, up from 10,089 a day earlier. There were 126 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 119 on Tuesday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,185 from a previous 1,145. Spain has reduced its Covid self-isolation period to seven days, even as the number of new infections recorded in the country hits record highs. Previously those who tested positive had to isolate for 10 days. On Wednesday the country’s health ministry said that the new, shortened isolation period would also apply to non-vaccinated people who are in close contact with Covid cases. The Spanish decision follows similar moves in countries such as the United States and England, where businesses had voiced fears that the fast-spreading Omicron variant would leave them with mounting staff shortages. On Tuesday the number of cases in Spain hit an all-time pandemic high after nearly 100,000 cases were reported in the span of 24 hours. The surge sent the 14-day infection rate soaring to 1,360 cases per 100,000 residents, though hospitals appeared to be under less strain than previous waves of the pandemic. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, was confident that the country’s high vaccination rate – hovering around 80% of the population – would translate into a milder wave this time around. “We are obviously going to see high numbers of infections, but not hospitalisations and ICU admissions compared to previous waves,” he told reporters earlier this week. Portugal reported a new record of 26,867 Covid cases over the last 24 hours on Wednesday, up from 17,172 the previous day, although daily deaths dropped to a fraction of early 2021 peaks. Health authority DGS registered 12 fatalities, down from 19 on Tuesday, while the number of patients in intensive care units was steady at 151. In late January, the number of daily deaths exceeded 300 and there were more than 900 patients in intensive care. Portugal has one of the world’s highest Covid vaccination rates with around 87% of its 10-million population fully inoculated, but the fast-spreading Omicron variant has caused the recent surge in cases, amplified by an increase in mass testing. The 14-day infection rate jumped to 923 cases per 100,000 people from 804 reported on Tuesday. The health minister, Marta Temido, warned on Tuesday that the country could reach as many as 37,000 daily cases in the first week of January, although recently imposed restrictions should have a dampening effect. Before Christmas, the government ordered nightclubs and bars to close and told people to work from home for at least two weeks. After decades of decline and with the public wary of human interaction amid Covid fears, vending machines are back in fashion in Japan, writes my colleague Justin McCurry. Here is his report: More than 90% of community Covid cases in England are the now Omicron variant, according to the latest data from the UK Health Security Agency. As it is now by far the dominant variant, the UKHSA said it would stop providing Omicron-specific daily updates from 31 December. Scotland has already stopped reporting Omicron cases separately from other Covid cases in daily reports. Another 39,923 Omicron cases were detected across the UK as of Wednesday, the second-highest daily figure so far, taking the total number of Omicron cases identified in the country to 210,122. As we reported earlier, the US has broken its record for daily coronavirus infections, as the Omicron variant has surpassed Delta in distribution across much of the country amid a massive surge. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 267,000 on Tuesday, beating its January 2021 record of 251,232, according to a New York Times database. Here is my colleague Edward Helmore’s report: Cuba will give booster shots to its entire population in January, according to a report in state-run media, in a bid to keep the highly contagious Omicron variant at bay. Health authorities in the island, heavily dependent on tourism, last week reported a 35% week-on-week rise in coronavirus cases. As of Tuesday, they had registered at least 44 cases of Omicron, though both infections and deaths from Covid-19 remain at 1% of their pandemic peak on 22 August, according to statistics compiled by the online database Our World in Data. The health minister, José Angel Portal Miranda, said the threat from Omicron had prompted Cuba to fast-track its booster campaign, and that all those eligible would have a booster shot in January, according to the state news outlet CubaDebate. Cuba has already administered nearly 1.5 million boosters in the capital Havana, and to high risk groups such as health care workers. That campaign will now spread across the island in the coming weeks. The country has vaccinated 92% of its population with at least one shot, and 85% with a full course, of its homegrown vaccines, according to Our World in Data. That puts it second in the world behind only the United Arab Emirates, among countries of at least 1 million people. Cuba has vaulted ahead of its neighbours in Latin America and other emerging economies by developing its own vaccines instead of competing for those produced by wealthier nations. Officials say Cuba’s protein-based shots - Abdala, Soberana 02 and Soberana Plus - give upwards of 90% protection against symptomatic Covid when offered in three-dose schemes, though those claims have yet to be fully vetted in peer-reviewed journals, or by the World Health Organization. Cuban scientists had previously called for boosters to be given six months after the first three shots, but have now halved that time, the CubaDebate report said. The German health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said on Wednesday that the number of new Covid cases has been under-reported and the actual incidence rate of infections is about two or three times higher than the officially reported figure, Reuters reports. Lauterbach said the under-reporting was due to fewer tests being performed at workplaces and at doctors practices during the holiday season, as well as only a few of those test results being submitted to authorities. Lauterbach also expressed concern about a clear rise in cases of the Omicron variant and appealed to people to celebrate the new year only in small groups. Hajo Zeeb of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology also expressed doubts over the accuracy of Germany’s reported figures for the coronavirus and the Omicron variant. “The figures now are certainly under-reported,” he told the media group RND. The Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases on Wednesday reported 2,686 new cases of Omicron, bringing the total number to 13,129. Four people have died with the variant. The seven-day incidence rate, which has been a key metric for determining coronavirus policy, was reported as 205.5 cases per 100,000 residents, the lowest figure since early November. This translated into 40,043 new cases over the past 24 hours. In neighbouring France, by comparison, authorities on Wednesday reported 208,000 new cases [see 2.31pm.]. A spokesperson for the German health ministry said earlier on Wednesday that the government expects a clearer picture of the infection situation early next year. “The number of infections is an important indicator, but of course it’s not the only one,” the spokesperson said. The sinking incidence rate comes despite repeated warnings by health officials of an impending fifth wave of infections. The health ministry confirmed on Tuesday that Germany is buying 1m packs of Paxlovid from Pfizer, which has said that the pill cuts by 89% the chance of hospitalisation or death for adults at risk of severe disease. The simultaneous circulation of the Delta and Omicron variants is creating a “tsunami of cases”, the World Health Organization (WHO) director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a news briefing on Wednesday. “Delta and Omicron are now twin threats driving up cases to record numbers, leading to spikes in hospitalisation and deaths,” he said. “I am highly concerned that Omicron, being highly transmissible and spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases.” Tedros repeated his call for countries to share vaccines more equitably and warned that the emphasis on boosters in richer countries could leave poorer nations short of jabs. He said the WHO was campaigning for every country to hit a target of 70% vaccine coverage by the middle of 2022, which would help end the acute phase of the pandemic. New Year’s Eve will mark the second anniversary of China alerting the WHO to 27 cases of “viral pneumonia” of unknown origin in the city of Wuhan. More than 281 million people have since been reported to be infected by the virus globally and more than 5 million have died, according to a Reuters tally. Bosnia has identified its first 10 Omicron infections and there are very likely more, with the highly transmissible variant expected to become dominant in the next couple of months, health officials said on Wednesday. Goran Čerkez, the assistant health minister in Bosnia’s autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, said the 10 cases were discovered in tests by the Clinical Centre of Sarajevo University. “We have no doubt that Omicron has been already circulating in Bosnia and that it will become the dominant variant in the next couple of months,” Čerkez told Reuters. Administratively fragmented Bosnia does not have a national health ministry but instead has 13 regional governments and ministries, each of which releases its own statistics. Official statistics suggest that only about 30% of Bosnians have been inoculated against Covid. However, Čerkez said he believed the number was far higher because the figures did not take into account a mass exodus of Bosnians in recent years. France is seeing a record rise in Covid infections, with 208,000 new cases reported over the past 24 hours, a national and European record, the health minister, Olivier Véran, told lawmakers on Wednesday. France has been breaking Covid records repeatedly over the past few days, with Tuesday’s 180,000 cases already the highest for a country in Europe, according to data on Covidtracker.fr. Every second, two people in France are testing positive for Covid, Véran said, adding that the situation in hospitals was worrying because of the Delta variant, with Omicron yet to have an impact. The flu will further complicate things for hospitals, he said. Earlier we reported that, amid the record surge in infections, the French government was accelerating introduction of the so-called vaccine pass to increase pressure on the unvaccinated to get the jab. [see 1.20pm.]. The Scottish government has resisted pressure from businesses and opposition parties to cut the isolation period from 10 to seven days, and will only decide next week, Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs. Opposition and business leaders have urged the first minister to follow England’s lead by allowing infected people to leave self-isolation after seven days after a negative PCR test, arguing that would relieve the heavy pressure on businesses and services from staff absences. Sturgeon agreed there was a clear need to limit staff absences. John Swinney, her deputy, indicted in media interviews on Wednesday that changes were being considered. However, Sturgeon said the government would not make a final decision until next week: ministers wanted to greatly increase booster vaccinations first. So far, 75% of eligible Scots had had their booster jabs, five points short of the 80% target set for Friday, 31 December. She said: If Covid continues to spread rapidly, the economic impact in the form of staff absences and diminished consumer confidence will be severe. We’re already seeing those impacts. So doing nothing won’t help business. We must protect public health and the economy together - by slowing the speed at which Covid is spreading, while we complete the booster programme. [These] are finely balanced judgments and we are considering the current trends in infection carefully. However, I confirm that we hope to reach decisions in the next week with any changes taking effect from 5 January. She said extra effort was being made to prioritise PRC testing for exempt workers, those in critical NHS or transport roles, who may be allowed to end self-isolation early. Greece is introducing new restrictions on the hospitality sector from Thursday, bringing forward measures planned for early January as coronavirus infections surge. The decision came a day after authorities announced a new daily record of 21,657 cases, more than double compared with Monday. Authorities said the highly contagious Omicron variant appeared to be dominant in the community, barely a month after it was first detected. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants will have to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music, with the exception of New Year’s Eve when then can stay open until 2am. “These measures, if they are applied in our entirety, will allow us from mid January to go back to our normal lives,” the health minister, Thanos Plevris, told a news conference. Authorities had also tightened curbs last week, mandating masks in open spaces and banning Christmas and new year festivities in public places. Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs that Scotland recorded a record 15,849 Covid cases on Tuesday, with around 80% of them believed to be the new highly-infectious Omicron variant. As she began an emergency update to the Scottish parliament, the first minister said the positive cases comprised 29% of all tests carried out yesterday. The previous record, also attributed to Omicron, came on Sunday this week, when 11,030 cases were reported. She said 679 people were in hospital, an increase in 80 on yesterday’s total, with three deaths reported of people confirmed to have had Covid. She said over the past week, the number of cases had risen by 47%. She told MSPs: We should also bear in mind that any transmission over recent days will not yet be fully evident in the reported figures. It is reasonable to assume therefore that we will continue to see steep increases in cases in the days and possibly weeks ahead. Boris Johnson has urged people to get their booster vaccine as he said up to 90% of those in intensive care had not had their third Covid jabs. On a visit to a vaccine centre in Milton Keynes, the UK prime minister said people should enjoy their new year celebrations while taking extra precautions such as ventilation and testing, and he urged people to take up the offer of a third dose. “I’m sorry to say this but the overwhelming majority of people who are currently ending up in intensive care in our hospitals are people who are not boosted,” he said. “I’ve talked to doctors who say the numbers are running up to 90% of people in intensive care.” He added: If you’re not vaccinated, you’re eight times more likely to get into hospital altogether. So it’s a great thing to do. It’s very, very important. Get boosted for yourself, and enjoy new year sensibly and cautiously. The NHS has called on people to have a “jabby new year”, highlighting research from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) that found that at the start of last month about three out of five patients in London’s intensive care units (ICU) had not received a jab, a figure that it said was rising. Johnson, who spent the Christmas break at Chequers with his family, suggested people should take tests before heading out for new year events, but the system has been dogged by shortages. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said the situation was “a total shambles”. He said: People are trying to do the right thing, follow the government’s own advice and test themselves regularly, but are prevented by the Conservative government’s incompetence. They need to get a grip and provide enough tests so people can keep themselves and everyone else safe. Read the full story here: Up to 90% of Covid patients in ICU are unboosted, says Boris Johnson Three people have died in Ukraine after a candle lit in memory of a patient who died of Covid set fire to an intensive care unit, officials said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, a hospital employee in Kosiv, a western town on the edge of the Carpathian mountains, lit a candle in memory of a recently deceased patient according to local tradition, the emergencies services said. The candle was lit in the hospital’s intensive care unit where five oxygen concentrators had been operating, with equipment instantly catching fire. “Ignorance of the elementary laws of physics and disregard for safety rules have led to irreparable losses,” the emergencies services said, describing the incident as a “terrible mistake”. Three people - including two patients - were killed. Four other people were treated for severe burns. Malta registered a record number of Covid infections on Wednesday as the United States added the island to its highest-risk category for travel and urged its citizens not to visit. Health authorities said 1,337 new cases were detected, marking a record high for the second day in a row. It is the fifth time in eight days that the number of new daily infections hit a national record. However, hospitalisations remained low at just 82. The US Centers for Disease Control advised against travel to Malta late on Tuesday, placing the country at the level 4, “very high” category, where more than 500 cases per 100,000 residents are registered in the previous 28 days. “Because of the current situation in Malta, even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk of getting and spreading Covid-19 variants,” the advisory said. The increase in infections came despite a high rate of vaccination, with 95% of Malta residents having received two doses of a vaccine. The island is currently vaccinating children aged over five. The health minister, Chris Fearne, also said on Tuesday that 200,000 out of a population of some 500,000 - had already had a booster dose. Business lobby groups on Wednesday urged the government to reduce a two-week quarantine period for patients and those who come into contact with them, saying it was impacting the economy. The Times of Malta newspaper reported that at least 20,000 people were currently in quarantine, four times the population of the capital, Valletta. France’s government is forging ahead with efforts to increase pressure on unvaccinated people to get Covid jabs, as the Omicron variant fuels a record surge in infections, the Associated Press reports. At a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday afternoon, the health minister will defend a government plan to allow only the fully vaccinated to enjoy continued access to places such as restaurants, cinemas, theatres, museums, and sports arenas. The accelerated introduction of the so-called “vaccine pass” forms part of a government strategy to use vaccinations, rather than new lockdowns, to try to soften the impact of the fast-spreading omicron variant on already overburdened hospitals. France reported nearly 180,000 new cases of Covid on Tuesday, a record, and is bracing for that number to keep increasing, with forecasts warning of more than 250,000 daily infections likely by January. France has vaccinated more than 75% of its population and is rushing out booster shots, again to combat Omicron. But more than 4 million adults remain unvaccinated. The government wants the vaccine pass to be in place by mid-January. If approved by parliament, its introduction will mean that unvaccinated people will no longer be able to use negative test results to access places where the vaccine pass is required. The Belgian government was set to reverse course on Wednesday by allowing theatres to reopen after a court suspended their closure ordered a week ago to stem the surge in infections from the Omicron variant, Reuters reports. The ruling from the Council of State did not cover cinemas, but the government says they too can reopen because they operate like theatres, with audiences seated and obliged to wear masks and only allowed in with a Covid pass to prove vaccination, a negative test or a recent recovery. Georges Gilkinet, the mobility minister, said in a tweet that the government had agreed to both opening. A final decision will be taken by ministers and regional chiefs later on Wednesday. Other indoor venues, such as casinos and bowling alleys, will remain closed. The prime minister, Alexander De Croo’s, government and regional chiefs decided last week to close cinemas and theatres and play sporting fixtures behind closed doors, while allowing bars, restaurants, gyms and other indoor sports venues to continue as before. Belgium has seen infections fall since a late November peak, but Omicron cases are rapidly rising, and now make up well over half of all Covid cases. The country has recorded 881 cases per 100,000 people over past two weeks, less than half November’s peak. For readers in the UK, walk-in PCR tests appear to be available to book once again in most parts of the country on the government’s website here. UK new year celebrations should be ‘cautious and sensible’, warns Boris Johnson – video Daily coronavirus infections in the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf region’s tourism and commercial hub, have risen above 2,000 for the first time since June, Reuters reports. Authorities on Wednesday recorded 2,234 new infections in the past 24 hours, without breaking down the cases by variant. The UAE, which is hosting the Dubai Expo 2020 world fair, announced its first known case of the Omicron variant earlier this month. Daily cases had fallen below 100 in October but started to climb again in December as tourists flocked to Dubai in the holiday period. The UAE, a federation of seven emirates, saw daily infections hit a record near 4,000 last January amid the peak tourism season as millions of visitors travelled to Dubai to escape lockdowns at home. Abu Dhabi this week reimposed restrictions requiring those entering the emirate from within the UAE to show proof of vaccination and negative PCR results, as of Thursday. It also instituted remote learning for the first two weeks of the new school term. Dubai, which is hosting the Expo until the end of March and whose economy relies heavily on the travel industry, has not yet reintroduced restrictions that were largely lifted in mid-2020. Mask-wearing in public has remained mandatory in the UAE, which does not give a breakdown of Covid cases for each emirate. Chinese officials have admitted they have faced challenges getting enough supplies to residents in locked-down Xi’an, after the city’s inhabitants took to social media to complain they didn’t have enough food and to call for help, AFP reports. Thirteen million residents in northern Xi’an are in their seventh day of home confinement, and national health officials have called for measures to be strengthened further as China battles its worst virus surge in months. Beijing has followed a strict “zero Covid” strategy involving tight border restrictions and targeted lockdowns since the virus first surfaced in late 2019. But officials admitted at a press conference on Wednesday that “low staff attendance and difficulties in logistics and distribution” had led to trouble providing essential supplies as the country faces a resurgence in infections. A day before, many residents asked on social media for help acquiring food and other essentials, with some saying their housing compounds would not let them out even though they were running out of food. Xi’an official Chen Jianfeng told reporters that the local government has mobilised enterprises to step up community distribution, with cadres supervising wholesale markets and supermarkets. “We’re trying our best to assist in the problem of staff turnout, and are issuing passes for vehicles that guarantee the supply of necessities,” he said. But some were still struggling with supplies. “How do we live? What do we eat?” one user wrote on Weibo. “Days ago, we could go out once to buy groceries but that’s been cancelled... all online grocery apps are either sold out or beyond the delivery range,” the user added. The city stepped up confinement measures on Monday, with many residents told not to leave their homes except for virus testing - after previously being told they could go out once every three days to buy supplies. Authorities had previously insisted that supplies remain stable as they maintain strict controls of movement into and out of Xi’an. The city has logged over 960 domestic virus cases since 9 December. Although the surge in China is low in comparison with caseloads in Europe and the United States, Chinese officials imposed what they have called the “strictest” possible curbs in Xi’an. Authorities have also detained at least seven people in the city over attempting to skip quarantine, disrupting order and spreading rumours, local media said. Calls for a reduction in England’s Covid self-isolation period from seven days to five in order to ease NHS staff shortages have been dismissed by a government minister. Chloe Smith, the minister for disabled people, health and work, said the previous period of 10 days had only recently been cut by three. That came after a senior NHS official warned that staff absences due to Covid over the winter months – exacerbating the underlying shortages – was likely to pose the NHS a bigger problem than the number of Omicron-related patients being hospitalised. “There are no current plans in England to change that period,” Smith told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. “Of course, we have actually only recently taken it down from 10 to seven, and we want to look at that – we want to make sure that that is working as we believe it ought to. “We think the current period, therefore, is the right one, so we haven’t any plans to change that further.” On Tuesday, US health authorities halved the recommended isolation time for people with asymptomatic Covid to five days. A leading immunologist suggested the UK could follow a similar path if rapid testing capacity and quality could support it. Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and the government’s life sciences adviser, said illness associated with Omicron was proving less severe than with previous variants. “My view is that lateral flow tests are quite a good way of marking who is infectious and who isn’t and, as you know, we’ve dropped from 10 days to seven days if you have sequential lateral flow tests. That is a much better way to measure and quantitate whether we are allowing people to go back into the community who are infectious,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday. Asked if he thought that should lead to a further cut to the self-isolation period in England, he said: “If it was supported by lateral flow data, yes.” Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told Today that a decrease in the self-isolation period would help ease the staffing crisis. But he acknowledged that ministers needed to carefully balance that against the risk of increasing transmission. More here: Minister rejects calls to reduce self-isolation to five days in England Scottish revellers planning to travel to English cities for Hogmanay celebrations have been urged to stay at home, to avoid spreading the Omicron variant. John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said travelling to England to bypass the closure of all nightclubs in Scotland would be the “wrong course of action” and went against the spirit of Scottish policy. “People are free to take those decisions, but I would discourage them from doing so,” Swinney said on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. “I think it is the wrong course of action for people to take because we have a serious situation we have got to manage and we encourage everybody to play their part in addressing that.” Swinney, the Scottish government’s Covid response minister, said the rate of spread of Omicron was “alarming” and rising far faster than any previous variant. Earlier this week, Scotland reported its highest ever number of daily cases reported on Sunday, at 11,030. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon is due to update the Scottish parliament later on Wednesday and may unveil further restrictions. She said the country should be braced for even more cases in the near future. The Scottish government ordered all nightclubs to close for at least three weeks from 27 December in an effort to suppress the latest waves. At the same time, outdoor events were limited to 500 people. The country’s main open-air Hogmanay and New Year’s Day events, including the street party and concerts organised in Edinburgh, have been cancelled. With Omicron infections surging, Scottish ministers have urged people to limit any celebrations to a maximum of three family groups. Swinney said he was asking for voluntary restraint, but his request echoes restrictions on travel over the Scotland-England border in July 2020 after a significant outbreak in the Dumfries area, with linked cases in Carlisle. That led to Sturgeon ordering people not to travel further than five miles from home. Swinney said: People have got to make their own choices, they have got to follow the advice we put in place. We have the power in Scotland to put in place certain restrictions and we have done those on what we consider to be a proportionate and appropriate basis. Read the full story here: Scottish revellers urged not to travel to England for New Year’s Eve A lack of lateral flow tests (LFTs) in UK pharmacies is a “huge” problem as people have been requesting them every five minutes over the Christmas period, providers have warned. Leyla Hannbeck, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, said a lack of LFT kits over Christmas and new year had put those “doing the responsible thing” in an impossible situation. “What our members are telling us is that demand for the lateral flow tests is very high at the moment due to the current guidelines around self-isolation. Pharmacies are reporting that every five minutes, approximately, somebody comes into the pharmacy asking for a test,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. She went on: But, unfortunately, because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent, it means that those who come for the test don’t always get it, which is very stressful; not just for the pharmacy team, but for the patient. The scale of the problem is huge because the demand is high, because of the current guidelines. People are doing the responsible thing by wanting to be tested. And we are in the Christmas area of time and the new year is just around the corner and people want to be with family and friends. Current rules in England allow anyone who has tested positive to cut their self-isolation from 10 days to seven if they have negative LFTs on days six and seven. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the self-isolation period for those who test positive remains 10 days. The UK Health Security Agency has said nearly 900,000 test kits are being provided each day, double the supply before 18 December. The government’s policy has driven demand for LFTs in England, adding to the seasonal demand throughout the UK among those wanting to see family and friends over Christmas, and the underlying testing requirements. Read the full report here: Lack of lateral flow tests is ‘huge’ problem, UK pharmacies warn The average number of daily Covid cases in the US has hit a record high of 258,312 over the past seven days, a Reuters tally showed, as officials weigh the impact of the more transmissible Omicron variant. The previous peak for the seven-day moving average was a figure of 250,141 recorded on 8 January of this year. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, Rochelle Walensky, in a round of television interviews, said she was watching the nation’s case load and its potential impact on health care providers. Meanwhile, the White House Covid-19 Response Team is scheduled to hold a news conference at 11am. While there was some data from other countries that showed less disease with Omicron, it was too early to say what the impact might be across the United States, particularly given its uneven vaccination rates, Walensky told MSNBC. “We may have many, many more cases and so we may still very well see a lot of severe disease in the hospitals,” she said. “What I am focused on now is making sure that we can get through this Omicron surge, that we do so with minimal amount of hospitalisation and severe disease,” she added, pointing to vaccines and booster shots as top tools to curb infections. “We are seeing and expecting even more cases of this Omicron variant,” even if many are mild, she said separately on CNN. States showing the highest daily infection numbers on Tuesday included New York, which reported as many as 40,780 cases, and California, which reported over 30,000. Texas reported more than 17,000 cases and Ohio over 15,000. The Omicron variant was estimated to make up 58.6% of the coronavirus variants circulating in the US as of 25 December, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which represents all NHS community pharmacies in England, says deliveries of lateral flow device test kits to pharmacies have restarted today after four days of no deliveries. Alastair Buxton, director of NHS Services at the PSNC, said: The wholesaler which supplies the LFD test kits to pharmacies, on behalf of the UK Health Security Agency, made its last deliveries on Friday afternoon, following which all deliveries were paused until this morning, when they fully re-opened, as all pharmacies also returned to their normal opening hours. Many pharmacies were open over the four-day Christmas break, but as deliveries of medicines and LFD kits would not be made during that period, it is likely that their supply of test kits will once again have been exhausted. More stock of test kits will have been delivered to pharmacies this morning and they will be able to order more for delivery tomorrow and on Friday. Good morning from New Orleans. I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next eight hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ British prime minister Boris Johnson said the vaccination campaign had allowed England to maintain its current level of coronavirus controls. He said: The Omicron variant continues to cause real problems. You are seeing cases rising in hospitals. But it is obviously milder than the Delta variant and we are able to proceed in the way that we are. That was due to the “huge proportion of the British public” which had been vaccinated. “That is allowing us to go ahead with New Year in the cautious way that we are.” Johnson said people should enjoy the New Year in a “cautious and sensible way”. He said: I cannot stress too much” how important it is to get a booster jab against Covid-19 to be able to enjoy the New Year “sensibly and cautiously” The prime minister said there were 2.4 million eligible double-jabbed people who were yet to take up the offer of a booster. He told reporters: I’m sorry to say this but the overwhelming majority of people who are currently ending up in intensive care in our hospitals are people who are not boosted. I’ve talked to doctors who say the numbers are running up to 90% of people in intensive care, who are not boosted. If you’re not vaccinated, you’re eight times more likely to get into hospital altogether. So it’s a great thing to do. It’s very, very important. Get boosted for yourself, and enjoy New Year sensibly and cautiously. Asked about reports of people travelling across the border from Wales and Scotland into England to celebrate, he told reporters: I think everybody should enjoy New Year but in a cautious and sensible way. Take a test, ventilation, think about others – but above all, get a booster. Boris Johnson said the UK government had looked at the “balance of the risks” on Covid policy. Asked why England had acted differently to the devolved nations, Johnson told reporters: I think that we’ve looked at the balance of the risks together, we generally concert our strategies together, we see the data showing that, yes, the cases are rising and, yes, hospitalisations are rising, but what is making a huge difference is the level of booster resistance or level of vaccine-induced resistance in the population. What we need to do now is really finish off that work. I’ve no doubt at all that by 1 January, by the new year, every adult in the country will have been offered the slot to get a booster. They’ll be given a slot to get one. The question is, are we getting people coming forward to take advantage of those slots? And that’s what needs to happen. Johnson urged people to think about the risk they are running with their own health if they fail to get a booster jab. He told reporters: We’re looking at the data and what we’re seeing is that we’ve got cases certainly going up, we’ve got a lot of cases of Omicron. But, on the other hand, we can see the data about the relative mildness of Omicron. What we can also see is the very, very clear effect of getting those jabs, getting those boosters in particular – and that’s what’s making a huge difference. According to some of the surveys I’ve seen, 90% of the patients in ICU are people who are not boosted. So, think about that. Think about the risk you’re running with your own health if you fail to get a booster. There are no walk-in PCR tests available to book anywhere in England or Northern Ireland. Appointments had been unavailable in every region of the country, although there were some in Scotland and Wales. The NHS website also said no home tests were available either for the general public or for essential workers. On Monday, the UKHSA said the problem was due to “high demand” and the problem only lasted for a few hours before people could book appointments again. A fear of catching Covid-19 is not a protected belief under the Equality Act, a judge has ruled, after a woman claimed she was discriminated against by her employer when she refused to go into work during the pandemic. A tribunal held in Manchester this month heard that the claimant refused to return to her workplace in July 2020 because she had a “genuine fear” of contracting coronavirus and passing it on to her partner, who was at high risk of becoming seriously unwell. Neither the woman nor her employer were named in the judgment. In a statement given to the tribunal, the worker said her employer had refused to pay her and she had suffered financial detriment as a result. She said: I claim this was discrimination on the grounds of this belief in regard to coronavirus and the danger from it to public health. This was at the time of the start of the second wave of Covid-19 and the huge increase in cases of the virus throughout the country. Asked what her belief was, she told the tribunal: “A fear of catching Covid-19 and a need to protect myself and others.” In his ruling, the employment judge Mark Leach said he accepted that the woman had a genuine fear, but he did not believe it met the criteria for a “philosophical belief” that would be protected under section 10 of the Equality Act 2010. Read the full story here: The World Health Organization says the number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide increased by 11% last week compared with the previous week, with the biggest increase in the Americas. The gain followed a gradual increase since October. The UN health agency said in its weekly epidemiological report released late Tuesday that there were nearly 4.99 million newly reported cases around the world from Dec. 20-26, AP reports. Europe accounted for more than half the total, with 2.84 million, though that amounted to only a 3% increase over the previous week. It also had the highest infection rate of any region, with 304.6 new cases per 100,000 residents. WHO said that new cases in the Americas were up 39% to nearly 1.48 million, and the region had the second-highest infection rate with 144.4 new cases per 100,000 residents. The US alone had more than 1.18 million cases, a 34% increase. Reported new cases in Africa were up 7% to nearly 275,000. The agency said that “the overall risk related to the new variant omicron remains very high.” It cited “consistent evidence” that it has a growth advantage over the delta variant, which remains dominant in parts of the world. It noted that a decline in case incidence has been seen in South Africa, and that early data from that country, the UK and Denmark suggest a reduced risk of hospitalisation with omicron. But it said that more data is needed “to understand the clinical markers of severity including the use of oxygen, mechanical ventilation and death, and how severity may be impacted by vaccination and/or prior infection”. WHO said that the number of newly reported deaths worldwide last week was down 4% to 44,680. Any decision to cut the Covid self-isolation period to five days in the UK “would have to be based on very clear evidence” that it will not drive a rise in infections, an NHS leader has said. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, acknowledged staff absence “is a huge issue for the NHS right now” but said the case for amending isolation rules further needs to be made clear. At present, people who receive negative lateral flow results on day six and day seven of their self-isolation period – with tests taken 24 hours apart – no longer have to stay indoors for a full 10 days. Calls are growing on the government to cut this further after the US slashed its self-isolation period to five days if people are not showing symptoms. The US Centres for Disease Control said most transmission of the virus happens in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Taylor suggested he had not seen a process where the evidence on cutting isolation could be assessed. He said: The government, with scientific advice, has to make an assessment of the balance of risk here, but it’s important to recognise that there are risks to anything that we do, and if we were to reduce to five days that would have to be based on very clear evidence that is not going to increase the rate of infection. He pointed to Omicron being a new variant and the fact that Covid hospital admissions are still rising. He said: The news about the acuity of those patients is good. It seems as though they are suffering less bad symptoms, and indeed many people who’ve got Covid are not coming to hospital because of Covid and it’s then been subsequently found out – that’s good. It’s also important to recognise the hospitals are full of people who are very vulnerable and, for those people, even a relatively mild form of the virus can have serious consequences, so whilst anyone in the NHS would be delighted if people were able to come back to work earlier, if they are safe, we need to be absolutely sure that that is the case. Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth also said the government should avoid “rushing into” cutting Covid isolation times. Asked about reducing it to five days, he told Sky News: I think we should always follow the advice of our leading scientists, medical scientists like Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, and I don’t think they’ve given an opinion on this. Let’s see what they say on this before rushing into this. Sajid Javid has criticised the Welsh government for banning parkrun as a measure to control the spread of Covid. The health secretary tweeted: “I can’t see how restricting outdoor exercise in this way is justified or proportionate.” Since 26 December, all outdoor gatherings of 50 or more adults have been prohibited in Wales. The rule has put a temporary stop to Welsh parkruns – free, weekly 5km runs that take place across the world every Saturday at 9am. Junior parkruns, which are for children aged four to 14, can continue. “We know that some Welsh parkrun events regularly have fewer than 50 people attending, however it would take a very small influx (at what is typically a very busy time of year) for them to exceed the limit,” parkrun said in a statement. “We understand that this news will be incredibly disappointing to many Welsh parkrunners, and we’d like to reassure you all that we will do everything we can to bring parkrun events back across Wales as soon as these restrictions are lifted.” The former communities secretary Robert Jenrick called the Welsh decision “madness”. “Having worked with councils to restart parkrun in England this summer, it would be madness to stop it again in Wales or elsewhere,” he tweeted. Read more here: Plaid Cymru has backed Welsh Conservatives’ calls for the Labour-led Welsh government to publish the advice from its scientific advisers on which it has based its post Christmas restrictions. The government has been criticised by many in the hospitality and sporting industries for rules that severely limit how people can celebrate the new year and watch and take part in sporting events. Sajid Javid, the UK health secretary, joined the attacks after Parkrun cancelled its free, 5km runs in Wales because of a rule banning more than 50 people gathering together. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, the Plaid leader, Adam Price, said he supported the Welsh administration’s cautious approach but said: “I agree we should be seeing more up to date information on the advice. We need to see the advice.” Plaid and the Tories have been briefed on the advice but have not actually seen it. Thai health authorities warned on Wednesday that residents should brace themselves for a potential jump in coronavirus cases after classifying the country’s first cluster of the Omicron variant as a super-spreader incident. The Omicron cluster identified in the northeastern province of Kalasin on Christmas eve has been linked to a couple who had travelled from Belgium and visited bars, concerts and markets, Reuters reports. The ensuing cluster had infected hundreds, with cases spreading to 11 other provinces, said senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong, citing how one of the bars linked to the cluster had been packed and did not have good ventilation. “During the New Year, if you visit any place and it does not look safe, just don’t go,” Opas told a briefing. Up to now, Thailand has reported 740 cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant, including 251 in people who had come into contact with foreign arrivals, said Opas. After coronavirus infections peaked in August above 20,000, daily case numbers have fallen to around 2,500 in the past week. But the health ministry’s planning scenario indicated that by March daily infections could hit 30,000, with more than 160 deaths, without a faster rollout of measures like vaccinations and testing, as well as greater social distancing. If restrictions were tightened, daily cases could peak at 14,000 in February, with fewer than 60 daily deaths, the scenario showed. In the first two weeks of January, government employees have been advised they can work from home, coronavirus taskforce spokesman Taweesin Wisanuyothin told a separate briefing, where he urged the private sector to follow suit. Wales’ leading doctor, Chris Jones, has warned that a “huge surge” of Covid cases is expected in January because of mixing over the festive period. A record seven-day Covid rate – 1,004 per 100,000 people – has been reported by Public Health Wales. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales on Wednesday, Jones, the country’s deputy chief medical officer, said he was very worried at the figures: We are really concerned. We are at the beginning of a fourth wave of the pandemic with a very transmissible version of the virus. We are still not out of the third wave, the Delta wave. Our hospitals are already full. Omicron has been increasing in Wales with a doubling time of less than three days. During the last two to three weeks it has gradually replaced Delta and is now the dominant variant. Because of that I expect we will see a further acceleration. We are in a better position than we were a year ago due to the booster campaign. But the difficulty we have got is the sheer number of cases we anticipate in January where we have the new year weekend coming up with all the social mixing. We don’t yet know the effect of mixing over Christmas as well as new year. If that generates a huge surge in cases, which I fear we may see, then there will be a lot of people who will be very ill and end up in hospital. People in the UK should “persevere” in their efforts to secure Covid tests amid reports of patchy supply, the work and pensions minister Chloe Smith said. She told BBC Breakfast: Of course, what we’re seeing is increased demand for testing, which is good and sensible because that’s part of people having been cautious, I think, and being sensible around Christmas and around New Year. So, we’re seeing spikes of demand. What we’ve done in response to that then is double the delivery capacity – so we’ve taken action to make sure that people can get testing kits delivered to them at home. An additional method to that, of course, is going to a pharmacy. I quite understand that people will be wanting to make sure that the testing kits are there - that follows on from people having been doing the right thing in being cautious and in wanting to be tested, perhaps before big events or family gatherings. What I would say is to please persevere with either making use of your friendly local pharmacy or using the delivery method on the gov.uk website. Even whilst there have been periods of great demand on that, and every so often we’ve had to replenish the means behind the scenes there, that is happening and the delivery is occurring. People in Australia testing positive to Covid using rapid antigen tests are being turned away from, or are giving up on, getting a PCR test, as the New South Wales government warns that the actual number of Covid cases could be much higher than the 11,201 reported on Wednesday. Wait times for testing clinics have ballooned across NSW, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. Guardian Australia has spoken to people who have developed Covid symptoms after being in contact with a confirmed positive case, or who have a positive rapid antigen test, who have been trying for several days to get a PCR test but have been turned away. Others were tested before Christmas but are still waiting on their result. Long queues result in wait times of several hours. Some people had been turned away half an hour after a testing site opened because it was over capacity. At others people camped out overnight to ensure they were at the top of the queue. Read the full story here: Nightclubs in France will remain closed for a further three weeks, it has been announced, after nearly 180,000 new Covid cases smashed the record for daily cases since the pandemic began. Approximately 1,600 clubs were ordered shut on 6 December for four weeks as officials hoped to avoid a wave of infections prompted by holiday travel and festivities, fuelled by the highly infectious Omicron variant. But on Tuesday, France’s health agency said 179,807 Covid cases had been reported over the previous 24 hours, exceeding the previous record of 100,000 reported on Saturday, AFP reports. Tourism minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne told France Inter radio that the decision to extend nightclubs closures was part of a series of new measures announced by the government this week in a bid to halt the Omicron spread. “I can imagine the distress for these employees and entrepreneurs,” he said. Financial aid would be provided for the huge loss of holiday business, he added. Interior minister Gerald Darmanin this week encouraged local officials to limit public New Year’s Eve gatherings, in particular by requiring face masks outdoors and stepping up police patrols to enforce a ban on public alcohol consumption for the night. Parliament will start debating on Wednesday a new law to require a “vaccine pass” for entering restaurants, cinemas, museums and other public venues in a bid to spur further Covid jabs. France already has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, at 90% of the eligible population. Previously, the so-called “health pass” could also be obtained by providing a recent negative Covid test in the absence of vaccination. The UK’s shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the government should avoid “rushing into” cutting Covid isolation times. Asked about calls for the isolation period to be reduced to five days, he told Sky News: I think we should always follow the advice of our leading scientists, medical scientists like Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, and I don’t think they’ve given an opinion on this. He added: “Let’s see what they say on this before rushing into this.” Ashworth said politicians “should always be careful to listen to scientific experts”. The current daily supply of almost 900,000 lateral flow tests in the UK is not enough to meet demand, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, Leyla Hannbeck, has said. She urged the government to improve the consistency of deliveries. She told the BBC’s Today programme: It just simply isn’t enough to meet the demand and it’s patchy. Some days you get one box delivered and other days none. It isn’t enough for the pharmacies to deliver to the patients. We want to make sure that the message is clear to the government that the supply needs to be consistent. People can get it easily from pharmacies if the supply is consistent. The UK Health Security Agency has said there are now nearly 900,000 test kits being supplied per day – which is double the delivery capacity seen before 18 December. Mistakes in a Sydney laboratory that led to nearly 1,000 people getting incorrect Covid test results will cause positive cases to ripple through the community, but epidemiologists say Australia’s infection rate is now so high it might not make a significant difference. Over the Christmas period, St Vincent’s hospital told 886 people their result was negative when in fact they were positive. The hospital’s pathology department, SydPath, has apologised for the “specific human error” that led to the wrong results being delivered. Initially 400 people were sent text messages saying they had a negative result, but were later told they were positive. A further 950 people were told they were negative when the results were not yet known, with 486 of them later told they were positive. “Once again, we are sincerely sorry for this error and acknowledge the significant impact it has had on those involved,” SydPath said in a statement, adding that it had procedures in place to ensure it would not happen again. Read the full story here: People in the UK are turning up to pharmacies for lateral flow tests approximately every five minutes and often not being able to get one due to low supplies, according to the chief executive of the Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies. Leyla Hannbeck told the BBC’s Today programme: What our members are telling us is that demand for the lateral flow tests is very high at the moment due to the current guidelines around self-isolation. Pharmacies are reporting that every five minutes, approximately, somebody comes into the pharmacy asking for a test. But, unfortunately, because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent, it means that those who come for the test don’t always get it, which is very stressful not just for the pharmacy team but for the patient. The scale of the problem is huge because the demand is high, because of the current guidelines. She said that people are doing the responsible thing by wanting to be tested. She added: We are in the Christmas area of time, and the New Year is just around the corner and people want to be with family and friends. A run on rapid antigen tests in chemists and supermarkets across Australia has left governments scrambling for supplies as they seek to change the way people get tested for Covid. Rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been available in the US, Europe and parts of Asia since March this year, but the Australian testing regime has relied on the more expensive PCR tests as its program’s cornerstone. Now, as case numbers surge and the system comes under increasing strain, state and federal governments have sought to promote RATs as an intermediate step before people join a queue to be tested. In response, RATs have been flying off shelves in supermarkets and pharmacies, raising concerns about a lack of supply. Jini Maxwell, a games journalist from Melbourne, said that while they had been able to easily find tests a week and a half ago, they had struggled to find any since Christmas “anywhere”. “There are two chemists near me that I’ve been checking every day that have been sold out for the past three or four days,” they said.

Deputy minister of health Waldemar Kraska made the announcement on broadcaster Polsat News on Wednesday morning, adding that 600 people were not vaccinated at the time of their deaths. Kraska told the outlet: They could go on living if they had the vaccine. The average age of the remaining deceased is over 75; They were burdened with many diseases: obesity, hypertension, heart diseases or cancer.” The country also reported another 15,571 new daily coronavirus cases. Poland has been dealing with persistently high daily case numbers in a fourth wave that has forced authorities to tighten restrictions. Thailand is reporting 2,575 new confirmed coronavirus cases: 116 from abroad, and 2,459 from local transmission. A further 17 deaths were also reported, according to recent figures published by the ministry of health. As the UK wakes up for what will be one of the final days of 2021 here is a quick visual snapshot of how the coronavirus is unfolding across Britain. New Zealand has reported its first community exposure to the Omicron variant from a person arriving from the United Kingdom earlier this month. The person, who tested positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19, had briefly been active in the community in Auckland. The recent international arrival reportedly returned a positive result on day nine of their self-isolation period but had previously returned three negative tests for Covid-19 while completing seven days of managed isolation at a facility in Auckland, the ministry of health said in a statement on Wednesday. “The case arrived on a flight from the United Kingdom via Doha on 16 December and is fully vaccinated with a mRNA vaccine. No other Covid-19 infections have been identified from the individual’s flight,” the statement read. Read the full story here. Good morning/evening/afternoon wherever you may be in the world. Countries across Europe have reported a record high number of infections as authorities scramble to stem the surge while the US also reported its single highest number of daily cases on Tuesday. In the latest reporting period, the UK saw a record 129,471 new Covid cases, up from 98,515 reported on Monday. France reported 179,807 new cases, by far the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Greece also reported a new daily record of 21,657 Covid cases, more than double the number the day before. Denmark and Iceland similarly broke pandemic records with Denmark recording the world’s highest infection rate at 1,612 cases per 100,000 people. If you’ve just tuned in to our live Covid blog here is a quick rundown of the latest developments: New Zealand reports its first community exposure to the Omicron variant in a person arriving from the UK who had been active in the community in Auckland. The person reportedly arrived in New Zealand from the United Kingdom on 16 December and tested positive on 27 December, the health ministry said in a statement. Japan will consider bringing forward Covid-19 vaccine booster shots amid concern over the spread of the Omicron variant. The Chinese city of Xi’an has entered its seventh day of lockdown on Wednesday, with many of the 13 million residents unable to leave their homes and dependent on deliveries of necessities. The US reported its single highest number of daily cases on Tuesday. The 512,553 daily new cases was by far the single highest number of cases recorded since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data released by the Johns Hopkins University. The previous record was 294,015 set on 8 January 2021. California became the first state to record more than 5 million known coronavirus infections. Hundreds more US flights have been cancelled in the fifth day of travel chaos. US airlines Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air Group cancelled hundreds of flights on Tuesday due to adverse weather conditions and rising cases of the Omicron variant. The World Health Organization has warned that the Omicron coronavirus variant could lead to overwhelmed healthcare systems even though early studies suggest it sparks milder disease. Japan will consider bringing forward Covid-19 vaccine booster shots amid concern over the spread of the Omicron variant. Prime minister Fumio Kishida told Kyodo News in an interview on Tuesday: Besides 31 million health care workers and elderly people, we’d like to consider bringing (the schedule for third shots) forward as much as possible.” New Zealand says it has recorded its first community exposures from a border-related Omicron case, Reuters reports. We will have more on this story as it develops. India has recorded another 9,195 confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, according to recently released data from its health ministry. A further 302 deaths were also recorded, bring the total death toll to 480,592. The Chinese city of Xi’an has entered its seventh day of lockdown on Wednesday, with many of the 13 million residents unable to leave their homes and dependent on deliveries of necessities. Xian reported 151 domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms for Tuesday, or nearly all of the 152 cases nationwide, bringing the total number of local Xian cases to nearly 1,000 during the 9-28 December period. No cases of the Omicron variant have been announced in the city. While the Xian outbreak is small compared with outbreaks in many other places around the world, officials imposed tough curbs on travel within and leaving the city from 23 December, in line with Beijing’s drive to immediately contain outbreaks as they appear. Since Monday, the Xian government has stopped granting permission to people seeking to leave their homes to buy essentials, as epidemic containment measures rose a notch. It said in-person shopping could be resumed for people in less risky areas once mass testing returned negative results, but it did not say exactly when stay-at-home order would be lifted. Germany is reporting another 40,043 new daily coronavirus cases and 414 deaths, according to recently released data from the Robert Koch Institute. The new figures bring the nationwide tally to 7,066,412 confirmed coronavirus cases and 111,219 deaths. The US recorded 512,553 daily new cases on Tuesday – by far the single highest number of cases recorded since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data released by the Johns Hopkins University. The previous record was 294,015 set on 8 January 2021. The figure takes the seven-day average of US cases to 267,000, according to a New York Times database. This eclipses the previous 7-day average daily high of 248,209 on 12 January. However, mitigating factors such as the delay in reporting over the Christmas weekend are important to consider. Many testing centres were likely closed over the holiday, meaning some test results would have been likely rolled over to Monday and today. Infectious disease epidemiologist and World Health Organization Covid-19 Technical Lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, has cautioned against becoming “numb” to rising case numbers. Do not become numb to these numbers. Each one is a person, a family, a friend, a loved one… Do not become complacent. Even if Omicron is less severe. Many places are seeing record numbers of cases and hospitalisation rates… We can do more. We need to end this pandemic.” South Korea has just released its daily Covid report. The Asian nation recorded another 5,409 confirmed coronavirus cases and 36 deaths, according to data released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. California became the first state to record more than 5 million known coronavirus infections, according to the state department of public health and data from Johns Hopkins University. The state with 40 million residents was poised for a surge in new infections amid holiday parties and family gatherings forced indoors by a series of winter storms. California’s caseload is ahead of other large states but can attributed to its larger population. In the last week the state averaged 16.4 new cases per 100,000 people, less than a third of the national rate. Coronavirus related hospitalisations have been rising slowly in California, up about 12% in the last 7 days to 4,401. That’s less than half as many as during the late summer peak and one-fifth of a year ago, before vaccines were widely available. California has recorded more than 75,500 deaths related to Covid-19 with 27,555 in Los Angeles alone. The World Health Organization has warned that the Omicron coronavirus variant could lead to overwhelmed healthcare systems even though early studies suggest it sparks milder disease. The WHO warned against complacency even though preliminary findings suggest that Omicron could lead to milder disease. WHO Europe’s Covid incident manager, Catherine Smallwood, warned: A rapid growth of Omicron … even if combined with a slightly milder disease, will still result in large numbers of hospitalisations, particularly amongst unvaccinated groups, and cause widespread disruption to health systems and other critical services.” However, the WHO highlighted the 29% decrease in the incidence of cases observed in South Africa - the country which first reported the variant to the WHO on 24 November. It said early data from Britain, South Africa and Denmark - which currently has the world’s highest rate of infection per person - suggested there was a reduced risk of hospitalisation for Omicron compared to Delta. However, further data was needed to understand Omicron’s severity in terms of clinical markers, including the use of oxygen, mechanical ventilation and death. More data was also required on how the severity might be being impacted by previous Covid infection, or vaccination. Read the full story here. US airlines Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air Group cancelled hundreds of flights on Tuesday due to adverse weather conditions and rising cases of the Omicron variant. Delta said it expected to cancel more than 250 of 4,133 scheduled flights on Tuesday, while Alaska Air cancelled 150 flights to and from Seattle and warned of more cancellations and delays throughout the day, Reuters reports. Total cancellations as of 2pm ET within, into, or out of the United States stood at 1,034, with 2,694 flights delayed, marking a fifth day of flight cancellations. Delta said it was working to reroute and substitute some planes. Thousands of flights were grounded over the Christmas holiday weekend as airlines struggled with staff shortages from Covid-19 infections and bad weather in parts of the country. Hello and welcome back to our live Covid blog. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest coronavirus developments as they happen. In two days time, on 31 December, it will be two years to the day since health authorities in Wuhan reported an unknown pneumonia outbreak to World Health Organization (WHO) colleagues in Beijing. It is also just over one month since the first case of Omicron was announced by South Africa. Countries across Europe have reported a record high number of infections as authorities scramble to stem the surge. On Tuesday, the UK saw a record 129,471 new Covid cases, up from 98,515 reported yesterday. France reported 179,807 new cases, by far the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Greece also reported a new daily record of 21,657 Covid cases, more than double the number the day before. Denmark and Iceland similarly broke pandemic records with Denmark recording the world’s highest infection rate at 1,612 cases per 100,000 people. Meanwhile South Africa, officially the most affected country in Africa, has recalled rules that no longer required people without symptoms of Covid-19 to isolate or test if they have been in contact with a positive case, the government announced on Tuesday. If you have any stories, tips or feedback please get in touch via email at samantha.lock@theguardian.com or Twitter @Samantha__Lock. I would love to hear from you. Here is a quick snapshot of how Covid is unfolding across the world: Europe: Omicron “appears to be less severe and many people spend a relatively short time in hospital,” Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and leading immunologist has said. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said he will not introduce further Covid restrictions in England before 2022 giving mass events the go-ahead and leaving nightclubs open for New Year’s Eve. Scientists say it is “the greatest divergence between scientific advice and legislation” seen since the start of the pandemic. The UK recorded 129,471 new Covid cases on Tuesday, the highest recorded total ever, and up from 98,515 reported yesterday. More than 500 children admitted to hospital with Covid in England in week up to Boxing Day. France has reduced the waiting time for a third booster shot to three months from four. From Monday, all indoor gatherings will be limited to 2,000 people, and to 5,000 people for outdoor events. Consumption of drinks and food will be banned in long-distance transport and home working will become mandatory for at least three days per week where possible. France reported 179,807 new confirmed cases on Tuesday, by far the highest number since the start of the pandemic. Denmark and Iceland reported record daily Covid cases on Monday. Denmark now has the world’s highest infection rate, with 1,612 cases per 100,000 people. Greece will impose further restrictions from January 3 including the closure of bars and restaurants at midnight, no standing customers at entertainment venues and a maximum limit of six people per table. Greece reported a new daily record of 21,657 Covid cases on Tuesday, more than double the number the day before. Germany toughens Covid restrictions with indoor and outdoor gatherings restricted in size and leisure facilities closing in several states. Asia: Daily cases in Australia exceeded 10,000 for the second consecutive day, with a total of 11,264 new Covid cases across the country – the highest figure since the beginning of the pandemic. In Yan’an, China, hundreds of thousands more people were ordered to stay at home, joining millions under strict lockdown in Xi’an. China’s coronavirus cases rose for a fourth consecutive day on Monday. Delhi, India, announces new Covid restrictions. Schools, colleges and educational institutions will close as well as sports complexes, cinemas, conference halls, stadiums and swimming pools. Offices will operate at 50% capacity, as will restaurants with a 10pm curfew. Japanese officials have detected a five-person cluster of Omicron cases in the city of Osaka. Hong Kong will tighten quarantine rules for air cargo crew. Malaysia will cut the booster vaccine waiting time to three months and has banned mass celebrations for New Year’s Eve with negative Covid tests required for private gatherings. India has approved Merck’s Covid-19 pill and two more vaccines for emergency use. United States: Omicron accounts for 58.6% of all Covid cases in the US, new CDC data shows. Delta accounts for 41.1% of Covid cases for the week ending 25 December. The US recorded 512,553 daily new cases on Tuesday – by far the single highest number of cases recorded since the beginning of the pandemic. Dr Anthony Fauci said a vaccine mandate should be considered for all passengers in the US. The US Centre for Disease Control has reduced the recommended isolation time for people recording a positive test from 10 days to five. Joe Biden said the dramatic surge in US Covid cases caused by the Omicron variant “should be a source of concern but it should not be a source of panic”."

          "headline": " How to ensure your broadband internet will meet the demands of a wet summer",
          "bodyText": "La Niña will likely dampen the summer plans of Australians across the eastern and northern parts of the country, meaning families may become even more reliant on their broadband connections to keep themselves entertained. But what if our online requirements and internet connections don’t stack up? The Bureau of Meteorology is predicting it will be a very wet summer, so if your household’s plans to go to the beach are replaced with Netflix, Switch and PlayStation, how do you make sure your internet connection is up to the task? Do you need faster internet? The easiest thing you can do is run a speed test. That will give you an indication of what you’re working with, noting that it’s probably best to test in peak hours – like the evening – to see the worst-case-scenario speeds. The streaming services, for example, will accomodate slower connections and adjust accordingly, but if you are wanting to stream Netflix or Apple TV in high definition, that will be around 5Mbps of speed needed per stream. If you’re wanting to stream in 4K, then it’s 25Mbps per stream. HD will likely be enough for most, but if you factor in multiple people using the internet at once in a household, then it adds up pretty quickly, and you might need to go to a higher plan. Check what plan you’re on If you’re connected to the internet using the National Broadband Network, the first thing you should do is check with your internet service provider what speed plan you’re on, and what your download limit is per month. If you’re on a basic 12Mbps or 25Mbps plan, you may want to see if you can upgrade to something a bit faster, such as 50Mbps or 100Mbps. The higher the speed plan, the more likely your internet will be able to cope with more people streaming and gaming and doing all other online activities at once. Check if you can change your plan You might not be able to actually change your plan, depending on the technology you use to connect to the NBN. Your internet service provider will be able to tell you the highest possible speed you’ll be able to achieve on your current connection, and the corresponding plan the company can then offer to you. See if you can upgrade If you are on a technology like fibre-to-the-node for the NBN and can’t get the higher speeds, NBN Co may be able to upgrade it for you, if you agree to be locked into a higher speed plan for a set period of time, or you agree to fund the fibre extension yourself. This is a much more expensive option, and will run into the thousands of dollars at a minimum, so it’s unlikely many people will choose this just to beat the wet summer blues. The other catch is, it probably won’t be done when you need it. NBN Co was initially starting to take orders from November this year, but the company did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about whether that had gone ahead as planned. Even if the fibre extension was available, it would still take time to construct, so while in the long term you’ll get a faster NBN, it probably won’t be done before everyone heads back to work or school. See if you have alternative choices like 5G If you live in an area where Telstra or Optus have rolled out 5G, their 5G services are incredibly easy to sign up for and set up at home, and very competitive with NBN plans. Optus’s plan is unlimited data from up to 210Mbps download speeds at $79 per month. The exit fee is just the cost of the modem. Telstra’s plan is $85 a month for 1TB of data, with average speeds of 378Mbps or up to 600Mbps. The plan is month to month, with no exit fees provided the modem is returned. Even if you can’t get 5G, if you are able to get 4G the home modem options are improving, and data rates are cheaper than they used to be. TPG offers home wireless broadband for $54 a month for up to 20Mbps, for example. In regional and remote areas of Australia that do not get good 4G or 5G coverage, your options may be more limited to what the NBN has to offer on fixed wireless or satellite (if they’ve connected you). Brave the rain If all else fails, you might have to put on the gumboots and raincoat and make the most of the summer rain."

          "headline": "Animal crossings: the ecoducts helping wildlife navigate busy roads across the world",
          "bodyText": "From a tiny railway bridge for dormice in the UK to elk, deer and bears benefitting from a slew of new animal crossings in Colorado, wildlife bridges are having a moment. As the human footprint on the planet continues to expand, a growing number of roads and railways include provisions for wildlife to pass through fragmented landscapes. In January, we reported on Sweden’s plans to build a series of “renoducts” to help reindeer traverse the country’s main roads. The Swedish Transport Administration has since completed an ecoduct over the E6 in Skåne in southern Sweden, the third in the county. In southern California, work is due to begin on the largest wildlife bridge in the world in 2022, to connect isolated mountain lion populations north of Los Angeles that are becoming dangerously inbred. Joe Biden has earmarked $350m (£260m) of his $1.2tn infrastructure package for wildlife bridges to lessen the multibillion annual cost of collisions. “Ten years ago, wildlife bridges were experimental. We didn’t know whether they would work or not. Now they’ve shown they get huge reductions in collisions. In some cases, 85% to 99% reductions,” says Rob Ament, a road ecology expert at Montana State University. “You can design them for many species. Even out in the plains, we’re getting moose crossings in North Dakota.” Wildlife bridges are found on every continent: there is an elephant underpass near Mount Kenya; the Netherlands has a network of ecoducts that may help the country’s first wolf pack in more than 140 years gain a foothold across the densely populated country; suspended water pipes are helping Java’s endangered lorises; and a bison bridge may help the animals cross the Mississippi. Here are five projects from around the world helping animals make their way: Alligator Alley, Florida The 129km (80-mile) stretch of road between Naples and Fort Lauderdale bisects the Everglades, an enormous wetland that is home to thousands of alligators, deer and the endangered Florida panther. It used to be notorious for high-speed collisions with wildlife until the road was upgraded to a four-lane motorway and crossings were installed. Today, dozens of underpasses and fencing help wildlife navigate the road. A camera trapping exercise found panthers, black bears, skunks, deer, bats, birds and even fish use the crossings, and hope is growing the state’s wildlife bridge network could be extended north to connect potential habitats for the Florida panther. “Fencing is critical along Alligator Alley. It is a 10ft-high chain link fence with three-strand barbed wire on top. That’s to keep the wildlife off the roadway and on the crossing,” says Brent Setchell, a design engineer at Florida Department of Transportation, who identifies potential crossing sites by monitoring road collisions with panthers and bears. “The fascinating thing is we just started monitoring the crossings four or five years ago. We found an abundance of wildlife.” ‘The tunnel of love’ on the Great Alpine Road, Australia Stretching through the Victorian Alps in south-east Australia, the Great Alpine Road posed an existential threat to a colony of critically endangered mountain pygmy possums. Even though there are only about 150 of the marsupials on Mount Little Higginbotham, testing revealed genetic differences between sub-groups separated by the road, which are also threatened by fire, disappearing food sources and invasive species. Conservationists decided to build a “tunnel of love” between the isolated groups to improve mixing and strengthen their chances of survival. Over the last two summers, 30 possums have been identified using the tunnel of love, often in spring when they wake up from hibernation. The tiny marsupials can cross the nearly 15-metre tunnel in just 15 seconds – sometimes too fast for remote sensing cameras to capture them. India’s tiger corridor India’s first dedicated wildlife underpasses were a hard-fought victory for environmental campaigners. The nine crossings in the Pench tiger reserve were a court-ordered mitigation measure on the country’s longest road, the 4,112km National Highway 44, which runs down the middle of the country. Collisions with big cats still happen on the multi-lane motorway, but environmentalists say the underpasses have highlighted the need for more wildlife crossings on India’s road network. A 2019 camera trapping exercise found at least 18 species use the crossings, including tigers, wild dogs, sloth bears, civets and leopards. “According to our calculation, some 55,000km of roads pass through India’s forests and protected areas, many of them through wildlife corridors,” Milind Pariwakam, a road ecologist with Wildlife Conservation Trust Mumbai, told the Hindu. More infrastructure projects now have wildlife passes, including the 1,380km Delhi-Mumbai expressway currently under construction, which includes India’s first animal bridges. Bhutan’s elephant crossing Nearly 700 Asian elephants roam Bhutan’s forest on the eastern edge of the Himalayas. The small Buddhist country sandwiched between China and India is known for its dramatic landscapes and environmental leadership, as one of the few carbon negative countries in the world. On the 183km east-west motorway, Bhutan’s first elephant underpasses were constructed to help the threatened animals move through the landscape.Monitoring from 2015 to 2017 found that 70 groups of elephants were recorded near the passes, with three-quarters passing through the structures. Sloth bridges in Costa Rica Wildlife passes are not always bridges or underpasses. In Costa Rica, canopy bridges are used to help sloths, monkeys and other wildlife cross roads to combat collisions, dog attacks and electrocutions on power lines. The rope bridges, which cost about $200 (£150), are installed by the Sloth Conservation Foundation in areas where rainforest has been interrupted by human development on the country’s Caribbean coast. Crossing roads is often deadly for the slow-moving creatures and the canopy bridges also help combat inbreeding. “People look at them and think that they’re so poorly equipped to survive because you see them crossing roads and trying to move around and they look so awkward and useless,” Rebecca Cliffe, head of the Sloth Conservation Foundation, told Bloomberg earlier this year. “But if you put them in a well-connected rainforest, then they are masters of survival.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

          "bodyText": "Air travel in and out of the UK slumped by 71% in 2021 as the second year of the Covid-19 crisis took its toll on international flying, according to a report. Just over 406,000 international flights operated from the UK up to 22 December this year compared with almost 1.4m in 2019 before the pandemic struck and travel restrictions were imposed, the aviation analytics firm Cirium said. UK domestic flights were found to have declined by almost 60%. International travel has been slow to recover because of testing and quarantine requirements, which have changed throughout the year, and fears of countries being added to the UK’s red list which involve mandatory hotel quarantine for 10 days. The budget carrier Ryanair remained the largest airline in the UK, Cirium said, operating more than 100,000 UK flights in 2021, followed by easyJet, with more than 82,000 flights, while British Airways was third with 77,460 flights. The busiest international route was between London’s Heathrow and New York’s JFK, even though the US only reopened its borders to UK travellers in November. Travellers from the US had been able to fly to the UK since 28 July. BA, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue operated a total of 2,410 flights on the route. Short-haul flights were the most popular, though, with eight out of the 10 busiest routes to mainland Europe. They included London Heathrow to Amsterdam, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt. The UK’s busiest domestic route was the 31-mile flight between Land’s End in Cornwall to St Mary’s on the Isles of Scilly, with 2,330 flights recorded this year. With new Covid infections soaring across Europe and the US, and hitting record highs in the UK amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the outlook for next year remains uncertain. Thousands of flights have been cancelled over the past few days because of staff testing positive for Covid-19, and bad weather in parts of the US. By Wednesday morning, a further 2,100 flights had been cancelled globally, after 3,000 cancellations on Tuesday, including 1,300 into or out of the US, according to the tracking website FlightAware. Globally, airlines cancelled more than 6,000 flights between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day, normally the busiest time of the year. One in eight UK travel and tourism jobs – 205,000 roles – will be unfilled at the beginning of 2022, according to the London-based World Travel and Tourism Council. The staff shortage could have an “enormous impact” on the UK’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the WTTC said. It called for a series of measures to tackle the issue, such as more support for remote working, reskilling workers and increasing the number of apprenticeships. “If we cannot fill these vacancies, it could threaten the survival of travel and tourism businesses up and down the UK,” said the council’s chief executive, Julia Simpson. Separately, Indonesia has lifted the ban on the Boeing 737 Max, more than three years after a Lion Air plane flying from Jakarta crashed in October 2018, killing 189 people. In March 2019, there was a second disaster involving the 737 Max model when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed soon after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. Boeing’s bestselling aircraft was then grounded globally. On Monday, Ethiopian Airlines said it would resume 737 Max flights in February."

          "bodyText": "After five seasons of the groundbreaking TV drama Lost, the formula had started to get stale – to say nothing of the endlessly convoluted mystery at its heart. And so, for the sixth and final series, the producers added a new twist: as well as the flashbacks and flash-forwards that had come to define the show, it introduced the flash-sideways, showing the viewers an alternate reality where no one was ever marooned on a deserted island. Anyway, as we come to the season finale of the Long 2020, with the reintroduction of a global villain viewers thought was defeated and an increasingly convoluted B-plot involving chaos in the top tiers of the British state, I thought I would borrow that concept. Yes, rather than doing a look back over the year that was (because no one needs to dwell on that for a second longer than is necessary) or a prediction of what next year might hold for us (if I do not hold out hope for good things then I cannot be disappointed), I thought we could do something different, and look at what might have been if previous predictions had been a bit more accurate … 2017 Christmas 2016. The world was reeling from the election of Donald Trump, Mark Zuckerberg had just said it was “crazy” to think that Facebook might have played a part, and I was predicting that the big story of 2017 would be … virtual reality. I thought that the recent release of Sony’s PlayStation VR, Oculus’s Gear VR and Google’s Daydream all pointed to an imminent mainstreaming of the technology – or, at least, a definitive answer as to whether or not VR had what it took to break out of the early adopter bubble. That means there’s two versions we could flash-sideways to: the one in which VR succeeded, or the one in which it flamed out in an industry-destroying mess. It’s fairly easy to see how the latter filters through to today. If 2017 had been the death knell for the VR industry – rather than another year of sales being just high enough to continue investment, but just low enough to claim success – then we wouldn’t be talking about the “metaverse” in anywhere near the same tenor. Facebook’s investment in Oculus would have been written off, Sony would have shuttered its VR project, and Google … well, Google did sunset Daydream, but that’s just because someone in Mountain View clearly gets off on killing products. But the former is harder to imagine. With the benefit of hindsight, it’s clear that the technology simply wasn’t sufficient for mainstream acceptance: even Facebook’s Oculus Quest 2, several generations improved from what it was selling five years ago, is still clunky enough that the company’s head of communications, Nick Clegg, blasts it as a “wretched headset” while wearing it for a PR stunt with the Financial Times. So a victory for VR in 2017 would have been still confined to a niche – but if that niche was “video games”, the industry today would be transformed. A breakout success for Sony’s PSVR, for instance, would at the very least have radically changed the company’s plans for the PlayStation 5, foregrounding plans for a successor to the VR system. But the biggest ramification, I think, would have been if Facebook’s Gear VR – a collaboration with Samsung that let users slot their Galaxy phone into the headset for low-cost accessibility – had been a hit. Mark Zuckerberg has wanted to build a VR-based social network since he acquired Oculus back in 2014, but the user numbers have never been big enough to fully commit to. Even the Meta rebrand was predicated on hope for the future, rather than success in the present. If Oculus had exploded in popularity five years ago, though, you can be sure that Facebook would be all-in on VR by now. The motivation remains the same in either world: a desire to own the platform on which Facebook is built, rather than have to play by the rules of, first, the open web and later the app stores of the major players. We’d be five years ahead on the transformation to “Meta” – but, of course, only if the events of 2018 had also been somewhat different from reality … 2018 As 2017 drew to a close, the “techlash” was beginning to brew: the events of the year had served to raise more questions than ever about whether the largest tech companies in the world were fit to hold the power they had amassed. Against that background, questions were being raised about one Silicon Valley company, which had an uncomfortably close relationship with the American right, was credibly linked to the rise of Donald Trump, and was being remarkably cavalier about the safety of children and young people on its platform. But it wasn’t Facebook. As we looked ahead to 2018, the smart money was on an annus horribilis for YouTube. The video sharing site’s widespread use by far-right shock jocks had been noted in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the phrase “algorithmic radicalisation” was on everyone’s lips: how far down the rabbit hole could YouTube’s recommendations take someone? “The world’s largest broadcaster has started to wake up to the fact that time and again, it is cited as part of the ‘radicalisation pathway’ that turns young men from bedroom shut-ins to mass murderers,” I wrote at the time, predicting that it would be forced to take action. On top of that, the same algorithmic pressure was leading to utterly bizarre content being screened for children on the site, with one internet theorist calling the site’s practices “infrastructural violence” against children. And then, in March that year, the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in the pages of the Observer, and YouTube was forgotten. The ramifications of that diversion have been long-lasting. Even as the techlash broadened from Facebook to the wider industry, with leaders like Tim Cook and Jack Dorsey invited to sit alongside Mark Zuckerberg and be shouted at by US legislators, YouTube has been forgotten. Susan Wojcicki, the company’s long-running chief executive, has never been grilled by Congress. Her boss, Sundar Pichai, has been; but YouTube rarely comes up in those conversations. Contrast that to, say, Instagram, which frequently gets treated like its own company in such discussions, even though the top down control of the latter is much stronger than the former. With or without the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was always going to face a reckoning given its involvement in the 2016 election. But YouTube has managed to remain largely unchanged over a period that’s seen all of Google’s peers forced to radically alter their ways of doing business. Perhaps it would have been better if this were one prediction that had come true? 2019 OK look, I actually did pretty well in my predictions for 2019. That may be because I had a fairly dull selection (wow, past-me, you really thought you’d set the world alight with that prediction that USB-C would be in more things, huh?), and generally I’d rather be wrong but interesting that right and boring. But, being right still feels quite good. Still, there’s one major flub: I thought that Epic Games’ decision to launch a competing App Store on Android was a seriously consequential step, and one that could up-end the power of the app stores in general. I maintain my reasoning was sound. This was Fortnite at the peak of its popularity, suddenly being rendered unplayable on Android unless you installed Epic’s competing games store. It was a strategy that the company did indeed successfully pursue on computers, where it’s managed to bootstrap a competitor to Steam, the pre-eminent PC gaming platform, with just gumption, hard work, and billions of dollars in incentive payments to publishers for exclusivity. Epic’s problem, it turned out, was that while Google technically makes it possible to install a second App Store on Android platforms, it doesn’t make it easy. Add to that the fact that, anecdotally, Fortnite’s smartphone players are more likely to be on the younger end of its demographic, and so less likely to be able to pull off the complex steps required and less able to voice their displeasure at Google’s limitations, and Epic found it had argued itself into a corner. We all know what happened next, of course: reinstated to the Android App Store, Epic took the nuclear option, simultaneously breaking the rules of both Android and iOS in a bid to get itself thrown off the stores with standing for a lawsuit. But what would it look like if Epic’s stance on Android had worked? I think one possible answer is – not actually as good as Epic hopes. Alternative app stores for Android aren’t unheard of, after all, particularly in mainland China where Google’s own App Store is unavailable. Epic may have been able to avoid Google’s cut of in-app payments on Android, but it seems unlikely that it would be able to parley that into a wider competitive position. Instead, if the Chinese experience is instrumental, it would be more likely to open up a situation where every major app has its own unique App Store, and every minor app finds itself needing to be present on multiple app stores at once or run the risk of pirates stealing its customers. And then, of course, there’s the fact that Epic’s position on iOS wouldn’t have improved one bit from the painful showdown. In fact, it could conceivably be in a worse position that it is in our world – one where its case against Apple is weakened by the demonstrable fact that Apple’s claims that opening up the App Store would harm user privacy and security are true. 2020 and 2021 Over Christmas 2019, I drew up a list of 20 trends that would define 2020. Twenty! Surely I covered everything that would happen in the coming – ah, right. Yes. In 2021 I didn’t even bother to make any predictions, and yet I still got it wrong, because the fact that I sit here today, in effective lockdown due to a coronavirus outbreak, is … not something I would have predicted this time last year. That said, I did get some things right, from the fact that workplace activism would come to Apple (aided by the pandemic, which pushed the secretive company on to remote working platforms and so enabled organising for the first time) to the continued failure of the UK government to pass the online harms bill (now known as the online safety bill, and barely closer to actual passage than it was two years ago). In fact, the pandemic probably helped tech futurists more than it harmed them. Its immediate effect on the industry was to accelerate trends that were already well on their way to fruition: if you predicted more people using videoconferencing, more people shopping online, or more people playing video games, well, the pandemic helped you out. My major stinker was predicting the death of Facebook’s Portal, the company’s video-enabled Echo competitor. “Who would want to put an always-on microphone connected directly to Menlo Park in their homes,” I wrote. “Portal sales have reportedly been minuscule. A second iteration was squeezed out earlier this year; don’t expect a third.” Well, it turns out that a dedicated video-chat device is rather more compelling now than it was two years ago, and Facebook’s big pivot helps position the Portal as a halfway house between full VR and simple text chat. Talking about the world of tech in the absence of Covid feels like an impossible task – what wouldn’t be different – but there’s one are that I think would be radically changed, and it’s not what you might think. Zoom, Slack and even QR codes were all slowly growing in importance, and while they may not have had the explosive growth that they did, the companies would be largely recognisable even if Covid had never left Wuhan. Instead, the most 2020 story that wouldn’t exist without Covid was, I think, the rise of the “meme stocks” and the subsequent NFT boom. The tale of the second half of that year was one of a “K-shaped” recovery, with some people rapidly readjusting to life under lockdown even as others lost their livelihoods for months. Particularly in the US, where generous universal stimulus payments put money in the pockets of millions who simultaneously saw their monthly outgoings collapse, it lead to the creation of a fairly large group who suddenly had an awful lot of cash to burn, and an awful lot of time to burn it. It’s no wonder, then, that Robinhood, the free stock-trading app that has faced criticism for “gamifying” day trading, saw a boom in use, as day traders piled in on stocks such as Hertz, AMC and, notoriously, GameStop. This year, the focus shifted from stock trading to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, but the underlying cause was, I think, the same: people with more money and time than they used to have, seeking an outlet for their boredom. The question for the coming year, of course, is whether Covid is required to maintain that interest, or if it’s now reached self-sustaining levels of attention. I’d bet (and, if I’m honest, hope for) the latter, but we won’t find out for a while yet.

          "bodyText": "Every winter, thousands of grey seals give birth on the beaches near Winterton-on-Sea. By late November this year, the Friends of Horsey Seals had already counted 1,172 pups, with many more on the way. The Friends have looked after the growing colony since 2012, to make sure visitors can watch safely without disturbing the wildlife. I’m alarmed that one fluffy white pup seems to be bleeding, until a warden points out the red streak is the umbilical cord. The scene in front of me, teeming with life, is one of Britain’s great natural spectacles. Winterton-on-Sea is a 45-minute ride on Coastal Clipper bus 1 from Great Yarmouth, which has smart, hourly trains through the marshy Broads from Norwich. I’ve spent much of the past decade exploring East Anglia and thought I knew what to expect from a minibreak on the coast near Yarmouth. Turns out there’s plenty I don’t know: about lichen, about the circus, and seals. I talk to several seal wardens, all devoted, knowledgable, and keen to emphasise that people should keep off the beach. A raised flipper, which looks like a cheerful wave, actually means stay away. I’m sleeping in an old red-brick barn at Mill Farm, which is 15 minutes’ walk from the beach. There are four big bedrooms round an even bigger living room with sofas, TV, log-burning stove and piles of boardgames. There’s a separate games barn with pool and ping pong tables. And several green features, from a biomass boiler to a guest allotment. The welcome hamper includes juice from the farm’s apples. Environmentalists Emma and Neil Punchard, who converted this Eco Barn, have created an orchard, wildlife pond and butterfly-magnet paddocks around it, and planted 1,800 native hedgerow shrubs to line the permissive path that keeps walkers safely off the road from the village and nearby bus stop. In April, they’re opening a new Grain Barn that sleeps four. The pink-footed geese first fly over while I’m having breakfast the next day. Their calls alert me, and I run to the door to see a classic spear-shaped line of geese. Attracted to Norfolk partly by sugar beet tops left in the fields after harvesting, overwintering pink-foots have become a local phenomenon. The nearby Berney Marshes sees as many as 15,000 of them gathering between October and March each year, migrating from their summer breeding grounds in Iceland and Greenland. One of the area’s most interesting car-free trips is to these remote, roadless marshes, which I explored with friends very soon after Berney Arms railway station reopened in February 2020. Accessible only by train, boat or on foot along the river (and bank) from Yarmouth, the black tower of the Berney Arms wind pump is the tallest in the Broads. Around it, miles of water and grass stretch out to a distant horizon, home to wild geese, galloping hares and muntjac deer. On Sundays, with buses from Winterton into Yarmouth and trains onward from there, you can follow an isolated loop through the windmill-studded landscape. You’ll need to keep an eye on train times and bring weatherproof kit and refreshments. I spend this morning exploring Winterton and the neighbouring dunes, marvelling at the patchwork of ferns, fungi and mosses. There are dozens of different types of lichen, including one that has pale branches like antlers and another that looks like lots of tiny green elfin goblets. I look them up later and find they are reindeer lichen and pixie cup lichen. There’s a tall white lighthouse above the dunes and colourful thatched roundhouses that are part of Hermanus holiday park. Three silver, 70s Airstream caravans nearby belong to Norfolk’s Edge, a new beach cafe that opened last July. Alex Clare, former head chef at the Ingham Swan, serves up seasonal brioches or tubs of shellfish bisque here by day, and provides fine dining in private houses in the evening. I stop for a bagel, then follow the coast path northwards. The seal colony stretches seven miles from Winterton to Waxham. Patches of bright red on distant sand are placentas, soon food for scavenging seagulls. There are seals surfing the waves, lolloping over the beach, or moaning to each other. It’s almost a relief to leave the unsettlingly human wailing and turn inland to loop back to Mill Farm. I combine routes 2 and 3 from the booklet of local walks supplied in the barn and relax to the sound of birdsong and rustling reeds. Marsh harriers fly silently over fields of squawking pheasants. The highlight is ruined St Mary’s church at East Somerton. Arched windows, curtained with ivy, surround a large oak growing out of the roofless nave. It’s raining steadily next morning, so I catch the bus into Yarmouth for some weatherproof sightseeing. I kick off with coffee and a lemony, sugar-crusted bolo de arroz (rice muffin) at Duarte’s cafe, where everyone else is drinking espresso and speaking Portuguese. The seafront is two minutes away, but it’s still drizzling, so I head for Time and Tide museum. Alongside a temporary exhibition of art from Ladybird books (until 23 January), this engaging museum celebrates the town’s history and herring industry in an old Victorian fish-curing factory (£6.70). Even through my face mask, I can smell the lingering woodsmoke in the well-worn wooden floors and old brick walls. The reconstruction of one of the town’s old rows (narrow streets) comes complete with a soundscape of babies crying, dogs barking and kipper-sellers shouting. Like any regional museum, it’s more interesting if you know the area a little. There are bronze buckles from the Roman fort at Caister-on-Sea, whose ruins I saw from the bus window on the way here, and an 1819 painting by George Vincent of the local seafront, complete with Dutch traders, bathing machines and Yarmouth’s towering monument to Norfolk-born Nelson. Round the corner on Yarmouth’s South Quay, a Georgian merchant’s house, which once housed a Nelson museum, reopened in May as the new Yare art gallery (free). The big, light-filled rooms are ideal for bold, colourful exhibitions, like the current celebration of the circus (until 13 January). There’s bunting above the stairs, distorting mirrors scattered through the galleries, and a giant inflatable pink elephant in the courtyard. Peter Jay, whose band toured with the Beatles, has owned Yarmouth’s Hippodrome Circus since 1979 and lent pictures and costumes from his collection. A film on the top floor narrated by Jay’s son Jack, the current ringmaster, shows how the 120-year-old building was restored; its round stage sinks to become a swimming pool for the water show. Intrigued, I walk 10 minutes to the art nouveau Hippodrome, where this year’s Christmas Spectacular runs until 9 January (from £13/£22 for kids/adults). The quirky 1903 cafe, full of mismatched furniture and circus memorabilia, opened earlier this year. The gold curtains are still drawn this morning, and I stroll along the sand for a bowl of clam chowder (£6.90) at the Beach Hut, my favourite Yarmouth cafe. The greyish-brown North Sea lies ahead, beyond young, grassy dunes. The Venetian Waterways, next door to the cafe, are a network of winding canals, bridges and little thatched shelters between neat borders of Russian sage and rosemary. The gardens were first laid out in the 1920s, part of a scheme to provide work for 300 unemployed men, and reopened in spring 2019 after a £1.7m restoration. The weather has cleared and scraps of rainbow float above the Britannia pier. After lunch, I hike past the airy Minster and five miles out of town to third-century Burgh (pronounced Burra) Castle, one of Britain’s best-preserved Roman ruins. Known to the Romans as Gariannonum, this was one of nine forts defending the estuaries of the Saxon Shore against seafaring raiders. Its flint walls stand up to 4½ metres high and Time and Tide has a Roman horseman’s helmet that was found there. I’m following the start of the Angles Way, a long-distance route that leads from Yarmouth, along the winding River Waveney and through the Broads, to wild Knettishall Heath in the Suffolk Breckland. Here, the route runs beside Breydon Water, a big, tidal stretch of water whose muddy banks attract thousands of waterbirds in winter. The tide is high now, leaving them little room to forage, but there are ducks and lapwings near the flood wall. This area was below sea level when the Romans arrived and built their coastal fort. The sun is already sinking as I reach a boardwalk between reedbeds and climb the steps to Burgh Castle. A chill wind ripples over the reeds and river. I walk past a round-towered church and along the lane to warm up in the Queens Head pub. Bus 5 goes back to Yarmouth every hour until teatime from the stop outside. As I wait, the pink-footed geese fly overhead again, calling to each other as they circle the ruins and head out across the twilit marsh. • Accommodation was provided by Mill Farm Eco Barn, which sleeps eight (three nights from £796 or from £325 for the two-person Hay Barn, millfarm-ecobarn.co.uk/).

          "headline": "England hospital Covid admissions highest since February; France announces new curbs – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: Boris Johnson will not introduce further Covid restrictions in England before 2022, giving mass events the go-ahead and leaving nightclubs open for New Year’s Eve – in contrast with all other UK nations. Scientists criticised the decision, describing it as the moment of “the greatest divergence between scientific advice and legislation” seen since the start of the pandemic. There were no walk-in PCR tests available to book anywhere in England for a few hours on Monday due to “high demand”. Appointments had been unavailable in every region of the country, although there were some in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Social media users said the lack of availability of tests could affect travel plans, sports fixtures and business appointments. The number of patients in England admitted into hospital with Covid-19 has reached its highest level since mid-February after a 74% rise in a week. In London, hospital admissions have increased by 73%. A total of 8,474 people were in hospital in England with Covid-19 as of 8am today – the highest number since 5 March. France has narrowed the delay for a third booster shot to three months from four in response to the rapid spread of Omicron but there will be no curfew for New Year’s Eve. From Monday, all public gatherings will be limited to 2,000 people for indoor events, and to 5,000 people for outdoor events. Consumption of drinks and food will be banned in long-distance transport and home working will become mandatory for at least three days per week where possible. Denmark and Iceland, both of which had some of Europe’s lowest infection rates before the arrival of Omicron, reported record daily Covid cases today. Denmark now has the world’s highest infection rate, with 1,612 cases per 100,000 people. Europe recorded the most cases and deaths in the past seven days, according to statistics compiled by Agence France-Presse. The five countries with the highest case rates over the last seven days were all European. People who test positive for Covid in the US can self-isolate for just five days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said – down from the 10 days the agency previously recommended. In a statement, the CDC said these changes reflect the latest data on when the virus is most contagious. Scotland has recorded a record number of Covid cases over the Christmas weekend, hitting a high of 11,030 new cases on Boxing Day, the Scottish government has said. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is due to update a specially-reconvened sitting of the Scottish parliament on Wednesday about the spread of the virus and the impact on hospitals. Paraguay has confirmed the country’s first Omicron cases, health officials said. The cases were detected in people who had travelled outside the country this month but the government has not taken immediate action on travel. Flight cancellations that disrupted Christmas travel stretched into Monday, with major US airlines each cancelling dozens of flights. According to FlightAware, which tracks flight cancellations, airlines have cancelled roughly 4,000 flights to, from or inside the US since Friday. Greece has announced further restrictions effective between 3 and 16 January to contain a further surge in Covid infections. Bars and restaurants will have to close at midnight and no standing customers at entertainment venues will be allowed. There will also be a maximum limit of six people per table. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, for today. Goodbye. Goldman Sachs has told employees that all individuals coming into the bank’s US offices will be required to show proof of a booster shot. The new policy will come into effect on 1 February and applies to both employees and visitors. In addition, Goldman Sachs plans to double mandatory testing to twice weekly, beginning on 10 January. Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro has said he will not vaccinate his 11-year-old daughter against Covid-19. “Children have not been dying in a way that justifies a vaccine for children,” he told reporters in the southern state of Santa Catarina. Bolsonaro himself has refused to get vaccinated and has repeatedly called into question the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccines, Reuters reports. Vaccinating children against coronavirus has been a hot topic in Brazil. More than 300 children between the ages of 5 and 11 have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, according to a government coronavirus advisory body. Ministers have confirmed that no new Covid-19 restrictions will be imposed in England before the new year. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, told reporters there will be “no further measures before the new year”, adding: “Of course people should remain cautious as we approach new year celebrations and take a lateral flow test if that makes sense, celebrate outdoors if you can, have some ventilation indoors if you can.” It puts England at odds with the rest of the United Kingdom in how people will be allowed to ring in the new year. Here is what you can, and cannot, do: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have shortened its recommended time for isolation for people who test positive for Covid-19 from 10 days to five days if they don’t have symptoms. The reduction follows the CDC’s decision last week to cut its isolation period for infected health care workers assuming they are asymptomatic and later test negative. Health officials have similarly shortened the recommended time for people to quarantine if they are exposed to the virus to five days if they are vaccinated, and often to no time if they are boosted. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the country is about to see a lot of Omicron cases. “Not all of those cases are going to be severe. In fact many are going to be asymptomatic,” she told The Associated Press. “We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science.” Hospitality bosses have welcomed news that the government has ruled out additional Covid restrictions in England before the busy New Year’s Eve trading period. Businesses had been calling for certainty, with bars and restaurants saying they had been left in limbo at a time of potentially lucrative bookings – or costly cancellations. The industry had feared that Boris Johnson and ministers would toughen up Covid-19 measures in England, after the Omicron variant led to a surge in Covid infections. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have already imposed tougher Covid rules on physical distancing and the number of people who can meet, including the closure of nightclubs. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality, the industry body, said the confirmation by Sajid Javid, the health secretary, that no further clampdown would come in England until early 2022 was welcome news for businesses. She said that the government had taken a “pragmatic and proportionate approach” which would “give a real lifeline for many who have struggled with the loss of trade in the run up to Christmas. “Losing new year on top of December would have been devastating, and keeping restrictions to a minimum helps protects businesses and jobs,” she said.

The rate, measured over the preceding 14 days, rose to 1,206 cases following the Christmas weekend, according to health ministry data. That compares with 911 reported on Thursday. The figures have added 214,619 new cases and a further 120 deaths since Thursday. Daily deaths have been hovering below 100, far lower than the 1,000 mark at the peak of the first wave last year or about 600 in January. “We are obviously going to see high numbers of infections, but not hospitalisations and ICU admissions compared to previous waves,” the country’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters earlier today. The number of patients in England admitted into hospital with Covid-19 has reached its highest level since mid-February after a 74% rise in a week. NHS figures updated for the first time since the Christmas break show here were 1,281 Covid-19 hospital admissions in England on 25 December. This was up 74% week-on-week and the highest number since 16 February. During the second wave of coronavirus, admissions peaked at 4,134 on 12 January. In London, hospital admissions increased by 73% with 364 admissions reported on 25 December. A total of 8,474 people were in hospital in England with Covid-19 as of 8am today – the highest number since 5 March. France has narrowed the delay for a third booster shot to three months from four in response to the rapid spread of Omicron but there will be no curfew for New Year’s Eve, Reuters has reported. Jean Castex, the French prime minister, also said that from Monday and for the next three weeks, all public gatherings will be limited to 2,000 people for indoor events, and to 5,000 people for outdoor events. Consumption of drinks and food will be banned in long-distance transport and home working will become mandatory for at least three days per week where possible, Castex said. Mask wearing will also become mandatory in city centres. The announcement comes as France reported 30,383 new cases today, compared with 27,697 the previous day. On Saturday, the country reported a record high of 104,611 infections, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Speaking to state governors on Monday, Joe Biden said the dramatic surge in US Covid cases caused by the Omicron variant “should be a source of concern but it should not be a source of panic”. “If you’re fully vaccinated and got your booster shot,” Biden said, “you’re highly protected. If you’re unvaccinated, you’re at a high risk of getting severely ill from Covid-19, being hospitalised and in some cases dying.” The president outlined plans to help states tackle the rising caseload. But he did so as uncertainty and disruption continued to spread, particularly in the aviation industry, and as his chief medical adviser said Americans should avoid large New Years events. Federal officials have said people can safely gather with their families if they are vaccinated but say larger celebrations are riskier. On Monday, Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, urged Americans to avoid large gatherings. “When we are talking about a New Year’s Eve party … I would recommend strongly stay away from that this year. There will be other years to do that, but not this year,” Fauci told CNN. Fauci added that he hoped the surge in cases would subside in January. But he said infections could still overwhelm hospitals, especially in highly unvaccinated areas. Read the full article here: Italy reported 142 Covid-related deaths on Monday, compared with 81 deaths the previous day, according to health officials. The number of daily cases rose to 30,810, up from 24,883 on Sunday, Reuters reports. Patients in hospital with Covid – not including those in intensive care – stood at 9,723 on Monday, up from 9,220 a day earlier. There were 100 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 85 on Sunday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,126 from a previous 1,089. Three confirmed cases of the Omicron variant have been recorded, Paraguay’s health ministry said today. The cases were detected in people who had travelled outside the country this month and the patients were quarantined, Reuters reports. An official said the government would not take immediate action on travel, but urged people to plan safely. Here’s the UK health secretary Sajid Javid confirming that no further measures will be introduced in England before the new year. Speaking to reporters this afternoon, Javid said the prime minister had decided not to bring in fresh curbs this week, but said ministers would look again in January at whether measures were needed. Good evening, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from my colleague Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic. Denmark and Iceland reported record daily Covid cases today as the fast-spreading Omicron variant makes Europe the global hotspot for infections and deaths. Europe recorded the most cases and deaths in the past seven days, according to statistics compiled by Agence France-Presse. The five countries with the highest case rates over the last seven days were all European. In Denmark, authorities registered 16,164 cases in 24 hours, the first time the daily caseload has exceeded 15,000 since the pandemic began. Denmark now has the world’s highest infection rate, with 1,612 cases per 100,000 people. Iceland reported 672 cases today. Until mid-December, the country had never reported more than 200 cases and daily cases never exceeded 100 during last year’s autumn wave. Both Denmark and Iceland had some of Europe’s lowest infection rates before the arrival of Omicron. England will have no further Covid restrictions over New Year’s Eve, Boris Johnson has ruled, meaning nightclubs and mass events can continue but people will be urged to test before seeing those who are vulnerable. After a virtual briefing with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, No 10 said the data would continue to be reviewed but that no new steps would be taken before the new year. The decision makes England an outlier in the UK, after Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put limits on social gatherings and mass events. Instead, Johnson and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, will put an emphasis on personal responsibility, despite warnings from health bosses and trade unions, stressing the needs to wear masks indoors, keep areas ventilated and to take tests before seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives. Greece has announced further restrictions effective between 3 and 16 January to contain a further surge in Covid infections, targeting mainly night-time entertainment venues. As confirmed new Covid cases surged to a record of 9,284 on Monday, resulting in 66 deaths, the health minister said that under the new measures, high-protection masks would be compulsory at supermarkets, public transport and eating establishments. Bars and restaurants will have to close at midnight and no standing customers at entertainment venues will be allowed. There will also be a maximum limit of six people per table, Reuters reported. “If we find that these measures are not complied with we will ban music [at entertainment venues],” the health minister, Thanos Plevris, told a news conference. The government also moved to restrict attendance of sports events to 10% of capacity or an upper limit of 1,000 people. Visitors at care facilities for the elderly will be permitted if they can furnish a negative PCR test taken within the previous 48 hours. Authorities had already tightened existing regulations last week, mandating mask wearing in open spaces and banning Christmas and new year festivities. Flight cancellations that disrupted holiday travel stretched into Monday, with major US airlines each cancelling dozens of flights. Staff calling in sick because of Covid, particularly since the emergence of the Omicron variant, have left airlines short in recent days. According to FlightAware, which tracks flight cancellations, airlines have cancelled roughly 4,000 flights to, from or inside the US since Friday. Delta, United, JetBlue and American have all said that coronavirus was causing staffing problems, and European and Australian airlines also cancelled holiday-season flights because staff were infected, but weather and other factors played a role as well. Winter weather in the Pacific Northwest led to nearly 250 flight cancellations to or from Seattle on Sunday, said Alaska Airlines, and the airline expects more than 100 flight cancellations on Monday. United said it cancelled 115 flights Monday, out of more than 4,000 scheduled, due to crews out with Covid. Covid cases in the UK have remained high, with 98,515 new confirmed cases reported on Monday as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a winter wave of infections. The latest official data also reveals figures for Christmas Day and Boxing Day, for which 113,628 and 108,893 daily cases have been reported respectively. However, as experts have noted, figures around Christmas may not give a true picture of the situation – not least as people may be less likely to have a Covid test. “Data will be unreliable over the festive period as testing and hospital admission patterns change. This will make it difficult to interpret any apparent trends over the next few days,” documents released on Thursday by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned. The numbers of in-person Boxing Day shoppers in Britain fell to almost half of pre-pandemic levels. Footfall at shopping sites across the UK on Boxing Day was 41% below the 2019 level, data from industry analyst Springboard shows. In contrast to bustling bargain hunters normally filling shops on Boxing Day, the footfall in high streets was 37.7% lower than in 2019, while it dropped 48.4% in shopping centres and 40.2% in retail parks. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard, said: A major reason for the significantly lower footfall compared with 2019 will be due to consumers’ ongoing nervousness about the Covid infection rate. This will have been compounded by the fact that a few multiple retailers opted not to open on Boxing Day which will have deterred some shoppers. In addition, Sunday generally has the lowest footfall on any day in the week so a comparison with 2019 when Boxing Day fell on a Thursday will always have meant that footfall would be lower than two years ago. Despite this, most multiple retailers still opened their doors to shoppers, and the mild weather should have meant that it was easy for shoppers to visit stores and destinations. In central London, footfall was 41% lower than 2019 numbers, while it was 42% below in other major UK cities. This had improved during the day, however, as at noon in the capital, footfall was 67% lower than pre-pandemic levels. Footfall dropped by 61.6% in Northern Ireland, 48.3% in Scotland, 51.3% in Wales and 39.7% in England. Israel’s health ministry said on Monday it was shortening the time between offering the second and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine to three months from five months. The health ministry said the decision was based on a ”steep rise” in infections as the Omicron variant spreads, Haaretz reports. The new timeframe would be applied to vaccines made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. Israel on Monday also introduced tougher regulations on public access to shopping and commercial centres. Israel recorded 1,760 new infections on Monday and logged 87 active serious cases, a slight decline from Sunday’s 96. The number of new seriously ill Covid patients however has been steadily climbing over the past five days. Scotland has recorded a record number of Covid cases over the Christmas weekend, hitting a high of 11,030 new cases on Boxing Day due to the highly-infectious Omicron variant, the Scottish government has said. The Scottish government said provisional data showed that 8,252 fresh cases were confirmed on Christmas Day, 11,030 on Sunday 26 December and 10,562 on Monday. These are the highest daily figures reported in Scotland since the pandemic began in March 2020. It said a majority of those cases came from tests carried out before Christmas Day and warned that data and reporting would be inconsistent over the holiday weekend. “With the longer turnaround time for test results at the moment, the actual number of positive Covid-19 cases may be higher,” it said. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is due to update a specially-reconvened sitting of the Scottish parliament on Wednesday about the spread of the virus and the impact on hospitals. She said these data were expected, and urged people to continue using facemasks in public, observe distancing rules and take all booster jabs on offer. Earlier on Monday, Scotland’s health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said nearly 74% of eligible Scots had received their boosters, bringing the country close to its revised target of 80% of the population getting boosters by 31 December. Sturgeon said: These figures underline how important it is that we don’t underestimate the impact of Omicron - even if the rate of hospitalisation associated with it is much lower than past strains of the virus, case numbers this high will still put an inevitable further strain on NHS. This level of infection will also cause a significant and severely disruptive level of sickness absence across the economy and critical services. So even though we are all thoroughly fed up with the impact of Covid on our lives, it is really important that over the new year period we follow guidance to help slow the spread of the virus while we complete the accelerated booster programmes. Health experts urged the Italian government on Monday to relax Covid-19 quarantine rules, warning that the country otherwise risked paralysis as the highly infectious Omicron variant spreads. Reuters reports: Under current rules, people who have come into close contact with a Covid-19 sufferer have to self-isolate for seven days if they are vaccinated and for 10 days if they have not had a shot. Nino Cartabellotta, head of the Gimbe health foundation, said each positive person had, on average, five to 10 close contacts, and predicted that within two weeks 1 million people in Italy might have come down with Covid-19. “That would mean there could be five to 10 million contacts to be sent to quarantine, and this is not possible,” Cartabellotta told Radio Cusano Campus. Fabrizio Pregliasco, a virologist, echoed his comment: “It’s clear that at this stage and with this diffusion of Omicron, we must consider changes in the way we intervene, otherwise we’re heading for a generalised lockdown.” Boris Johnson is not expected to announce further restrictions for England on Monday after he is briefed on the impact Christmas had on Covid infections and hospital pressures. The prime minister delayed any new cabinet summit on restrictions until after his regular data briefing with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty – expected to be knighted in the new year honours – and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s story. There were no walk-in PCR tests available to book anywhere in England for a few hours on Monday due to “high demand”. Appointments had been unavailable in every region of the country, although there were some in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. However, later on in the afternoon, bookings were available in every region, with the UK Health Security Agency saying the reduced availability was merely temporary, PA reports. A UKHSA spokesperson said: Appointments for PCR tests are available but high demand can lead to temporarily reduced availability in some areas. More appointments are made available for people to book every afternoon. Testing is playing an integral role in keeping people safe and managing the spread of Covid-19. We are very grateful to everyone who is following the government’s guidance and getting tested to protect themselves, their loved ones and their communities. Everyone with symptoms or who is directed to get a PCR test should continue to come forward to get a test delivered to their home or at a test site. Twitter users said the lack of availability of tests could affect travel plans, sports fixtures and business appointments. Professor Alison Leary, chair of healthcare and workforce modelling at London South Bank University, said as much as 40% of the NHS workforce in London could be absent because of rising coronavirus infections under her worst-case scenario workings. She told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: The NHS is in a fairly fragile state in terms of workforce anyway – that’s fairly well documented – and the increased absence rate due to Covid and Omicron in particular are putting a lot more strain on the system. Christmas Eve is the last data we have – there is more data due out today – but, essentially, London’s absence rate is up by about 30%, depending on the organisation. That’s not just people off sick with Covid but also people isolating because of positive tests. It is kind of going up every week. Normal sickness rate runs around 4%-5% in the NHS, and we are looking more now at 8%-9%. Asked whether that pattern was likely to be replicated elsewhere, Leary said there were similar signs in the north-west of England and that the Midlands was showing “increased rates of absence”. Asked what was likely to happen over the coming weeks, she said: One of the scenarios we’ve modelled is around 40% of the workforce being off, absent in London. We’d hope that’s a worst-case scenario, but because we are already seeing an increase, I think it wouldn’t be unrealistic to expect that to go up significantly. US airlines cancelled about 800 more flights on Monday after nixing thousands of flights during the Christmas holiday weekend, as Omicron cases across the country rise, forcing crews to isolate. Shares of American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Delta Air Line Inc and Southwest Airlines Co were down between 2% and 3% in trading before the opening bell, Reuters reports. Nearly 740 flights were cancelled within, into, or out of the US by early on Monday morning, a tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com showed. The flight cancellations on Monday were on top of over 3,000 cancellations during the Christmas holiday weekend, typically a peak time for travel for Americans. With rising infections, airlines have been forced to cancel flights, with pilots and cabin crew needing to quarantine. Delta, United, Southwest and American did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Over the weekend, at least three cruise ships were forced to return to port after Covid-19 cases were detected on board, according to media reports. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, is not expected to announce further restrictions to control the Omicron variant in England after being briefed on the impact Christmas had on Covid infections and hospital pressures. Cabinet ministers remained sceptical of further Covid curbs on Monday morning as Johnson prepared to receive his post-Christmas briefing on the latest infection data by chief medical officer for England, Profe Chris Whitty, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser. The PA news agency understands no announcement is expected to come out of the meeting, potentially leaving England at odds with other parts of the UK, where post-Christmas restrictions have been deployed. Conservative MPs have urged caution in going beyond plan B in England, with veteran Tory Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, calling for a “wait-and-see” approach to the impact of infections on hospital admissions and saying he hoped the prime minister would be “very cautious before introducing further measures”. The latest UK infection data currently in the public domain is from Christmas Eve, when more than 122,000 people tested positive in the previous 24 hours, while hospital data on the government dashboard has not been updated since 20 December. Curbs on hospitality and large events were reintroduced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with the Scottish government ordering nightclubs to be closed from Monday while hospitality businesses will need to return to offering only table service if serving alcohol. Johnson had previously indicated he would not hesitate to introduce tougher measures after Christmas if rising cases of the Omicron variant threatened to overwhelm the NHS. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to announce new Covid measures on Monday as the country braces for a new wave of infections driven by the Omicron variant. Officials fear that hospitals could become overwhelmed after a record 100,000 cases were reported Saturday, the highest daily level in France since the pandemic began. Macron will hold a crisis meeting at 4pm (1500 GMT) via video conference from his Mediterranean holiday retreat at Brégançon with key members of his cabinet and representatives of French public health bodies. One measure under consideration is to restrict the country’s Covid health pass, which is required to enter restaurants, cinemas and other public venues, only to people who are fully vaccinated - and no longer also to those with a recent negative test. The pass as well as a negative test could also be required for bars or cafes without table seating, and possibly for nightclubs if they are allowed to reopen in January after a four-week closure ordered on 6 December, Reuters reports. Doctors have also clamoured for a New Year’s Eve curfew, while a group of health workers have urged the government to postpone the return of students to schools currently set for 3 January. Masks could also be required when outside, a measure already imposed in the Savoie region in the French Alps, and in other European countries. Officials have been urging people not to hold parties or large family gatherings over the holidays, and some 22 million people out of an eligible 40 million have received Covid booster shots. Travel plans of people in England over the festive period are being badly affected by industrial action, planned closures and pandemic-related staff shortages. Several rail services are currently experiencing disruption due to staff being ill with Covid-19, with TransPennine Express, ScotRail, Avanti West Coast, Northern Rail, LNER and Greater Anglia all having reported an impact on services caused by a lack of available staff. East Midlands Railway services continue to be affected by industrial action by the RMT union, with an amended service expected to run on 2 January, PA reports. A number of routes are also being hit by planned engineering works. Southern’s Gatwick airport trains are operating to and from London Bridge instead of London Victoria until 3 January. In the north, Leeds will have a reduced service between 27 December and 3 January, including a “very limited” service on 2 January. In the west, CrossCountry trains will not call at Bristol Parkway between 27 December and 31 December, while Some Great Western Railway services to and from Bristol Temple Meads will also be affected. Despite the closures, National Rail said that 95% of Britain’s rail network will remain open during the festive period. It added that the 370 engineering projects it is carrying out over Christmas were planned “months, and in some cases years, in advance”. The London Underground and Overground will also be hit by planned closures. Enough coronavirus booster jab appointments have been booked to put the Scottish government’s target of 80% of the adult population by the new year within tangible reach, Scotland’s national clinical director, Jason Leitch, has said. Prof Leitch said around 72% of the adults in Scotland had received their booster shot before Christmas Eve. Discussing the government’s “get boosted by the bells” target on the BBC’s Breakfast programme, he said: We’re at 72-point something before Christmas Eve. We’ve got appointments to get to 80%. What we need now is that final push to get people to come to fill those appointments. That honestly is the best present you could give to any of your relatives, to get yourself protected so that you then protect others. Prof Leitch also said he was “very, very hopeful” schools would return on time in January. An Israeli hospital administered fourth Covid-19 vaccine doses on Monday to a test group, as the country considers approving the extra jab for clinically vulnerable populations in a bid to stem a surge in infections fuelled by the Omicron variant. Reuters reports: The Sheba Medical Centre study in Ramat Gan outside Tel Aviv “will zero in on efficacy of the vaccine in producing antibodies, and safety, in order to ascertain if a fourth vaccine is needed in general”, a spokesman said. The 150 subjects are all medical staff. A health ministry expert panel last week recommended that Israel become the first country to offer a fourth vaccine dose - also known as a second booster - to those aged over 60, those suffering from compromised immune systems, and medical workers. The proposal was welcomed by the Israeli government, which has struggled against a plateauing of turn-out for vaccines. But the fourth shot awaits final approval by the ministry’s director general, Nachman Ash, a medical doctor whose decision, officials say, will be made without government intervention. Given concern about the lack of test data, Ash may amend the eligibility criteria by raising the age threshold to 70 and dropping medical workers from the roster, Israeli media said. The health ministry has neither confirmed nor denied that, nor said when Ash’s decision is due. Some 63% of Israel’s 9.4 million population have received the first two vaccine doses, according to ministry data. Almost 45% have also received a third dose, or booster shot. Close to 2,000 confirmed or suspected Omicron cases have been logged. Israel was the fastest country to roll out initial vaccines a year ago, and became one of the first to observe that immunity waned over time, responding with a widespread booster programme. Hello everyone, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be helming this blog for the next few hours. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter @JedySays or via email. Oman will not allow employees in the public or private sectors to enter their workplace without a vaccination certificate that proves they are fully vaccinated, Reuters reports. The health minister made the announcement during a news conference on Monday. We will have more on this story as it develops. The Democratic Republic of Congo is battling a fourth wave of the coronavirus that is threatening to put greater pressure on its health system than at any time during the pandemic. Congo is the least vaccinated country against Covid-19 in the world with just 0.06% for the population fully vaccinated, Agence France Presse reported earlier this month. Fewer than 300,000 people out of a population of 90 million have received at least one dose, or just 0.33%, Reuters data indicates. The vaccine rollout was hindered by a lack of funds and supplies, remote populations and rumours claiming that vaccination made people sterile or that Africans were to be used as “guinea pigs”. Now Covid patients fill hospital wards and tents are needed to cope with the overflow, Reuters reports. “We have experienced the three previous waves gradually, but in the fourth wave cases have jumped overnight,” said Francois Kajingulu, the head of the St Joseph Covid Treatment Centre in Kinshasa. “On Monday we had 5-6 cases and on Saturday we went straight from 30 to 36.” Congo registered 6,480 new cases in the week of 13 December - more than double the number hit during its previous record week in June, World Health Organization data show. The Netherlands is suggesting a rather innovative approach for those hesitant to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Health minister and deputy prime minister, Hugo de Jonge, has recommended those with “injection anxiety” to use virtual reality glasses in vaccination centres run by the the Public Health Service of Amsterdam (GGD). “Do you suffer from injection anxiety, but still want the (booster) injection?” de Jonge asked over Twitter. “The GGD is happy to help you. For example, there are more and more locations where they work with VR glasses that make it easier to relax during the injection. They also work with it in Rotterdam.” As US regional health authorities reacted with alarm to a jump in child Covid infections that caused some school districts to announce returns to remote learning, a leading public health official questioned the need for schools to close, saying: “We know how to keep schools open, we know how to keep them safe.” Over the past three weeks, as Omicron-related cases soared in New York City and elsewhere, the number of children hospitalised in New York with Covid-19 quadrupled, the state health department said. The California state epidemiologist Dr Erica Pan wrote on Twitter: “Unfortunately New York is seeing an increase in pediatric hospitalisations (primarily amongst the unvaccinated), and they have similar [five - to 11-year-old] vaccination rates.” Across New York state, about 16% of five- to 11-year-olds and 71% of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated. Rising numbers of pediatric cases have convinced officials in some states to order a return to remote learning after the winter break. Around 300 schools in Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York will remain closed. Read the full story from our reporter Edward Helmore in New York here. Ukraine has just released its daily Covid report, confirming another 1,864 coronavirus cases recorded on Sunday. Another 133 deaths were also reported, according to a statement from the ministry of health. There is trepidation in Australia over how New Year’s Eve celebrations will contribute to rising case numbers. Donna Lu reports that experts are urging caution: South Korea has confirmed it has approved for emergency use Pfizer’s oral coronavirus treatment Paxlovid and will introduce the drug for treatment in January next year. The treatment is expected to reduce hospitalisation and death of high-risk mild/moderate patients, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCPA) said in a press release. In Britain, those who are still eligible to receive their coronavirus jabs are being urged to start 2022 by getting the vaccine as more than 1.5 million appointments are available to book over the festive season. PA reports that the NHS said there were 1,551,187 slots still available to be booked between Monday and January. NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis called on people to get boosted in time for the New Year. He said: “The evidence is clear that two Covid jabs is not enough, and with the Omicron variant, there is no time to delay getting your booster. “Staff and volunteers up and down the country are working incredibly hard to make sure that anyone who wants to get boosted between now and the new year can do, so start 2022 by protecting yourself, your friends and family and book your jab today.” Australia has surpassed the unwanted milestone of 10,000 new Covid-19 infections in one day, spurred by high case numbers in NSW, Victoria and South Australia, according to the Australian Associated Press. The state of New South Wales reported 6324 new cases while Victoria had 1999, with the two states forming the bulk of the country’s near 10,200 new infections. There were 784 new cases in Queensland, three-quarters of which are the Omicron variant the state’s premier said. There were also a record 842 in South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory’s highest daily tally of 189 new cases, 35 in Tasmania, 12 in the Northern Territory and one in Western Australia. As the sun begins to rise in the UK and many wake up after a weekend of Christmas and holiday festivities, here is a quick visual snapshot of how Covid is currently unfolding in Britain. A major Israeli hospital will begin administering a fourth Covid vaccine shot to 150 medical workers on Monday in a trial aimed at gauging whether a second booster is necessary nationwide. Sheba Medical Centre near Tel Aviv said its trial would shed light on the efficacy of a fourth dose and help decision-makers set health policy in Israel and abroad, Reuters reports. A Health Ministry panel of experts has recommended offering a fourth dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to Israelis aged 60 and over who received a booster shot at least four months ago. But final approval by the ministry’s director-general is still pending amid public debate as to whether sufficient scientific information is available to justify a new booster drive. Sheba Medical Centre did not say how long its trial would last. Gili Regev-Yochay, the study’s director, said: We will examine the fourth dose’s effect on the level of antibodies and morbidity and we will gauge its safety. We will understand whether it is worthwhile to administer a fourth shot, and to whom.” Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you on the blog as we go through all the latest coronavirus developments. I’ll be reporting from Sydney, Australia before one of my colleagues joins from London. Christmas might have put a pause on any new Covid curbs or announcements but this may all change with ministers in the UK set to meet sometime this week to discuss whether additional measures are needed to protect hospital capacity. Boris Johnson is expected to examine crucial hospital data before making any new announcement on Covid measures. Another blunder has emerged from Sydney’s St Vincent’s pathology lab after almost 1000 people were sent the wrong Covid test information. A total of 995 people were contacted over their ‘negative’ tests, which may have been incorrect as the results are yet to be determined. This is in addition to the 400 people who were told on Sunday they were negative when they were in fact positive. US airlines called off nearly 1,200 flights on Sunday as crews remain grounded amid surging Covid-19 infections, causing misery for thousands of Christmas travellers. A total of 997 flights were scrapped on Christmas Day and nearly 700 on Christmas Eve. Thousands more were delayed. On the other side of the world, lockdown restrictions have been tightened in the Chinese city of Xi’an, which is battling the largest community outbreak the country has seen since the initial months of the pandemic. Authorities reported 162 new community infections on Monday, up from 158 on Sunday. All but 10 of Monday’s new cases were reported in Shaanxi province, where 13 million residents of the capital Xi’an have been locked down for five days. Here’s a quick rundown of the latest global developments: Europe: UK prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to examine crucial hospital data on Monday before making any new announcement on Covid measures across England which could include a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors. New restrictions are being introduced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Coronavirus vaccination teams could go door-to-door in the UK to reach those yet to have their jabs, reports have suggested. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections at the weekend, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Germany also recorded 10,100 Covid cases. Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day. The Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in Portugal. United States: US airlines called off nearly 1,200 flights on Sunday as crews remain grounded amid surging Covid-19 infections. It was a third straight day of travelling pain and more cancellations were likely as Covid infections soar. Asia: China’s Covid cases hit a 21-month high as the northern city of Xi’an announced tightened restrictions on Sunday. China recorded 200 new coronavirus cases for 26 December, a slight decrease on the 206 cases reported a day earlier. The northwestern province of Shaanxi, home to the recently locked down city of Xi’an, accounted for 150 new cases. Bangkok, Thailand, is cancelling its new year celebrations amid growing concerns about a surge in Covid cases. South Korea’s daily Covid cases fell below 5,000 for the first time in 20 days. South Korea has approved for emergency use Pfizer’s oral coronavirus treatment Paxlovid, Yonhap news is reporting, citing the country’s ministry of food and drug safety. The ministry convened a panel of experts to review the safety and efficacy of Paxlovid, and concluded that the oral pill is needed to deal with the public health crisis, the agency reports. The ministry said trial results showed Paxlovid significantly reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death in patients at high risk of severe illness. If you have just joined us, welcome to our live coronavirus blog covering all the latest Covid developments. Health officials warn a post-Christmas jump in Australia’s Covid-19 infections is expected after lower testing rates and a batch of falsely negative results. More than 9,600 cases were recorded across the country on Sunday after New South Wales and South Australia recorded new daily case highs, with 6,394 and 774 infections respectively. Numbers fell in Victoria, which recorded 1,604 daily infections, down about 500 cases from the day before. Here is a quick snapshot of the Covid situation unfolding in Australia. Sydney’s St Vincent’s pathology lab say another 995 people have been contacted over their ‘negative’ tests, which may have been incorrect as the results are yet to be determined. This is in addition to the 400 people who were told on Sunday they were negative when they were in fact positive. Tasmania is seeking advice on whether rapid antigen Covid-19 tests can be used at its border for interstate travellers, instead of PCR tests, AAP reports. The state recorded 35 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, a slight drop on the 44 reported on Boxing Day. Queensland is also considering using rapid antigen tests instead of PCR tests for travellers’ day-five tests. The state detected 784 new Covid-19 cases. Western Australia has recorded just one new local Covid infection, while premier Mark McGowan warns the state is “not out of the woods yet” after a French backpacker was in the community while infectious. The Northern Territory detected 12 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours as health authorities investigate a mystery case in Darwin. The Australian Capital Territory recorded 189 new Covid cases, a record number. Coronavirus cases in Germany have just surpassed seven million. The country reported another 13,908 cases over the past 24 hours, taking the cumulative Covid tally to 7,005,289 confirmed cases. Another 69 deaths were also recorded, according to data released by the Robert Koch Institute. India is reporting a daily rise of 6,531 coronavirus cases and 315 deaths, according to a recently released statement from its ministry of health. Tasmania is seeking advice on whether rapid antigen Covid-19 tests can be used at its border for interstate travellers, instead of PCR tests, AAP reports. The state recorded 35 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, a slight drop on the 44 reported on Boxing Day. About two-thirds of Tasmania’s new cases were acquired in another state, 20% spread within families and close contacts and two cases do not have a specific source yet. Premier Peter Gutwein said the Tasmanian government is seeking advice on whether rapid antigen tests can be used for interstate arrivals. Gutwein told reporters in Hobart on Monday: We have a 72 hour pre-test requirement for PCR test if you’re looking to travel to Tasmania and, I want to be clear, that will remain in place for the time being. But we are considering other options such as where the rapid antigen testing can be used as a safeguard. We’ll have more to say on this, I’ll speak later in the week about what the requirements will be in terms of our borders, as we approach the New Year.” The move aims to take pressure off testing sites in other parts of the country, as demand continues to impact queue lengths and turnaround times in the eastern states. Western Australia has recorded just one new local Covid infection, while premier Mark McGowan warns the state is “not out of the woods yet” after a French backpacker was in the community while infectious. The new infection is a woman in her 20s, in quarantine since 23 December, who was a close contact of an earlier case. “This is good news and another encouraging result from this Delta outbreak,” McGowan told reporters on Monday. McGowan said the health department had identified 608 close contacts, and 1,089 casual contacts, and was in the process of tracking and testing them all. Current restrictions will remain in place until 4 January, and a new proof of vaccination app will be released soon. More on the Covid situation unfolding in Australia’s Northern Territory. Australia’s least populous region detected 12 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours as health authorities investigate a mystery case in Darwin. The mystery case was detected overnight with NT Health saying little except the source of infection is under investigation, the Australian Associated Press reports. Both are people from the Tennant Creek area and household contacts of previous cases, NT Health said on Monday. They were not infectious in the community and are in quarantine. The other nine new cases include a close contact of two workers from Yulara who acquired their infections in Queensland. They were not infectious in the community and are in quarantine at The Centre for National Resilience in Howard Springs, near Darwin. Five cases are interstate arrivals and are all in isolation at home or at the Howard Springs facility. Three cases are close contacts of interstate arrivals. There are currently 15 people with Covid-19 in hospital, including one in intensive care. Sydney’s St Vincent’s pathology lab say another 995 people have been contacted over their ‘negative’ tests, which may have been incorrect as the results are yet to be determined. This is in addition to the 400 people who were told on Sunday they were negative when they were in fact positive. The hospital issued an apology for the first blunder yesterday and now say the additional 995 results will be delivered by Monday night. A media statement shared with the Guardian read: Yesterday SydPath confirmed that more than 400 people were incorrectly advised they had tested negative to COVID when in fact they had tested positive. As soon as SydPath became aware of the issue it immediately commenced a process to contact those impacted. This morning SydPath can confirm that all people within this group have been contacted and advised of their positive result. The emergency response team investigating the cause of this error, has now identified approximately 995 more people, tested on 23 and 24 December, were prematurely sent an SMS advising them their test was negative when in fact their true result had not yet been determined. All of these people have been contacted and advised of the error. They have been advised they will receive their accurate test results by tonight (Monday). Once again, we are sincerely sorry for this error and acknowledge the significant impact it has had on those involved. We have identified what occurred and can confirm it was related to a specific human error. SydPath have put procedures in place to ensure this cannot happen again. This event comes at a time of unprecedented COVID-testing activity and SydPath’s people, as with all pathology teams throughout NSW, are working around the clock to respond.” Bangkok is cancelling its new year celebrations amid growing concerns about a surge in Covid cases. Thailand’s government said in a statement: The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and relevant government agencies regret to announce their cancellation of the New Year celebration events hosted by the BMA in 50 districts, including prayer and chanting ceremonies. The private sector will reportedly still be allowed to host new year countdown festivities under strict precautions. A post-Christmas jump in Covid-19 infections is expected after lower testing rates and a batch of falsely negative results, according to health officials. Australia dodged the unwanted milestone of 10,000 new daily cases on Boxing Day only due to a significant drop in cases in Victoria compared with Christmas Day. More than 9,600 cases were recorded across the country on Sunday after New South Wales and South Australia recorded new daily case highs, with 6,394 and 774 infections respectively. The NSW record came despite a drop of 40,000 tests on Christmas Day. Numbers fell in Victoria, which recorded 1,604 daily infections, down about 500 cases from the day before. There were two deaths in the state. St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney also admitted it accidentally told more than 400 people on Christmas Day they had tested negative to the virus when they had in fact tested positive. The hospital has since notified those who received the wrong results, but concerns remain over people who would have been infectious in the community after being reassured by their initial negative test. The more than 400 false-negative cases are yet to be officially recorded. Annastacia Palaszczuk has also hinted at possible upcoming changes in Covid testing while chief health officer John Gerrard said the state’s quarantine rules were also being reviewed, indicating these may be relaxed. Palaszczuk said the government was considering using rapid antigen tests instead of PCR tests for travellers’ day-five tests. The measure could be introduced within the next 48 hours. The rapid tests could replace all PCR tests for travellers, with Palaszczuk saying a policy change was unlikely before 1 January. Covid-19 testing centres in Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Cairns have been given more resources to increase capacity and reduce queuing times. Meanwhile, online vaccination bookings are open for children aged five to 11 years, with jabs set to start from 10 January. More on the Covid situation unfolding in Queensland. There are 3,621 active cases in the state and 24,515 people were tested in the past 24 hours, according to the Australian. About 75% of cases are the Omicron variant and 25% are Delta, with the majority of infections among people aged 35 and younger. More than half of the state’s 5,798 cases have been diagnosed since the borders reopened on 13 December. Annastacia Palaszczuk said the government had not expected the 400,000 interstate visitors and this, coupled with private testing clinics closing over the festive period, had added extra burden on Queensland Health’s testing facilities. Queensland has detected 784 new Covid-19 cases but the health system is coping, state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has said. Quarantine and testing policies are being reviewed and rapid antigen tests may be introduced for some people within 48 hours to take pressure of testing facilities, AAP reports. There has not been a spike in case numbers on Monday with just 70 more infections recorded over the past 24 hours compared with the 714 on Sunday. But Palaszczuk warned Queenslanders case numbers would continue to climb: I don’t want people to be alarmed by that, the real issue here is what is the impact it is having on individuals in hospitals? We are not seeing any massive impacts on our hospitals, which is really good news. We are monitoring this very closely. Just four “significantly unwell” people were in a hospital receiving care for virus symptoms. The Australian Capital Territory has recorded 189 new Covid cases, a record number. The ACT has an extraordinary vaccination rate of 98.5% of people aged 12 and over. One person is in hospital but no one is in intensive care or on ventilation, AAP reports. The Chinese city of Xi’an, where 13 million residents are in lockdown and confined to their homes, announced tightened restrictions on Sunday as the country recorded its biggest Covid-19 infection numbers in 21 months. On Sunday the country reported 206 new Covid infections – the highest daily number since March 2020, according to the national health commission. “In the coming days, a number of cases are still likely to be detected,” Agence France-Presse reported Xi’an official He Wenquan as saying. The northern metropolis – about 900km (560 miles) from the Olympics venues – has so far recorded more than 500 Covid infections over the past few weeks. About 29,000 people have been placed in hotel quarantine, He Wenquan said. Xi’an residents have been tested several times, authorities said, and a “total” disinfection was to begin Sunday evening. Restrictions on movement have also been tightened. Each household can only send one member out to buy basic necessities once every three days – down from two days under previous rules. All businesses except supermarkets, convenience stores and medical facilities have been ordered to close. South Korea has also just released its latest coronavirus figures with some more promising news. New Covid-19 cases fell below 5,000 for the first time in 20 days on Monday, Yonhap News reports. The country added 4,207 new Covid-19 infections, raising the total caseload to 611,670 as well as 55 more deaths, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). The figure marked the first time daily cases fell below 5,000 since 7 December and represented a sharp decline from a daily record high of 7,849 on 15 December. The number of critically ill Covid-19 patients also slightly fell to 1,078 after reaching an all-time high of 1,105 on Saturday, the KDCA said. The decreasing infections are believed to be due partly to the newly introduced restrictions and possible fewer tests taken at the weekend. China has just released its daily Covid report, recording 200 new coronavirus cases for 26 December, according to newly updated data from the national health commission. The figure is a slight decrease on the 206 cases reported a day earlier. Of the 200 cases reported, 162 are believed to be from local transmission, with 38 imported cases from abroad. The northwestern province of Shaanxi, home to the recently locked down city of Xi’an, accounted for 150 new cases. The Boxing Day Ashes Test is also under way at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The match got off to a delayed and chaotic start after Channel Seven, the host broadcaster, reported that the MCG press box had a confirmed case of Covid-19. A statement from the broadcaster read: The Seven Network confirms it is responding after a member of staff working on the Ashes broadcast at the MCG tested positive to Covid-19 on Sunday night. The staff member was asymptomatic at time of testing and has been in self isolation since the moment the positive result was returned. Seven is activating its Covid measures to ensure the health and safety of all staff, as well as the broader community, and is working in line with all relevant guidelines and regulations. We are working closely with the MCG operational team and Cricket Australia. The ECB also released a statement about an English touring family member testing positive. Cricket Australia later released a statement confirming four cases (so far) in the England tour party after rapid antigen tests this morning. Play is under way and you can also follow our live feed of the Ashes 2021-22 third Test, day two: Australia v England here. A small change to the hospital numbers in New South Wales: Just to recap on Australian Covid news: Three people have died in New South Wales – and the Sydney Morning Herald reports that one man died with the Omicron strain. That’s the first NSW Omicron death. NSW recorded 6,324 new cases, there were 35 in Tasmania and 784 in Queensland, where children aged five to 11 are now eligible for vaccinations. Three more people died in Victoria and there were 1,999 new cases. Stay tuned for more developments. US airlines called off nearly 1,200 flights on Sunday as crews remain grounded amid surging Covid-19 infections, causing misery for thousands of Christmas travellers. Commercial airlines had cancelled 1,171 flights within, into or out of the US by mid-afternoon, according to a tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com and as reported by Reuters. It was a third straight day of travelling pain and more cancellations were likely as Covid infections soar, driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. A total of 997 flights were scrapped on Christmas Day and nearly 700 on Christmas Eve. Thousands more were delayed. Read the full story here. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you on the blog as we run through all the latest Covid developments from across Australia and the world. Let’s start with the news that US airlines have cancelled more than 1,000 flights as crews remain grounded and forced to quarantine amid surging Covid-19 infections. Flight-tracking website FlightAware.com recorded 656 cancelled flights either into or out of the US on Sunday. This comes after nearly 1,000 were cancelled on Christmas Day and nearly 700 on Christmas Eve. Meanwhile, Covid cases continue to rise to record levels in Australia. The nation’s most populous state of New South Wales recorded three deaths and 6,324 new cases while Victoria recorded three deaths and 1,999 new cases. But vaccination rates may offer some solace, with 92% of Victorians aged 12 and over fully vaccinated and 93.5% of people aged 16 and over in NSW having received at least two jabs. Europe: New restrictions are being introduced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. New Covid measures in England could be in place until late March, including a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors. Coronavirus vaccination teams could go door-to-door in the UK to reach those yet to have their jabs, reports have suggested. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections at the weekend, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Germany also recorded 10,100 Covid cases. Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day. The Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in Portugal. US: More than 1000 flights were grounded on Sunday. Asia: China’s local Covid case count has reached a 21-month high driven by the Xi’an outbreak as the city remains in a strict lockdown. In South Korea, three members of K-pop sensation BTS test have tested positive after their return from the US. They are all fully vaccinated. Middle East: The Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday it had identified the first case of the Omicron variant in the Gaza Strip. An Israeli hospital will begin administering a fourth vaccine jab to 150 staff on Monday in a trial aimed at gauging whether a second booster is necessary nationwide. Israel has ordered 100,000 units of Pfizer Inc’s antiviral pill Paxlovid for people aged 12 and over at risk of severe illness. Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett has started isolating at home after his daughter tested positive. Iran has banned the entry of travellers from Britain, France, Denmark and Norway for 15 days."

          "headline": "Transgender people: judges advised to use preferred personal pronouns",
          "bodyText": "Judges have been told that it is a matter of “common courtesy” in cases involving transgender people to use the personal pronoun and name that a person prefers, and that reporting restrictions could be used to prevent a previous name being disclosed. In updated guidance, they were also reminded that there is a high level of transphobic hate crime, which is believed to be greatly underreported, and that trans people may be apprehensive about coming to court, particularly when there was a risk of possible disclosure of their medical history. The new advice is contained in the “equal treatment benchbook”, a 540-page guide from the Judicial College, which is responsible for training judges in county, crown and higher courts in England and Wales. The guidance, however, is also used by sitting judges. In one of 12 chapters, entitled Trans People, the document states: “It should be possible to respect a person’s gender identity and their present name for nearly all court and tribunal purposes, regardless of whether they have obtained legal recognition of their gender by way of a Gender Recognition Certificate.” A person’s gender at birth or their transgender history should not be disclosed unless it is necessary and relevant to the particular legal proceedings, it adds, before warning that there may be situations where the rights of a witness to refer to a trans person by pronouns matching their gender assigned at birth clash with the trans person’s right to privacy. The guide states that issues around gender identity could and should be addressed at an early, case-management stage, for example instances when a witness might be unwilling or unable to give evidence in a way that maintains the trans person’s privacy. “For example, a victim of domestic abuse or sexual violence at the hands of a trans person may understandably describe the alleged perpetrator and use pronouns consistent with their gender assigned at birth because that is in accordance with the victim’s experience and perception of the events.” In the “rare circumstances” where it is necessary in the proceedings to disclose a person’s previous name and transgender history, the guidance says that the court may consider imposing reporting restrictions to prevent the disclosure of this information. It goes on to observe that the Equality Act 2010 appears to be limited in its explicit protection for trans people, in that the protected characteristic is defined as gender reassignment, adding: “However, its full interpretation and scope has not yet been tested in the appellate courts.” In a foreword, Lady Justice King, the appeal court judge and the chair of the college, described the book as a “living document, constantly updated and amended to reflect changing circumstances and to incorporate the most up-to-date knowledge”. In other sections, the document says the need for swift adoption of remote hearings during the Covid-19 pandemic “has magnified difficulties faced by children and vulnerable adults in hearings”. In relation to sentencing at the time of a pandemic, it advises: “It is permissible to take into account the current conditions in prison arising from Covid-19 protection measures, when deciding whether to suspend a sentence. “For example, the likely impact of a custodial sentence could be heavier if the offender is likely to be confined to a cell for much longer periods than usual. This may be even more so for offenders with mental ill health or impairment.” The most recent edition of the document represents the first major revision in three years."

          "bodyText": "Years ago I collected my new prescription glasses and walked home staring up like a person who had time-travelled from a pre-aeroplane era: I had no idea trees had individual leaves that could be seen from the ground. Before 2020, I had never noticed gardens, either: they were things that old people liked and neighbourhood dads mowed constantly. The garden attached to my flat became interesting only if a fox was standing in it. Then lockdown happened, and the people who usually kept the vines and trees from eating the building stopped coming. I tried to sort it out myself, pathetically Googling to figure out what was supposed to be there and what was an alien plant invasion. Somehow, I ended up watching Gardeners’ World. I can’t remember the first episode I saw, nor the first time I heard Monty Don talk about elephant garlic. I’d never heard of a “sweet pea” outside of Popeye cartoons, but I remember Monty telling us that their fragrance was intoxicating. I learned that flowers that looked like living spirographs were called dahlias and that tulips and daffodils, the welcome sights of spring and harbingers of warmth, only come alive if they’ve been left out in the cold all winter. Over the year, my interest, well, grew. My boyfriend gave me Monty Don’s back catalogue of books for my birthday, including one from the 90s where he’s still going by Montagu. Very soon I became entirely unavailable on Friday nights, mentally or physically; if Monty was in the pond with his waders on, even the cat was ignored. Whatever horrors were happening in the news, the birds were chirping at Longmeadow and Monty was there among them, a calming presence when everything else was on fire. “The BBC made a decision to carry on filming Gardeners’ World, and I always see it rather like wartime,” says Monty, when I call to tell him about the creepy shrine I have erected in his honour (I’m joking. I would never tell him). “They had to entertain the troops. So I was the Vera Lynn of Covid.” There’s a pause and he laughs. “I’m going to regret saying that.” At Longmeadow, where Gardeners’ World is filmed, the BBC installed five miles of cabling and blocked the drive with four metal containers that served as isolation pods for the cameraman, the sound recordist, the director and the electrician. It stayed like that until July 2021. Monty was alone in his garden – Vera Lynn with a walkie-talkie, remote-controlled cameras and an invisible audience. “I really didn’t enjoy filming during lockdown; there was no fun. When you’re filming with a crew it becomes a collaborative, creative process. But I felt, in a quite old-fashioned way, that I was doing my bit.” I ask what got him through the year if he couldn’t watch Gardeners’ World like the rest of us. “I lapped up Succession. I’ve seen the first two seasons twice.” When the first lockdown began, I didn’t know that for the next 18 months I would think of little else but the garden, that I would one day be a person with a preorder for spring bulbs. I am, statistically speaking, not unusual: my newfound interest stands alongside banana bread and sourdough as one of the great pandemic cliches. According to the HTA (Horticultural Trades Association) Garden Retail Monitor, garden centres at one point reported a rise in sales of 34% compared with pre-pandemic times, and they are still trading at 25% higher than in 2019. Gardeners’ World itself had an influx of new viewers. “I don’t think it came out of nowhere,” says Monty of the surge in interest. “This has been a slow burn; circumstance suddenly gave it a flowering. Over the last five years or so there has been a growing movement in people who are interested. It’s the interface with the natural world that most people have.” At last count, 88% of people in the UK had some kind of access to a garden or an outside space. But prior to the pandemic, many regarded their garden as a bind, something else to be kept tidy. “They didn’t see it as a creative opportunity. I think that that’s what lockdown did,” he says. “It opened up the possibilities of a garden.” Lockdown also opened up the possibilities of what the BBC would broadcast: Monty put out a call for viewers to send in videos of their own gardens – to fill the spaces in the programme where presenters would ordinarily go farther afield. They received 10,000 videos in the first year. Although they still included three an episode right through 2021’s series, the majority have never been shown. The videos are a fascinating, uplifting, sometimes heartbreaking glimpse into people’s shrunken lives. There was the woman in Warsaw who had filled her tiny fourth-floor balcony until you couldn’t see the walls, but had left a window for her dog to look out of, like a mouse-door in the skirting board. There was the 84-year-old woman talking about how for the first time she was starting a garden while being conscious of her own mortality; she wanted mature trees because she didn’t believe she had time to wait and watch them grow. And there were the doctors and nurses on a Covid ward who had discovered that the stuffy environment of the hospital office created the perfect conditions for cultivating the kind of vegetables they remembered from growing up in the Philippines. They had Chinese bitter gourds trained up against the windows, ripening in the sun. “I think what’s come through from all those is people just sharing pleasure,” says Monty. His own favourites include a 90-year-old woman who “didn’t quite say it, but she meant: ‘Fuck it, I’m going to do what I want,’” and the infectious joy of the sisters with Down’s syndrome who wrote him a poem. “You can gloss over them and call them simple pleasures, but they’re not: they’re really deep, rich pleasures, and they’re intensely complicated because they strike so close to where true happiness is.” When Gardeners’ World finished for the year last autumn, I was bereft. I watched old episodes and pretended it was spring. I stared out my window and willed the daffodils to grow. All I wanted was a one-off special where Monty wore a big jumper and showed us his houseplants. I couldn’t handle the fact that the light that had seen me through the horrors of the pandemic was going out, just as the clocks changed and the world got darker. This year, when I watched Monty fill pots with tulip bulbs and prepare the garden for another winter, the only thing that grew was the feeling of dread in my stomach. He was going to go away again. “I don’t think the schedulers really understand gardens, gardening, or the audience,” he says. “They see it as: ‘Well, the season’s over, it’s October and it’s wintry. Obviously no one’s interested in gardening in winter, so therefore we don’t put gardening out.’ What they don’t realise is they are gardeners. Gardening doesn’t leave their life just because Gardeners’ World goes off air, any more than food leaves people’s lives because Bake Off finishes a run.” The loss was obviously not felt by me alone. This year, the BBC is putting out winter specials – something it hasn’t done in a decade. The world is more interesting thanks to Monty. I tell him I can name plants in gardens as I pass them, that I can make an educated guess as to how much tender care goes into their lives. I know that trees are sharing food and possibly spreading information through their root systems to alert others to disease or danger – and now that I know all of this is happening beneath my feet and far above my head, I won’t ever forget. As the poet Mary Oliver wrote: “Attention is the beginning of devotion.” “Ah,” he says, chuckling. “Now you’re the smartarse who knows.”"

          "bodyText": "When my older brother died, the first thing I thought about was work. I had just moved to New York from London, so my family had to break the news over the phone, grappling with my grief while still sucker-punched by their own. But if you had asked me at that moment, I would have told you there was no grief. Instead, I immediately began thinking about which editors I was going to have to let down. What work might fall by the wayside for ever? I quickly calculated the upsides of my “time off”. At least I would have more time to spend on that long article that was due. Then I thought about going for a run. Or shouting at somebody. Mostly, I thought about getting off the phone. It was all an inconvenience. Had my family – always so keen to remind me of where I had come from and who I was never going to get to be – just passed on this news to ruin my day? I should probably have been thinking about how my brother and I fought relentlessly, but how he always thought he was trying to protect me. How he would turn up at every family celebration with three dozen Ferrero Rochers in hand. How he was the life and soul of every party I had. But these leaps and twists of my mind, to escape a horrible truth, reflected a mental agility I had learned in childhood. When I ended up estranged from my parents and homeless at 16, I reframed it as “moving out”. When I worked multiple jobs to cover rent in London in my 20s, I told people: “It’s so crazy how having less time makes you more organised! It’s like you have more time!” Dad taught me an exceptional work ethic – he still works six‑day weeks and 16-hour days – something I now realise is due to generational trauma. He fled Bangladesh with his family in the 60s searching for prosperity, only to arrive in a UK that was rife with racism. Yet he never gave up the dream, telling us every day that if we wanted to escape poverty, we needed to work hard. For me, that mantra turned into a compulsion. I started to believe that if I didn’t work hard enough, bad things would happen and I would have only myself to blame. During high school exams, I prepared obsessively for every possible essay question, sticking revision notes on the walls of my homeless shelter, as if they were posters of boybands. I finished that year with near-perfect grades. I had conditioned my body to believe that I could work myself into the ground to escape every trauma, upset and obstacle life threw at me. Then came my brother’s death. In the hours after I received the news, reality set in. I held on to the kitchen counter, walking like a cat, low to the ground from fear. I felt the world unsteady beneath my feet. I called my friends to tell them I didn’t know if I was sitting or standing. “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know,” I responded to every question. I was in shock. I howled in pain at the life-shattering confusion that came from realising that the big brother I knew would now exist only in photographs – aged five, wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt – and in a video on my phone, surprising his best friend with a fridge full of sweets and chocolate. Yet still I tried, after one day in bed, to “snap out of it”. I went out for a bagel. I met a new person in the city and apologised when, less than an hour in, I started to cry uncontrollably. I flew back to London to see my family, screamed at my boyfriend, went to the funeral, then returned to work two weeks later. I was told to take as much time as I needed. But the job in New York was a dream job. Walking through a farmers’ market the day after I had first landed, picking out fresh vegetables and lamb sausages, I had felt as if I had finally escaped. So, when the life-upending phone call came the next day, it felt like a premonition: my old life was trying to catch me again. I felt a familiar compulsion to outpace it. Bosses don’t wait for you to get back on your feet, my dad told me. This time, however, my tank was empty. No matter how much I willed myself to get up and carry on as normal, my body and my mind resisted. I walked out of meetings to cry in the bathroom. Some days I came in and turned around as soon as I got to work. Sometimes I couldn’t get out of my bed at all. One day, standing outside our office in Manhattan, telling my boss I didn’t need to go home when clearly I did, I confessed. “I just don’t want it to defeat me,” I told her. “Well,” she said. “It’s going to beat the shit out of you if you don’t confront it.” When I finally went to a therapist, she confirmed the worst. There was no running from this one. Of course, I tried to argue. I tried to explain a black hole had been chasing me my whole life, that it had chased me out of my home and then across the Atlantic. I told her how it waited around after bad events, promising to suck me back to my old life if I let my guard down. If I didn’t run now, I would soon be homeless again, living on 3p noodles and washing in a bucket in my bedroom. She suggested, gently, that perhaps the reason I couldn’t run any more was because I didn’t have to. What if my body was letting me stay still because I was finally safe, because I had a job that would grant me the time off I desperately needed, a liveable wage that would pay my bills, a partner on whom I could rely? Maybe, she said, I was no longer the 16-year-old living in hostels who would lose everything if she didn’t stop running. I didn’t believe her, but what choice did I have? The sadness was there, my therapist told me; I was just choosing not to look at it. So I tried. I still worked obsessively – old habits die hard – but on days when I was stricken with grief I asked to work from home, or to take a few hours off. I stopped filling my social calendar with events that helped me avoid having to think about what haunted me. I stopped drinking so much and spent more time alone. When I was homeless, I used to avoid the hostel’s TV room. I hated trying to relax in a communal space full of people I didn’t know, pretending it was a home. I didn’t like the attention, or the idea of having to fight over a remote with a fake family. But in my mind, I had reframed this: I told myself that I was so busy that if I watched TV, I would never get anything else done. Now, in the hours when I could no longer force on a happy face, the TV became my best friend. I became acquainted with shows I had never watched: Breaking Bad, The Wire, Girls and The Sopranos. I watched films – and learned that many include a scene in which a brother dies. I cried a lot. I learned that my disposition to run away was a result of trauma, that it left some people feeling like passengers in my life, rather than people invited along for the ride. I learned I was destructible. Finally unable to find a silver lining, I learned that the bad things that happened in my life were neither a test nor a triumph, just unpleasant things that I wished had never happened. With that, I grew around my grief. I learned that no amount of work would prepare me for, nor relieve me from, difficult things – including my brother not being here. I learned that, on some days, I would still find myself blindsided by a memory of him while doing the shopping, or in the middle of a meeting, or during a conversation not related to him at all. In those moments, I learned, I didn’t need to run from the memory. I could just stay still. The mental health charity Mind can be contacted on 0300 123 3393 or by visiting mind.org.uk"

          "headline": "Asad Rehman on climate justice: ‘Now we are seeing these arguments cut through’",
          "bodyText": "Asad Rehman, who emerged as a key figure among the coalition of activists who took to the streets during last month’s climate summit in Glasgow, admits to being “somewhat of a reluctant environmentalist”. Tucking into his lunch in a cafe in east London, Rehman – the director of the charity War on Want – says having cut his teeth as a young, working-class man fighting the National Front in his home town of Burnley during the 70s and 80s, he initially saw the environment movement as remote and largely irrelevant to the causes he was championing. “It was framed as about saving polar bears or whatever, and of really only being a concern to white, middle class environmentalists.” But as his political work expanded – from the miners’ strike to the Stephen Lawrence campaign, the police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes to various social justice campaigns in the global south – his view changed. He began to realise that far from being a distant, technical problem for others to worry about, the climate crisis – and the injustice it created – were central to everything he was fighting for. “I was really struck … on racial justice, on economic and social justice, [the climate and ecological crisis] was an epitome of all of those issues. At the same time, it was also clear to me that it was something that would exacerbate these things ... it was not rocket science, you just needed to join the dots.” Rehman said he was influenced by social justice movements in the global south, which often saw the climate crisis in different terms to the mainstream environmental NGOs in the UK, Europe and North America. “They had a very different way of talking about climate – they saw it as part and parcel of the bigger anti-colonial fight.” In Glasgow, at the UN climate summit, Rehman was at the forefront of a global network of indigenous activists, civil society campaigners, trade unionists, anti racists and youth climate strikers that put that perspective at the heart of the debate. Under the banner of the Cop26 coalition, the activists ensured climate justice, rather than straightforward environmentalism, was centre stage, with activists, delegates and many politicians recognising that the climate emergency could not be solved without addressing the underlying economic system that produces it. “We have spent years and years building the movement,” said Rehman. “Making the argument that this is a systemic crisis, that it is about racialised capitalism, making the case that you cannot understand the climate crisis without understanding that there is an arch from slavery to colonialism and imperialism to the climate crisis ... Now we are seeing those arguments cut through.” The origins of this climate justice movement go back more than a decade. In 2007, Rehman remembers sitting under a tree in Bali, where that year’s UN climate summit was being held, discussing what to do next with dozens of justice campaigners from around the world. The activists had become increasingly disillusioned with an approach that – as they saw it – had become dominated by powerful western countries, global corporations and mainstream NGOs. “We decided then to launch a network that would take the struggle forward not just in the climate talks, but on the ground and in the streets,” said Rehman. “We wanted to build a diverse movement to put justice – social, ecological, racial and gender – at its heart, and be a powerful voice to hold rich countries to account for causing the crisis.” Rehman says a key moment for this embryonic movement came two years later at the Copenhagen climate summit, with climate justice campaigners calling for a 1C warming target lined up against richer countries pushing for a goal of 2C. As the gathering closed in turmoil Lumumba Di-Aping, the then chair of the G77 group of 130 developing countries, made a tearful appeal, saying: “2C is a death sentence for Africa.” Rehman says that moment revealed that rich governments were “calculating that sacrificing black, brown and indigenous people was more acceptable than anything that threatened their economic interests”. Fast-forward 14 years, and although the notion of climate justice that came to prominence at the ad hoc meeting in Bali was central to this year’s Cop26, Rehman is clear-eyed about the scale of the challenges and opportunities that still lie ahead. “This is an epoch moment in human history … as profound and far reaching as the industrial revolution. What people need to realise is that fundamental change is happening – the real question is what kind of transformation we are going to get and who will it serve.” This overt politicisation of the climate emergency has ruffled feathers within the mainstream environment movement and with politicians. Critics argue that by saying the climate crisis cannot be solved without addressing and rewiring the global economy you are setting yourself up to fail, with catastrophic consequences. But Rehman is unrepentant. He argues that “fossil fuels and the logic of extraction and exploitation” are woven into the fabric of the economic order and therefore to tackle emissions you need to address the system of capitalism that creates them and other crises simultaneously, putting “justice and equity” at the heart of the campaign. “[I would say to critics] demonstrate to me in 26 years of your strategy to tackle this crisis how your theory has worked ... You have tried your way again and again and again, and it has not delivered, because how do you transition the global economy when at the same time you are signing trade deals locking in the power of fossil fuel multinationals and corporations, when you have financial institutions at a global level continuing to bank on fossil fuels and the food and energy systems that go with that?” He says the only way to “make that equation work” would be to “consign three-quarters of the world’s population to genuine disaster” and the global north to chaos, inequality and militarism. “If that is not the future you want, if you are not willing to accept that for yourself and your children, we have to ask how are we going to transition an economy that is geared to growth and extraction of profit from materials and labour in a meaningful way?” Despite the scale of the task, Rehman says the growing recognition of the systemic nature of the crisis and the links being built between movements in the global south and those in the north, means the climate justice movement has never been stronger. The key in the coming months, he argues, will be to make the climate crisis relevant to the lives of ordinary people – about warm homes, free public transport and clean air – and to build solidarity. “Winning on the climate is never going to be possible with environmentalists alone; we need to build social licence for the change that is needed and that means bringing in other movements – the labour movement, people working on economic justice and poverty, you have to bring in the energy of Black Lives Matter, migrant rights groups.” Finishing his lunch as the rain beats down, Rehman recalls the Marshall plan to rebuild Europe after the second world war. “This is what the trade union movement did 100 years ago when it convinced people that something better is possible, that things can and do change,” he said. “That is the task facing us now … Building power is about collective action, about solidarity and it can be done.”"

          "bodyText": "Root and Stokes both have super powers, but they’d have to dig out another...200? In classic bowling conditions. Against bowlers with stoked furnaces in their bellies. With a tail that is elegant in its longitude. In conclusion, England are stuffed and the Ashes are lost. Prove me wrong, oh cricketing gods. Thanks for all the messages and tweets, time for black coffees all round. We’ll be back tomorrow at 11pm GMT, have a lovely day. Glenn McGrath is reflecting “That last hour, that’s as tough as any batting conditions you’re ever going to have. Any little mistake, there’s bounce, there’s pace, there’s seam, you can’t be too tough on the English batsmen. This pitch is not getting any easier to bat on, not only is there bounce and seam movement, there’s a lot more pace too. Stokes and Root are two fighters and they’re going to have to fight as hard as they ever have.” That was one of the most torrid, exhilarating, periods of fast bowling I’ve seen. Cummins was magnificent in his wicket-lessness. Starc and Boland marvellous, roared, screamed, on by a wired-up crowd. That England’s fragile batting didn’t survive, is no real surprise. With the ball, England had their best day, despite the early-morning Covid scare. Better lengths, better catching, better inspiration. But all, an hour later, for naught. “I don’t expect to wake up after three hours of sleep to hear “England just have to survive these last 10 minutes, and tomorrow.” types a resigned Chris Purcell. “And then lose another two wickets! Haven’t these boys been practising? Maybe we need to set up a training establishment, on a remote island, or maybe a remote continent? I’m not angry, not even slightly miffed, but deeply disappointed. When you lot get back, see me the next day at 7 am. Right, I’m going to open up another barrel of brandy cream.” 12th over: England 31-4 (Stokes 2, Root 12) In a tiny act of defiance, Root drives Cummins down the ground for 3 off the last ball of the day. What to say? 11th over: England 23-4 (Stokes 1, Root 9) Boland gets his chance in front of a fired-up crowd. We glimpse Hameed’s eyes, stretched wide as perppermint creams as he watches him run in. A good leave second ball, a nick third to a beauty moving off the seam. Who is handed the poisoned chalice? Jack Leach of course, but even he can’t stonewall in the face of this Australian pressure. He successfully leaves the first, we’ll draw a veil on the second. Ben Stokes crawls to the crease. Inelegant slaughter. Nightwatchman Leach dares to leave and is rewarded with the death rattle. Boland’s third ball, squared up, and Hameed paper darts an easy catch behind. 10th over: England 22-2 (Hameed 7, Root 9) A brief respite as Cummins slips outside the off stump and Root largely ignores it. Ten minutes left. 9th over: England 22-2 (Hameed 7, Root 9) Root is tempted again by Starc, his soft hands save him as the edge flies just short of slip. And some temporary light relief as Hameed leans into a drive which zips all the way to the long-off boundary. As punishment he gets a snorter next ball and a back of the length screamer the next. “When I saw Crawley escaping with a snick, I thought England’s luck might just have changed but I realise that was a vain hope.” taps Colum Fordham “Dawid Malan was desperately unfortunate to get such a good first ball which was only just clipping. Here in Naples, people keep a small red horn in their pockets/wallets/whatever to ward off evil (and Mitchell Starc). “But having managed to stay up till three in the morning (3.00 am Italian time, 2.00 am Uk time), I set the alarm at 7.00 to see if England could muster the fightback they seemed to be showing last night. And I was pleasantly surprised to find the bowlers have done so. Can Hameed now save his test career and eke out a stand with his captain and re-start our Ashes tour?” “Here’s hoping against hope and symbolically clutching on to the Neapolitan horn.” Survival tonight would be a victory. 8th over: England 17-2 (Hameed 3, Root 8) Hameed survives an over of vintage Cummins that begins with a huge lbw shout which Cummins correctly decides not to review. The man is a god. Seventeen minutes left. 7th over: England 17-2 (Hameed 3, Root 8) Root chases a half volley which wouldn’t make his greatest hits album but it slices between third slip and gully and England can’t complain about their luck here. Hass picks up a single off one that slides down leg stump. Half an hour or so left in the day. 6th over: England 12-2 (Hameed 2, Root 4) I don’t know how England are only two down after that Cummins over, but they are. Hameed starts by surviving a huge lbw appeal, Root closes it with a straight-drive for four off a rogue loose ball. Total respect. “Following on from Boycotts’s old maxim that one should add two wickets to a score to visualise how quickly the complexion of a game can alter, I always think of England beginning their innings 0-2,” sniffs Hugh Molloy. “Saves disappointment. “ 5th over: England 7-2 (Hameed 1, Root 0) The hat-trick ball is a beauty, unplayable perfection, and not even Root can touch it. Just the double-wicket maiden for Starc, who is patted by everyone like a very favourite dog. Root allows himself a wry grin. Writes Andy Roberts. “Andy from FNQ enjoying the cricket at home in plenty of heat and under grey and humid skies. Enjoying a bit of a contest for a change, but having seen them bat I still wouldn’t put it past England to finish being defeated by an innings at this point. Loving the prospect of 5-0! England, don’t ever change; your cricket can always be counted on for a good laugh.” Oh my, that is unlucky, the replay shows the ball clipping the top of leg stump, but it’s umpire’s call and off he goes. That’s two in two - and Starc is on a hat-trick. Joe Root must face it. In hope not expectation Angled across, geometric perfection, a slither of an edge, captured by Carey. Crawley marches off miserably in 6/8 time. 4th over: England 7-0 (Hameed 1, Crawley 5) More majesty from Cummins. Crawley closes the face, gets a nick and the ball flies, but just short of Warner and Carey behind the stumps, neither who go for the catch.. Crawley all at sea but riding his luck, accidentally hogging the strike with an inelegant squirt off the final ball. 3rd over: England 2-0 (Hameed 1, Crawley 0) Hameed gets another monster first ball, which flies up and somehow misses catching glove or handle. A maiden is tailed with a tempter outside off stump which Hameed is magnetically drawn to play. No! No! No “Looking forward to this last hour of the match, possibly the series,” writes Robert Speed. When you say “looking forward”, do you mean watching from behind the sofa? 2nd over: England 2-0 (Hameed 1, Crawley 0) Ooof ! Cummins’ first ball is a brute, rearing off a length, Hameed springs like a puppet on a string, with no clue where the ball is, and it flies behind slip for a leg bye. The third zips through Crawley, the remaining three tease and tempt. Sublime bowling. 1st over: England 1-0 (Hameed 1, Crawley 0) Hameed faces the first ball with the burden of two ducks in his last two innings. Starc’s first ball is wide and for a mili-second I think Hameed’s gone for it, but he’s just swerving his bat out of the way. In fact, Starc’s first four balls are all wide of off stump and Hameed nudges a single off his ribs. The sixth is also wide and Crawley watches it pass. Over one: survived. Starc stretches those lampost legs at the top of his mark. 88.5 overs: Australia 267 all out (Starc 24 not out) Mark Wood hugely deserved that wicket for his efforts today, crucial firepower support for the magnificent Anderson (23-10-33-4). The lead is a nasty 82 thanks to excellent wagging from the Australian tail, who now prepare to bowl at England’s poppadom openers. Sixteen overs left in the day as the heavy roller does its thing. Smashing catch by Crawley in front of his chops at second slip, and just reward for Wood who never slowed his smooth charge to the crease. Boland pushed waywardly. 87th over: Australia 261-9 (Starc 21, Boland 3) Sorry about that, up and working again now. Boland fences his first Test runs and that is DRINKS. Australia lead by 76 and the options for the last hour are either that England get this last wicket quickly and then have a tricky 40 minutes to navigate, or Australia keep ticking away and picking up irritating last-wicket runs. The lead is probably already too big on a tricky surface tbh... 86th over: Australia 257-9 (Starc 20, Boland 0) Robinson is back on and rattles through an over. I’ve somehow lost tv coverage by pressing the wrong button when it threatened me with turning off. Bear with me a second. 85th over: Australia 254-9 (Starc 18, Boland 0) A huge roar for the local boy Boland and a crucial breakthrough for England. Anderson on song today. “Morning Tanya.” I’ve been waiting Brian Withington. “As a son of Essex I must join in protest at Graham Gooch’s characterisation as boorish by an earlier correspondent. He led England from the front with a professional pride and determination that seemed conspicuous by the contrast with his predecessor. As for David Gower’s after dinner speaking, I can confirm from personal experience that he wasn’t the only one in the room ‘bored rigid’. Ditto for his truly tedious career in commentary.” Anderson to the rescue as Cummins top-edges to point where Hameed collects like a knitter at the guillotine. 84th over: Australia 249-8 (Starc 17, Cummins 21) Stokes finishes the over, and his four balls go for 8, including a shiny-new bib and tucker hook for four by Starc. 83.2 over: Australia 245-8 (Starc 9, Cummins 21) Robinson replaces Wood after two overs, and immediately creates a chance as Starc drives straight back but Robinson can only put up his hands to protect his face rather than hold on. He slips and falls onto his back and is wincing, starts his run-up, pulls out, and now walks off, clutching the back of his left hamstring....poor Joe Root looks as if another bucketload of old scrap has been loaded on his shoulders. 83rd over: Australia 245-8 (Starc 9, Cummins 21) Better from Anderson, Cummins can’t lay a bat on him. A maiden. “In reply to Mr P Reynolds,” writes the Rev Nicholas Gates, “let’s have faith and dare, to dream the impossible... An England fight back. One of our ducks, could become a hero.” 82nd over: Australia 245-8 (Starc 9, Cummins 21) Wood, who doesn’t like the feel of the new ball in his hand, takes it from the other end. His first delivery is full and driven straight back past his falling fingertips by Cummins. What flourish! And, oh, then Cummins lays into a pull and Anderson launches into the air and somehow reaches the ball with his right hand but can’t hold on at mid-on. He’s suitably furious. The lead stretches to 60. 81st over: Australia 240-8 (Starc 9, Cummins 16) Nothing doing from Anderson. Darryl Accone “On David Gower: he played with the casual grace of the gods, he captained with graciousness in defeat (obliteration by the West Indies) and he had wryness and wit that completely escaped his boorish successor, Essex Man Gooch. Viva David Gower Viva!” The Snow White and Rose Red of English cricket. I’m not sure about boorish to describe Gooch though. He did try and install some boring but essential discipline to that England dressing-room. The tracksuit transformation was probably overdue. 80th over: Australia 233-8 (Starc 5, Cummins 13) Wood gets the last over with the old cherry. Three from it and England’s hopes rest with the shiny red ball currently resting in the umpire’s right hand. “It’s the bloody hope thing starting up again,” writes Paul Reynolds, “help please.” Shall I speculate about how quickly the new ball might fly to the boundary? Or mention how adept these big Australian fast bowlers are with the bat? 79th over: Australia 233-8 (Starc 5, Cummins 13) Stokes bleeds five and this Australian lead is abuilding - 48 and counting. 78th over: Australia 228-8 (Starc 3, Cummins 10) WinViz have England’s chances of a win up from 17 per cent this time yesterday to 20 percent today. Do with that what you will. Wood purrs in again, but Cummins and Starc are up to the challenge. Was this at Adelaide? I think Gower referenced this yesterday. An absolute shocker! 77th over: Australia 226-8 (Starc 2, Cummins 9) Cummins muscles Leach over the long-off boundary for an effortless four. Another single, hit hard to the fielder patrolling the oundary. “Listen,” taps Eamonn Maloney, “I don’t think Pat Cummins is a number 8 at the best of times and surely not now he’s captain and most important bowler. Surely Starc when he’s playing.” Eamon, you provoked him! 76th over: Australia 220-8 (Starc 1, Cummins 4) Starc survives a good probing, the last ball flayed just in front of gully. Australia lead by 35. England need to keep this below 50 if possible. Will he be tempted? Yes he will! A fat wide one with chocolate sprinkles and Carey can’t resist, edging the ball safely into Buttler’s gloves. 75th over: Australia 215-7 (Carey 16, Cummins 3) Ooof, Cummins edges just past slip and I think I detect a sparkle behind the spectacled eye. 74th over: Australia 211-7 (Carey 15, Cummins 0) Carey squeezes four priceless runs from Robinson. I must admit having a soft spot for the old rogue. I spoke to him earlier this year and he was obviously bored rigid doing after-dinner speaking about old times. I think he’s still got something to offer. 73rd over: Australia 207-7 (Carey 11, Cummins 0) Nicely done and England look thrilled for their put-upon teammate. Just nine, ten, Jack to go. Umpire’s call! A confidence boosting scalp for Leach, with the ball bumping the front pad on the knee and would have gone on to clip the leg stump. On field decision is out. 72nd over: Australia 206-6 (Carey 10, Green 17) Root entrusts Robinson with the first over after tea, with nine overs to the second new ball. Gorgeous straight drive from Green, head over bat, front foot eating up half the pitch, for four. They pick up another couple “Jeff Tweedy of Wilco fame once said the scariest thing about screaming into the void is when the void answers back,” says Adam Levine. The lesser of two evils? In the studio, the ever-courteous Moeen Ali, resplendent in a salmon shirt, suggests that Leach should have bowled less down the leg side and more at the stumps and that he wasn’t threatening enough. But points out that he probably needs to get his confidence back. England are walking back out Root and Bairstow are in jumpers like the northern softees they are. A crucial session this, put the kettle on and settle in. 71st over: Australia 200-6 (Carey 9, Green 12) I hope Leach never listens to his character assassination by Chappell on TMS. Having said that, Carey picks up two with a reverse sweep, another two with a sweep, fairly easily. And that is tea! Advantage Australia, but not out of reach. Time for a coffee. 70th over: Australia 196-6 (Carey 5, Green 12) Wood rattles through, and with ten overs left to the new ball, Root turns again to Leach. 69th over: Australia 195-6 (Carey 4, Green 12) Stokes, collar up, skins to the wrist, is not looking as dangerous as Anderson did, and Australia are able to bleed three from the over. The lead now 10. I was beginning to wonder if I was typing into the void, but an email lands. Thank you Adam Levine! “Whilst it might difficult to pick the winner amongst the litany of mistakes and missed opportunities on this tour from batting first and dropping Broad in the first test, bowling too short and not picking Wood in Adelaide, the palm d’or of incompetence has to go to the England selectors for the continued non-selection of Ben Foakes. He is by far and away the best keeper of this generation and hardly a mug with the bat. I am baffled by the blind faith they continue to (mis) place in Buttler.” I think what Buttler has had in his favour is the potential to transform a game, with the selectors just forever tempted by his white ball wiles. I’m not sure many keepers will average much over 30 in Test cricket, so then you’re on glove work - where Buttler has obviously not had a great tour. I think he dropped another half chance this morning? 68th over: Australia 192-6 (Carey 1, Green 12) Wood switches ends after two overs, and Carey picks up his first run. Might have been tight if Hameed had hit with is swoop and release. Greg Chapple suggests that Australia are running with the mindset that England won’t hit the stumps. Another rears up off Green, but not close enough to point, then Green glances his last ball down to the boundary as Wood slips legside. 67th over: Australia 187-6 (Carey 0, Green 8) Stokes’ first ball is edged by Green past gully to the bowler’s disgust, and Australia squeeze into the lead. The sun shines onto Stokes shirt, shadows darting across his chest as he vigors in. Green resists the temptations of a short ball and that’s a good first over back. 66th over: Australia 184-6 (Carey 0, Green 6) Another Anderson maiden. Carey has now played 15 balls without scoring. Anderson 19-9-24-3. Can England make this pressure count? 25 minutes till tea. It looks as if Ben Stokes is going to get a bowl. 65th over: Australia 184-6 (Carey 0, Green 6) Fierce from Wood, who gets some exceptional bounce, one steeples into Green’s glove and flies uncontrollably short of point. Australia sniffing towards parity now, but England threatening. 64th over: Australia 181-6 (Carey 0, Green 3) Green crouches over his bat and plays Anderson back. Carefully does it. He’s a big ball striker when he’s in the mood, but reins himself in. An old dog v a coiled spring Is anyone out there at the MCG? What’s the atmosphere like? 63rd over: Australia 181-6 (Carey 0, Green 3) Now we get the change as Wood replaces Leach and immediately the danger level is raised. Green is a sniff away from edging behind until he scampers away up the other end leaving Carey to see out the over. 62nd over: Australia 180-6 (Carey 0, Green 2) The old dog showing all his tricks. Carey sees out the over with some difficulty, pinged on the gloves. Anderson bowling nice and full, just like Joe likes it. Nicely played by Harris, securing his place for the next Test. Another catch for Root! Beautifully done by Jimmy, one that straightens as Harris prods, and the ball angles off the bat dropping at shin height to Root. 61st over: Australia 180-5 (Harris 76, Green 2) Leach stays on for his eleventh over: Green is impotent but Harris square drives with aplomb. 60th over: Australia 177-5 (Harris 73, Green 2) Anderson is whipped into action and he’s full and Green can’t get any purchase. Some stattage - 83 per cent of Anderson’s balls this year have been dots in Test cricket. I don’t have any comparisons to that but it seems pretty mindblowing, the old miser. 59th over: Australia 176-5 (Harris 72, Green 2) Harris picks up Leach for three, and Green sees out the over. Yes, I’d be tempted to bring back one of the fast men. I guess Root is trying to bowl him into rhythm with a long spell - obviously the middle of a crucial Test not the ideal place to do this... 58th over: Australia 173-5 (Harris 69, Green 2) Robinson - I’m trying to think of a more flattering verb than trundles - through another over. A maiden and that is DRINKS. 57th over: Australia 173-5 (Harris 69, Green 2) Just a single off Leach, as Green stretches his giant limbs forward and slips into a drive. Here’s the latest on England’s covid cases, which could yet threaten the tour. I’ve just sent the two positive teens in this house upstairs but am enjoying breathing their covid-air in the living room. 56th over: Australia 171-5 (Harris 69, Green 0) Tasty bowling by Robinson dangling the bait, which Head couldn’t resist. A vital breakthrough for England on what has been a barren afternoon after a sprightly morning. If they could just rattle through the next few, all is not lost. Australia currently just 14 runs in arrears. Head prods inelegantly and the edge flies safely into the hands of Root at navel height at slip. 55th over: Australia 170-4 (Harris 69, Head 27) Leach wheels through a quick over of fairly flattish fare. 54th over: Australia 169-4 (Harris 69, Head 26) Good morning and thanks Jonathan, just an easy workaday session for you there.... Now where are we? We get a close up of Buttler looking stony faced behind the stumps before Harris cuts Robinson down to third man for four with quite the zing. Australia’s out-of-form batsman now striding towards his century. And with that, I’ll hand you over to Tanya Aldred. Catch you here tomorrow. 53rd over: Australia 165-4 (Harris 65, Head 26) Since moving over the wicket Leach has looked a very different operator. Head doesn’t know whether to stick or twist in this latest over that goes for a couple of singles. 52nd over: Australia 163-4 (Harris 64, Head 25) Decent line and length from Robinson at 130kph and his accuracy draws an edge from Harris, but it’s played with soft hands and dies short of Bairstow at a very short third slip. England battled hard in the morning session to wrest some control after yesterday’s horror show, but this now 53-run partnership has taken the wind out of their sails. Australia are happy to grind their way into a lead. England need an injection of magic form somewhere. 51st over: Australia 163-4 (Harris 64, Head 25) Leach, starting an over from over the wicket for the first time today, draws a false shot from Head, sweeping off the top edge that lands not far from Robinson at square leg. Then he beats Harris with a fast dart down the leg-side that turns and bounces - STUMPING CHANCE! - but Buttler can’t hang onto the opportunity. That’s the second half-chance the England gloveman has missed today. 50th over: Australia 157-4 (Harris 63, Head 22) Ollie Robinson gets another chance, replacing Mark Wood, and he soon teases Harris into fishing outside his off stump with the angle across the left-hander. Once again, the opener recognises his error of judgement and returns to his compact ways. This has been an excellent demonstration of temperament from Harris. 49th over: Australia 157-4 (Harris 63, Head 22) The Leach nonsense continues with easy singles on offer whenever Harris or Head want them. Belatedly, Leach comes over the wicket, but what preceded will remain one of those most baffling passages of play I can recall. 100%. But presumably this isn’t all (or at all!) on Root. This was surely a plan devised over a 40-minute break with coaches and analysts. It’s barmy. 48th over: Australia 155-4 (Harris 62, Head 21) Harris has been patient and compact all day but he’s lucky not to nick a swoosh at Wood well outside off stump. He reverts to type immediately afterwards, as has been his great strength this innings, and pushes a simple couple through point. 47th over: Australia 152-4 (Harris 60, Head 20) More of this Leach around the wicket weirdness, and it almost buys a dismissal with Head dawdling a single, but Stokes misses the direct hit after some smart fielding. Whatever happened to run outs? Are they still a thing? I remember when Ricky Ponting and Jonty Rhodes were at their pomp in the 90s and every team had a baseball coach and specialist fielding drills and it seemed as though an era of dead-eye fielders was upon us. Nope. 46th over: Australia 149-4 (Harris 59, Head 18) Wood runs in hard, hits the deck hard, and hits the bat hard, but he’s too short and Head is happy to see off an over of dots from the crease. After a cool morning, the sun’s out over the MCG and it’s lovely and warm. “All this talk about turning the ashes into an intercontinental competition because England are so poor. It’s worth remembering that Australia haven’t won a series in England for over 20 years.” Euan Roberts with some perspective. 45th over: Australia 149-4 (Harris 59, Head 18) Another nothing over from Leach, but only two singles milked from it. All that diligence of the morning session feels like it’s leaking away for the tourists. 44th over: Australia 147-4 (Harris 58, Head 17) Wood is a more rational choice at the opposite end to Leach but he begins by bowling too full to Harris who punches a compact drive down the ground to bring up a dogged half-century, repaying the faith of the selectors after a lean series to date. Harris follows that up with a guided glance through the gully for four more. That was a shot from a batter in control of his game - solid platform, modest ambition, at ease with the pace of the ball. Australia have come out flying after lunch. 43rd over: Australia 137-4 (Harris 48, Head 16) The mind boggles. Leach bowls the first over after lunch, and it’s that same defensive line from around the wicket to the left-handers, with that weird-in-out field. Any mild frustration from England supporters must surely become untempered rage after three deliveries when a rank long hop is pounded behind square-leg by Head for four. Talk about allowing a batter to settle in after an interval. Cheap singles follow and logic sails out of the visiting dressing room window. And a quick shoutout to any Melburnians (local, or visiting) who might be keen to check out how Geoff’s beard’s going... How fast was Mark Wood this morning? The fastest. That was a welcome breather. Back to the cricket. England bowled excellently this morning session. Great control, fuller lengths, and they deserved more than the three wickets which came their way. Anderson in particular was superb. Marcus Harris has been dogged for Australia, riding plenty of edges and plays and misses for his 48. At the other end he hasn’t found a lasting partner. That all said, the major action probably took place off the pitch with four of England’s touring party failing RAT Covid tests and the remainder of the tour on a knife-edge while the full PCR test results come back. 42nd over: Australia 131-4 (Harris 48, Head 11) Robinson’s lethargic over is the only one of his spell with Mark Wood swapping ends to hurry up Marcus Harris with lunch in sight. Wood does beat the edge, twice in the over, but as he has all day, Harris gets his head down, brushes off any concern and presents the full face of his bat to a fuller delivery to earn a couple of runs, then leans into a glance that brings him closet to a half-century. 41st over: Australia 127-4 (Harris 44, Head 11) Now it is time for some spin, and the first overs from Jack Leach since his Gabba nightmare. Lisa Sthalekar is immediately furious at the defensive in-out field, as well as Leach bowling his left-arm orthodox from around the wicket to a pair of left-handed batters. There’s turn and bounce, but it all seems very confused from England with both batters able to milk runs unchallenged into the on-side. Not hugely promising from Root and the brains trust. 40th over: Australia 123-4 (Harris 43, Head 8) Anderson’s superb morning comes to a close. On comes Robinson, and out goes the ball - all the way to the cover fence. Not for the first time in his Test career the seamer struggles to his mark early and Head pounds a merciless square cut to a soft long hop. He works three more through the covers later in the over. Robinson simply cannot afford to miss his line and length at 125kph with a ball that isn’t moving in the air. There’s a run-out scare late in the over, but England never hit the stumps with a shy, do they? 39th over: Australia 116-4 (Harris 43, Head 1) Consecutive maidens for England but Wood was again too short to the watchful Harris. 38th over: Australia 116-4 (Harris 43, Head 1) Anderson is into the sixth over of his superb spell, and he continues to keep Head tied down, targeting the stumps from around the wicket, searching for that hint of tail away from the bat. Another maiden, Anderson’s seventh from 15 overs all up. It might be time to take a look at some spin soon. 37th over: Australia 116-4 (Harris 43, Head 1) Back comes Wood for a burst before lunch. He was lively in his wicket-taking two-over spell earlier, but he can’t find the right length here, allowing Harris and Head to hang back and defend from the crease. Until the final delivery of the over that is, when Harris is fortunate to see a thick edge bounce before the cordon and scuttle away for four. “England’s bowlers finally seem to be listening to their captain (not to mention pundits and cricket fans) and pitch the ball up,” emails Colum Fordham. “As soon as Robinson increased his length, he enticed Lyon into the forward defensive prod and got the wicket. Likewise, Wood has settled upon a fuller length and is really testing the Aussie batsmen, getting the crucial breakthrough of Labuschagne. It’s up to Root to set more attacking fields, encourage his bowlers to land the ball in good areas to put Australia under pressure for the first time this series. I like the way Anderson is bowling around he wicket to Harris. We might just get something from this morning’s session.” #Astute 36th over: Australia 110-4 (Harris 38, Head 0) Anderson is bowling beautifully. Head is welcomed to the crease with a delivery angled into him from around the wicket that seams away past the outside edge off the pitch. Terrific wicket-maiden from the veteran. Smith never looked settled during his 31 ball stay at the crease, failing to get bat on ball as much as he would normally expect. Harris now has an important job to convert his dogged start. There’s that in-ducker again from Anderson to Smith, this time the edge is thicker and there’s no need to bring the keeper into the equation because the ball ricochets down onto the stumps and the bails go flying. A richly deserved wicket for England. 35th over: Australia 110-3 (Harris 38, Smith 16) Some rare runs off the bat, three of them, to Smith, who stands tall outside off-stump and drives confidently. Harris then milks three of his own when Stokes strays onto his pads. Tom van der Gucht has dropped me a line. I agree with the analysis, not convinced about the practicality of the remedy. This is the market at work, right, comrades? “I’ve read a great variety of reasons as to the decline in our cricketing fortunes, but I’ve been brewing a longstanding concern regarding the impact of a talent drain upon England’s sporting fortunes through football clubs hoovering up all the top athletes at an early age. Football academies snap up the most talented pupils whilst at primary school - encouraging them to sign their sporting future away and spend the next decade missing out on a rich and varied diet of different opportunities they never get the chance to excel at. Then, at 18, 99% of them fail to make it and get released... Imagine all the sporting talent slipping through the net... they may not be footballers, but they were recognised for their athletic potential that could have flourished if they’d been able to apply it elsewhere. I think all Football academies should be forced to run other competitions in the off season: A T10 cricket league between premiership clubs; an annual athletics competition; mini Wimbledon; indoor rowing 2KM races (we need to up our game there too); and possibly handball as we may have an outside shot at an Olympic medal there.” 34th over: Australia 105-3 (Harris 36, Smith 13) Now Harris plays and misses to Anderson, but the length is a fraction short to demand an edge. And again! Fuller this time, angling into the left hander then seaming enough to hold its line. England continue to probe, as they have all morning, but the Gods have not been on their side. To his credit, Harris has shrugged off any moral defeats and played every ball on its merits. 33rd over: Australia 105-3 (Harris 36, Smith 13) Stokes beats Smith’s outside edge again in another tight over for England. They have dried up the runs, but Australia’s batters are keeping their heads; for now. 32nd over: Australia 104-3 (Harris 36, Smith 13) Smith rotates the strike early against Anderson, who then denies Harris anything to work with. England have bowled diligently this morning but they need to find some magic to convert that pressure into wickets. Only Wood has really seemed capable of delivery something out of nothing. “Could Covid scupper the entire series if there were more outbreaks?” asks Andrew Benton. Possibly, yes. “Maybe need the whole thing to be played again?” I hope not. “Or at least not listed as a series defeat for England?” Lol. “Do we know what the possible scenarios and actions are?” The immediate response will be based on the volume of cases and the need for isolating. We then have the issues of internal movement between states in Australia with the final Tests in NSW and Tasmania. Lots of logistics to work through, if required. 31st over: Australia 103-3 (Harris 36, Smith 13) Good over from Stokes, angling the ball into Harris from around the wicket, but the Australian survives and continues to look assured at the crease for the first time this series, offering an aggressive pull soon after his near-dismissal. “It’s true that the ECB seems to be favouring short-form cricket against the proper game, but that’s because they are chasing the money,” argues John Starbuck. “That they don’t account for the effects of doing this on the players only reveals the shortcomings of accountancy. Players don’t have sufficient experience of the longer game, which isn’t just about pacing their innings or bowling spells, it’s also about how you bat or bowl with differently-set fields. How many short-form games have a full slip cordon, for instance? Players naturally play to the strengths of the short-forms because they can win matches; in the short term, this works, but the ECB and corresponding bodies elsewhere don’t take a longer view. Much the same can be said of politicians these days, who aim to set the tone for their societies.” I would like to be smart enough to write a book with a title along the lines of: “The death of custodianship: What happened to the public good?”. See Premier League football clubs as further examples. ... yes, yes there was an inside-edge, a very skinny one that relied on snicko to confirm. Hot spot missed it. Ben Stokes pins the Australian opener on the pads from around the wicket. Paul Reiffel’s finger goes up. Was there an inside edge? Keeps the scoreboard ticking over, irritates bowlers, fielders, and captains, gets him to the non-striker’s end. Superb. 30th over: Australia 103-3 (Harris 36, Smith 13) Anderson sends down a tight over to Smith, who respectfully sees off a maiden. Only one delivery catches the eye, an inswinger that moved appreciably in the air, the ball carrying over the stumps with the batter already way outside off-stump. Drinks. 29th over: Australia 103-3 (Harris 36, Smith 13) Just a two-over burst from Mark Wood, which doesn’t bode well. The speedster is replaced by Ben Stokes for his first trundle of the day - and he immediately finds a thick edge from Smith’s bat, but it flies through the vacant third slip region and away for four. Smith, still yet to settle, then mistimes a slap of a pull that clears the infield but plugs a long way from the midwicket boundary. England are not enjoying the rub of the green. “Don’t forget the America’s Cup,” emails Jen Oram, in response to the suggestion the Ashes may have outlived their usefulness. “It went from 1881 to 1962 until the Aussies were allowed to challenge. (There were a couple of Canadian challenges before that.) If we’ve got another 70 years or so to wait before someone else can compete for the Ashes. I might give up and start following bog-snorkelling.” 28th over: Australia 94-3 (Harris 34, Smith 6) DROP! ISH! Anderson’s length draws Smith forward, then he finally gets some movement off the pitch, leading to an inside-edge that clips the pad and carries through low to Buttler’s left. The keeper dived full length but could only get his fingertips to the opportunity. That was tough, with Buttler only seeing the chance at the last minute. Still, add it to the tally. As is often the case, Angry Anderson brings out the best in the Lancastrian and he peppers Harris’ outside edge for the remainder of the over. 27th over: Australia 93-3 (Harris 34, Smith 5) Wood leaks onto Smith’s pads and goes for three at the start of an over lacking the same precision of the England paceman’s previous efforts. “Yes, we can all have a good laugh about England and ask whether a Big Bash XI could do any worse,” opens Andrew Cosgrove. “But over the past few years, a lot of England’s selection policy appears to have been predicated on the question ‘could they do any worse?’, and the answer has usually been ‘yes. Yes they can’. Look at Jason Roy. Vince and Hales’s test careers don’t really inspire much confidence. Mills can only bowl about four overs a day. Abell and Mahmood I’ve thought for a while are likely to have promising careers for England at some stage, but they scored no runs and took no wickets for the Lions against Australia A. So, on balance, I think no, we wouldn’t be better off with a team from the Big Bash.” 26th over: Australia 88-3 (Harris 33, Smith 1) Robinson strays onto Harris’ pads, allowing the Australian opener an easy three. Smith has yet to settle at the crease, but he avoids a duck with a nurdle into the on-side. 25th over: Australia 84-3 (Harris 30, Smith 0) That extra pace makes so much difference in these conditions, hurrying up the Australian batters before their eyes are in. Smith is skittish at the crease with Wood bowling a tight fourth stump line, the speed gun registering 151kph. England have an opening they must take advantage of before lunch if they are to breathe life into this series. Mark Wood, the pick of England’s bowlers yesterday, is a welcome introduction to the attack. Harris leans into a nice drive for three, but then Labuschagne goes! A rare cheap dismissal for the Australian run-machine, who is late to a fizzing Wood delivery on a length and can only send a regulation edge to Joe Root’s bread basket. England might just be onto something here. 24th over: Australia 81-2 (Harris 27, Labuschagne 1) Robinson is bowling stump-to-stump to Labuschagne and the Australian is unable to work any runs away on the leg-side. He’s also caught in the ribs with a delivery that rises off a length. Not a whole heap going on out in the middle, especially compared to what must be happening behind the scenes. “I have been on a cricket break for a bit but was just coming back to it for this series; doing the usual, reading articles listening in for the first few hours, texting pals about batting collapses. But tonight it’s a toss up between a podcast or TMS, I’ve not even chatted to pals about it,” emails Lennie Lenford. “Every year since 2005 it seems to matter a little less. And maybe there’s more important things right now. I hope I’ll tune in again and hope there’s still something to tune into.” 2005 remember, the year cricket left terrestrial TV in the UK. 23rd over: Australia 80-2 (Harris 27, Labuschagne 1) Anderson is on the money bowling around the wicket to Harris, pushing the ball up and forcing the opener to defend a maiden from the crease. There is no lateral movement to speak of so Anderson is somewhat de-fanged. I think England have tried this approach already (see Sibley, Pope, Crawley, Archer etc) but for one reason or another it just hasn’t worked, nor have many of the up-and-comers demonstrated they have the techniques or wherewithal to be persevered with in the expectation they will come good. 22nd over: Australia 80-2 (Harris 27, Labuschagne 1) Marnus is off the mark with a squirty inside-edge behind square on the on-side. Marcus also adds a run to a similar location, albeit mirrored, with him being a leftie and all. “Will the Ashes go the same way as the Wightman Cup - an inter-continental competition that was scrapped because the British team kept being whitewashed?” asks Dominic O’Reilly. Or perhaps it morphs into a Ryder Cup style event with England becoming Team Europe? The European Cricket Championship is making inroads... 21st over: Australia 78-2 (Harris 26, Labuschagne 0) Harris has his top score of the series so far after being backed in by the Australian selectors, and he whips a couple off his pads to move to 26. On his home deck he looks compact and assured. They sure are, and there is of course a grey area between RAT and PCR tests that invites an element of risk to proceedings. 20th over: Australia 76-2 (Harris 24, Labuschagne 0) Robinson’s reward for removing the nightwatchman is the sight of the No 1 batter on the ICC’s rankings. Marnus Labuschagne is happy to let a couple of sighters through and allow the bowler a wicket-maiden. “If a Covid case takes out the entire England team, or this current shower of a side is sent home,” emails Brendan Jones, “maybe a scratch side made up of England players currently here for the Big Bash could be pressed into duty. Could they do any worse? Vince, Billings, Hales, Brook, Duckett, Abell, Evans, Thompson, Mills, Mahmood, Jordan.” Even if it was worse, it would be more entertaining, surely? When the fun stops, stop. Nathan Lyon had a couple of swipes but Robinson’s line and length eventually does for him. Textbook seam bowling, textbook lower order outside edge off-balance through to the keeper. 19th over: Australia 76-1 (Harris 24, Lyon 10) Another four through the cordon. This time Harris uses soft hands to ruffle Jimmy’s feathers. Early doors, but this looks like a run-scoring day. 18th over: Australia 71-1 (Harris 20, Lyon 10) Lyon has come for a good time, not a long time. Ollie Robinson, who has a tendency to bowl a rank long hop loosener at the start of a spell, is slapped for four with disdain through midwicket, to the delight of the crowd. Robinson adjusts and catches the edge of Lyon’s bat, but it flies just to the left of the diving Bairstow in the gully. Maybe a half-chance of a catch? The ball then beats the outside edge before Lyon farms the strike with a single. 17th over: Australia 62-1 (Harris 20, Lyon 1) Nathan Lyon is keen to get bat on ball early and the third of a series of mistimed strokes eventually earns him a run. Marcus Harris is more watchful. Nothing to report in the air or off the seam for Anderson. You’re not the first to raise this point. Barney Ronay in particular has been very forceful on the topic. James Anderson has the ball, nightwatchman Nathan Lyon is on strike, Michael Atherton is on comms. The sun is shining. Cricket it is, after all. Despite all of that, play is about to get underway at a cool and breezy MCG. Cricket Australia have released a statement. Confirmed four cases (so far) in the England tour party following the Rapid Antigen Tests this morning. PCR tests to come. “Hi Jonathan,” hello John Davenport. “You wonder: ‘how such a well-funded cricket board can deliver an outcome like this with such consistency.’ This sadly matches the question that exasperated British club tennis players have been asking of the LTA for the last 50 years. The one word reply to both is probably: super-amateurish.” I fear the opposite end of the scale may be the case here. Super-managerial perhaps? Robert Wilson has logged on, and he has Viv on his mind. “Continuing yesterday’s theme of moral correction, I was very sad about the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu given that he once publicly ticked me off good and proper for laughing at an Ulster Unionist politician who had the temerity to read out a quote from Nelson Mandela’s memoirs. I’m not sure how familiar the Archbish was with Ulster Unionism’s usual policies on inclusion and universalism (it was quite a mild telling off in the end). It felt agreeably buzzy and ticklish, a fizzy kind of fruity disapproval. He was a mensch. I can’t help hoping Root doesn’t beat Viv Richard’s deathless year of Homeric grandeur. Because reasons (my loving faithful heart might break). But also because nothing should come close. I’ve been trying to write a tight five pages about it for the last couple of years but I keep getting bogged down in asinine hero-worship, slack-jawed awe and frankly disturbing surges of molten passion. Look at the dates on that list of boss-bat years. All post 2000 apart from Viv. He’s the heroic outlier, the sine qua non, the ‘grovel’-crusher, the national (and international) unifier, the greatest walker to the wicket, the caressing butcher, the gumchewing panther, the erotic...” This has been an odd morning. It could easily become a landmark day. As with the Yorkshire racism scandal, the lack of openness and accountability at the top doesn’t help either. “Less than a year ago England were competing with India for a place in the final of the world test championship,” emails Ben Skelton. “Is the English system really dong as badly as Geoff Lemon is currently claiming on Test Match Special? Or have they just had a dismal year in extraordinary circumstances?” I would concur with Geoff, and other esteemed observers of the English system, notably George Dobell, who have been warning of this outcome for a long time. Sure, these are extraordinary circumstances that are possibly magnifying the problems, but this is not a case of a few batters with odd techniques, it is a systemic issue that has been a long time coming. This Tweet from Guardian alum Will Macpherson could prove more significant as the series wears on. Lateral flow tests are not the gold standard here in Victoria, but then PCR testing is overloaded with some results delayed by days. We are in a grey area with regards clearance. Kim Thonger is the first cab off the rank. “I think if Australia want to finish this game off quickly they could declare after the first ball today, roll England over again for, say, 120ish, and knock off the 250 or so needed to win, quite comfortably in 40 to 50 overs, and still have three days of rest on the beach. I had planned to retire in time to enjoy a visit to Australia for the NEXT England Ashes tour, but I’m beginning to think this may be the last.” If Pat Cummins did such a thing I think he would receive a stern email from the Cricket Australia CEO and a large bill from the host broadcaster. It would be very funny though. Ok, it feels as though the morning rush of news has subsided for now. Time to look ahead, and get stuck into some of your correspondence. The Guardian data gurus have been sifting through the noise of England’s calamities looking for signals. And they’ve come up with some pretty graphs, and a splendid headline. England’s latest batting collapse in Australia follows on from a series of below average scores from the men’s Test team in the past year. Statistics show the top order fairs poorly compared with other countries, and well adrift of their six main rivals. Here’s Ali Martin’s latest report from the MCG after England delayed their journey to the ground following a positive Covid test. Jonathan Liew riffs on the predictability of England’s latest collapse and how a system that has produced such a taut white-ball group can have delivered such a haunted Test outfit. There was a time when England collapses had a kind of fascinating car-crash quality. These days, by contrast, they feel strangely banal: tedious, overfamiliar, predictable, like a recurring anxiety dream. The openers disappear early. Joe Root does something pointless and defiant. All of a sudden you’re back at your old school. Someone in the middle order plays a stupid shot. You turn over the exam paper, but there’s nothing on it. Jonny Bairstow will be in action soon, and the England No 6 had the unenviable job of fronting the media after yesterday’s shambles. It’s one of those days that … we will look back on and probably reassess next time and potentially take different options. Vision coming through now of the England side striding out onto the MCG for their warm-ups. Ben Stokes is wielding a protein shake. England are on their way. Start time delayed by 30 minutes. You can also listen to Geoff (and Adam Collins and Emma John) dissect play on The Final Word Podcast if you like. Ok, on with the show, and back to yesterday, where Pat Cummins demonstrated once again that he is bloody impressive. Geoff Lemon tells the tale. You could easily arrive at the conclusion that Patrick Cummins had been blessed by some benevolent god. The best-on-ground performance in the teenage Test debut, the personal qualities that made people speak of him as a future captain, the rise to that position despite a century and more of entrenched Australian opposition to bowlers taking the job. That interpretation, though, would be overlooking the long, long wait after that teenage beginning, when Cummins had played one Test but spent six years being denied the next, the cycle of injuries whirring as endlessly as the exercise bikes on which he did another stint of rehabilitation. Your early 20s are supposed to be a time of impulsiveness and expression, not of quiet dedication to a long-term goal. There may still be a delay to the scheduled 10.30am start, but we’re on course for action. While we wait for more news to filter through about if and when England take the field, let’s recap yesterday’s action, starting with Ali Martin’s report from the close of play. Shortly after tea on the opening day at the MCG – not even halfway through the series as a whole – the Barmy Army trumpeter could already be heard pootling the theme from the Great Escape. A rejigged England side featuring four changes were eight down during what became an eventual 185 all out in 65.1 overs. And that was a total swelled by Ollie Robinson, the No 9, throwing the bat to the tune of 22 runs. So, Channel 7 has just come on air in Australia and the frontline broadcasters (Ponting, Botham etc) are off having PCR tests. They have been replaced by the crew normally on BBL duty - Alister Nicholson, Brad Hodge, and Lisa Sthalekar. Further, the ECB has just released the following statement about a touring family member also testing positive. Once again the precarious nature of this series reveals itself. Some early reports coming through on Channel 7, the host broadcaster, that the MCG press box has a confirmed case of Covid-19. I’ll bring you more as it comes, but it wouldn’t surprise me if there was some disruption to how this match is broadcast. Hello everybody and welcome to live over-by-over coverage of day two of the Boxing Day Ashes Test. We’re underway at the Melbourne Cricket Ground at 10.30am local time (11.30pm UK). History doesn’t repeat, but it often rhymes, or so the saying goes. If that’s the case, then England’s Ashes series is turning into something from the Dr Seuss canon. On day one at the MCG all the familiar failings materialised. Both openers fell cheaply, set batters got out to poor shots, no pressure was applied to Australia’s attack, and (although this is minor in comparison) England’s one true hope, Joe Root, could not convert a half-century into a Test-defining score. There was plenty of noise after Adelaide that England had talked frankly about their performances. This set the tone for the topic of conversation throughout a miserable day’s play: that of England not backing up their words with deeds. I think we’ve all been willingly, or unwittingly, overthinking things. Put simply, England are not very good. They are especially not very good in Australian conditions. They are very extremely especially not very good in Australian conditions against a well-drilled bowling attack, led by the magnificent Pat Cummins. What happened yesterday was normal. Sometimes it’s that straightforward. From England’s perspective, the remainder of this series has to focus on how such a well-funded cricket board can deliver an outcome like this with such consistency. Something very significant is wrong that cannot be addressed by interrogating a heated dressing room debate or the angle of an opener’s blade. This Test is not over, yet, but England’s first-innings dismissal just 65.1 overs after the toss means it is moving on apace. The next two days promise the best batting conditions at the MCG. Further ignominy for the tourists awaits. I’ll be back with more shortly, but if you would like to join in, you can reach me by email or Twitter (@JPHowcroft)."

          "bodyText": "I walked the county boundary of Gloucestershire: Claire Jenkins I used to live in London, but went home to Gloucestershire at the start of the pandemic. I’m an active person, easily bored, and I thought: “What am I going to do?” I decided to get to know my county by walking its boundary. I have a geography degree but I don’t know how to plan a route, so I turned to the YesTribe, a community that comes up with ideas and solutions. Someone plotted the 300-mile route for me, and I thought: “Oh no – I’ve got to do it now!” I hiked from my family home on the edge of the Forest of Dean and, when restrictions allowed, from friends’ houses. I spent a couple of nights camping, but mainly I did day hikes – 15 days of walking in total, over about six months. I walked 25-30 miles a day in summer, less in the colder months. I walked through sunshine, snow, wind and floods. One day I found myself wading through thigh-high muddy water; other times I didn’t know where I was and my phone had run out of battery. But getting over these mini-barriers was uplifting, inspiring and empowering. I saw parts of Gloucestershire I’d never seen before – I absolutely loved walking by the Severn, and exploring the north-east of the county. I walked alone, but I had conversations with other walkers, cyclists and paddleboarders. I’d thought about doing a solo walking challenge for a while, but actually doing it opens up so many possibilities. You think: “What else could I do?” Having lived in a city for so long, this brought back my love of the outdoors. I’ve swapped my stilettos for hiking boots and my laptop bag for a rucksack! Now when I catch up with friends, we go for a walk instead of a coffee. I’ve since completed other walking challenges, such as visiting all the trig points in Gloucestershire. I did a lot of that with my dad and my aunt – I wanted an activity we could share. It was fun to see my 70-year-old aunt climbing over fences and barbed wire! We’d have tea and cake and look at the stunning views. The pandemic has made me reframe my mindset. I’ve travelled a lot in Europe, Africa and Asia, but now I’ve found such interest close to home. You don’t have to go overseas to have amazing adventures – there is cool stuff on our doorsteps. Claire Jenkins is the co-founder of tablecrowdtalent.com I circumnavigated England on my free bus pass: Penny Ibbott It was New Year’s Eve 2019. I was slightly sozzled when my daughter asked if anyone had anything exciting planned for 2020. I said: “I wonder how far I can get on my free bus pass?” Just over two months later, I set off from my home in Chidham, West Sussex. I had planned to travel around the whole of England by bus, but was I got about 10 days in, when the first lockdown was announced. I was gutted. In September 2021, I started again. It took me almost six weeks to travel the entire 2,200 miles on about 120 buses, staying as close to the coast as possible. My son Robin was my mission control – he sent me my journey leg by leg. But the timetables didn’t always tally: I missed a lot of buses, and had to take detours if I couldn’t find anywhere to stay. The biggest challenge was getting the right bus at the right time – and finding public toilets! My favourite journey was from Minehead, Somerset, to Lynmouth, Devon, on an open-top bus. You go up and up Porlock Hill, coming out on Exmoor. It was a beautiful afternoon: the sea was sparkling on my right and sheep and ponies were grazing on my left. Other highlights were riding the Coasthopper along the Norfolk coast, exploring the north-east coast right up to Berwick-upon-Tweed, and travelling along the Scottish border. The best moment came right at the end. A Stagecoach manager boarded the bus I was on and asked me to get off. He had arranged a vintage open-top bus to take me the last few miles, and all my family and friends were on it. I have been widowed for five years. There were times on my journey when I did heartily wish for a companion, but I talked to lots of people on the buses. I haven’t always been an adventurous person, but I’ve become more so after my husband, Geoff, died. An enterprising spirit has grown in me. I have to battle a guilty conscience, because although I grieve him and miss him, I can now do things I couldn’t do before, such as visit my sister in Canada. Age is no barrier if you’re feeling well. If you’re capable of taking a journey, do it! It keeps the sparkle in your life. It’s about the people you meet as much as the places you go, and I met some extraordinary characters. I didn’t set out to be a hero or be inspiring; I did it for the adventure. This trip has given me a new zest for life. I hope to crisscross England next, visiting every county – by bus, of course. Penny Ibbott is fundraising for St Wilfrid’s hospice in Chichester, justgiving.com I went wild camping with a baby: Bex Band My passion for adventure started quite late – my family weren’t really into the outdoors. But in 2017 I quit my job, packed up my London flat and went to walk the 1,000km Israel National Trail, inspired by a list of long-distance hiking trails published in National Geographic. It changed my life! When I came home I didn’t go back to teaching but set up Love Her Wild, an online community for women wanting outdoor adventure. It started as a Facebook page but now we have 30,000 members. I went on so many adventures – and led my own trips. When I had a baby in 2020 I knew, of course, that things would change. I would be less free, but I didn’t want the adventures to end. So in June 2021, when Rivi was 11 months, my husband, Gil, and I decided to go on a four-day wild camping trip on Dartmoor (the only place in England and Wales where wild camping is allowed, as long as campers leave no trace). We picked somewhere quite close to where we lived in case things went badly wrong, but the biggest issue was how to transport the baby and everything she needed – nappies, food, equipment – as well as tent, cooking gear and lots and lots of water. We bought a three-wheel buggy designed to go off-road and chose a circular route from Princetown designed for mountain bikes. “If a bike can do it so can a buggy” was our thinking. As we set off I was so excited I got goosebumps. It was everything I look for in an adventure: out in nature, doing something new, a challenge. We piled everything we could on to the buggy, perched the baby on top, and carried the rest in rucksacks. The going may have been slower than planned – it was difficult and bumpy in parts and we stopped more than we normally would for snacks, suncream application and breaks, but it was amazing! Rivi loved the tent and slept so well on a roll mat. She saw wild horses and enjoyed all the time outside. We got up early and had naps together in the afternoon. With no distractions from phones and work, we were it forced to really slow down and enjoy being just us in the great outdoors. It’s tempting as parents not to try new things – you’re so tired all the time – and it did take some planning, but it showed me adventures with babies are 100% doable and so rewarding. You just need to be adaptable and not have too many expectations! Bex Band is the author of Three Stripes South, Bradt Guides, £9.99 (£9.29 at Guardian Bookshop) I kayaked a tidal race: Kevin Rushby Jack Sound is a narrow strait between Pembrokeshire’s Marloes peninsula and the bird sanctuary island of Skomer. It’s home to one of the fastest tidal races in the world when, twice a day, a vast amount of seawater is forced at speeds of up to six knots through an 880-metre gap, causing large standing waves, whirlpools and lots of white water. After too much time hemmed in by lockdown I was after a new adventure. I had long-distance walks planned but wanted a different challenge. I remembered watching the power of the tidal race from the cliffs above Jack Sound and began to wonder if it might be possible to kayak. Instructor Jet Moore from Adventure Beyond is a former Team GB whitewater slalom champion and knows the area well: he agreed to take me. We set out from Saint Martin’s Haven, a short paddle from Jack Sound. Jet is utterly professional about safety so I wasn’t worried. We crossed the mouth of the sound during a lull then paddled along the north cliffs of Skomer Island. It was magical – loads of puffins, guillemots and razorbills, plus a friendly seal. Using tidal currents we reached the south side and watched juvenile puffins zooming overhead, close enough to hear the wind in their wings. Then, after five hours of glorious paddling, it was time for the final test, actually a double examination because the sound is divided by a small island, Middleholm. Basically the tidal race is so fast that you paddle hard in one direction while actually being swept back. The first crossing went smoothly. I got a few slaps in the face with spray then picked up a swift current that swooshed me around the back of Middleholm, where we could rest. The next bit was not so pleasant. The largest standing waves looked immense as we smashed through them. It was a complete maelstrom, but Jet had the air of a man out for a quiet stroll. At one point I spotted what looked like a flat calm section and went for it. That was a mistake. I was spun right around and hit by several waves – plus a massive shot of adrenaline. Then the current spat me out and there was an amazing few seconds of speeding along without any effort before we hauled ourselves around the headland and it was over. My first reaction was “Let’s do it again!” But of course, you can’t: the currents are shifting all the time and Jet had timed it to perfection. My challenge was complete. I rode my horses hundreds of miles over the Scottish Highlands: Claire Alldritt I’ve always loved hillwalking in the Scottish Highlands. I was into horses as a child, but I didn’t have my own until I was 35. When I did, I decided to combine the hills with the horses. On my first trip, I rode with a friend and we stayed overnight in a bothy. Over 10 years, I have tackeld ever longer and more challenging trails. I have also become more self-sufficient – instead of taking a friend, I now take my other horse as a packhorse, and wild camp. During lockdown, I spent a lot of time planning routes. This year, I was ready to tackle my toughest rides yet. In June, I rode from Fort William to my home in Keith. It was a trip of two halves: the first half was along the East Highland Way, very mountainous and remote. The second was along the Moray coast, by a brilliant blue sea, with sandy beaches and amazing-smelling pine forests. It was one of my most memorable trips – the weather was fantastic and the horses were really up for it. In August, I did a 300km route through the Cairngorms. These were the most challenging trails I’ve ever done. I rode through deep, rocky rivers, over stony obstacles and through bogs that were up to the horses’ bellies. It’s quite an unusual thing to do with horses, so there are no guidelines. The trails aren’t colour-coded like they are in skiing and mountain biking. In more remote areas, you don’t know whether the path is suitable for horses until you get there. Some trails don’t exist on maps, but you hear that there are ancient ways through little glens. I was on the move for between six and eight hours a day, but that includes a lot of walking as well as riding. I alternate the lead horse and the packhorse every couple of days. There is a lot to carry: food, water, coffee flask (and hip flask for a drop of whisky at the end of the night), rugs for the horses, waterproofs for me, GPS device, air vest that inflates if I fall, first aid kit, stove, tent, tarp, corral system to secure the horses at night … When you travel alone, you connect more with the land and live in the moment. But if you see a fabulous view or something funny happens – like when I fell in a river – there’s no one to share it with. That’s why I occasionally still head to bothies to share tales of the trails with walkers and bikers. If you fancy an adventure, take small steps out of your comfort zone – big steps tend to be unsuccessful and put you off. Smaller steps will improve your self-confidence, which you can transfer to other areas of your life. I also feel calmer after getting out into the hills. My husbands notices if I haven’t been away for a while because I’m much more grumpy! Next year I’m planning to take four months off from my job as a paramedic and ride 1,000 miles all over the Highlands. I’ve travelled the world, but this is the only place that literally takes my breath away. • Claire Alldritt is the author of From East to West, by Saddle is Best"

          "bodyText": "As US regional health authorities reacted with alarm to a jump in child Covid infections that caused some school districts to announce returns to remote learning, a leading public health official questioned the need for schools to close, saying: “We know how to keep schools open, we know how to keep them safe.” Over the past three weeks, as Omicron-related cases soared in New York City and elsewhere, the number of children hospitalised in New York with Covid-19 quadrupled, the state health department said. The California state epidemiologist Dr Erica Pan wrote on Twitter: “Unfortunately New York is seeing an increase in pediatric hospitalisations (primarily amongst the unvaccinated), and they have similar [five- to 11-year-old] vaccination rates.” Across New York state, about 16% of five- to 11-year-olds and 71% of 12- to 17-year-olds are fully vaccinated. “Please give your children the gift of vaccine protection as soon as possible as our case [numbers] are increasing rapidly,” Pan wrote. Rising numbers of pediatric cases have convinced officials in some states to order a return to remote learning after the winter break. Around 300 schools in Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico and New York will remain closed. In Mount Vernon, a New York suburb, virtual learning is scheduled until at least 18 January. “I have been very reluctant to close schools but given the current trends in Covid cases it would be risky not to do so,” district superintendent Kenneth Hamilton wrote. In Maryland, Prince George’s county public schools, one of the 20 largest districts in the US, transitioned more than 136,500 students to virtual learning last week. The district chief executive, Monica Goldson, told families staff “must be able to deliver in-person instruction and other activities in conditions that prioritise their own health, as well as the wellbeing of the school community. “The increased positivity rates have significantly challenged the ability to do so, causing anxiety among many school communities and disruption to the school day.” In New Jersey, Paterson public schools will start 2022 with two weeks remote. “A surge of new cases has occurred in north-eastern New Jersey and it is expected that the trend will continue through the holiday break,” said the superintendent, Eileen Shafer. Some officials have expressed frustration. Dan Domenech, director of the School Superintendents Association, told Newsweek: “Just when we thought this past October – when we had about 98% of kids back in schools in person – that things were moving in the right direction, here we are right back where we were last year.” On Sunday, a leading health expert questioned the need for any schools to close. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told Fox News Sunday: “We know how to keep schools open, we know how to keep them safe. This really shouldn’t even be on the table. I’m disappointed to see this happening. “We know that for kids being in school is the right thing for them, for their mental health, for their education. And we have all sorts of tools to keep schools open so I don’t really understand why school districts are [closing schools]. “… There could be times when you have such severe short staffing shortages that it may be hard to keep schools going. That really should be the only context I think at this point.” Concern about Omicron infections among children remains high, however. On Friday, Christmas Eve, the New York health department warned healthcare providers of rising numbers of child hospitalisations around New York City, where Omicron was first recorded on US soil. The department warned that admissions rose four-fold from the week starting 5 December to the week starting 19 December. Approximately half the admissions were of children under five and thus not eligible for vaccines. For the week starting 19 December, none of the five- to 11-year-old patients were fully vaccinated. “The risks of Covid-19 for children are real,” said acting state health commissioner Dr Mary Bassett. “We are alerting New Yorkers to this recent striking increase in pediatric Covid-19 admissions so that pediatricians, parents and guardians can take urgent action to protect our youngest New Yorkers.” The health department advised parents to protect “children who are five years and older by getting them fully vaccinated and protect children under five by making sure all of those around them have protection through vaccination, boosters, mask-wearing, avoiding crowds and testing”. The California public health director, Dr Tomás Aragón, warned to expect rising admissions there. “Why? Omicron is so contagious that it finds unvaccinated/non-immune people who are most vulnerable for hospitalisations and deaths.” Throughout the pandemic, experts have said children are less likely to develop serious illness. For the week from 9 to 16 December, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported 169,964 pediatric Covid-19 cases, representing 1.8% to 4.1% of hospitalised patients."

Children aged between five and 11 are now eligible for vaccinations in Queensland. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk urged parents to book children, to get them vaccinated before school goes back, and to talk to their GPs about any concerns. The jabs will be available from state health clinics, GPs and pharmacists. Queensland has recorded 784 new cases. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said they are not seeing “massive impacts” on hospitals, but urged people to get their booster shots. Qld chief health officer John Gerrard said patients are “on the young side”, and that Omicron is the dominant strain at about 75% of cases. There are also some changes to vaccinations for children, more on that in a minute. Tasmania has recorded 35 new Covid-19 cases, a slight drop on the 44 reported on Boxing Day. The new daily infections announced on Monday take the number of active cases in the state to 194, with 116 patients managing their care at home, the health department says. One case is in hospital, however authorities say they were admitted for an alternative medical condition. The spike in cases comes as new arrivals for the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race continue to dock in the state capital. Tasmania opened its borders to states and territories considered of risk on December 15, when the island state had zero Covid cases. The Chinese city of Xi’an, where 13 million residents are currently in lockdown and confined to their homes, announced tightened restrictions on Sunday as the country recorded its biggest Covid-19 infection numbers in 21 months. On Sunday the country reported 206 new Covid infections - the highest daily number since March 2020, according to the national health commission. “In the coming days, a number of cases are still likely to be detected,” Xi’an official He Wenquan warned, Agence France-Presse reported. The northern metropolis - about 900 km (560 miles) from the Olympics venues - reported 155 new Covid patients on Sunday, bringing the total to nearly 500 over the past few weeks. About 29,000 people have been placed in hotel quarantine, he said. Xi’an residents have already been tested several times, authorities said, and a “total” disinfection was to begin Sunday evening. Restrictions on movement have also been tightened. Each household can only send one member out to buy basic necessities once every three days - down from two days under previous rules. All businesses except supermarkets, convenience stores and medical facilities have been ordered to close. Now I’m handing you over to the marvellous Samantha Lock, but I’ll pop back in occasionally with some Covid updates. Samantha Lock here and back with you on the blog as we go through all the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. I’ll be bringing you the news from over here in sunny Sydney so let’s start with a quick snapshot of how Covid is unfolding in Australia. The nation’s most populous state of NSW recorded three deaths and 6,324 new cases while Victoria recorded three deaths and 1999 new cases. Around Australia there have been lengthy delays getting PCR tests, and now moves are afoot to switch to rapid antigen testing in some cases. The Age reports that Covid contacts in Victoria could use rapid tests to clear themselves from isolation. In South Australia, the government has scrapped a requirement for PCR tests for interstate arrivals in favour of rapid tests on arrival. Things move fast! Looks like the cricket players have tested negative and are now heading to the ground. To stay up to speed, head to our live Ashes blog: Some more details on the Ashes delay – AAP is reporting that a member of England’s family group tested positive to Covid: England players remained back at their hotel just an hour before play on day two of the Boxing Day Test to have rapid tests. It means the start of play will almost certainly be delayed, with Australia set to resume on 1-61 in reply to the tourists 185. There’ll be more to come on this: Amid the dire news of increasing Covid infections, vaccination rates offer some solace (although a third dose may be needed to ensure “fully vaccinated” status in the future). 92% of Victorians aged 12 and over are fully vaccinated. In New South Wales it’s 93.5% of people aged 16 and over. Also three deaths in New South Wales, and 6,324 new cases: There were three deaths and 1999 new cases in Victoria: On the relentless march of the Omicron variant around the world... Kosovo has had its first cases. The Balkan state has had relatively low rates with 22 people testing positive for Covid in the past days. But nine of them had Omicron, Reuters reports, and the health officials there say its arrival is expected to worsen the situation. Updated figures show more than 1000 flights were grounded in the United States on Sunday. Reuters reports 1001 trips were cancelled, topping the 997 flights scrapped on Christmas Day and about 700 on Christmas Eve. Thousands more were delayed. Crews have been forced into quarantine as Covid surges in the US, and poor weather didn’t help. Here are some more details on the revelation that hundreds of people spent Christmas Day falsely believing they had the all clear. A Sydney hospital told more than 400 people they had a negative test result, when they were in fact positive. Eek. Read all about it here, and we’ll see how they reconcile those figures later this morning: Thanks so much, Nadeem. Tory Shepherd here in Australia, where Covid case numbers are also on the rise. I’ll bring you the latest figures as they come in. Worryingly, there is expected to be a post-Christmas spike in numbers. New South Wales reported 6,394 new infections on Sunday, which led to health minister Brad Hazzard saying “we’re all going to get Omicron”. (Not everyone was entirely chuffed with that prediction). Nationally there were almost 10,000 cases recorded, including in previously “Covid-free” states. Western Australia, which has had the toughest border restrictions, is tracing the contacts of a French backpacker who tested positive for the Delta variant. Victoria reported 1,608 cases, Queensland 714, South Australia 774, the Australian Capital Territory 71, Tasmania 44, and the Northern Territory 12. I’ll update you as soon as the new numbers are available. The US is now reporting 184,802 new cases per day - the country’s highest seven-day average since January, reports CNN and Johns Hopkins university. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, started isolating at home today after his daughter tested positive for Covid. His office said that he is awaiting the results of a PCR test after his 14-year-old daughter, who has been vaccinated, contracted the virus, reports Reuters. Iran has banned the entry of travellers from Britain, France, Denmark and Norway for 15 days as part of coronavirus curbs, Reuters reports. State television said on Sunday a similar ban imposed in late November on travellers from South Africa and seven neighbouring countries was also extended for 15 days. Algeria implemented new vaccine passport requirements today for crossing the border and entrance to public venues including sports facilities, cinemas, bathhouses and museums. Under a quarter of the population have had one vaccine dose amid vaccine hesitancy. Kosovo’s health ministry said it had registered its first nine cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the Balkan country. Coronavirus vaccination teams could go door-to-door in the UK to reach those yet to have their jabs, reports have suggested, in a bid to stave off further restrictions, PA Media reports. The Mail on Sunday reported a trial which had been carried out in Ipswich, Suffolk, could be expanded across the whole country as the government attempted to hold out against introducing new restrictions in England. The Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday it had identified the first case of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the Gaza Strip. Reuters reports that the carrier is a Gaza resident who was infected within the coastal territory, ministry official Majdi Dhair told a news conference. New coronavirus restrictions are being introduced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as the country’s leaders try to combat rising Covid cases. Although Boris Johnson is still considering similar measures in England, the devolved governments have gone ahead with new rules. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has registered 10,100 new Covid cases in Germany and 88 deaths within the past 24 hours. The RKI gave the value of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants as 220.7 as of Sunday morning. The previous day was 242.9, while a week ago the nationwide incidence was 315.4. In Australia, St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney has launched an emergency response after falsely telling 400 people they tested negative for Covid when they were, in fact, positive. The hospital has released a statement saying it is believed the mistake was down to “human error”. Kosovo’s health ministry said it had registered its first nine cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the Balkan country. The ministry said that out of the nine, two people came from the US, two from the UK, one from France, and the four other cases were people who had not travelled outside the country, Reuters reports. Labour has claimed ministers in the UK are risking the emergence of other Covid variants like Omicron by thwarting a bid by poorer countries to manufacture their own vaccines. The British government has “actively blocked countries in Africa and across the developing world from making their own vaccines” by opposing a waiver on intellectual property rights for Covid vaccines, the party says. Rich countries are divided over the proposal for a temporary waiver, first floated last year by India and South Africa. While the US, Australia and New Zealand have backed the idea, the UK, European Union and Switzerland are opposed. The amount of high street traffic in the UK on Boxing Day may have been affected by new coronavirus restrictions which came into force on Sunday in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, including wearing masks in all shops and limiting group sizes to six indoors. Footfall in Northern Ireland was 73% below the 2019 level, 63% lower in Wales and almost 50% lower in Scotland, PA reports. France has reported 27,697 new coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. Yesterday the country recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Saturday, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Arsenal football club in England have announced their next game against Wolves in the Premier League on Tuesday has been postponed due to “a number of the Wolves squad testing positive for Covid-19”. The club said: “This game will be rescheduled in due course and any tickets and/or hospitality packages purchased for this fixture will be valid for the rescheduled date.” The use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in vulnerable people may be resulting in a lower death toll in the UK compared to Europe, according to the former chief of the country’s vaccine taskforce. Clive Dix said the durable cellular immunity response produced by the AZ jab can potentially “last for life”. The Oxford/AstraZeneca jab was approved last December and vaccines were initially rolled out among the older and the most vulnerable in society. Dix told The Daily Telegraph: “If you look across Europe, with the rise in cases, there’s also a corresponding lagged rise in deaths, but not in the UK, and we have to understand that.” He added: “I personally believe that’s because most of our vulnerable people were given the AstraZeneca vaccine.” An Israeli hospital will begin administering a fourth Covid-19 vaccine jab to 150 staff on Monday in a trial aimed at gauging whether a second booster is necessary nationwide. Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv said its trial would shed light on the efficacy of a fourth dose and help decision-makers set health policy in Israel and abroad. Israel has reported 1,118 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant, with the number of people infected by it doubling every two days. A health ministry panel of experts has recommended offering a fourth dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to Israelis aged 60 and over who received a booster shot at least four months ago. But final approval by the ministry’s director-general is still pending amid public debate as to whether sufficient scientific information is available to justify a new booster drive, Reuters reports. A White House official, who asked not to be named, said despite the chaos at some airports that “we’re in a better place than last Christmas” and noted that “only a small percentage of flights are affected”. “But any cancellations can be a pain and delay reunions with family and friends, so the Transportation Department and the FAA are monitoring this closely,” the official said, referring to the Federal Aviation Administration. Commercial airlines cancelled more than 720 flights within, into or out of the US on Sunday, according to a tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. United Airlines called off 98 flights on Sunday, a spokesperson said, adding that it remained a small portion of the average 4,000 daily flights, Reuters reports. Iran has banned the entry of travellers from Britain, France, Denmark and Norway for 15 days as part of coronavirus curbs, Reuters reports. State television said on Sunday a similar ban imposed in late November on travellers from South Africa and seven neighbouring countries was also extended for 15 days. Health authorities also indefinitely halted land travel to neighbouring Turkey, a popular tourist destination, the broadcaster said. Iran, the pandemic’s epicentre in the Middle East, has reported just 14 confirmed Omicron cases so far but media reports said detection kits were not widely available and officials have warned of a possible rapid spread within weeks. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, is expected to examine crucial hospital data on Monday before any new announcement on Covid measures but has no plans to recall his cabinet, with ministers still deeply sceptical of further legal curbs. Sources said the prime minister would “take stock” after being encouraged by improving data on Friday, a sign that No 10 is leaning away from stricter curbs in England, but Downing Street sources said he would act quickly if there were new causes for concern. Instead, Johnson will receive only his regular data briefing over the bank holiday with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty – expected to be knighted in the new year honours – and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. New York’s acting state health commissioner, Dr Mary Bassett, said the “striking increase” in hospitalisations of children with Covid-19 that the state has recorded in the last three weeks showed urgent action was needed. All children older than five should be fully vaccinated, she said, while those under five should be shielded by ensuring those around them have protection through vaccination, boosters, mask-wearing, avoiding crowds and testing, Reuters reports. “The risks of Covid-19 for children are real,” Bassett said in a statement. The state’s health department said the increases were concentrated in New York City and surrounding areas where Omicron is spreading rapidly. A scaled-back Boxing Day trail-hunting programme will go ahead in parts of the UK this year despite the worsening Covid situation and growing calls to ban the practice on public land, the Countryside Alliance has said. The majority of Boxing Day hunts are due to go ahead on 27 December because this year’s holiday falls on a Sunday, traditionally a day of rest for the hunting community. Restrictions designed to slow the spread of the virus in Scotland and Wales have forced many packs to cancel public gatherings connected to their meets. France reported 95,609 total coronavirus deaths in hospital, an increase of 96. It also reported that 3,299 people are in intensive care units with coronavirus, up by 17, Reuters reports. British consumers have largely stayed away from the traditional Boxing Day sales amid concern over the Omicron Covid variant, with visits to high streets, shopping centres and retail parks down more than 45% on pre-pandemic levels, according to industry figures. Fears over the virus, as well as several key retailers including John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer and Next deciding to keep their stores closed, and the traditional bumper shopping day falling on a Sunday this year, all put a dampener on sales. By lunchtime on Sunday, numbers were only up just over a quarter on last year, when UK high streets were in lockdown, according to the latest data from shopping tracking group Springboard. Italy reported 81 coronavirus-related deaths on Sunday compared with 144 the day before, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new cases fell sharply as testing was reduced over the Christmas weekend. Following three successive days of record cases, the health ministry said just 24,883 new infections were registered in the last 24 hours, down from a previous 54,762. Only 217,052 tests for Covid-19 were carried out over the past day, compared with 969,752 announced on Saturday, the health ministry said. Italy has registered 136,611 deaths linked to Covid-19 and has reported 5.65 million cases to date, Reuters reports. Here are more details on the earlier story about US airlines calling off hundreds of flights for a third day in a row on Sunday, as surging Covid-19 infections forced tens of thousands of Christmas weekend travellers to change their plans. Commercial airlines canceled 656 flights within, into or out of the US on Sunday, slightly down from nearly 1,000 from Christmas Day and nearly 700 on Christmas Eve, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. The UK Health Security Agency has tweeted a reminder that it will not be publishing new Covid figures today. The next update will be coming tomorrow. The US is now reporting 184,802 new cases per day - the country’s highest seven-day average since January, reports CNN and Johns Hopkins university. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, started isolating at home today after his daughter tested positive for Covid. His office said that he is awaiting the results of a PCR test after his 14-year-old daughter, who has been vaccinated, contracted the virus, reports Reuters.

The hospital has released a statement saying it is believed the mistake was down to “human error”. The US is now reporting 184,802 new cases per day - the country’s highest seven-day average since January, reports CNN and Johns Hopkins university. What are the new Covid rules in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland? Jessica Elgot explains: Hundreds of US flights have been cancelled for the third consecutive day amid surging Covid infections. Reuters reports that flight-tracking website FlightAware.com recorded 656 cancelled flights either into or out of the US today. It comes after nearly 1,000 were cancelled on Christmas day and nearly 700 on Christmas eve. The Christmas holidays are usually a peak time for air travel in the US, but the arrival of Omicron has led to flights being cancelled as pilots and crew are forced to quarantine. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, started isolating at home today after his daughter tested positive for Covid. His office said that he is awaiting the results of a PCR test after his 14-year-old daughter, who has been vaccinated, contracted the virus, reports Reuters. Bennett left his weekly cabinet meeting and went home after hearing about his daughter’s positive test. Before the session started, he and other cabinet members took rapid antigen tests and received negative results. It comes as Israel is seeing a rise in infections caused by the Omicron variant. So far, Israel has reported 1,118 confirmed cases of Omicron and the number of infections is doubling every two days. Algeria implemented new vaccine passport requirements today for crossing the border and entrance to public venues including sports facilities, cinemas, bathhouses and museums. Under a quarter of the population have had one vaccine dose amid vaccine hesitancy. It is hoped that the new requirement will boost vaccination rates. The new restrictions were announced last night and came into effect today, leaving no preparation time for businesses. According to official figures, 6,230 people have died from Covid, including seven in the past week, and there have been 217,000 cases, reports the Associated Press. But the true figures are estimated to be much higher. Last month the health minister, Abderrahmane Benbouzid, warned that if vaccine hesitancy continued, over 13 million vaccines risked going out of date before they were used. Hi, I’m looking after the blog for the next hour or so. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk Santa hats and Christmas jumpers added festive colour to the usual PPE for the “jingle jabs” NHS campaign in east London on Christmas Day. At one of at least eight vaccination centres open in England, volunteers decorated Redbridge town hall with Christmas-themed pictures and festive messages as they dealt with a fast-moving queue for booster jabs. “We’ve tried to jazz it up a little bit, tried to decorate some of the bays. There’s only a limited amount we can do from a clinical point of view, but we’ve tried. Those with their Christmas hats have got them on while trying to observe full PPE,” said Imran Khan, a senior clinical pharmacist at the centre. Khan said the campaign to get people vaccinated at centres open from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day was useful in a diverse area such as Ilford and especially for workers who did not have the luxury of working from home. Sadique Shikder, 46, said his job as a bartender meant he was usually too busy to get to a vaccination centre. Similarly, 54-year-old Azmat Hussain, said he would normally be travelling as a salesperson in the financial sector. “We usually do a dinner today and it’s my mum’s birthday as well but because of Covid we’ve had to scale back so I’ll go back and watch TV,” said Hussain. Omani authorities will require foreign travellers aged 18 or older to have received at least two Covid-19 vaccine doses to enter the sultanate, the state news agency reported on Sunday. The sultanate also cancelled a previous decision that suspended entry from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique. France recorded more than 100,000 virus infections in a single day for the first time since the pandemic struck, and Covid-19 hospitalisations have doubled over the past month as the fast-spreading Omicron variant complicates the government’s efforts to stave off a new lockdown. More than one person in 100 in the Paris region has tested positive in the past week, according to the regional health service. Most new infections are linked to the Omicron variant, which government experts predict will be dominant in France in the coming days. Meanwhile a surge in Delta variant infections in recent months is pushing up hospital admissions. More than 1,000 people in France with the virus died over the past week, bringing the overall death toll to more than 122,000. The government is holding emergency meetings on Monday to discuss next steps. Some scientists and teachers have urged delaying the post-holiday return to school, or re-imposing a curfew. But the education minister says schools should open as usual on 3 January, and other government officials are working to avoid measures that would hammer the economic recovery. Instead the government is hoping that stepped-up vaccinations will be enough. The government is pushing a draft law that would require people to be vaccinated to enter all restaurants and many public venues, instead of the current health pass system which allows people to produce a negative test or proof of recovery if they’re not vaccinated. Coronavirus vaccination teams could go door-to-door in the UK to reach those yet to have their jabs, reports have suggested, in a bid to stave off further restrictions, PA Media reports. The Mail on Sunday reported a trial which had been carried out in Ipswich, Suffolk, could be expanded across the whole country as the government attempted to hold out against introducing new restrictions in England. New Covid measures came into force in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Boxing Day but politicians in England are unlikely to discuss further measures until Monday, with suggestions a voluntary reduction in social contacts before Christmas could convince Boris Johnson to rely on guidance rather than new rules. Downing Street believes that reaching those who have not yet had their vaccinations is a key way of staving off new restrictions. A month-long campaign was launched at the end of November in the Westgate area of Ipswich, which had a low vaccine uptake rate. Public health teams went door-to-door addressing worries and offering transport to vaccination centres. A bus also toured the area to offer jabs without appointments. In Great Yarmouth, in Norfolk, community vaccinators have made doorstep calls in areas where vaccination rates are low. The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is expected to speak to government officials on Boxing Day over the prospect of a recall of parliament to approve any pre-new year measures in England. It is understood a Covid O meeting is yet to be scheduled as ministers await further data, but No 10 did not rule out the possibility one could take place on Monday. The number of people getting their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine rose by around 46% in the week up to 21 December, the government said. In total, 221,564 first doses were administered in England in the week of 15-21 December, a 46% increase from the previous week, and 279,112 second doses were administered, a 39% jump, the Department of Health and Social Care said. The largest increase was seen among young people, with an 85% increase in first doses for those aged 18 and 24 and a 71% increase in first doses for those aged 25 to 30. In the week up to 21 December, more over-60s had had a first dose than during any seven-day period since early June. More details from Reuters on the identification of the first case of the Omicron variant on the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian health ministry said the carrier is a Gaza resident who was infected within the coastal territory. A ministry official, Majdi Dhair, said this meant the variant, first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong last month, existed in Gaza and was now spreading among the population. The discovery poses a new challenge to the enclave’s under-developed health system. “We are ahead of difficult days. It is expected that the Omicron variant will spread fast,” he told reporters. Gaza, with a population of 2.2 million people, has registered 189,837 COVID-19 infections and 1,691 deaths. Dhair urged Gazans to get vaccinated, putting the percentage of those who had already received shots at around 40 percent. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, three cases of Omicron variant had been detected among Palestinians on Dec. 16 and the number had since risen to 23 among the 3.1 million population, Palestinian health authorities said. Is Omicron the start of another bleak new year or the beginning of the end for the pandemic in the UK? The Observer’s science editor Robin McKie reports How close does this year’s outbreak parallel that of last winter? At first glance, the two years look similar, with case numbers rocketing in only a few weeks in the UK. However, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 remain very low so far this year, with latest research suggesting that the new variant appears to trigger fewer cases of severe illness than its viral predecessors. Scientists have generally treated these results studies as good news but have also counselled caution. Daily Covid-19 case numbers are still rising – they reached a record 122,000 on Friday – and it was estimated that 1.7m people had Covid-19 in the UK last week. Are there noticeable differences in the ages of those affected by Omicron? Crucially, most of the new cases have occurred in young adults, which has led some researchers to warn that if Omicron starts to affect older – more vulnerable – people in greater numbers, hospitalisations could still jump. On the other hand, a huge number of people – especially the elderly – have now been give vaccines and boosters and will have gained considerable protection against Omicron. It remains to be seen how these different factors affect figures. At present, data is still being gathered and it is too early to be sure. At the same time, policy decisions to protect public health still have to be taken. The problem is highlighted by infectious disease epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University. “There is inevitably a lag between infection and hospitalisation,” he told the journal Nature last week. “But in the meantime, policy decisions have to be made, and that is not straightforward.” Is the virus likely to lose its power to cause severe illness? Many scientists believe evidence is now suggesting that this idea may be correct. Recent studies in Scotland, England and South Africa all point in this direction. “My gut feeling is that this variant is the first step in a process by which the virus adapts to the human population to produce more benign symptoms,” says Dr Julian Tang, Professor of Respiratory Sciences at Leicester University. “In a sense, it is to the virus’s advantage if it affects people in a way that that they don’t get too sick – because then they can walk around and mingle in society and spread the virus even more.” So will Covid-19 end up behaving like flu? Some health officials have predicted that Covid-19 could end up behaving like influenza, which requires a new vaccine to deal with new strains that appear every year. However, Professor Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues that coronaviruses – like those that already cause common colds – do not behave this way: “They do not appear as new strains every year. The reason we get colds in winter is because our immunity to coronaviruses does not last very long. And this virus seems to be more similar to those that cause common colds. In other words, we may still need to think about giving vaccines to protect against Covid-19 every year because immunity will always slip.” That does not mean we face “doom and gloom” for the next five years, adds Tang. “I think the virus will evolve itself out of the pandemic strain very soon and become milder, more transmissible to the point where you may only need to think about vaccinating the more vulnerable members of the population.” The Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday it had identified the first case of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the Gaza Strip. Reuters reports that the carrier is a Gaza resident who was infected within the coastal territory, ministry official Majdi Dhair told a news conference. Gaza, with a population of 2.2 million people, has registered 189,837 Covid-19 cases and 1,691 deaths. In the UK, cabinet ministers vying to succeed Boris Johnson have been warned by Tory colleagues that they will damage their chances unless they stridently oppose further Covid measures in England, as MPs called for New Year’s Eve restrictions to be ruled out. With ministers expected to meet as soon as Monday to discuss whether additional measures are needed to protect hospital capacity, several Conservatives said that they would be watching those emerging as leading contenders to replace Johnson should he step aside before the next election. The news comes after it emerged government scientific advisers had modelled the impact of implementing so-called “step 2” restrictions from Tuesday. Such measures would see an end to indoor gatherings, limited outdoor gatherings, and bars and restaurants only able to serve outdoors. The modelling suggested that restrictions could reduce deaths by 18% if kept in place until mid-January or 39% if retained until the end of March. Delaying the measures until New Year’s Day would reduce their impact, though the scientists said their models did not have “sufficient precision” to detect differences in a small delay. “When an epidemic is rapidly growing, the earlier interventions take place, the larger their effect,” they said. The UK recorded 122,186 new Covid cases on Friday, the highest yet, while the Office for National Statistics estimated that 1.7 million Britons had the virus in the week ending 19 December, also a record. The Liberal Democrats have called for a clear plan to keep schools in England open in January. The Sunday Times has reported that the prime minister told Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, that he is “absolutely determined” that pupils will return to school after the Christmas holidays and that both believe education is the “No 1 priority” with school closures “not being considered”. However, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said it was not clear what mitigation measures had been put in place to keep Covid cases down in classrooms. “Our children have been failed again and again throughout this pandemic by Boris Johnson’s government,” she said. “Of course schools should stay open but he needs to explain how and with what help for teachers and parents. “He needs to explain how and with what help for teachers and parents. From air purifiers to rolling out the vaccine to teenagers, this government has dragged its feet. Ministers must set out a clear plan to reassure families that schools will be kept open, instead of making yet more empty promises.” Schools were closed in England last January, some after reopening for just one day following the Christmas holidays. Most children had already been off school from March until September. Restrictions on hospitality in Scotland have been reimposed as the government looks to stem the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. With the increased transmissibility of the new strain, the Scottish government has imposed limits on the number of people who can attend events. Only 100 are allowed to attend a standing indoor event and 200 at a seated event. Outdoor events have been limited to 500, meaning large-scale Hogmanay celebrations have been scrapped. Despite the restrictions, football games in the Scottish Premiership will go ahead on Boxing Day, with the winter break brought forward to limit the impact of restrictions on teams. Indoor non-professional contact sports have also been stopped. The restrictions will be reviewed in three weeks, and will be paired with further changes coming into effect from Monday at 5am, including the closure of nightclubs. Indoor hospitality and leisure settings will also have to return to one-metre social distancing and table service where appropriate under the new measures. Some detail on the new restrictions in Wales, via PA Media. Groups of no more than six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales from Boxing Day as new restrictions come into force. Under a series of new measures announced by first minister Mark Drakeford last week, the two-metre social distancing rules are returning in public places and workplaces. Licensed premises will have to offer table service only, face masks will have to be worn and contact tracing details collected. Outdoor events will be limited to 50 people, with 30 indoors - but numbers able to attend events such as weddings, civil partnerships, funerals and wakes will be determined by the size of the venue. The rules, which come into force from 6am, are a revised version of alert level two. The regulations bring back protections in hospitality businesses, including licensed premises, and in cinemas and theatres. Nightclubs will also close. The Night Time Industries Association described the measures as a “devastating blow” to the industry and urged the UK Government to reintroduce the furlough scheme. Drakeford said £120m would be available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses affected by the measures. “We are facing a very serious situation in Wales. A wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very infectious Omicron variant is headed our way,” he said. “We will do everything we can to protect people’s health and livelihoods in Wales - this means taking early action to try and control its spread.” There will be no restrictions on household mixing, but guidance will be issued about limiting the number of visitors, taking a lateral flow test before the visit, and meeting outdoors, if possible. There will be a separate offence for large gatherings - more than 30 people indoors or 50 people outdoors - in private homes and gardens. Drakeford did not rule out introducing further restrictions in the new year, but said he hoped these measures would flatten the infection rate. More on the situation in China, courtesy of Reuters, after the country reported its highest daily rise in local Covid-19 cases in 21 months as infections more than doubled in the northwestern city of Xian, China’s latest Covid hot spot. The city of 13 million, which entered its fourth day of lockdown, detected 155 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms for Saturday, up from 75 a day earlier, official data showed on Sunday. That drove the national daily count to 158, the highest since China managed to contain a nationwide outbreak in early 2020. Xian, with 485 local symptomatic cases reported for the 9-25 December period, has imposed heavy-handed measures to rein in the outbreak, in line with Beijing’s policy that any flare-up should be contained as soon as possible. Residents may not leave town without approval from employers or local authorities and multiple rounds of mass testing were conducted to identify cases. The city has announced no infections caused by the Omicron variant, although Chinese authorities have reported a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in southern China. Including imported cases, mainland China confirmed 206 new cases on 25 December , up from 140 a day earlier. No new deaths were reported, leaving the cumulative death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 101,077 confirmed cases as of 25 December. Russia has reported 23, 721 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, down slightly on the 24,946 cases it reported the day before. The country had also reported 968 Covid-linked deaths in the last day. New coronavirus restrictions are being introduced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as the country’s leaders try to combat rising Covid cases. Although Boris Johnson is still considering similar measures in England, the devolved governments have gone ahead with new rules. Wales From 6am on Boxing Day, a maximum of six people will be allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants. A total of 30 people will be allowed at indoor events while 50 people will be allowed at outdoor events. Two-metre social distancing is being required in public premises and offices, and nightclubs will close. Scotland Large events will have one-metre physical distancing and will be limited to 100 people standing indoors, 200 people sitting indoors and 500 people outdoors from 5am on Boxing Day. Up to three households can meet with a one metre distancing between groups at indoor and outdoor venues like bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and gyms. Table service is also needed at places where alcohol is served. The restrictions will be reviewed in three weeks, and will be paired with further changes coming into effect from Monday at 5am, including the closure of nightclubs. Northern Ireland Restrictions begin on Boxing Day and December 27, with indoor standing events no longer permitted and nightclubs closing. Full story here: To summarise the latest developments: Covid is continuing to spread in Australia, with 9,605 cases detected across the country. New South Wales recorded a record 6,394 cases, as the NSW health minister urged residents to reconsider whether they need to call an ambulance or go to hospital due to staff furloughs, warning everyone in the state was likely to be infected with Omicron. In South Australia, restrictions have been tightened to stem the spread of Omicron after a record daily number of cases. Testing centre delays were still hitting Australian states and territories, with some reaching capacity before opening on Boxing Day. Also in Australia, a Sydney hospital has been forced to issue an apology after falsely telling 400 people they had tested negative to the virus yesterday evening, when they were positive. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Saturday, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day, Reuters reports. New cases reached 54,762 compared to 50,599 a day earlier, the health ministry said. Record cases are being reported in Ireland and in China, where authorities are imposing strict lockdowns to contain the outbreaks. Local transmission is rising in China and its Xi’an province is now allowing only one member of a household to leave their home for necessities every two days. China recorded 206 cases, the highest daily rise in 21 months. More than 5,400 flight cancellations have thrown the Christmas travel schedule into chaos. Omicron has meant airlines could not staff flights. A quarter of cancelled flights were in the United States. New Covid measures in England could be in place until late March under measures examined by the UK government’s scientific advisers, including a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors, in line with the Step 2 restrictions in place in England earlier this year India’s prime minister Narendra Modi has announced vaccinations for children under 15 and booster jabs for healthcare and frontline workers. The Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in Portugal, making up almost two-thirds of cases since Wednesday. Schools, bars and clubs are closed until 10 January. There were queues at vaccination centres in England, kept open in some areas to allow walk-in appointments as the government encourages booster shots to counter the surge caused by the Omicron variant. The Nigerian president’s top media aide Garba Shehu said on Saturday that he has tested positive for coronavirus and was in isolation. Germany recorded 10,100 new Covid cases and 88 deaths, as the reference rate continues to decrease. SydPath medical director professor Anthony Dodds has addressed the media on the 400 false negatives at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney. He said no sailors or crew linked to the Sydney to Hobart yacht race were believed to have been impacted. Owing to the very large volume of tests we’ve been contending with, last night we incorrectly messaged 400 patients who had been swabbed at our centres from 22 December and 23 December, advising them they had tested negative to Covid. These people in fact had tested positive to Covid. As soon as we became aware of this issue this morning SydPath immediately commenced a process to contact these individuals. An emergency response team is now investigating the cause of this mistake which we believe is due to human error. We sincerely apologise for the mistake that has been made. In Europe, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has registered 10,100 new Covid cases in Germany and 88 deaths within the past 24 hours. The seven-day incidence continues to decrease. The RKI gave the value of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants as 220.7 as of Sunday morning. The previous day was 242.9, while a week ago the nationwide incidence was 315.4. It brings total deaths during the pandemic to 110,364. To recap Australia’s daily Covid numbers. There have been 9,618 total cases recorded across the country: Victoria has recorded 1,608 new cases. NSW has reported a record 6,394 Covid cases. St Vincent’s hospital has revealed 400 people were incorrectly told they tested negative yesterday evening. It hasn’t been confirmed whether this brings the official case count to 6,794, which would push the national case count to 10,018. The ACT has recorded 71 new local cases. Tasmania has recorded 44 new cases. South Australia has recorded 774 new Covid cases, prompting the return of some restrictions in the state. There have been 714 Covid cases detected in Queensland. Western Australia has recorded one local case who wasn’t infectious while in the community. The Northern Territory has reported 12 new local cases. Western Australia has recorded one new Covid case. The case attended the Perth Mess Hall event, and was also staying at a hostel linked to a previous case. They tested positive while in quarantine and aren’t considered to have been contagious in the community. It brings the total number of local cases linked to the current outbreak to eight. In addition, there was one other case reported overnight – an overseas traveller in hotel quarantine. Today’s new case came from 3,387 tests. Case numbers have not yet been released for Western Australia, but if there were 400 further cases that weren’t included in the official daily count in NSW because of the St Vincent’s hospital bungle, then Australia would have recorded more than 10,000 Covid-19 cases in a single day. NSW would have accounted for the bulk of the cases - almost 7,000. In Sydney, St Vincent’s hospital has launched an emergency response after falsely telling 400 people they tested negative for Covid when they were, in fact, positive. The hospital has released a statement saying it is believed the mistake was down to “human error”. The affected people are being contacted. What is unclear is whether this impacts today’s case numbers in NSW - which were already at a record 6,394. Here is the full update from the NT’s Michael Gunner. No cases have been found in Nhulunbuy, where positive wastewater was detected: The Northern Territory has recorded 12 new cases of Covid-19 since our last update. Four new cases are linked to the current cluster. This brings the total case count for the cluster to 144. Two new cases are household contacts of previous cases in the Tennant Creek area. They were not infectious in the community. Two new cases are in the Katherine area and are likely to be linked to previous Katherine area cases. They are in isolation and contact tracing is underway. Two new cases were locally acquired in household contacts of a traveller from interstate. Six new cases are in interstate arrivals. They are all in isolation at home or at the Centre for National Resilience. There are currently 18 people with Covid-19 in hospital, including one in ICU. The majority of admissions are for the purposes of infection control and assessment. 1,499 Covid-19 tests were processed across the NT yesterday....Covid-19 testing sites are open in Nhulunbuy, Katherine, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. Testing is also available at NT Health clinics in remote communities. Back in Australia, the Northern Territory has recorded 12 new Covid cases, bringing the total number of cases linked to the current outbreak to 144. There are 18 people in hospital with Covid, including one in ICU. In a Facebook post, chief minister Michael Gunner said the “majority” of admissions were for infection control and assessment. Two cases detected in Tennant Creek are household contacts of previous cases and haven’t been infectious in the community, and two cases have been detected in Katherine, likely linked to previous cases with contact tracing underway. Two new cases were recorded in household contacts of a traveller from interstate, and six further cases were recorded in interstate arrivals. Western Australia is yet to provide a Covid update after reporting two new cases yesterday. More on the 206 new cases reported in China today from Reuters, which is the highest daily rise in local Covid cases in the past 21 months. Infections more than doubled in the northwestern city of Xian, the nation’s latest hotspot. The city of 13 million, which entered its fourth day of lockdown, detected 155 domestically transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms for Saturday, up from 75 a day earlier, official data showed on Sunday. It drove the national daily count to 158, the highest since China managed to contain a nationwide outbreak in early 2020. Xian, with 485 local symptomatic cases reported between 9 December and 25 December, has imposed heavy-handed measures to rein in the outbreak, in line with Beijing’s policy that any flare-up should be contained as soon as possible. Residents are unable to leave town without approval from employers or local authorities, and multiple rounds of mass testing have been conducted to identify cases. The city has announced no infections caused by the Omicron variant, although Chinese authorities have reported a handful of Omicron infections among international travellers and in southern China. Including imported cases, mainland China confirmed 206 new cases on Christmas Day, up from 140 a day earlier. No new deaths were reported, leaving the cumulative death toll at 4,636. To recap, Covid case numbers across Australia have been released for every state and territory excluding Western Australia and the NT. It brings total cases (so far) in Australia to 9,605. Victoria has recorded 1,608 new cases. NSW has reported a record 6,394 Covid cases. The ACT has recorded 71 new local cases. Tasmania has recorded 44 new cases. South Australia has recorded 774 new Covid cases, prompting the return of some restrictions in the state.. There have been 714 Covid cases detected in Queensland. Tennis player Denis Shapovalov, who is part of Canada’s team for January’s ATP Cup, has tested positive for Covid in Sydney. Shapovalov played at the World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi last week, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the third-place play-off match. Nadal also tested positive for the virus after playing at the tournament, as did Belinda Bencic and Tunisian Ons Jabeur. Shapovalov said his symptoms were minor. The ATP prefaces the Australian Open, due to kick-off in mid-January. The Dominican Republic has identified its first case of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the health ministry of the Caribbean country said on Saturday and Reuters reports. In a statement on Twitter, the ministry said Omicron had been identified in a person with mild symptoms who had arrived in the country from South Africa. The ministry also said it had later been informed by Chilean authorities that a person who traveled to Chile from the Dominican Republic had tested positive for Omicron. Other potential cases of Omicron are under investigation. NSW shadow minister for health Ryan Park has responded to health minister Brad Hazzard’s comments about the Omicron variant earlier today. Hazzard said it was inevitable everyone in the state would get Omicron, which was what made vaccination rates particularly crucial: It’s not good enough for the premier to say ‘we’re all going to get Omicron’. He’s the leader of the state, where’s the planning and where’s the resources and where’s the leadership? Where’s the plans for hospitals? For health workers? Are there enough resources for testing clinics to cope with demand? We’ve got many people in NSW with Covid symptoms or positive RAT tests without access to a PCR test. Many clinics are closed for the next few days. That’s not good enough. South Australia has tightened public health and social restrictions in response to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant of the virus. Gyms will return to density limits of one person per seven square metres, effective immediately. From midnight, hospitality venues will return to one person per four square metres density limits for indoor dining. Home gatherings will be reduced to 10 people. The state was due to further ease restrictions on 28 December. PCR tests will no longer be mandatory for interstate arrivals. Back in Australia, South Australia has recorded 774 new Covid cases from more than 20,000 tests - another record day of case numbers. It is up from 634 cases detected on Christmas Day as the Omicron variant continues to spread. There are 17 people currently being treated in hospital, including three in intensive care. Some 93% of eligible South Australians have received their first dose of a vaccine. China has reported 206 new Covid cases on Christmas Day, a significant jump from 140 a day earlier, its health authority said on Sunday and Reuters reports. Of the new infections, 158 were locally transmitted, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 87 cases the previous day. Most of the new local cases were in the northwestern province of Shaanxi. China also reported 29 new asymptomatic cases, which it classifies separately from confirmed cases, up from 24 a day earlier. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 101,077 confirmed cases as of 25 December. Many Covid testing clinics are closed in Queensland today for the Boxing Day public holiday, but five-day testing after arrival to the state is still mandatory, causing a backlog. Still in Australia, Queensland has reported 715 new Covid cases, bringing active cases in the state to 2,857. There are seven patients being treated in hospital, and none requiring intensive care. It comes as Omicron becomes the dominant strain in the state, accounting for about 75% of new cases. Chief health officer John Gerrard said the fall in case numbers from the previous day followed a testing lull on Christmas Day, and warned case numbers would increase in the coming days: It won’t surprise us at all if within the next couple of days if the numbers get substantially higher. We would not be too concerned at that, that would not be a surprise. If you’re just joining us, here is a summary of recent major developments. Cases are continuing to rise in Australia. New South Wales recorded a record 6,394 cases, while Victoria recorded 1,608 new Covid cases. The NSW health minister has urged residents to reconsider whether they need to call an ambulance or go to hospital due to staff furloughs, warning everyone in the state was likely to be infected with Omicron. Testing centre delays were still hitting Australian states and territories, with some reaching capacity before opening on Boxing Day. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Saturday, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day, Reuters reports. New cases reached 54,762 compared to 50,599 a day earlier, the health ministry said. Record cases are being reported in Ireland and in China, where authorities are imposing strict lockdowns to contain the outbreaks. Local transmission is rising in China and its Xi’an province is now allowing only one member of a household to leave their home for necessities every two days. More than 5,400 flight cancellations have thrown the Christmas travel schedule into chaos. Omicron has meant airlines could not staff flights. A quarter of cancelled flights were in the United States. New Covid measures in England could be in place until late March under measures examined by the UK government’s scientific advisers, including a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors, in line with the Step 2 restrictions in place in England earlier this year India’s prime minister Narendra Modi has announced vaccinations for children under 15 and booster jabs for healthcare and frontline workers. The Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in Portugal, making up almost two-thirds of cases since Wednesday. Schools, bars and clubs are closed until 10 January. There were queues at vaccination centres in England, kept open in some areas to allow walk-in appointments as the government encourages booster shots to counter the surge caused by the Omicron variant. The Nigerian president’s top media aide Garba Shehu said on Saturday that he has tested positive for coronavirus and was in isolation. Back in Australia, the ACT has recorded 71 new Covid cases on Boxing Day. Some 21 new exposure sites have been added to the government’s website in response to rising cases. It is half the record 142 new cases reported on Christmas Day. Meanwhile, ACT Health hasn’t updated waiting times at Covid testing clinics since 10am, when all were closed or at capacity. “We are experiencing high demand for testing. Please do not queue on the roads,” the website states. Serbian media is reporting star tennis player Novak Djokovic won’t play in the ATP Cup due to take place in Sydney in January. He will make a decision on the Australian Open before the new year. Djokovic has refused to disclose his vaccination status, which is mandatory in order to play at the Australian Open unless he receives a medical exemption. In Australia, the Queensland treasurer Cameron Dick has lashed out at the New South Wales health response to the virus. The state has been reporting daily record case numbers of Covid-19. The NSW health minister earlier today acknowledged hospital staff were being “run off their feet”. Dick: This is a state that let the virus get out of control and it caused untold damage to lives, livelihoods and to business ... and we look at the hundreds of lives that were lost. People of NSW are naturally very concerned. It comes as three-quarters of Covid patients in Queensland in the past two weeks are revealed to have been under the age of 35. Israel has ordered 100,000 units of Pfizer Inc’s antiviral Covid-19 pill Paxlovid for people aged 12 and over at risk of severe illness, Reuters reports. It is the first pill developed specifically to treat Covid-19. An Israeli official confirmed the announcement on Saturday, after Channel 12 TV said Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett agreed the deal in a phone conversation with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. There was no immediate confirmation from the company. Paxlovid, the first oral and at home treatment for Covid, is nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalisations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to Pfizer’s clinical trial. Pfizer said recent lab data suggested it retained effectiveness against the Omicron variant of the virus. The FDA approved the antiviral pill three days ago. In South Korea, three members of K-pop sensation BTS test have tested positive for Covid-19 following their return from the US, AFP reports. The South Korean group gave their first in-person concerts since the start of the pandemic in Los Angeles, which took place from late November to early this month. They have been on holiday since then, and each of the three infected members returned to South Korea on different dates. They are all fully vaccinated, and none have had any contact with other group members after their return. Rapper RM and vocalist Jin tested positive for the virus Saturday evening, according to Big Hit Music. The announcement came a day after the agency confirmed that Suga, another member of the septet, was “administering self-care at home” following a positive test. While RM and Suga are asymptomatic, Jin has mild fever, the agency said. Among the three, RM and Suga received their positive tests while still in self-quarantine after arriving back home, while Jin was released from quarantine after testing negative and received his positive result later. Big Hit Music said in a statement the company would put its “highest priority on the health and safety of our artists”. As Christmas arrives around the world, a surge of Covid infections is keeping many families apart, overwhelming hospitals and scaling back religious ceremonies as the Omicron variant continues to spread. I’m Caitlin Cassidy here to bring you major Covid developments around the world. Pope Francis has used his Christmas address to pray for more vaccines to reach the developing world, while in England, Queen Elizabeth II has noted another year of pain after losing her husband, Prince Philip, in April, acknowledging Christmas can be hard for “those who have lost loved ones”. Cases are continuing to rise in Australia, where New South Wales earlier recorded a record 6,394 cases. The NSW health minister has urged residents to reconsider whether they need to call an ambulance or go to hospital due to staff furloughs, warning everyone in the state was likely to be infected with Omicron. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Saturday, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began, and Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day. Meanwhile, some 5,400 flight cancellations have thrown the Christmas travel schedule into chaos. Omicron has meant airlines could not staff flights, with quarter of cancelled flights in the United States. Let’s dive in."

          "headline": "Healing myself the Pagan way: how witchcraft cast a spell on me",
          "bodyText": "Witchcraft has always played a large role in my life. While many kids were learning badminton or taking trombone lessons, I was reading up on spellcraft and ways to plant my herb garden. I grew up in the late 1990s when my cultural life became saturated with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Channel-hopping without stumbling across a young woman with magical powers was virtually impossible. But the draw wasn’t just the empowerment that spells and telekinetic forces threw my way; I was intensely charmed by witchcraft’s connection with the world outside and the earth around me. In the evenings I spent time in my garden wrapped up in scarves and blankets to watch the different phases of the moon pass each night; I learned the names of wildflowers growing at the side of the road where no one cast a second glance and wondered how I could use them in a spell. These small things gave me an overwhelming sense of calm, so enthralled was I by constellations, intricate root systems and the dashes of magic I found around me. Perhaps witchcraft was in my blood – my very first word was “moon”. So, as an adult, it seemed incredibly natural to me that witchcraft would be the safe haven I returned to in order to recover my mental health after a workplace ordeal left me suffering from depression. Back in 2018, the world started to look a little hazy to me. For as long as I could remember, I had been told the direction my life would take: I would do well in school, go to university and get a good job. But, in my new communications role at a fast-paced agency, I struggled to come to terms with my reality – I was waking up in cold sweats at 4am every morning and, whenever I washed my hair, long tendrils would pull free from my scalp and form a dark pool at my feet. On top of the physical symptoms of anxiety, I noticed that as the job grew more stressful, my mood tumbled downwards until I was in a state of depression for months at a time. And so, in the winter of 2018, after realising how disconnected I had become from myself and the nature-loving woman I had once been, I knew something had to change. I decided to break away – I quit. In the aftermath and panic of walking away from a job that paid my bills and gave me some semblance of a normal person, I decided to use this newfound time to re-connect with my longtime love of bubbling cauldrons, flickering candles and the occult in an effort to restore balance in my life and heal my mental health. Witchcraft falls under the umbrella term of Paganism – a form of spiritual practice that involves a deep reverence of the earth. While the term “witch” is now incredibly nuanced and there are many different names for people who practise forms of magic, I think it is hard to find a Pagan who isn’t involved in saving the planet in some way. I believe that a witch is someone who is deeply in touch with people, plants and animals, and knows how to work with their innate power to bring about change in the world, usually through magical forces. This could be through spells, ritual work or through concocting brews and elixirs made from potent ingredients, although there are many ways to work with the magical world. Much as the Romantic poets showed their appreciation for nature by writing about its beauty, now Pagans throw their arms up to the sky to welcome in the rain when it is needed, grow native plants to feed the bees and only take as many leaves from nature as they need so as not to disrupt the balance of local flora. This care for and worship of the natural world in the face of climate change is perhaps why witchcraft and Paganism are the perfect practices to help us reconnect with the world and survive in the 21st century. My year of witchcraft unfolded before me and I took the first steps to recover my mental health. I was shaky at first, unused to allowing myself the time to do anything other than “be productive”. I started by observing the Pagan festivals – or sabbats – commonly followed by witches, including Yule (the winter solstice), Imbolc (the first signs of spring in February) and Ostara (the spring equinox). Each of these festivals has a different tradition associated with it, and during the winter festivals, I focused on spending time outside, soaking up the pale fractions of vitamin D that the sun would allow, and sitting under the trees to feel their deep-seated power thrumming directly below me in the ground. I gave myself time to just be in nature and connect with its sounds and feelings, allowing it to trigger the healing processes in my brain. I breathed deeply; I smiled when I saw a flash of a plump, pink bullfinch in the hedgerow. Witchcraft is so intensely wrapped up in nature that the link to mental health is clear. The benefits of spending time outdoors are well-documented, with one study reporting that spending at least two hours outside every week could boost physical and mental wellbeing significantly. As spring approached, instead of the dark fingers of anxiety that had tapped on the back of my neck for the past year, I began to feel hopeful for the first time in a long time. As a teenager, I had spent so much time out in nature, spotting birds with my dad and going on long family rambles that ended with jam sandwiches and crisps in the car. I would come home shattered, but knowing the sounds of birds, replaying the call of a blackbird, wren or oystercatcher in my head while many of my friends spent their weekends in crowded shopping malls. The idea that I had become so disconnected from these flurries of feathers and muddy boots made me nervous and rattled my core. Slowing down and appreciating the magic of the cycles of life again opened up my sense of wonder for the natural world that had been lacking for so many years. Of course, we are at a point in history where we are experiencing a massive shift in working patterns and environments and it is only natural that we would look to practices that ground us – practices and rituals that were lost during the industrial revolution, when huge swathes of the population were uprooted from their rural country homes and cut off from their connection with nature. The pandemic gave some of us a few moments to sit back and reflect on our priorities. Research showed that 46% of people were looking to quit their job this year and do something different now that remote working is a possibility. People have been spending more time in nature and in their gardens, giving us the headspace to ask: w hat makes us happy? What makes us feel most like ourselves? What would we do if anything was possible? Light a vanilla-scented candle; add Himalayan salt to your bath; wrap seaweed around your face. Self-care has become yet another compulsory measure to add to our busy days to stave off the pandemic burnout. Of course, people got exhausted before the 21st century, but the past two years have brought self-love practices to the fore. We’ve seen big companies giving their staff time off to help reverse the epidemic of anxiety, and employees are being told to get out in nature, download Headspace and learn to meditate. But wouldn’t it be better if we took a pause before we got to the point of a panic attack? As we come to re-examine office structures and working life, many people are looking to find a deeper connection with the natural world and their place within it. However, birdwatching and outdoor yoga aren’t for everyone – some of us need something more charged and immersive in order to help us rediscover our true selves. Returning to my love of witchcraft that started when I was a teenager helped me to refocus my energies and see the world through a new lens – one where nature, cycles and my own wellbeing are the focal points. As we continue to reach dizzying heights in the technological age, witchcraft can help us see the magic of the everyday and bring us back down to earth where we can plant two outstretched hands in the moss.

          "bodyText": "This was the year of the great exhibition – in spite of the plague. Galleries offered online shows when they couldn’t open and riches when they could, no matter the havoc of cancelled loans, insurance hikes and unreliable transport. Schedules were dextrously shifted and blockbusters extended, so judiciously that Tate shows ran longer and the Royal Academy’s magnificent Late Constable continues straight through until next year. Still, one curator confided, 2021 was like playing poker while also juggling eggs. Terrific surveys of female artists continued apace, though still not fast enough to make up for lost time. The wild and stirring genius of the Scottish painter Joan Eardley was celebrated in multiple centenary shows across Scotland. Swiss modernist Sophie Taeuber-Arp’s graphic wit and versatility of needle, pen and paintbrush dazzled at Tate Modern. There were lifetime commemorations of Barbara Hepworth in Wakefield, Eileen Agar at the Whitechapel, Laura Knight at Milton Keynes (still on, until 20 Feb) and US abstract expressionist Helen Frankenthaler at Dulwich – her visions diaphanous as mist, frequently vast, yet miraculously achieved through hard-line woodcut. By general consent, Yinka Shonibare brought the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition to exhilarating new life with outstanding works by black artists. And 2021 felt at least fractionally more diverse, with riveting solo shows from Charles Gaines, Michael Armitage and Samson Kambalu, Joy Labinjo and Sonia Boyce in public spaces, Carrie Mae Weems in Cardiff, whose photographs could be seen outdoors during lockdown, and every single one of the 40 and more contributors to Life Between Islands, seven decades of British Caribbean art at Tate Britain, so mind-altering I will never forget it. This was the show of the year for me. Painting soared, and was everywhere. People muttered that it was safer than installation or event art, say, during a pandemic (though that didn’t stop Yayoi Kusama’s mirror-upon-mirror Infinity Rooms from selling out at Tate Modern). Ralph Rugoff’s Mixing It Up: Painting Today offered an enthralling overview of what he called “one of the three best painting scenes in the world right now” – namely ours. His Hayward Gallery show offered an astounding range of UK-based artists – Lisa Brice, Matthew Krishanu, Vivien Zhang, rising stars Mohammed Sami and Kudzanai-Violet Hwami – almost all of them born elsewhere. Yet another irreducible argument, were it necessary, for freedom of movement. Many venerable artists died in 2021. There will be no more work from Christian Boltanski, Chuck Close, Lawrence Weiner or the Lebanese painter and poet Etel Adnan, who died at the age of 96. Her life lesson was radiantly simple: “When I paint, I am happy.” The tragic death of Tate Modern’s internationally admired head of exhibitions, Achim Borchardt-Hume, whose shows included the incomparable Picasso: 1932, was announced last month. He was 56. Memories of his acclaimed shows survive him. The Courtauld Gallery reopened after several years – clarified, beautified, masterpieces newly cleaned, the staging a sequence of surprises. So did Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery, expanding to incorporate a whole double-height warehouse. The south-west acquired a new museum with the Box in Plymouth, opening with a show of Australian art. Bournemouth got the art gallery Giant, where Debenhams once stood. You can now see the YBAs beside the seaside. Art can take you anywhere – and this year it did. To the Middle East in the V&amp;A’s Epic Iran, to Australia at Tate Modern (until Autumn 2022), and to Peru (until 22 Feb), Nero’s Ancient Rome and Hokusai’s Japan in the wondrous The Great Picture Book of Everything (ends 30 Jan), all at the British Museum. Art – international, intimate – embraced us into the world again this year, when that world felt remote. For this, and all else, I am so grateful. The top 10 art shows of 2021 1. Life Between Islands: Caribbean-British Art 1950s-Now Tate Britain, London (until 3 April) Joyous, piercing, beautiful: transatlantic life in every medium 2. Late Constable Royal Academy, London (until 13 Feb) Dark, tumultuous, triumphant works. 3. Paula Rego Tate Britain The turbulent inner life in stunning narrative paintings. 4. Joan Eardley centenary Across Scotland Multiple shows of this great Scottish painter of children, seas and wintry landscapes. 5. Frans Hals Wallace Collection, London (until 30 Jan) Revolutionising the male portrait: spies, diplomats, cavaliers, brewers. 6. Helen Frankenthaler Dulwich Picture Gallery, London (until 18 April) Captivating visions miraculously achieved in woodcut. 7. Jean Dubuffet Barbican, London Rebellious, witty pioneer of subversive art brut. 8. Sophie Taeuber-Arp Tate Modern, London Paintings, puppets, embroideries and more from this long-overlooked modernist. 9. Tokyo: Art and Photography Modern Art Oxford (until 3 Jan) Love, loneliness, life and death in the floating world. 10. Artes Mundi Cardiff Global sweep through the best in contemporary art. Turkey Turner Prize 2021 Herbert Art Gallery, Coventry (until 12 Jan) Four socially concerned collectives: worthiest yet, though possibly the worst."

          "bodyText": "In the next 12 months, Britain is expected to make a remarkable aerospace breakthrough. For the first time, a satellite will be fired into orbit from a launch pad in the United Kingdom. It will be a historic moment – though exactly where this grand adventure will begin is not yet clear. A series of fledgling operations, backed by the UK Space Agency, are now competing to be the first to launch a satellite from British soil. One is based in Cornwall, where a Virgin Orbit jumbo jet is set to carry a LauncherOne rocket to a height of 35,000 feet, where it will then be fired to propel its satellite cargo into orbit. The first flight is scheduled for late summer. By contrast, rival Scottish spaceports – one in Sutherland and one on Shetland – are preparing more direct routes, with each announcing plans to launch two-staged rockets that could put satellites round the Earth in late autumn. In addition, proposals have been announced to build spaceports in Scotland at Campbeltown, Prestwick and North Uist, while Wales’s B2Space, based in Snowdonia, has revealed its own, unusual method for getting into space: by balloon. It plans to release a helium-filled dirigible which will carry a rocket to a height of more than 20 miles. The launcher will then be fired, carrying its satellite cargo into orbit. Some of the remotest parts of the British Isles will soon reverberate to the sound of rocketry and space launches, with the Cornish, Sutherland and Shetland programmes rated as the most likely to see first successes next year. Each of these spaceports has stressed the carbon-friendly, re-usable aspects of its operations and, in general, have received cautious support from most local people. An example is provided by Sutherland Spaceport – which is based on a 12-acre site in the middle of the Melness Crofters‘ Estate on the A’Mhoine peninsula on the very northernmost part of mainland Scotland. Crofters there graze cattle, catch fish and tend the land but have welcomed the £17.5m project that could soon see rockets fired over their remote homeland. “This is not going to be the Cape Canaveral of the Highlands,” said Dorothy Pritchard, chair of Melness Crofters’ Estate. “There will only be a few launches every year. But the spaceport will provide skilled jobs for young people, and that is desperately important here. The oil industry is going, young adults are leaving, and the population around here is ageing. A spaceport will bring a tremendous boost to the area by providing jobs for skilled, educated young folk.” Not everyone has been enthusiastic. Local landowner, the Danish billionaire Anders Povlsen, has claimed the spaceport would harm his plans to rewild the area. Earlier this year, a judicial review threw out a bid by him to have the project blocked, however, and Povlsen has since announced that he will not appeal against the decision. Space Hub Sutherland’s first launch is tipped for late autumn when a Prime rocket – built by Orbex, a UK-based launcher manufacturer – is scheduled to make its maiden flight from the spaceport. Orbex describes its Prime rocket as “one of the most advanced, low-carbon, high-performance micro-launch vehicles in the world”. The spaceport lies on mainland Britain’s remotest corner, though its location looks positively bustling compared with its Shetland rival, SaxaVord Space Port, which is being built at Lamba Ness on Unst, the most northerly inhabited island in the UK, 400 miles north of Edinburgh. Its Pathfinder rockets will be delivered next year. The site, like Sutherland’s, offers special advantages. Many satellites – in particular, Earth monitoring spacecraft that study sea-level fluctuations and ice-sheet changes – often fly in polar orbit round the Earth, on trajectories inclined at 90 degrees to the equator. On orbits like these, the Earth revolves beneath the craft as it sweeps over the poles, allowing it to monitor the entire planet underneath it. So, blasting a rocket northwards, safely over open seas and not over inhabited land, gives spaceports such as Sutherland’s and SaxaVord a key benefit. “What we really have to concentrate on is making sure we have as much flexibility as possible in our operations,” said Scott Hammond, operations director of the Shetland spaceport. “We need to be able to launch fairly big satellites, say 500kg, as well as small ones, down to 10kg, in order to attract as many different customers – who will have varying requirements for the objects that they want to put in space – as possible. And that, precisely, is what our rockets are designed to do.” A different approach is taken by operators at Cornwall’s spaceport. Their satellite launcher will involve no fiery blast-offs but will, instead, be carried aloft, strapped to the underside of Cosmic Girl, a retrofitted 747 jet that is operated by Virgin Orbit and which will take off from Newquay airport. Virgin Orbit has already launched satellites this way, over the Pacific, and has plans to use this spaceport as its European base. “Instead of customers having to take their satellites to a rocket pad to have them blasted into space, Virgin Orbit takes the opposite route – by coming to a site near you to offer a launch,” said Melissa Thorpe, head of Spaceport Cornwall. “It has set up bases round the world, and Cornwall will be the centre of its European operations. That will make it much easier for UK satellite builders to get their craft into orbit.” In total, it is a striking set of launch plans with Britain concentrating on the growing market for launching small satellites, which are usually less than 500kg in weight. “In 2012, there were around 50 launches of small satellites,” said Ian Annett, deputy chief officer of the UK Space Agency, which has played a key role in setting up the nation’s spaceport network. “By 2019, there were more than 400 and the market continues to grow. “It used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to put a kilo of material into orbit. However, commercial launching companies – like Elon Musk’s SpaceX – have brought that cost down to nearer $1,000.” Such reductions are opening up low Earth orbit for exploitation by a wide range of users, from single university departments to companies planning to exploit global markets. For example, internet providers such as OneWeb have announced plans to put hundreds of small satellites into orbit to generate global broadband coverage. Others want to use them to study the impacts of climate change, carry out disaster monitoring, manufacture alloys and drugs in microgravity, test new communication technologies and to implement a host of other applications. Small satellites range from the size of an oven to a phone, and can be launched individually or in clusters. It remains to be seen whether the UK’s fledgling space launch industry can attract enough business to keep all seven proposed spaceports busy launching these satellites. At present, however, there is confidence for their prospects. “The market potential is immense, and Britain has a chance to exploit that operation from within its own shores, for the first time,” said Annett."

          "bodyText": "In a pastoral scene that has changed little in centuries, farmers wearing red woollen ponchos gather on a December morning in a semicircle to drink chicha, made from fermented maize, and mutter an invocation to Pachamama – Mother Earth – before sprinkling the dregs on the Andean soil. Singing in Quechua, the language spread along the vast length of the Andes by the Incas, they hill the soil around plants in the numerous small plots terraced into a patchwork up and down the Peruvian mountainside. The Andes sustains one of the most diverse food systems in the world. Through specially adapted farming techniques, these farmers conserve a great variety of maize, also known as corn, and other biodiverse crops that could be key to food security as global heating causes a more erratic climate. Maize has been grown in Lares, near Cusco, for thousands of years, in one of the highest farming systems in the world. Choquecancha and Ccachin communities specialise in more than 50 varieties of the cereal in a myriad of different sizes and colours. “In the old days, the Incas grew these ecotypes and now we continue the path set down by our ancestors,” says Juan Huillca, a conservationist in Choquecancha, a tiny mountainside village. On a blanket are ears of corn ranging in colour from faintly yellowed white to deep purple. All have thick kernels and evocative names. Yellowish corncobs with red tinted kernels are called yawar waqaq (blood crier). White cobs flecked with grey, whose toasted kernels are served as crunchy canchita with Peru’s flagship dish ceviche, are more prosaically called chuspi sara (small corn). Historians believe what is now the world’s most widely grown cereal crop was first domesticated by people in modern-day Mexico about 10,000 years ago and subsequently spread south down the spine of the Andes to reach Peru about 6,000 years ago. Long before the climate crisis, these farmers’ ancestors adapted to growing crops in different niche ecosystems, from icy mountain peaks to sunny valleys. “In this landscape it would be difficult to produce just one variety of one crop, because in one year you can have frosts, hail, droughts or torrential rain,” says Javier Llacsa Tacuri, an agrobiodiversity expert who manages a project to safeguard the farming techniques, which have been identified as one of a handful of globally important agricultural heritage systems. “With a few varieties, you could not face a farming year, so the response is to have many varieties. The frosts and hailstorms have always occurred and their ancestors knew how to face them,” he says. With more than 180 native domesticated plant species and hundreds of varieties, Peru has one of the world’s richest diversity of crops. Backed by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, the project supports the farmers to preserve the native species, and Llacsa Tacuri and colleagues help find markets for the multicoloured corns. “Peru is one of eight places in the world which is considered a centre of origin for agriculture,” says Llacsa Tacuri. “The first inhabitants and their descendants – the peasant farmers who are here – started their adaptation to this landscape more than 10,000 years ago.” Huillca says his village and its neighbours are already feeling the climate crisis. “Diseases like stem rust or blight arrive, sometimes we get frost or hail. That’s why we have our seed bank in order not to lose our maize ecotypes, so we can recover what we’ve lost and resow those varieties,” he says. In a simple farmhouse in Ccachin lies the genetic heritage of thousands of years of crop domestication and variation. Dozens of types of dried kernels are stored in plastic containers for rainy days. “But many young people migrate to the city because this doesn’t generate much income,” Huillca adds. “What we do doesn’t bring enough income to sustain the family, so they move to the city.” Sonia Quispe, a maize conservationist in Choquecancha, says the harvest is half what it would normally be. “With the climate crisis, there’s less harvest, but we substitute our diet with potatoes,” she says. “It’s important to work with the different varieties of maize for our food security. With global heating, there are varieties that are more resistant to illnesses and pests.” Quispe can identify the variety of three-month-old maize shoots from the stalks. She explains that the ones with red at the base will produce red-tinted cobs with a bitter taste that repels pests, which are moving further up the mountain as the sun becomes more intense. Julio Cruz Tacac, 31, a yachachiq, or farming teacher, who returned to Ccachin after studying in Cusco, has seen weather patterns change. “When I was little, the sun didn’t shine with such intensity, the temperature was mild,” he says. “It’s as if we live in an Eden in terms of food products, we have everything to hand,” he says of his childhood home. This is in contrast to city life, where “everything is money”, he says, and which became even harder during the Covid-19 pandemic – Peru had the world’s highest Covid mortality rate. The custom of ayni, reciprocal communal work, remains in these remote villages, but a bartering form of exchange, known as trueque, has been hit by the pandemic’s economic impact. “We go to the market and we trade with the fruit and coca from the farmers in the valley,” says Genara Cárdenas, 55, from Ccachin. “But now with the pandemic the people don’t want to barter, they want money.” Financial pressures have affected the village’s traditional way of life, but their crops have helped them remain self-sufficient despite the economic problems. Even so, the climate crisis presents new challenges, says 55-year-old farmer Victor Morales. “When I was young, the rains, the frost, all had their time. But today everything has changed. We had many types of potatoes and maize, now we have varieties which are more resistant to climate change.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:"

          "bodyText": "In 2015, Saturday Night Live spoofed the rancorous political arguments besieging American social life. Cast members seated around a dining table to celebrate Thanksgiving passed the side dishes and threw invective. The verbal heat rose and rose until a young girl pressed play on a cassette player and the Adele song Hello washed over the room. The combatants instantly ceased fire and began lip-synching the lyrics. Their rapture escalated until they physically entered a re-creation of the music video. A Thanksgiving Miracle aired before the Trump presidency and its violent subversive conclusion. This holiday season, it’s hard to think of a song capable of transporting Americans into a state of blissful unity. Masks and vaccines have become a divisive issue and assault weapons have cropped up as accessories on congressional Christmas cards. But there is an alternative to mutually assured bad-mouthing. Americans can meet clandestinely among the like-minded, not just to commiserate but also to plan and participate in election campaigns. Emily Van Duyn, a political communications scholar, embedded with one such group in Texas in 2017. Her book chronicles the journey of 136 liberal women living in a rural and thus predominantly conservative Texas town who, determined to resist Trump, organized themselves into what Van Duyn anonymizes as the Community Women’s Group (CWG). They were middle-aged and senior white women (save one who was Black), afraid to speak their minds and put up yard signs. The author interviewed 24 of them multiple times, attended their monthly meetings on a dozen occasions, and examined meeting minutes from November 2016, when they were in tears and shock, until December 2020, at which point their politicking had yielded higher vote totals for Democrats in the previous month’s election, though not enough to prevail anywhere on the ballot. Van Duyn also conducted a national and statewide survey in 2018, from which she concluded that more than one in five American adults felt the need to hide their politics, and just under one in 10 operated in similarly self-obscured conversational settings. The study explains how social, geographic and political causes shaped the communication practices of the CWG. “[T]he growing animosity between and within parties, the uncertainty about truth, the growing intersectional animosity around ideology, race, class, and gender, made for a political context that was not only unpleasant but risky.” Trump palpably threatened their sense of security as women. Locally, they feared ostracization, loss of business (especially the real estate agents), defacement of property and being run off the road by men in trucks with guns who noticed liberal bumper-stickers, as happened at least once and was talked about often. Van Duyn excels at detailing the evolution of CWG’s communications practices, a mix of private and public facing activities conducted through physical as well as digital channels. Many members had grown up deferring to men about matters political. But a week after Trump’s victory one of them sent an email to eight neighbors: “I would like to suggest that we get together for support and see where that takes us.” That got forwarded, and 50 showed up at the first meeting. In a remote location, with the blinds closed, they wrote a mission statement and formed committees by issue to educate themselves. That super-structure soon fell by the wayside. Their formalized confidentiality agreement held, however. Between meetings they relied on a listserv to communicate among themselves with a brief detour into a secret Facebook group. In their darkened space (the book title inverts the slogan of the Washington Post) they opened each meeting with talk about their fears. A few started sending letters to the editor of the local newspaper using their individual identity, often to register dissent with and fact-check other letter writers. Over the two years of the study, about half emerged as open Democrats. They worked on mobilizing other Democrats (even though not all were registered or comfortable with the party), leaving the heavy labor of persuasion to formal campaigns. Their work shored up the party in their county: they ran phone banks, filled district chairs, updated voter files and raised money. The group had served as a safe harbor to develop political skills and confidence. CWG falls into several political traditions, including the voluntary associations that De Tocqueville valorized, the hidden minorities who have suffered the weights of oppression and, for that matter, the collectives of oppressors and cultists. Women are a demographic majority in America, and the political positions of CWG would fit in the national mainstream. But these women were neither in the contexts of their lives. Even so, by the end of the period Van Duyn examines, their politicking mirrored that of more open demographic counterparts such as the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County, a group that helped first-time candidate Abigail Spanberger turn a central Virginia seat Democratic in 2018 – one that she now has to decamp for a newly re-drawn district. Some Republicans at holiday gatherings this year will continue to relish the opportunity to bait liberals (a practice that goes both ways). They may emulate Trump’s style of discourse, centered on a barrage of lies, exaggerations, accusations and taunts. Or they may not do any of these things; as Trump said about southern border-crossers in 2015 “some, I assume, are good people”. Indeed, some Republicans may feel intimidated by progressive majorities in workplaces and on campuses. All told, the risks of escalated, energy draining crossfire between America’s political tribes have risen and intensified. So this holiday season is no time for engaging others in political matters, for disputing the veracity of their claims and integrity of their motives. Far better to smile wanly, deflect provocations, change the subject, and then join or form a political support group. As Van Duyn’s book shows, good things can follow from going underground.

          "headline": "1.7 million people in UK had coronavirus last week; thousands of Christmas flights cancelled – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Passengers travelling home for Christmas have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 2,000 flights on Friday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. The U.S. will next week lift the travel ban imposed on several southern African nations when the Omicron variant of Covid was first detected, AFP reports. France reported a record 94,124 new daily Covid-19 infections on Friday while the number of people hospitalised for the disease reached a seven-month high at close to 16,200, according to official data. One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far. South Africans without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday. Additionally, people in South Africa will be offered a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its used for the general public. France will require passengers to show negative Covid tests to travel to its overseas territories, with the new measure coming into effect on 28 December. The UK Health Security Agency’s chief has suggested the government might decide on whether further restrictions are needed in England based on Omicron’s wider impact, rather than the variant’s severity alone. The UK government’s chief scientific adviser has defended Sage against the charges that the group’s modelling was fearmongering, saying it was not their job to “spread gloom”. Dozens of officials have reportedly been punished over a virus outbreak in the locked-down city of Xi’an, China’s disciplinary body said on Friday, Agence France-Presse reports. Some further data from France. Some 16,173 people are currently hospitalised for Covid-19 in the country, with 3,254 of them in emergency care. Some 122,462 people have died of Covid-19 in France since the start of the pandemic, AFP reports/ Some 76.5 percent of the population have received two vaccine doses, and nearly 21 million people in a country of 67.4 million residents have received a booster shot. On Friday, health authority recommended that adults receive a booster jab three months after their initial vaccination. New coronavirus restrictions could be in place until late March under measures examined by UK government scientific advisers. The modelling by experts from Warwick University considered a package of measures including a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors, in line with the Step 2 restrictions in place in April in England. A consensus paper published on Christmas Eve by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (Spi-M-O) said “rapidly enacted Step 2 measures reduce the peak of hospital pressure to about half its level under Plan B only”, PA reports. The U.S. will next week lift the travel ban imposed on several southern African nations when the Omicron variant of Covid was first detected, AFP reports. Countries around the world restricted travel from southern Africa after the variant was detected in South Africa, which reported Omicron to the World Health Organization (WHO) on November 24. WHO and the United Nations spoke out against the travel bans and officials in South Africa said they were being punished for identifying the strain and being transparent. White House assistant press secretary Kevin Munoz defended the ban on Twitter, saying, “The restrictions gave us time to understand Omicron and we know our existing vaccines work against Omicron, (especially) boosted.” He said the travel ban would be lifted on December 31. In Bethlehem, hoteliers have been disappointed. After a near-total lockdown last year, Israel has again closed its borders. Celebrations on Friday were subdued as just several hundred huddled in the city’s Manger Square to watch the Palestinian scouts and bagpipers parade past. This year, like last, midnight mass on Christmas Eve will be reserved for just a small circle of people by invitation only. “It is a bit surreal,” American student Hudson Harder told AFP. “There is a selfish part where it’s like ‘Oh I get to see this place so empty’ but on the other hand you feel for the shops, all the money they are losing, it’s really quite tragic.” The prospect of a fourth Covid booster jab in the UK is possible as immunity may subside for millions by the new year, the Telegraph newspaper reported. Protection against getting ill with the Omicron variant is as low as 35 per cent 10 weeks after a booster, according to government data. Christmas Day will start early at Sydney’s Wayside Chapel in Australia. From about 6am volunteers will be blocking off the street and “rolling out the green carpet”. “We’re going to cover Hughes Street in astroturf and lay down some picnic blankets, appropriately socially distanced spots reserved for our very important guests,” the Kings Cross charity’s chief executive, Pastor Jon Owen, says, adding: “many of whom will be waking up in the gutter that morning.” The Wayside Chapel is among many Australian organisations that will open its doors to those with nowhere else to go on Christmas Day, offering a sense of something that has been particularly hard to grasp over the past two years: togetherness. The UK government will send millions of text messages on Boxing Day urging people to get a coronavirus booster vaccine. The message, part of the Get Boosted Now campaign, is the latest attempt to reduce the impact of the Omicron variant sweeping the UK. More than 32 million booster and third doses have already been administered, PA reports. The message will read: “Get boosted now. “Every adult needs a Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against Omicron. “Get your Covid-19 vaccine or booster. “See NHS website for details.” With all of the worrying news emerging from the fields of health and science this year, some of the incredible advances that occurred may have been overlooked. But there have been many weird and wonderful feats in the world of research. Life-saving tests, treatments and vaccines were developed and rolled-out – including those led by Australian doctors – and a world-first malaria vaccine for children was endorsed by the World Health Organization. A new species of dinosaur was discovered in south-west Queensland, adding to our understanding about how they evolved. We learned from Nasa that the much-feared asteroid, Apophis, won’t hit Earth for at least 100 years, so that’s a relief. Rebecca Miller is cooking up a Christmas Day feast – even though she can’t taste a thing. Both Miller and her partner Steven have Covid. They’ve cancelled their plans to go to Tasmania – where they were due to be celebrating her 50th birthday for 3 January, and his delayed 50th from last year. Instead they will spend Christmas at home in Adelaide instead, video-calling family and friends. “Even though I’ve lost my sense of taste and smell, I’m still cooking up a full vego roast, a big stuffed butternut pumpkin with roast veggies,” Miller said. In response to figures showing today’s 1,171 Covid hospitalisations in the UK, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the sharp rise was “really worrying” for the NHS. “Daily hospital admissions with Covid have gone up by over 40% in the last week [815 on 14/12; 1098 on 21/22 - England only] and this is really worrying for health leaders whose teams are working flat out in the context of rising staff absences and wider pressures”, he said. “While the preliminary findings suggest that omicron may be less likely to cause serious illness than other strains, positive cases are increasing and so, we must remember this virus presents a very real risk to daily life and to the NHS. The NHS will continue to be there for everyone who needs it but the best thing the public can is to continue to behave in ways that can keep themselves and others safe from illness. “This includes ventilating indoor areas, testing before social gatherings and if eligible, taking up that vital offer of a vaccine or booster.” Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “This rise, and today’s record of daily cases of infections, shows that we must keep watching these hospital numbers very closely. In particular, we need to see what happens as larger numbers of older people start to be infected with the new variant. It is likely the number of older people catching omicron will increase given the amount of inter-generational contact over the next 72 hours of Christmas” France reported a record 94,124 new daily Covid-19 infections on Friday while the number of people hospitalised for the disease reached a seven-month high at close to 16,200, according to official data. The seven-day moving average of new cases, which evens out weekly data reporting irregularities, also reached a new record of 66,417, a total that has tripled in just one month, Reuters reports. Italy reported a second successive record daily tally of Covid-19 cases on Friday, with new cases hitting 50,599 compared to 44,595 a day earlier, the health ministry said. The number of coronavirus-related deaths fell to 141 from 168 on Thursday, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 136,386 deaths linked to Covid-19, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 5.57 million cases to date. Hospital admissions due to Covid have nearly doubled week-on-week in London, the latest figures show. New data from NHS England shows that 386 Covid-19 admissions were recorded by hospitals in London on December 22, up 92% week-on-week and the highest number for a single day since February 1. Across England, 1,246 admissions were recorded on December 22, up 55% week-on-week and the highest number for a single day since February 16. But this is still well below the second wave peak of 4,134 admissions reported on January 12, PA reports. Global airline carriers cancelled more than 3,000 flights over the Christmas weekend, the FlightAware website said, as a spike in Covid-19 cases due to the Omicron variant piled on misery for travellers. The website showed that 2,175 flights around the world had been scrapped on Friday, which is Christmas Eve and a typically heavy day for travel. Around a quarter of those flights were in the U.S.. Another 1,259 Christmas Day flights were called off globally, the website said amid a surge in Covid-19 infections driven by Omicron, Reuters reports. Ministers could meet as soon as Monday to determine whether new restrictions are needed in England over the new year amid growing concerns that soaring Covid cases could hit public services. They will be expected to assess new modelling from the University of Warwick, given to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in documents published on Thursday. Scientists have looked at the effects of a potential return to step 2 restrictions from 28 December or 1 January, lasting either two weeks, four weeks or three months until 28 March. No 10 said the data had not yet been considered by ministers. Protesters in Guadeloupe are occupying the local legislature in the French Caribbean overseas territory, in a new standoff with Paris sparked by Covid rules. There have been tensions in Guadeloupe and the neighbouring island French territory of Martinique during the last weeks over rules including obligatory Covid vaccinations for health workers, which have fed into long-standing local grievances. Protesters first entered the debating chamber of the regional council while it was meeting on Thursday with several staying the night and deciding to continue their action into Friday. Councillors were able to leave peacefully. They want to negotiate with Paris over the crisis, but officials have so far indicated that there can be no talks as long as such actions are carried out, AFP reports. The protesters notably want all sanctions halted against health workers who have refused the Covid jab. There were 1,171 Covid-19 hospital admissions in the UK on 20 December, government figures show. This is up 30% week-on-week and the highest number since 19 February. During the second wave of coronavirus, UK admissions peaked at 4,583 on 12 January, PA reports. Passengers travelling home for Christmas have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 2,000 flights on Friday, according to a flight tracking website FlightAware. One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far. South Africans without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday. Additionally, people in South Africa will be offered a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its used for the general public. France will require passengers to show negative Covid tests to travel to its overseas territories, with the new measure coming into effect on 28 December. The UK Health Security Agency’s chief has suggested the government might decide on whether further restrictions are needed in England based on Omicron’s wider impact, rather than the variant’s severity alone.

Dozens of officials have reportedly been punished over a virus outbreak in the locked-down city of Xi’an, China’s disciplinary body said on Friday, Agence France-Presse reports. That’s all from me for today – thanks for reading along and happy Christmas. I’m handing over to my colleague Nadeem Badshah who will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours. Mark, 44, will be self-isolating on Christmas Day and plans to spend it relaxing. “I’ve got my two cats with me, a pile of books, and probably catching up on a few things on Netflix in bed as well,” the Church of England priest based in Manchester said. Meanwhile, Lauren, 31, from London, stressed that she would try to remember that tomorrow was just a day and that there were better days ahead. My colleague Aamna Mohdin spoke to people who will be stuck in their flats and bedrooms tomorrow about how they’re keeping their spirits up: A quick line from Reuters about the situation in France, which is dealing with a record number of cases: Emmanuel Macron will hold a Covid-19 meeting on Monday, the presidential palace has announced. The meeting, scheduled at 1500 GMT, will be followed immediately after by a cabinet meeting. The number of Christmas Eve shoppers in British city centres has slumped as people stay in to avoid the risk of being infected with the Omicron coronavirus variant, data suggests. Central London was hardest hit, with footfall down 30% compared with Friday last week, and 48% compared with Christmas Eve in 2019, according to data covering morning trading from Springboard. Footfall also fell by 10% week on week in other cities. The government has so far held off on imposing new restrictions on England. However, shopper numbers have fallen dramatically as people avoid crowds to ensure they are able to see family at Christmas. Footfall was lower than Christmas Eve 2019 across high streets, retail parks and shopping centres – although all categories were also stronger than Christmas Eve 2020, when large parts of England were placed in a surprise lockdown and other parts of the UK put restrictions in place. Read the full report, by the Guardian’s financial reporter Jasper Jolly, here: The number of Omicron cases in Scotland has more than doubled, Scottish government figures show, as nearly has the number of people in hospital confirmed to have the new strain, from 24 on Thursday to 42 on Friday. As of 5pm on Thursday, 3,832 confirmed cases were reported, taking the total number of cases of the new variant to 6,154. According to the figures, the increase was caused by a backlog of genotyping results being received by Public Health Scotland that were undertaken in mid-December, PA reports. In total, the number of cases of Covid-19 increased by 7,076 since Thursday. 10 new deaths were also logged, taking Scotland’s overall number of people who died after having first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days to 9,822. There were 536 people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19 on Wednesday, down four on the day before, and 34 people were in intensive care, down four. So far 4,378,172 people have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccination, 4,006,076 have received their second dose, and 2,841,703 have received a third dose or booster. On Friday, national clinical director Jason Leitch urged Scots preparing to meet loved ones for Christmas to be cautious: The Omicron variant is coming, but behaviour and vaccines are keeping it at bay a little. But tomorrow is crucial for that, because if we suddenly throw caution to the wind, then it will find a way to infect individuals who gather. Try and [meet] carefully, test before you meet other people and get yourself vaccinated. A total of 605,561 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were recorded in the UK on Thursday, the lowest daily figure since 13 December. Nearly 32.3m booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with more than 5.9m in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK’s four health agencies. New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that people from Pakistani, Caribbean and African backgrounds have the lowest rates for receiving a booster or third dose of Covid-19 vaccine in England. Figures suggest the lowest take-up of third doses and booster jabs among people aged 50 and over in England was in the Pakistani (42.2%), black Caribbean (44.4%) and black African (45.4%) groups. More than a quarter of people of black Caribbean ethnicity are estimated to not have received a first Covid vaccine dose up to 12 December – the highest proportion of all ethnic groups, the ONS said. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chair at the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: This is deeply worrying because in many ways I fear a repetition of what happened in the first wave, where ... we saw this rather alarming and disturbing disparity in illness and deaths amongst ethnic minorities from Covid. What we know now of course is that the patients, people who are becoming seriously ill, who are being hospitalised, are those who have not been vaccinated and those who have not had their boosters. Eighty percent of patients in some ICUs are those who have not been vaccinated. The ONS also said that take-up was lower among people with disabilities, people living in more deprived areas, those who have never worked or are long-term unemployed, those without qualifications and those who do not own their own home, compared to more advantaged groups. Hello, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be taking over for the next hour while my colleague Clea Skopeliti has a break. Don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have anything to flag you think we should be covering. I’m on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. In the UK, the chief of the Office for National Statistics has said there are “some indications” of people engaging in “safer behaviour” in response to the Omicron wave. However, Sir Ian Diamond told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: “At the moment I think it’s far too early to suggest that we will see anything other than a a continued rise.” Diamond denied being “shaken” by the speed of the rise in cases, saying: “I think we were gearing ourselves up for them”. “But at the same time, clearly they are really big increases, and that’s why it was incredibly important, we felt, to get them out into the public domain as soon as possible.” His comments come after figures showed that 1.7 million people in the UK had Covid last week, including one in 20 people in London. Airlines’ social media feeds have been filled with frustrated passengers asking for assistance after a spate of cancellations on Christmas Eve due to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. More than 2,000 flights were cancelled globally on Friday as the Omicron variant took a toll on airline carriers’ staff. “@Delta really?! You cancel my Christmas Eve flight at 12:30am?? I got up at 2am to get to the airport with my baby and husband and don’t see the cancellation till I’m at the airport to get my bags checked,” one passenger tweeted at the airline on Friday – one of several similar messages directed at carriers that have had to call off flights. There have been 458 cancelled flights within, into, or out of the United States, where Omicron now makes up more than 70% of new Covid cases. Passengers travelling home for Christmas have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 2,000 flights on Friday, according to a flight tracking website. The surge of Christmas Eve cancellations comes as the rapidly spreading Omicron variant means carriers are unable to staff their flights. The bulk of the cancellations came from five firms, with China Eastern cancelling 474 journeys, while Air China scrapped 188. United has cancelled 180 flights, Air India 160 and Delta has called off 127, figures from FlightAware show. At time of writing, the the flight tracking firm said the current number of Christmas Eve flights cancelled globally is 2,031. The figure includes 448 cancelled in the United States, where Omicron now accounts for more than 70% of new cases. “The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation. As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport,” United said on Thursday. Meanwhile, Delta said it has “exhausted all options and resources – including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying – before cancelling around 90 flights for Friday.” The airline attributed the impact of the Omicron variant and weather conditions for the cancellations. In response to the pre-holiday chaos, airlines have called for the relaxation of quarantine rules for vaccinated staff. Delta’s chief executive, Ed Bastian, asked the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to cut the self-isolation period for vaccinated people experiencing breakthrough infections from 10 to five days. Airlines for America and JetBlue have seconded the request. The request comes amid a relaxation of self-isolation rules in England, allowing people to end quarantine after seven days if they test negative on two tests 24 hours apart. Similarly, the CDC in the US cut the isolation period to seven days for asymptomatic people who test negative, but only for health workers. Officials in the north-western Chinese city of Xian are facing punishment after a Covid-19 outbreak led to the lockdown of its 13 million residents. All domestic flights out of Xian and most trains from the city scheduled for Friday were cancelled, while the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said that 26 people were being held accountable for the failure to control the outbreak. Unvaccinated people in the UK should be offered a free taxi ride to their local clinic, the Liberal Democrats have said, adding that hospitals are “largely [filling] with people who are unvaccinated”. The party called for the creation of a “vaccine tracing” service to identify unvaccinated people and offer them an appointment slot, with help to get there if needed. Those who are unable to afford or access public transport should be ferried in a taxi, they said. A similar policy is already in place some parts of the country, including in Manchester. Lib Dem health spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said: “The booster programme is critical to protecting us all against Omicron. But the Ggvernment needs to also step up efforts to persuade and support the unvaccinated to get their jabs, to protect themselves and the NHS in the longer term.” She accused the government of targeting the unvaccinated in a “blame game”, which she said “risks being counterproductive and alienating communities whose trust in this government is already low”. One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far. The figure rises to one in 20 people for London, which has seen the highest number of Omicron cases detected, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data. In Wales, around one in 45 people had Covid that week, while Scotland’s rate was one in 65 and Northern Ireland’s was one in 40. The data includes people who tested positive outside of hospital or a care setting in the week ending 19 December. Russia has reported 24,703 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 horus, Reuters reports. The country has also registered 998 deaths in the same period of time. Unions have raised safety concerns about changes to ambulance staffing as an extra 90 military personnel are drafted in to support Scottish health boards. The contingency plan, first reported by the Courier, would see more ambulances staffed by only one trained medic and a driver, potentially a military one, with breaks also be cut. The Scottish ambulance service insisted the changes would only happen in “times of extremis only”, but GMB Scotland said staff and the public should be worried. The military personnel will help NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Grampian and NHS Lanarkshire from January. Kieran Whitford, a paramedic working in Aberdeen, wrote on Twitter that the changes made staff “feel like we are worth nothing”. People at risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus will have their options for treatment expanded from January after the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first two antiviral pills against Covid. Full report by Eric Berger: South Africans without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday. The move is part of a shift from containment to mitigation measures, with the health ministry changing the rules to require asymptomatic individuals to monitor their symptoms for five to seven days and avoid attending large gatherings after contact with a positive case. Only those who develop symptoms must get tested, the statement continued, adding that those with mild symptoms should isolate for eight days and severe cases for 10 days. The shift also sees the end of quarantine in facilities other than the home. Contact tracing will also be scrapped except in cases like cluster outbreaks. The ministry attributed the change in policy to the following factors: the emergence of highly infectious variants like Omicron; estimates that at least 60% of the population have some protection from vaccination or infection; and new information including on the high level of asymptomatic cases and small number of actual cases diagnosed. France will require passengers to show negative Covid tests to travel to its overseas territories. The new measure will come into effect on 28 December and affect travellers both from mainland France and abroad, the health ministry said. It comes after the country recorded a daily record of 91,608 Covid cases on Thursday (23 December), with Omicron spreading rapidly across the country. Bhutan has begun administering booster vaccine doses to older citizens and priority groups in a bid to fight the spread of the Omicron variant, health ministry officials have said. People aged 65 and above, overseas travellers, health workers, chronically ill people, and all adults living in “high risk” areas were eligible, the officials said. With a vaccine stock exceeding 250,000 doses, Bhutan plans to inoculate more than 228,000 people in a week, according to the Kuensel newspaper. “As we did for the second dose, mix and match is recommended even for the booster, given its higher efficacy,” Sonam Wangchuk, an official of the Royal Centre for Disease Control, told the newspaper. More than 93% of over-12s have been vaccinated with two doses in the nation of some 750,000 people. The kingdom has recorded just three Covid deaths since the pandemic began, while government data shows its tally of infections to stand at 2,659. The Office for National Statistics has the latest figures on take-up of booster doses in England by occupation. Around a third of sports players in England (34.1%) are estimated to have received a booster or third dose of Covid-19 vaccine as of 12 December. Other specific occupations with low take-up of extra doses include plasterers (33.3%), waiters and waitresses (33.4%), chefs (35.0%), bar staff (36.6%), fork-lift truck drivers (37.6%) and vehicle technicians and mechanics (38.2%). The figures may reflect the order in which people became eligible for a booster or third dose of vaccine, with jabs initially prioritised for older and vulnerable people before being extended to younger age groups. Austria should offer a fourth vaccine dose to some healthcare staff and other key workers, the National Vaccination Board has said in the wake of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. However, there was not enough evidence to recommend it for the general public, the board said. “In view of an imminent Omicron wave, (a fourth vaccination) can be offered in high-risk areas (eg exposed healthcare personnel) and in systemically critical areas from six months after the third vaccination,” the board said. It comes after Austria on Wednesday announced it would bolster restrictions once more from 27 December to deal with the rising tide of Omicron cases. Several hundred have been identified so far in the country, which had its fourth lockdown in November. Updating its guidelines, the board said that fourth shots could be given “off label” to some groups of key workers following medical consultation. “There is still no evidence that this additional vaccination can prevent infections. However, it can be it can be assumed that serious illnesses can be prevented,” it said. The UK Health Security Agency’s chief has suggested the government might decide on whether further restrictions are needed in England based on Omicron’s wider impact, rather than the variant’s severity alone. The risk of hospitalisation is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta, according to the first UK government study of its kind. Monday is expected to be the first day the government could consider any further restrictions after Boris Johnson said no further measures would be brought in before Christmas. Asked whether the government will have the information on Monday to make key decisions, Dr Jenny Harries told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Ministers will look at all of the data that we have available - and that isn’t simply what the epidemiology is saying, it’s how it’s impacting society. “So, for example, we have very high rates of individuals off sick - we know that particularly in London, around one in 35 have currently got Omicron. “Now that’s having an impact on the workforce. So these are not simply about hospitalisation rates.” She added that ministers are being kept updated on a daily basis and that will continue throughout the Christmas period. “I don’t think we do know yet that this is going to be a significantly less serious disease for the population – the older population – that we are normally most concerned about in relation to serious disease and death.” NHS staff are struggling with a “very, very depleted workforce”, the head of the Royal College of Nursing has warned, saying that staff want a course of action that allows them to care for patients safely. Pat Cullen told BBC Breakfast that nurses and other healthcare workers are “quite ill from the spin-off with Covid”. “[They] continue to be simply because their internal and personal resources are low going into this because of the number of hours that they’re working and the shifts they’ve been working on a very, very depleted workforce working in a fragile service leading up to this current wave,” she said. Cullen said staff want leaders to act to “support the health service” in order to allow them to “care for their patients safely … If that means tighter measures, that’s for political leaders to decide based on the scientific evidence.” People in South Africa will be offered a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its used for the general public. While both J&amp;J and Pfizer’s vaccines had been approved for use as boosters, they had previously only been offered to health workers. “From 24 December 2021 the National Vaccination Programme will provide J&amp;J booster vaccinations to anyone who received their last dose at least 2 months prior,” the health department’s statement said, adding ideally it would also be within six months of their initial shot. Meanwhile, people who had their second Pfizer dose at least six months ago will be able to get a booster dose of the vaccine from 28 December. According to figures from earlier this month, 44% of South African adults have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine – a figure well shy of the country’s target. While Mongolia’s vaccine take-up was excellent for the first two doses, the country’s booster drive has lagged behind. More than 90% of adults in the sparsely-populated nation of three million took up their initial vaccine doses, but only half of this figure have had the booster so far, due to a combination of online misinformation and the difficulties of reaching remote populations, according to AFP. About one-third of the country is nomadic. In order to bring up the country’s booster coverage, health workers are travelling to remote areas to offer herders a third vaccine dose. “During the first wave, people were queuing outside (for vaccines) and I was working until 9pm,” said nurse Sodkhuu Galbadrakh. “There were days I didn’t go home. Now, only five to six people come to get the booster shot per day.” He said he calls herders daily to try and arrange the third shot but often can’t get through, especially with poor phone reception in pastureland. However, Batbayar Ochirbat, the official leading the vaccination programme, told AFP that confidence in the booster is slowly growing after a fall in cases. After daily cases reached more than 3,000 in September, figures have fallen to an average of 200 daily cases, which he attributes partly to boosters. “People started to build trust after they saw vaccinated people have booster shots, develop no symptoms, and not get sick,” he said. The UK government’s chief scientific adviser has defended Sage against the charges that the group’s modelling was fearmongering, saying it was not their job to “spread gloom”. Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not the responsibility of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) “to take a particular policy stance or to either spread gloom or give Panglossian optimism”. The remarks followed criticism of epidemiological modellers’ response to the Omicron outbreak. In a piece for the Times, Vallance said those participating in the debate “need to consider all the data in the round, not only those parts that fit an argument while ignoring the rest”. “That is not science, even though it might sometimes make an entertaining read,” he said. Instead, he wrote, science must be “self-correcting”. It comes after a statement from the SPI-M-O, a group of scientists who report to Sage, warned last week that hospitalisations could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day and deaths at between 600 and 6,000 if no new restrictions were introduced. Two people have died in a fire in the the intensive care unit of a Russian Covid-19 hospital in the southern city of Astrakhan, according to the Tass news agency. Russia’s emergencies ministry said in a statement that there were casualties, but gave no further details. Investigators said they have launched an investigation into the case. A number of Russian hospitals have dealt with accidental fires since the onset of the pandemic, chiefly due to ageing infrastructure and low safety standards, AFP reports. In August, nine coronavirus patients died after an oxygen pipe ruptured at a hospital in Vladikavkaz.

Dozens of officials have reportedly been punished over a virus outbreak in the locked-down city of Xi’an, China’s disciplinary body said on Friday, Agence France-Presse reports. China is on high alert for new infections as it prepares to hold the Winter Olympics in February in the capital Beijing and is continuing to pursue a strict zero-Covid approach. Xi’an recently plunged into a strict lockdown where its 13 million residents have been told to stay home from Thursday, shuttering businesses and launching several rounds of mass testing. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on Friday that 26 Communist party officials had been punished for “insufficient rigour in preventing and controlling the outbreak”. Chinese officials who are deemed to have failed at controlling the virus in their region are regularly sacked or reprimanded. The statement said inspections had revealed there had been a lax approach to testing and an uncoordinated response that hindered contact tracing in Xi’an. Authorities would clamp down on “bureaucratic issues in disease control work such as shirking responsibility, not taking action, passing the buck and dealing with things in a negative way”, a party discipline official said. Thailand has reported its first domestic cluster of coronavirus infections from the Omicron variant in Kalasin province in northeastern Thailand, officials said on Friday, Reuters news agency reports. “From the Kalasin cluster, there are 21 new infections,” said the country’s Covid-19 taskforce spokeswoman, Apisamai Srirangsan. The infections stem from a couple who travelled from Belgium through the country’s Test &amp; Go scheme that waived quarantine for vaccinated arrivals, she said. Both had tested negative for infections before travelling and after arrival in Thailand in early December. By 15 December, they started having symptoms and tested positive and were later confirmed to have the Omicron variant, she said. The announcement comes as Thailand’s capital city Bangkok cancelled government-sponsored New Year activity, including midnight prayers. Fireworks and countdown events organised by malls were still going forward and would require proof of vaccination and antigen test results. If you’ve just joined us welcome to our live Covid blog covering all the latest coronavirus developments. Here’s a brief snapshot of how Covid is unfolding around the world ahead of the holiday season. Boris Johnson has invoked the teaching of Jesus Christ to urge the public to get a Covid booster jab. In a recent video, he celebrated members of the public for “getting jabbed not just for themselves, for ourselves, but for friends and family and everyone we meet … That, after all, is the teaching of Jesus Christ, whose birth is at the heart of this enormous festival – that we should love our neighbours as we love ourselves.” NHS England has said there are 200,000 vaccination appointments available on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day and urged anybody due a booster to consider coming forward “to get the gift of a jab”. In England around 1.2 million people were infected with Covid last week, or one in 45 of the population – a pandemic record. London estimated one in 30 people were infected last week. Airlines in the US and Australia have announced cancellations to hundreds of flights ahead of Christmas. Australia cuts the Covid booster interval to four months after their second dose, then the wait will be shortened again. Ecuador has declared Covid vaccination will be mandatory after a marked rise of infections. New York City will scale back New Year’s Eve celebrations after mayor Bill de Blasio announced new restrictions for the city’s planned event in Times Square. An Oxford University lab study on AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the Delta variant after two doses. Italy is planning to tighten restrictions including making mask wearing mandatory outdoors. The country has also banned public New Year’s Eve celebrations. The Spanish region of Catalonia will introduce a night curfew on Thursday. Nightclubs in Scotland are to close from 27 December for three weeks. Denmark will require foreigners entering the country to provide a negative Covid-19 test from 27 December, regardless of vaccination status NHS England has said there are 200,000 vaccination appointments available on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day and urged anybody due a booster to consider coming forward “to get the gift of a jab”. Staff and volunteers will continue to deliver jabs in some locations on 25 and 26 December, as the NHS tries to meet Boris Johnson’s target of giving everybody eligible a booster by the end of the year amid a surge in the number of Covid cases. Vaccination centres that were open “over the festive period” included Redbridge town hall in north-east London from 10am to 5.50pm and Grim’s Dyke golf club in Pinner, Middlesex, the NHS said. Walk-in appointments can be obtained in Eastbourne, Dewsbury and Hartlepool. Dr Emily Lawson, the head of the NHS Covid vaccination programme, praised those willing to work over the Christmas weekend and argued that people should consider getting a booster as a last-minute present to family members. Hello, it’s Samantha Lock with you on the blog this Christmas Eve. I hope everyone is well. I’ll be bringing you all the latest Covid developments from across the world. In some disappointing news for those wanting to visit family and friends over the holidays, airlines in the US and Australia have announced cancellations to hundreds of flights ahead of Christmas. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines say they have been forced to cancel dozens of Christmas Eve flights due to Covid’s toll on its flight crews and other workers. United cancelled 120 flights for Friday, while Atlanta-based Delta said it has cancelled about 90 flights, Reuters reports. Meanwhile, thousands of Australians have also had their domestic flights cancelled in the hours leading up to Christmas, as frontline staff were ordered to test and isolate amid a rise in Covid cases. There were 117 domestic services cancelled on Friday between Sydney and Melbourne. An Oxford University lab study on AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the Delta variant after two doses. “As we better understand Omicron, we believe we will find that T-cell response provides durable protection against severe disease and hospitalisations,” Mene Pangalos, the head of AstraZeneca’s biopharmaceuticals R&amp;D said, referring to a critical component of the immune system that respond to fight infection. Here’s a story that echoes the cancellation of flights happening over the US. Thousands of Australians have had their domestic flights cancelled in the hours leading up to Christmas, as frontline staff were ordered to test and isolate amid a rise in Covid cases. There were 117 domestic services cancelled on Friday between Sydney and Melbourne. A Sydney airport spokesperson told Guardian Australia that 80 of the 500 domestic services scheduled to arrive and depart Sydney on Friday had been cancelled. Many flights cancelled on Friday are Jetstar services, with the airline unable to staff all of its planned services because employees were sidelined due to Covid testing and isolation requirements.

The south-east Asian country has seen a surge in daily infections since it lifted most of its movement restrictions in October, but has not reported any cases of the Omicron variant. “The Covid-19 situation has been evolving in a complicated manner recently, with a rising trend in new infections,” the ministry said in a statement. The country reported 16,377 infections on Thursday, raising its overall caseload to 1.6 million, with 30,500 deaths. More than 62% of its population of 98 million have received at least two vaccine shots. Australians will soon be able to access Covid-19 vaccine booster shots four months after their second dose, then the wait will be shortened again. The government has said the minimum interval will be cut from five to four months on 4 January, and reduced to three months on 31 January. The move, announced on Friday, follows calls from state premiers to speed up the shots to better protect against the more infectious Omicron variant. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation said maximising booster coverage – if combined with “enhanced public health and social measures” – may prevent a large surge in case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths. Read the full story here. South Korea has just released its daily Covid report. The east Asian nation reported another 6,233 confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, according to data released by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The figure is a slight drop on the 6,919 cases reported the day before. A further 56 deaths were also recorded – a significant drop on yesterdays record high of 109 deaths. A record number of 1,084 people have been admitted to hospital with serious symptoms and in critical condition. A controversial New Zealand scheme that offers visas to wealthy foreign investors has resumed operating after a year’s hiatus due to the pandemic, prompting concern from overseas New Zealanders who fear it will place additional strain on the country’s overburdened managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) system. Martin Newell, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Grounded Kiwis, said the scheme’s resumption would prompt “disbelief” among New Zealanders overseas, who may lose out on MIQ spots to the investors. “The government is abandoning the needs of its citizens in favour of those who have enough money to be able to buy their way into the country.” Read the full story from our reporter Pete McKenzie in Wellington here. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines say they have been forced to cancel dozens of Christmas Eve flights due to Covid’s toll on its flight crews and other workers. United cancelled 120 flights for Friday, while Atlanta-based Delta said it has cancelled about 90 flights, Reuters reports. Both said they were working to contact passengers so they would not be stranded at airports. United said: The nationwide spike in Omicron cases this week has had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation. As a result, we’ve unfortunately had to cancel some flights and are notifying impacted customers in advance of them coming to the airport.” Delta said it has “exhausted all options and resources - including rerouting and substitutions of aircraft and crews to cover scheduled flying - before cancelling around 90 flights for Friday. Delta cited potential inclement weather and the impact of the Omicron variant for the cancellations. On Tuesday, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian asked the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to shrink quarantine guidelines for fully vaccinated individuals who experience breakthrough Covid-19 infections, citing the impact on the carrier’s workforce. Bastian asked that the isolation period be cut to five days from the current 10. That request was echoed both by Airlines for America, a trade group representing major cargo and passenger carriers, which wrote to the CDC on Thursday, and by JetBlue on Wednesday. China is reporting 87 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Thursday, 23 December. The figure is a slight decrease from 100 reported a day earlier, its health authority said on Friday. Of the new infections, 55 were locally transmitted, including 49 in the northern city of Xi’an currently under lockdown, according to a statement by the National Health Commission, compared with 71 from a day earlier. China reported 26 new asymptomatic cases, which it classifies separately from confirmed cases, up from 19 a day earlier. There were no new deaths, leaving the death toll at 4,636. Mainland China had 100,731 confirmed cases as of 23 December. Ecuador has declared Covid vaccination will be mandatory after a marked rise of infections and the arrival of new variants of the disease. The government said Thursday that only Ecuadorians with a medical condition that could be complicated by vaccination will be exempt. Those people must provide documentation. Officials say the order comes because of an increase in coronavirus infections and the circulation of new variants such as omicron. Ecuador says it has enough vaccines to immunise the entire population. As of Tuesday, about 77% of Ecuador’s 17.3 million people had been vaccinated. About 33,600 people in Ecuador have died from Covid. Earlier this week, the body overseeing health policies to combat the pandemic decreed that vaccination certificates must be shown to enter restaurants, cinemas and other public areas. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has announced new restrictions for the city’s planned New Year’s Eve event in Times Square. Viewing areas that normally accommodate about 58,000 people will be limited to about 15,000 to allow for more distancing, and everyone in attendance must show proof of vaccination and wear a mask. “There is a lot to celebrate and these additional safety measures will keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year,” de Blasio said. On Wednesday, the city set another record with 22,808 new Covid cases, though a true comparison is difficult due to discrepancies in tests available. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog this Christmas Eve. I’ll be bringing you all the latest Covid developments from across the world. Let’s start with the news that New Year’s Eve plans in New York will be scaled back amid fears of a surge in Covid cases. The annual celebration will still go ahead as planned although the number of attendees has been slashed. Several countries including Greece, Italy and Malta have also scrapped planned New Year’s Eve events. An Oxford University lab study on AstraZeneca’s vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the Delta variant after two doses. “As we better understand Omicron, we believe we will find that T-cell response provides durable protection against severe disease and hospitalisations,” Mene Pangalos, the head of AstraZeneca’s biopharmaceuticals R&amp;D said, referring to a critical component of the immune system that respond to fight infection. Here’s a run-down of all the Covid news you may have missed: Europe In England around 1.2 million people were infected with Covid last week, or 1 in 45 of the population - a pandemic record. London estimated 1 in 30 people were infected last week. UK health secretary Sajid Javid says there will be no further announcements on Covid restrictions in England before Christmas. Germany’s health minister said he expects a surge in coronavirus cases around new year and people will probably need a fourth vaccine shot. Germany also confirmed the country’s first death due to the Omicron variant. Greece banned public Christmas and New Year’s Eve festivities and mandated mask-wearing in open spaces. The measures will come into effect on Friday morning. Italy is planning to tighten restrictions including making mask wearing mandatory outdoors. The country has also banned public New Year’s Eve celebrations. Malta will ban all events where attendees are standing not seated, except weddings and funerals, from 27 December. Nightclubs in Scotland are to close from 27 December for three weeks. Denmark will require foreigners entering the country to provide a negative Covid-19 test from 27 December, regardless of vaccination status. Montenegro’s president, Milo Djukanović, tested positive for Covid-19 after being in contact with an infected person. The Spanish region of Catalonia will introduce a night curfew on Thursday. United States Emergency Covid testing sites are being set up in hard-hit areas across the US. The US Supreme court will hold a special session on Biden’s nationwide vaccine-or-testing Covid mandate for large businesses and a separate vaccine requirement for healthcare workers. The US Food and Drug Administration authorised Merck’s antiviral pill, molnupiravir, for Covid-19, after giving the go-ahead to a similar treatment from Pfizer a day earlier. Asia China locks down 13 million people in Xi’an after detecting 127 Covid cases. All residents are barred from leaving their houses except to buy living necessities every other day or for emergencies. Organisers of the Beijing Winter Olympics said they expect a “certain number” of Covid-19 cases in China due to foreigners arriving for the Games. South Korea set a new record for Covid deaths on Thursday. Australia reintroduced Covid curbs such as mandated mask wearing indoors, capacity limits and QR code check-ins to cover most of the population on Thursday as daily infections hit a fresh record. Australia will also shorten the interval for people to receive their booster shots to four months from five from 4 January. South America: Ecuador is making vaccination against the coronavirus mandatory. Middle East Covid infections are rising again across the six Gulf Arab states after months of low or falling figures."

          "headline": "In spite of Omicron, Britain’s schools must remain open",
          "bodyText": "We still don’t know how severe the Omicron wave will be, and debates are raging about closing nightclubs, alcohol curfews and work-from-home guidance. It can sometimes feel like last Christmas all over again. But one decision should be clear. Given the tools and knowledge we have now, school closures should be off the table. Why were schools closed at all in previous lockdowns? The best approach was to minimise risk, given the limited knowledge about Covid-19 transmission and with no vaccination available to protect against severe health outcomes and death. Concerns about many different groups factored into policy decisions on schools. The first concern was the risk to teachers and school workers such as cleaners and security guards being in an environment where they could contract Covid-19 during their working day. Then there was risk to family members, particularly grandparents and vulnerable parents, of children first contracting Covid-19 at school and then bringing it home to their households. There was also the risk to children themselves of contracting Covid-19 at school; the concern for children was less about severe outcomes and death, and more about long Covid and potential long-term health impacts. The final concern was modelling data that suggested that schools being open led to wider overall societal mixing, and a greater number of contacts per person, which could increase the R number and drive exponential growth in transmission levels. But vaccines, testing and knowledge on how to manage Covid-19 transmission have radically altered all of the previous considerations. We now have safe vaccines that are effective at reducing the severe health outcomes of Covid-19, especially with boosters for over-18s. It is positive news that the JCVI has supported vaccinating at-risk children aged between five and 11 and those living with immunocompromised people. However, the UK is again out of line with other countries, many of which opened up vaccination to all children in that age group some months ago. We know that we can reduce transmission in indoor settings such as schools through good ventilation and air-filtration systems: this can range from opening windows to allow a breeze through classrooms and hallways to HEPA filters that completely clean the air several times in an hour. And rapid at-home lateral-flow testing is a simple, quick way of identifying infectious individuals and ensuring they stay out of the school environment until they’re past the infectious period. Probably the biggest impact on slowing Covid-19 spread and breaking chains of transmission is to have infectious individuals isolate and not pass on Covid-19 to anyone else. The UK has led in offering free at-home testing to teachers, school staff and pupils, and that is seen as one of the factors in slowing spread within schools. We also now have concrete evidence on the harms of children being out of school, which we must balance against the risk of harms from Covid. While some cling to the idealised version of online learning with middle-class children with devoted parents sitting next to them teaching with fast broadband and a laptop per child at home, this isn’t the reality for most children, especially those in low-income households. Access to devices such as computers and tablets, and the internet – and having parents with enough free time to support students – are not guaranteed. Children may also have to do work within the household, for example taking care of younger siblings. And they may have to figure out how to set up the technology themselves if they are in households where parents are working outside or absent. In short, virtual learning works for rich families, but not for poor people. This is not just about educational attainment. In-person schooling is also about providing children with a safe, heated space during the day, food, books, outdoor play areas and access to adults trained in teaching and interacting with children. School closures also lead to a loss of play and social interaction, they’re associated with increased domestic abuse, a decrease in physical activity, delayed access to paediatric care, and more mental health issues. Whatever Covid-19 control measures are discussed, school closures should be off the table. Home or remote schooling just doesn’t work and shouldn’t be seen as an acceptable outcome for children. The risks from Covid are better known, and we have more tools to fight it. So instead of closing schools, we need to focus on improving the protections we now have: better vaccination coverage, ventilation and filtration of the air, and identifying infectious individuals with rapid testing. Now is the time to start making plans for schools as essential societal infrastructure, just as hospitals, supermarkets and other essential institutions stayed open even during the strictest lockdown measures.

          "bodyText": "That’s all for today. Hope you have a lovely festive break, and that Santa pays his traditional visit (although he didn’t linger long in the London stock market today!). Here are today’s stories: Merry Christmas! GW Last-minute shopper numbers are sharply down on their pre-pandemic levels today, although retailers are busier than last year. Data analysts Springboard report that retail footfall this morning was 21% lower than on Christmas Eve 2019, just before the pandemic, showing the impact of the omicron variant on retailers. But it’s 30% busier than Christmas Eve 2020 when non-essential shops in parts of the country had been forced to close, and vaccines hadn’t yet been rolled out. Retail footfall up to noon was 13.9% higher than a week ago. But struggling high streets have only seen a 6.7% weekly jump, while retail parks are 23.6% busier and shopping centres have nearly 20% more customers. Footfall in Central London has plunged by 30% week-on-week, reflecting that many more office workers are at home, perhaps cutting their social contact ahead of Christmas Day meet-ups. In city centres outside London, footfall was 10% lower than last week. Springboard says: The increased activity in retail parks today will in part be due to trips for food and grocery products as the majority of retail parks have a food store. However, since the start of Covid, retail parks has consistently been more resilient in retaining shoppers as they are large open spaces, with large stores which make shoppers feel safer and less nervous. Their shopper numbers throughout this period have been boosted by the presence of food stores, as despite the growth of online food shopping, it only peaked at 11% of total retail spend and is now at around 10%. The UK’s benchmark stock market index hit a 22-month high on Friday, coming within touching distance of the levels seen in February 2020 just before stock markets around the world were sent into a tailspin by the first European lockdown, my colleague Jasper Jolly reports. The FTSE 100 hit an intra-day high of 7,403.65 points – surpassing the previous post-lockdown high that it hit last month – before slipping back one point to close at a Christmas Eve loss. Traders on the London Stock Exchange downed tools at 12:30pm on Friday to mark Christmas Eve, while exchanges across much of Europe were closed. Markets have been boosted in recent days by data suggesting that the latest variant of concern, Omicron, is not as severe as previously thought. British Airways owner International Airlines Group was among the biggest gainers, up 1.9%, while hotels group Intercontinental also edged up by 1.2% – both are particularly sensitive to pandemic restrictions. The cautious optimism around Omicron has helped the FTSE 100 to gain 4.4% so far during December. That would be its best month since November 2020, when news of Pfizer’s first successful vaccine prompted a global rally. The morning rally left the FTSE just shy of its closing point on Friday 21 February 2020 of 7,403.92 – the day Italy imposed a lockdown in the regions of Lombardy and Padua, sending markets around the world plummeting when they reopened the next Monday. The value of the FTSE 100 companies dropped by £62bn that day. Investors look out for a “Santa rally” on markets at the end of the year, as the low volumes combine with other factors that may include end-of-year portfolio adjustments. The S&amp;P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark, appeared to catch that mood with a fresh record high on Thursday, although the positive sentiment faded on the FTSE 100 on Friday. Some late news: asset management group Apollo is acquiring UK housebuilder Miller Homes, which builds family homes in England and Scotland. They’ve struck a deal to buy Miller from current owner Bridgepoint Group. Financial terms aren’t disclosed. Miller is on track for a record 2021; it builds approximately 4,000 homes a year across nine regions and hopes to grow to 6,000 per year. The government is planning to send out a UK-wide mobile alert urging the public to get a Covid booster, a move mobile operators fear could spark a backlash from customers opposed to vaccinations, my colleague Mark Sweney reports. The UK’s biggest mobile operators – EE, O2, Vodafone and Three UK – have been asked by the government to send a message on Boxing Day. The campaign, in which mobile operators would send a message on behalf of the government to their tens of millions of customers, is understood to have not yet been given final signoff. The message is likely to be on behalf of the NHS, with the text encouraging all adults to get an additional vaccination. The proposed copy of the text message will say: “Get boosted now. Every adult needs a Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against Omicron. Get your Covid-19 vaccine or booster. See NHS website for details.” It is understood that the mobile operators will all enable the message to be sent, but some are agreeing with reluctance given the highly politicised nature of the vaccination programme. “Operators feel a little nervous about angering some customers because it is such a heated issue,” a telecoms industry source said. “We will make it happen, but don’t want those who don’t agree with the message to blame us.” Here’s the full story: The London stock market is now closed until next Wednesday (the Christmas Day and Boxing Day holidays will be marked on Monday and Tuesday). And despite slipping back in late trading, the FTSE 100 could still post its best month in just over a year. Here’s Reuters take: Shares of heavyweight banks including HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered and Lloyds Group have all benefited after the Bank of England raised its interest rate to 0.25% from a record low of 0.1% (last week) for the first time since the pandemic. “The FTSE 100 has not had as stellar a year as some, but the recovery of 7,400 today puts it in good stead for the year ahead,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group. “A run at the pre-pandemic highs could still be possible if Omicron concerns can be kept under control and earnings continue to recover in the fashion they have throughout 2021.” The mid-cap index was subdued at the close on Friday but logged its strongest week since early August, as travel and leisure stocks rose strongly in December. Here’s a chart showing the wild swing in European gas prices this week: The fabled Santa Rally didn’t hold across the channel either. France’s CAC index of the 40 largest listed companies in Paris fell 0.3%, away from the record highs set in November. Amsterdam’s AEX index lost 0.2%, while other bourses were already on holiday for Christmas..... We’re into the closing stock market auction.... and the rally has rather fizzled out. The FTSE 100 index has dropped back from this morning’s 22-month high, to close 1 point lower at 7372 points. That’s a bit of an anticlimax, after the blue-chip index was on the brink of recovering all its losses since the crash that began on 24th February 2020. More companies rose than fell today (55 vs 42, with three unchanged), but heavyweight stocks such as miners Antofagasta and BHP Group lost ground in a quiet session. But, travel and hospitality stocks did still strengthen, amid speculation that further pandemic restrictions may be avoided if Omicron proves to be milder than Delta. Airline group IAG rose 1.86%, and Premier Inns owner Whitbread gained 1.2%. Among smaller companies on the FTSE 250 index, holiday firm TUI jumped over 4%, easyJet gained 1.9%, and cruise group Carnival picked up 2.3%. The Christmas spirit is slipping away in the City.. with the FTSE 100 dipping back from its earlier 22-month high. It’s now up just 8 points on the day, or 0.1%, around 7381 points, with the half-day session nearly over. There is some relief for energy suppliers and users - gas prices have dropped back from their record highs today. The day-ahead UK gas prices has dropped by 18% to 246p per therm, having hit 457p per therm on Tuesday. That’s still unusually high (the contract was around 60 per therm back in January), but might take some of the pressure off. European gas prices have also dropped sharply today, with the benchmark contract for delivery in the first quarter of 2022 down 20%. The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices. The energy industry believes the crisis, during which more than 26 energy suppliers have gone bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. More here: The FTSE 100 has now hit its highest level since the markets began to crash in late February 2020. The blue-chip index has touched 7403.65 points, a new 22-month high. That’s just over the previous pandemic high set in November 2021, in today’s thin pre-Christmas trading. It’s a broad rally, with 75 of the hundred companies on the index up today. Travel and hospitality companies are still doing well, with InterContinental Hotels (+2%) now the top riser. Stock markets in Europe and Asia have cemented gains in light holiday trade today, while the safe-haven dollar eased on signs the Omicron variant would not significantly derail global economic growth, Reuters reports. The greenback was set for its worst week in four months while other risk-friendly assets from bitcoin to the Australian dollar held onto their recent gains, buoyed by ebbing concerns over the severity of the new Covid-19 variant. A top European equity benchmark hovered around one month highs after a week of gains and the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1%, after a record closing high for the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday. Even though it is highly infectious, studies have shown how Omicron is less severe than the Delta strain, fuelling optimism about a limited fallout from new restrictions, and setting the MSCI world equity index for a 2% weekly gain. Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan, said: “The most popular motivation (for the rally) is the growing perception that Omicron is less lethal. This certainty helped risk appetite return, but self-fulfilling expectations of Christmas rallies and reduced liquidity also came in play.” “I still think the news on Omicron is good, but not as good as the market is taking it. So it really depends on how much the contagions will fly.” The FTSE 100 is currently on track for its best month in just over a year. The blue-chip index has gained 4.8% during December, as stocks recovered from their slump in late November when Omicron fears first rocked markets. That would be its best month since November 2020, when news of Pfizer’s successful vaccine prompted a global rally. Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarket, says investors should use the long weekend to assess the risks facing the economy and markets. Chief among those risks are high levels of inflation and potentially weaker economic growth, owing to the rapid spread of omicron triggering waves of restrictions around the world. Judging by the stock market rally this week, it appears as though investors are still confident that the ongoing recovery from the pandemic recession can survive the omicron wave. Sentiment has been lifted by several scientific studies showing that omicron is less severe than previous mutations. The new variant has also introduced a new element of uncertainty as to whether central banks will be able to follow up with more rate rises if the economic recovery falters. Cities are attracting more property hunters with demand for flats outstripping that of houses in the autumn, the latest sign that the pandemic-fuelled “race for space” could be waning. UK property prices hit record levels during the pandemic as factors including the rise of home and flexible working fuelled a buying boom outside cities. However, as staff returned to offices with flexible and hybrid working patterns through the autumn – prior to the emergence of Omicron – interest in flats has surged. “When the housing market reopened in May, there was an immediate rush for room from buyers to look farther afield from the capital,” said Tim Bannister, the director of property data at the property portal Rightmove. “However, in recent months we’ve seen higher demand to live near London, with buyer inquiries returning towards pre-pandemic levels. This is happening quicker than some will have anticipated, and is likely driven by many businesses encouraging a hybrid, rather than fully remote working model.” Rightmove said that flats have become the most in-demand property type among prospective buyers, supplanting the popularity of houses throughout the pandemic. More here: Holiday firm TUI (+3%), cruise operator Carnival (+2.8%) and budget airline easyJet (+2%) are also higher this morning, after several research studies this week suggested the effects of the Omicron coronavirus variant were less severe than Delta. But, experts have warned that this may make no change in the level of infection, due to the surge in Omicron cases. My colleague Richard Adams explains: In the UK, the huge surge in cases – with another 119,789 new infections reported on Thursday – means that even if only a small proportion of people with Covid need to attend hospital, it could cause difficulties for the NHS. Mark Woolhouse, a professor at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Scotland study, said the weight of new research meant that projections would be less pessimistic, although Omicron’s rapid spread meant there were still dangers ahead. “It’s good but it doesn’t get us out of the woods. Severity of infection is clearly very important but it is only one factor in terms of the public health burden,” Woolhouse said, speaking in a personal capacity. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that trading volumes are rather thin this morning, with many investors clocking off for Christmas: “With US, German, Italian and Swiss markets closed, the FTSE 100 has opened with a small move to the upside amid much thinner than normal volumes as the festive week rounds up and on risk-on sentiment. The UK index is enjoying its fourth day of gains, trading at six-week highs and inching closer to the next major resistance hurdle at 7,400. It is better late than never for the Santa rally, which helped drive gains for US indices yesterday with the S&amp;P 500 closing at a record high up 2.27% on the week while tech outperformed with the Nasdaq closing the week up 3.19%.” Stocks are creeping higher in London, lifting the FTSE 100 nearer to its pandemic high. The blue-chip index is now up 21 points, or 0.3%, at 7394 - putting November’s 20-month high of 7402.68 points in sight. The Footsie, which contains the hundred largest companies listed in London, has rallied by over 14% this year, helped by hopes of economic recovery from the pandemic. But it’s still below its pre-Covid levels, unlike US and other European indices, as the FTSE 100 suffers from a lack of major tech companies listed in the City. Pharmaceuticals group Hikma (+1.8%) is now the top riser, followed by BA parent company IAG (+1.7%), online grocery business Ocado (+1.5%), and Premier Inns owner Whitbread. Tiz the season...to test your knowledge with the Guardian’s Business Christmas Quiz. Good luck! Consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser has agreed the sale of skincare brand E45 for £200m, as it shifts its focus to higher growth areas. The Slough-based company, which also owns brand including Dettol and Durex, told investors this morning that it is set to sell the business to Swedish group Karo Pharma. E45 cream, which can soothe dry and itching skin and help with eczema, was created in 1952 by Reckitt subsidiary Crookes Healthcare and was initially only available in hospitals. Increased demand and positive results saw the brand move into traditional retail. In the financial year to December 2020, the E45 brand and related sub-brands had a combined net revenue of £43m. The proposed sale is the latest move by Reckitt to shake up its portfolio in a bid to focus on higher growth areas of its operations. Earlier this year it sold its infant formula and child nutrition business in China and its Scholl foot treatment brand. Reckitt benefitted from higher sales of Strepsils and Nurofen this autumn, as the lifting of global lockdowns led to more people catching coughs, colds and flu. But it has also been hit by rising costs due to the supply chain inflation. It’s not much of a rally.. but the UK’s blue-chip shares have opened a little higher in today’s shortened session. The FTSE 100 is up 7 points, or 0.1%, at 7380 points, nudging towards November’s 21-month highs. Airline group IAG, which owns British Airways, is the top riser, up 1.6%, with conference organiser Informa rising 1% and hotel operator Whitbread 0.9% higher. The Selfridges deal is the latest instalment of a rollercoaster history for the brand founded by a retail legend, our retail correspondent Sarah Butler writes: After more than 20 years rising through the ranks of the Marshall Field’s store in Chicago, in 1906 the US entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge arrived in the UK with one intention: to found a great department store. By some accounts, he was tempted to the UK by Liverpudlian Samuel J Waring Jr, who had built up a string of furnishings stores in London and wanted someone to run a neighbouring shop to his new Waring and Gillow outlet on Oxford Street. It was initially intended to be called Selfridge-Waring store, but Selfridge took control when his partner hit financial difficulties and the new store opened in March 1909 under his name alone. From the start, Selfridge embraced retail theatre and was determined his store would be “a civic centre, where friends can meet and buying is only a secondary consideration”. On the opening day, which drew enormous crowds, the store dazzled shoppers with live music, abundant floral displays and copious lighting in its airy halls. The store sold a huge range of goods but, out of respect for his early business partner, not food or furnishings. It housed a library, a rest room for ladies, a picture gallery and a restaurant linked to a roof garden. Selfridges set a new benchmark for UK department stores, ditching the tradition of housing staff above the shop and opting for large modern window displays more akin to advertising than the practice of piling up as many goods as possible. When the store was awarded one of English Heritage’s blue plaques in 2003, the charity said: “It is largely thanks to Selfridge that Oxford Street remains the commercial heart of the West End.”. More here: The big news of the morning is that Selfridges, the UK-based department store chain, has been acquired in a £4bn deal by Thai conglomerate Central Group and Signa, an Austrian real estate group. The deal will see the return of the luxury department store’s former boss Vittorio Radice. The firms have bought the group from Canada’s Weston family, and are thought to have beaten off rival bids from the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns Harrods, and Lane Crawford, a Hong Kong-based department store owner. The Thai group, which began with one store in Bangkok run by Tiang Chirathivat in the 1950s, last year listed part of the business on the Thai stock exchange, and has other interests in convenience stores, shopping centres and hotels. Signa is owned and run by René Benko, one of Austria’s richest men. The deal with the Westons includes Selfridges’ four UK stores – in London, Birmingham and two in Manchester – as well as Brown Thomas and Arnotts in Ireland and De Bijenkorf in the Netherlands. It also covers about £2bn of the chain’s prime property assets, including the freehold of its listed Oxford Street flagship store in London. Here’s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Just one trading day in the City until Christmas, and investors are straining to see signs of the fabled Santa Rally. US stocks rallied last night, as traders took heart from mounting evidence that the Omicron variant of coronavirus is milder. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high - it’s 68th this year - and European markets staged their own rally on Thursday. As Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, told Morningstar: “Today, it is about economic optimism that this variant is not going to be as bad as delta and original virus.” Last night, a UK government study showed that the risk of being admitted to hospital is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta. Australia’s share market has joined the festive cheer, with the ASX index rising 0.4% in the Christmas Eve session, with financial stocks, mining and gas companies and tech among the gainers. The markets have a habit of rallying around Christmas time (news depending...), and Jeffrey Halley of OANDA says it has arrived: Thankfully, reporters have stopped asking me if we will get a Santa Claus rally in stock markets, as it has well and truly arrived. Wall Street rose again overnight after a strong procession on US data and markets convincing themselves even more, that omicron is a mildly symptomatic storm in a teacup. But in the UK, concerns about rising financial distress on the high street and at hospitality firms is hitting the mood. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: More than 35,000 British retailers and 20,000 bars and restaurants are facing significant financial distress, according to new data, while shoppers are forecast to spend almost a quarter less in physical stores this Boxing Day than before the pandemic. If fashion and footwear shops, furniture businesses and other “non-essential” retailers are allowed to remain open from 26 December, £3.94bn is expected to be spent in stores and online that day, 10% less than before the pandemic and 1% lower than last year. Spending in physical stores alone is expected to fall by 23% compared with 2019 as many shoppers avoid high streets, shopping centres and retail parks amid fears over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Yesterday, the FTSE 100 hit a six-week closing high, near to its highest since the pandemic crash in March. But it could be a subdued start today, with the blue-chip index expected to dip a little. It could be a quiet session, with trading finishing early at lunchtime (hurrah)."

          "headline": "The Guide #14: readers pick 2021’s best culture",
          "bodyText": "It is remarkable – not to mention impressive – that, given all the turmoil of 2021, we were treated to such a terrific year of culture. As with 2020, there was endless innovation shown in every art form, as performers found ways to create within the restrictions placed on them. The difference this year was that, alongside lockdown-devised albums, remote theatre performances and the like, we were also treated to the hefty backlog of films and TV shows originally intended for the year before, from No Time to Die to season three of Succession. And, for a while at least, there was the return of full-throated live performance, from West End shows to music festivals. In this week’s newsletter we’re highlighting some of the best culture from 2021, chosen both by me and by you. There are no rankings here; the Guardian has already done that pretty extensively across film, music, TV, games, stage and art. Instead, it is more of a celebration of the great culture that you probably caught (Dune, It’s a Sin) and those gems you almost certainly missed (unearthed recordings from the birth of 80s Chicago house). Thank you for all your great recommendations, and I hope you have a very merry Christmas. Film The Guide’s picks For gargantuan big-screen spectacle at a time when the future of the cinema itself was being questioned, it is hard to look past Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. Right at the other end of the scale, was the hilarious and cringe-inducing low-budget comedy Shiva Baby. Its lead, Rachel Sennott, is a superstar in waiting. Pablo Larraín’s psychological horror-comedy Spencer was the year’s most audacious and divisive film, a Sandringham-set Rosemary’s Baby with Kristen Stewart’s Princess Diana in the Mia Farrow role. And on the documentary front, two very different films leaped out: MLK/FBI’s gasp-inducing uncovered history of institutional skullduggery, and Questlove’s joyous 1969 concert film Summer of Soul (... Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised). Reader picks Best film of the year for me is The Power of the Dog. Loved the cinematography and the slow pace, and the acting was brilliant. It’s a film I’d watch again to catch the subtleties. Jane Campion is a superb director, kudos to her. Suzanne Gauthier Must see: Coda! Would return to the theatre for that one, again and again. CG I thought Minari was splendid: beautiful, original, moving and hilarious. Excellent acting as well. What more could you want? Yvonne Durie [Further reading: Minari star Steven Yeun spoke about the film as well as his love of the great Bong Joon-ho, in an interview earlier this year] My favourite film was Another Round, which I’m sure will get lots of votes! Karen Beesley Music The Guide’s picks Surely 2021’s most gorgeously produced album, the daring, bracing, vast-sounding Sometimes I Might Be Introvert saw north London rapper Little Simz deliver on a decade’s worth of promise. Shame’s taut and propulsive Drunk Tank Pink was my favourite of the many British post-punk/noise-rock albums that landed in 2021 (although Black Midi’s John L remains the most thrillingly out-there track I heard this year). Promises – Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra’s lovely ambient-electronica-jazz hybrid – was perfect aural escapism in a frenetic year. And for pure jangly catchiness, it is hard to look past the Canadian outfit Kiwi Jr’s Cooler Returns, positioned perfectly between the Strokes, Parquet Courts and Pavement. Reader picks The Solution Is Restless by Joan as Police Woman, Tony Allen and Dave Okumu. Created music, not simply constructed. Niall O’Donnell Under the Conditions by LeRon Carson. Not sure if this really counts as new since Carson died in 2016, but a lot of these tunes are previously unreleased, made at the birth of house music in Chicago on the lowest of lo-fi equipment. This is amazing stuff, up there with Virgo, Mr Fingers &amp; co, back at the start of Trax, DJ International, Underground, Mitchbal and all the other seminal labels. Mike Firth Pressure Machine by the Killers. Rosa Bartlett [Hailed by the Observer as their best album in years] Cleo Sol took over from Max Richter for my own personal lullaby. Maggie Chute [Further reading: as well as her own soothing soul-jazz, Cleo Sol also found time to make yet another album with the prolific collective Sault, which found its way on to the Guardian’s best of 2021 list] Isles by Bicep got me through lockdown. Suzanne Stockton TV The Guide’s picks Although I am still not convinced it quite stuck the landing, Russell T Davies’s deeply affecting Aids drama It’s a Sin is the show that stayed with me the longest this year. The ridiculously consistent Succession has to be mentioned in any end-of-year sum-up, while the pitch-black satire of The White Lotus more than deserved its sleeper-hit status. It was a great year for small-screen documentaries: the Beeb’s policy of just letting Adam Curtis crack on with things bore fruit with his most ambitious series yet, Can’t Get You Out of My Head, while Steve McQueen’s doc about the 1981 fire in New Cross, south London, Uprising, served as a sobering postscript to his drama series Small Axe. And two British comedies – Jamie Demetriou’s fantastically daft Stath Lets Flats and Liam Williams’s note-perfect coming-of-age series Ladhood – returned with new outings that somehow improved on what had come before. Reader picks I learned about the Netflix series Somos from the Guardian. It’s about a Mexican town that is slowly taken over by drug traffickers, and it’s brilliantly done. Lives are upturned and destroyed by a wrong turn, a misplaced word, an unintended glance. It’s terrifying, tragic, subtle and with some superbly subdued performances from mostly unknown actors. A worthy addition to the year’s best. Andrew Downie The best series, without doubt, and not just because I live in Bristol was Stephen Merchant’s The Outlaws. Great cast, great writing, funny, serious, political and riveting. Josephine Eliot [Further reading: earlier this year, Stephen spoke to our magazine Saturday about his “low rent western” The Outlaws, and also walking through a plateglass window at a party hosted by Sarah Silverman] There was a recent spate of very good BBC dramas running in four-to-six parts. Showtrial was first class. Sheelah Kehoe Unforgotten’s Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar are the best double act on TV – bar none. Continuing the Nicola Walker theme, a shout for Annika – a quirky police procedural shown on Alibi, set in Scotland with her as the eponymous detective inspector. She breaks the fourth wall constantly, drives a boat to work, and references Viking words and customs to make sense of the plot. Completely oddball, but rather charming. Rob Mansfield I loved The White Lotus, and of course Succession! Elaine Dunlap Time by Jimmy McGovern, starring Stephen Graham and Sean Bean. Amazing story and acting from this impressive duo. Louise Carr Podcasts The Guide’s picks At a time where podcasts have somewhat lost that buzzy, blockbuster quality, Tortoise’s addictive catfishing investigation Sweet Bobby was an exception, harking back to the glory days of pods such as Serial. The film-maker Adam McKay hosted the engrossing Death at the Wing, which recounted the tragic deaths of high-profile basketball players in the 80s through the prism of Reaganism, while Karina Longworth’s old Hollywood podcast You Must Remember This had a particularly great season on Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. My favourite of the “people amiably chatting” genre this year was film pod The Big Picture, which seems to have come into its own in lockdown, with its lively “movie draft” episodes, director top fives and zingy back and forths from hosts Sean Fennessey and Amanda Dobbins. Reader picks World Service’s Deeply Human. Great presenter and subject. Maggie Chute Sweet Bobby came late in the year, but was a fantastic listen. The mic-drop moment in episode three was worth it alone. It’s been left tantalisingly open for a follow-up, but I was left counting down the days between episodes. Rob Mansfield [Further reading: the Observer’s Miranda Sawyer was just as hooked by Sweet Bobby] I like boring history podcasts, so it’s Rex Factor. Suzanne Stockton Books The Guide’s picks The Guardian’s books of the year list is an absolute monster this year, covering everything from Sally Rooney’s Beautiful World, Where Are You to Warren Ellis’s imaginative music biography, Nina Simone’s Gum. You can explore the whole thing here, helpfully divided into categories from politics to food. Meanwhile, the Observer has handed its books of the year list over to the experts, with authors ranging from Bernadine Evaristo to Kazuo Ishiguro highlighting their favourites from 2021. Reader picks Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman. To call this a book about time management is a whopping understatement and a major injustice. It gets to the heart of our existence and what, individually, our place here is – it’s part self-help, but a bigger part life philosophy. I defy you not to find something in here that will make you reassess the way you live your life. Rob Mansfield Civilisations by Laurent Binet, translated by Sam Taylor. Mary Bailey [This does sound fascinating: a counter-factual novel imagining what would have happened if the Incas had settled in Europe] My favourite book published this year was A Bright Ray of Darkness by Ethan Hawke. Karen Beesley [Further reading: we interviewed Ethan for his first novel in 20 years, as well as his unlikely love of Doris Kearns Goodwin] If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter please subscribe to receive The Guide in your inbox every Friday."

          "headline": "UK cities attract more property hunters as searches for flats soar",
          "bodyText": "Cities are attracting more property hunters with demand for flats outstripping that of houses in the autumn, the latest sign that the pandemic-fuelled “race for space” could be waning. UK property prices hit record levels during the pandemic as factors including the rise of home and flexible working fuelled a buying boom outside cities. However, as staff returned to offices with flexible and hybrid working patterns through the autumn – prior to the emergence of Omicron – interest in flats has surged. “When the housing market reopened in May, there was an immediate rush for room from buyers to look farther afield from the capital,” said Tim Bannister, the director of property data at the property portal Rightmove. “However, in recent months we’ve seen higher demand to live near London, with buyer inquiries returning towards pre-pandemic levels. This is happening quicker than some will have anticipated, and is likely driven by many businesses encouraging a hybrid, rather than fully remote working model.” Rightmove said that flats had become the most in-demand property type among prospective buyers, supplanting the popularity of houses throughout the pandemic. “The complete reversal in demand from bigger houses to flats paints a picture of society opening up again and a group of people looking to be closer to city centres,” said Bannister. “Although there was less demand for flats when the market reopened, with more availability than other property types, and more steady average asking price growth over the last year, flats could be a good opportunity for people looking to move or to get on to the ladder next year.” Rightmove’s findings chime with trends identified by mortgage lender Halifax, which found that in November flats were changing hands for 10.8% more than at the same time last year, while detached houses were typically fetching 6.6% more. Despite the boost in popularity of flats, Rightmove said the longer-term trend towards bigger houses, in outer-city and rural or coastal locations, is here to stay. Prospective buyers have widened their searches for their ideal home by an average of 50 sq km (19 sq miles), according to Rightmove. In October, the typical asking price for a detached house was 76% higher than a semi-detached property. “The pandemic redefined the role of the home and placed new emphasis on its importance, and people looked for more room in order to work, exercise, and often teach under one roof,” said Bannister. “People have extended their search area, which suggests there isn’t as much reliance on being near key transport hubs, or realising that living just a bit further away from the high street could open up more properties that a buyer can afford, or they may get more for their money.” Last week, Halifax forecast that the boom in UK house prices is likely to end next year as household finances become increasingly stretched."

Before we all go, let’s recap the biggest stories: Victoria recorded 2,095 cases, NSW 5,612 cases and one death, Tasmania reported 27, Queensland 589, The ACT 102, SA 688 new cases, WA had five cases, and the NT recorded one new case. Omicron accounted for the majority of SA cases as the state announced it would forward boosters to 26 December. National booster shots brought forward to four months. Airport chaos as Christmas flights cancelled. Anthony Albanese addressed the media, saying “this is a government by echo”.

Merry Christmas team Guardian! A Philippine family set to be deported from New Zealand on Christmas Day after the father used a false address to claim food vouchers out of desperation has been granted a last-minute reprieve in what they described as the “best present”. Jeffrey Santos had used a false address to claim $1,600 in vouchers because he lost his job when the Covid lockdown struck in March 2020 and was ineligible for New Zealand’s income relief payment, which wasn’t available to migrant workers. As a result, Jeffrey, his wife, Marjorie, and 8-year-old son James were to be deported back to the Philippines on Christmas Day. “I couldn’t pay rent for two weeks, I had to do something,” Santos told Stuff on Thursday. “I wish I hadn’t done this, but it is too late.” From AAP: A Sydney man who police allege was preparing to commit a terrorist act will face court on Christmas Day. Police arrested a 34-year-old man on Friday morning in Caringbah. NSW police detective superintendent Michael Sheehy says the man will be charged with offences relating to membership of a terrorist group and collecting and making documents likely to facilitate a terrorist attack. Following an investigation by the NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team, police will allege the Caringbah man “made numerous threats to commit acts of violence against law enforcement officers and other community leaders”. JCTT investigators seized two knives along with documentation and electronic storage devices when they searched the man’s home following his arrest. He is posting a significant amount of material in respect of bombings, beheadings, manufacturing explosives and other material. It is likely he was, and we’ll suggest that he was, preparing to commit a terrorist act and that would have been an act of violence against law enforcement. The man was charged with using a social media platform to distribute material which may offend, harass or menace in December 2020. He was in custody for six months before being released in July. Sheehy said police and government officials had engaged with the man to “attempt to deradicalise him” but he refused to engage in a program and continued to promote Islamic State material online. Due to his recent escalation in his activities it was necessary for us to act today and arrest him for those offences. The man has been refused bail and will appear in a Parramatta court on Saturday. Australian man Carl Stanojevic might be the world’s most considerate neighbour after he was asked to “take the bins out” and dutifully followed the request – to the letter. The practical joke began when the 54-year-old photographer from Mackay, in Queensland, received a late-night text message from his neighbour, Nick Doherty – who works remotely – asking if Stanojevic “would be able to take my bins out please”. We’ve got a video of the Christmas messages from Morrison and Albanese here: The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has said that “after such a tough couple of years, we all deserve a happy Christmas”. After such a tough couple of years, we all deserve a happy Christmas. Thanks to everyone for taking care of each other. Australians have stood together. And now, with our borders opening up again, we’re getting back together. Off the Zoom and actually back in the room with family, friends and loved ones. May the festive season bring you joy. And may it be a sign of better times to come. Both major party leaders have recorded Christmas messages to the Australian people. I’ve taken a few lines from each. Scott Morrison: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has thanked the “many selfless Australians” who are “caring for others this Christmas”. “At the end of this year, of course, we can think of the many difficult times we’ve had and the losses that people have incurred. But Christmas, you know, is a time of hope and we are an optimistic people,” Morrison said. He extended his support to the six families in Devonport in northern Tasmania that lost their children in the recent Hillcrest Primary School tragedy. “And this Christmas we’ll shed a tear and raise up prayers for them, I believe right across the country, for them that they might find some measure of comfort in this hour of their terrible grief.” He made a special thanks to the members of the defence force in the Solomon Islands and recognised it had been a hard year. “May all those who need a refreshing after what has been a difficult year, by just having a good long laugh out loud, round that Christmas table with friends and family, may you find it. May those who have been alone this year experience the warmth of companionship this Christmas. “May those of us who have faith find great encouragement as we reflect on God’s great gift to us and his son, Jesus Christ. And may all of us experience something of the joy and the wonder of Christmas, especially our children.” My colleague Lisa Favazzo got some of you to share your favourite Christmas traditions, and they are a wonderful mix of weird and cute. I like Little Drummer Boy as much as the rest of us but at 6 am on full volume it is a solid no from me. Hello everyone, this is Cait Kelly – I am back from my break and ready to roll through the last few hours with you. This is a cool calculator that tells you when and where you can get your booster. Whenever it’s quiet on the news front, you can usually rely on the Top End to come through. Today is no exception. AAP reports that thousands of dollars worth of Christmas hams are missing, after a learner driver allegedly stole a refrigerated truck in the Northern Territory. Police say about $10,000 worth of hams and the vehicle were stolen from a Darwin shopping centre car park on Thursday. The vehicle was later found abandoned, but there were no hams in the refrigerator and they remain missing, a spokeswoman said. Detective senior sergeant Mark Bland said: This behaviour can only be described as Grinch-like. It is incredibly disappointing for our members to be having to deal with these sorts of thefts just days out from Christmas. Police identified a 17-year-old boy and a man, 21, using CCTV footage, and they have been arrested and charged. The teenager was charged with aggravated unlawful use of a motor vehicle, stealing, damage to property, driving as a learner driver unaccompanied and failing to display L-plates. The man was charged with aggravated unlawful use of a motor vehicle, stealing and damage to property. Good afternoon. We’ve just launched our updated story on the thousands of Australians who have had their domestic flights cancelled in the hours leading up to Christmas, as frontline staff were ordered to test and isolate amid a rise in Covid cases. There were 117 domestic services cancelled on Friday between Sydney and Melbourne. I’m just going to hand you over to Michael McGowan quickly, who’ll keep you company while I eat some lunch. From AAP: The Top End is bracing for a wet and windy Christmas with residents warned a tropical cyclone could form near Darwin on Boxing Day. A monsoon trough and a tropical low are brewing north of the Tiwi Islands in the Arafura Sea, the Bureau of Meteorology says. It is expected to head south towards the Northern Territory by Saturday and extend across the Top End during Sunday as the monsoon sets in. “The best guidance is that the system will cross the coast south-west of Darwin as a category one system on Monday,” senior meteorologist Shaenagh Gamble said on Friday. “We’re fairly certain of where it’s going.” Darwin could be lashed by up to 100mm of rain per day with flash flooding and wind gusts of 150km/h possible. Communities from Point Stuart east of Darwin to Kalumburu in Western Australia have been told to remain alert and make preparations. If Braithwaite can’t reactivate the CBD no one can! The full list of WA exposure sites can be found here. The Northern Territory has recorded one new local case of Covid-19, taking the outbreak to 132. The case is a close contact of a previous case from Tennant Creek and Barrow Creek who was already in quarantine. A mask mandate that is currently in place in Alice Springs and Amoonguna will lift as planned at 5pm local time. And that is the end of the presser in WA. The state has recorded five new Covid cases. All cases attended the event Perth mess hall on 19 December in Northbridge. Anyone who attended that event, which is about 400 people, must get tested and go into quarantine until 14 days have passed since exposure to the virus. In this case, the quarantine period is counted from 19 December. About 100 people staying at the Fremantle Old Fire Station hostel are in lockdown, but will be moved to better accommodation for quarantining. SA and QLD are now classified by WA as high risk. Dawson is back up and is asked about if unvaccinated police officers will get full pay. I’m advised that the decision of the supreme court today was by one police officer; there’s in the order of about 30 police personnel with 23 sworn constables, and some other auxiliary officers and police staff. This injunction application was in respect of one officer alone, and the court – I haven’t read the decision because I have been here – but the advice I’ve got from the state solicitor is that the court has held that it only applies to that single officer [and] does not apply to the others. I intend to get further advice this afternoon in terms of further proceedings from here. Sanderson says check-ins have gone up by 38%. Yesterday, there were 1.7 million check-ins, that is significantly up on the day before. Sanderson says she doesn’t know how many people are in the hostel which is in lockdown. More than 100, but I don’t have the total number of residents there. Sanderson says surge plans are in place for hospitals. There are surge plans already in place for hospitals if ever required. But the public health measures we are putting in place at the moment and the very high levels of vaccination we have will negate the need for those plans, certainly in the immediate future. The current cohort that we are looking at with infections is also very young. And if this is potentially the Delta strain, evidence is that the disease is less severe in those young people. Sanderson is back up and she says the positive cases are all in their 20s. The people that are infected, people that have tested positive are in appropriate quarantine accommodation. We are working with those other potential close contacts, particularly the Fremantle hostel, and finding them appropriate hotel accommodation as well. McGowan says they will look at whether there can be compensation for the festivals that have had to cancel. In relation to some of the music festivals, that would have been difficult for the organisers of those festivals and quite costly. We will have a look at that as to whether or not there is any sort of compensation arrangements around it. Bear in mind, I think it ... can be difficult to do that but we will have a look at that. And what I normally find is whatever we do, people say it was not enough. In any event, we will examine the issue. McGowan: This is not about individual rights, this is about everybody. This is about protecting and helping everybody, and saving industries and lives more broadly across the community. And those who are out there protesting and taking matters to courts, all that thing, those are fundamentally selfish people. They are about them. They are not about the broader community. They need to have a good hard look in the mirror about their behaviour. But if and when Covid gets here, some of those people will die. I can’t help that if they are not going to abide by the rules and listen to all of the advice. McGowan says the people that will die when the virus enters WA will be those who are unvaccinated. Basically, the death rates around the world are the unvaccinated. When the virus gets here, and it may well be here already, the people who will die will be unvaccinated people. If people don’t learn that lesson, if they don’t watch what is happening around the world, then not much can be done for them. McGowan is asked if this is WA’s most challenging period yet, and says the outbreak is “most likely to have” caused community spread of the virus in WA. That is a fact. It is the Delta variant. The person in question has been to a whole bunch of venues. He has spread it to a whole bunch of other young people at those venues. It is a difficult situation. On the other hand, we now have over 91% first dose vaccination of over 12s. We have 85% double-dose vaccination of over 12s. ... Bear in mind, when I announced the transition plan a little while ago, it was on the basis that we wanted to get to 90% double-dose vaccination. That was the plan before we opened the borders. If we can get to 90% double-dose vaccination as soon as we possibly can, it will help protect the people of WA. If you are eligible to get the third dose, get it ... All the advice is, if and when Omicron gets here, the third dose gives you far greater protection against Omicron than two doses. McGowan says they are not happy about bringing in new restrictions. This is unpleasant and unfortunate for a lot of hospitality venues. I know that. But it does mean that tomorrow, if you’re running a restaurant or cafe [and] you have Christmas lunch booked, [you] can continue with seated service. McGowan says on the day WA announced the hard border with QLD, the state had one case. You have to bear in mind, Queensland, at that point in time ... We announced the hard border on that day and they had one community case. ... The day before they had six community cases ... in other words, in a state of 5 million people, at that point in time, they had seven cases. We still had a precautionary approach and put in place a hard border that night. Unfortunately, this person came in one hour before the hard border was put up. McGowan says they don’t know how many more cases are out there. Covid is a funny thing. I’m not, you know, a doctor, but your infectious period starts some days after you acquire the virus. It actually starts before such time as you become symptomatic, about a day before you become symptomatic. We have picked up five more people. We don’t know how much people are infectious or going to functions, which is why we’re being so precautionary about what has occurred. McGowan says the backpacker says he had not visited any of the known exposure sites in QLD. We asked the question, we put the exposure sites to him, and he indicated he didn’t go to any of the exposure sites. McGowan says there’s been good turnout at the vaccination clinics. People are booking their kids in. I expect a lot of the anti-vaxxers are now going and getting vaccinated. I expect a lot of people are going and getting their third doses, and that’s a good thing out of this. Go and get vaccinated, and if we get to very high levels of vaccination as a result of this, then that will be something that improves the situation for all of us. McGowan says it is “an unlucky” event. This fellow came in from Queensland whilst Queensland was ... very low-risk. So in other words, there were thousands of people coming in and out of Queensland because they ... didn’t have community spread of the virus. And our borders – again I’ll explain it – our borders were based upon the states and what the risk profile of each state was. Queensland, at the point of time this person came in, was very low-risk, so people were travelling freely between Queensland and Western Australia without restriction. That’s how he came in. Unfortunately he was one of basically half a dozen people in Queensland who had Covid at that point in time. McGowan says if there is a community outbreak, the planned border reopening on 5 February may become redundant. If we have community spread of the virus over coming weeks, then it may well be that 5 February date changes. It may well be it comes forward, because if we have major community spread of the virus ... it may well be that February 5 becomes redundant. Now, I said this prior to the outbreak. I said I hope we make it to February 5. The plan was to make it to February 5 without community spread of the virus. McGowan is asked what is different about this outbreak to others the state has had. Well, a few things about that. Firstly, if it is the Delta variant, it’s still highly infectious. So most of our outbreaks, bar one, were the predecessor variants prior to Delta. So Delta, of course, was regarded certainly by people in New South Wales as highly infectious. So that’s point one. So – it maybe Omicron but we suspect it’s Delta. Notwithstanding that, it’s highly infectious. Secondly, vaccination makes you less sick and reduces your transmissibility, it doesn’t eliminate. We have to explain this constantly to people. ... Like a flu vaccination, it reduces your chance of getting the virus, and it reduces your transmissibility. It doesn’t eliminate. So if you’re in a party in a room with hundreds of people, dancing in close proximity, you know, the chances are you’re going to spread it – and that appears to be what’s happened at the Perth Mess Hall. McGowan says 400 people at the Mess Hall are in quarantine. People at the Fremantle Hostel will be moved to hotel quarantine. It will be hotel rooms so they’ll be separated. The exact details, we’re working through. But at this point in time, the Fremantle youth hostel is locked down – so we have the people at the Fremantle hostel and the Mess Hall event ... in control, if you like. The reason we have done that is these hostels, as you know, have six or eight people in a room, so it’s very difficult for them to isolate. That’s why we have taken a particular interest in that hostel. McGowan says of the five cases, two are unvaccinated. The advice I have is that two are vaccinated, two are unvaccinated, one we don’t know. McGowan: It was an event with 400 people at the Perth Mess Hall. So it has parties in the undercover area there, so there were 400 people there including a hundred ... from a backpacker hostel in Fremantle who went there at the same time. It was very much sort of a – I suppose you’d say a young person’s party, in a closed environment. So at this point in time we have five people having acquired Covid from that single event. They’re obviously in proximity, probably dancing, having fun. He didn’t know he was positive, we didn’t know he was positive. So this is how this has come about. McGowan is back up; he says there is now another case, taking the state’s total to five. This is another person from the Perth Mess Hall event on 19 December. I don’t have any further details than that. He is asked if it is Delta or Omicron. We expect it’s Delta because [when] he arrived from Queensland, that was the dominant strain there. That’s the expectation. There’s still analysis, genomic sequencing on that, which means we might get an answer on that today or tomorrow. The WA police commissioner, Chris Dawson, says people are getting confused between testing and vaccine clinics. I must reinforce, though, that the testing clinics and the vaccine clinics are two separate premises. So don’t be confused ... at a vaccine clinic, the testing is not available there. They are quite specifically different premises. The vaccine clinics will not be open tomorrow but they’ll resume on Boxing Day onwards, and again, I would ask people to check those sites. It is encouraging that people are both presenting for testing and for vaccines. Sanderson: Encouragingly, we with had a 38% increase in check-ins by the SafeWA app yesterday from the day before. So it’s great to see that people are doing the right thing. Also today, we’re announcing that children aged five to 11 years old will have access to Covid-19 vaccinations from January 10. Vaccines will be available at a range of GP clinics, pharmacies and state-run vaccination clinics across Western Australia. Bookings opened for state-run vaccination clinics today, and bookings can be made via Vaccinate WA [online]. Sanderson says those getting tests should shop around for the quickest place. Capacity at our testing clinics was expanded yesterday. State-run testing clinics opened at 7am this morning and will be open until 8pm tonight. Tomorrow, Christmas Day, they will also be open from 7am to 8pm. On Boxing Day, they will open from 7am to 10pm. Private clinics are also open and are keeping similar hours. Please visit the HealthyWA website to find details of your clinics. Our clinics have been busy, and some are busier than others. I would urge you to shop around, it might be worth travelling a little bit further to get tested and wait less. The WA health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, is up now. More than 10,000 tests were carried out, and I understand that this is the last thing that you wanted to do just before Christmas, and I feel for those of you who will no longer be able to spend Christmas with your families. It generally takes between 24 and 48 hours for someone to get their Covid-19 test results, but rest assured our teams are working as fast as they can to get results back to people. Some are getting results back much faster than usual. Today, we have 85 contact tracers working hard to identify contacts of the confirmed cases. Tomorrow, 56 contact tracers will give up the chance to spend time with their families on Christmas Day to continue this important work, with the capacity to scale-up if needed, and we thank them for this. McGowan: To further protect our community and in light of skyrocketing infections over east, we’ll be upgrading our border arrangements. South Australia has today recorded an alarming spike in cases – 688 new infections. There are also worrying signs out of Queensland which has recorded 589 new infections. This is a major concern. That is why both South Australia and Queensland will be reclassified from medium-risk jurisdictions to high-risk jurisdictions. The new border arrangements come into effect from midnight tonight. This will mean arrivals must be approved, fully vaccinated, comply with the testing requirements before and after arriving, using the G2G Now app and undertake 14 days’ self-quarantine with the G2G Now app. McGowan says everyone needs to get vaccinated ASAP. These latest developments are a timely reminder of why it is so important to get vaccinated. Our vaccination rate is 91.3% for first dose 12-plus and 83.2% for second dose 12-plus. It’s 59.9% first dose for Aboriginal people and 44.7% double dose for Aboriginal people across WA over 12. The vaccine commander told this morning’s emergency management team meeting that we have seen an increase in vaccinations since yesterday’s developments. McGowan: As a result of these local cases, we are in a holding pattern while we get more tests done and develop a better understanding of the level of community transmission from case 1133. As detailed in our Safe Transition Plan, we’ll be introducing a proof of vaccination requirement for a range of venues and events by February 5 or earlier, depending on how this outbreak plays out. This will further protect everyone who has done the right thing and gotten themselves vaccinated. McGowan: Now, with the detection of these new cases and the big number of tests which are underway, more positive cases are expected, especially as we’re still in the infectious period from the exposure date. Therefore, from 6pm tonight, we will introduce an additional public health rule – for all licensed hospitality venues, seated service only will be permitted. This is on top of our public health rules we introduced yesterday including mask-wearing, the dancing ban, except at weddings, and the closure of high-risk entertainment venues and large-scale events. The additional seated service only requirement is also in place until Tuesday morning, December 28, which will help us further limit any potential spread of Covid in the community. McGowan: There are also 991 casual contacts of which 336 have tested negative so far and three positive as I detailed before. We expect the number of contacts to continue to increase. Last night, Health reported the partner of case 1133 and his four housemates have tested negative. They were all vaccinated. As a result of the Mess Hall event, and the large number of patrons who attend that event, our authorities have quickly responded to limit the spread as much as possible. A high number of patrons have been staying at the Fremantle Old Fire Station hostel. This morning, WA Police locked down that hostel. As this accommodation is not suitable for people to self-quarantine in, everyone staying in that hostel will now be provided with more suitable accommodation to complete their quarantine period. There are new exposure sites, which I will put up at the end of the presser. McGowan: The four cases – one is a close contact of case 1133 who also attended the Mess Hall event on Sunday, December 19. The other three are casual contacts of case 1133 who also attended the Mess Hall event but were not known to case 1133. As a result of the high-risk nature of the Mess Hall event in north, our health authorities will now upgrade the contact status for the Mess Hall event. This means that anyone who attended the event must get tested and now self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of exposure. As the date of exposure is 19 December, this means they will be in quarantine until January 3. We are making urgent arrangements to ensure everyone who was at the Mess Hall event, around 400 people, are tested and quarantined appropriately. Now, there are 21 close contacts linked to 1133, nine of whom have tested negative so far, and the one positive I mentioned earlier. McGowan says WA has four new Covid cases. McGowan says the advice from border force is that the French backpacker arrived before the onset of the pandemic and has been in Australia for two years. Fast forward to this month, he entered WA on December 12. At the time, Queensland was set as a very low-risk jurisdiction as they had virtually no Covid in that state which meant people entering WA from Queensland were not required to be vaccinated at that point in time. However, that changed the next day. And now under our safe transition plan, from February 5, everyone who is eligible aged 12 and over is required to be double-dose vaccinated to enter Western Australia. McGowan thanks everyone for wearing their masks when they are out and about. I acknowledge many Western Australians would prefer to not be wearing masks in indoor public venues across the festive season, especially when it’s so hot – me included – but the direction is based on health advice, it’s to keep us safe from any potential risk. And therefore, it is necessary at least until we know more about any potential spread. I want to nod to the many Western Australians who have clearly done the right thing and put their masks on where required. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, is giving an update now from Perth ... Labor Senator Kim Carr going in over the government refusing to grant six research projects including two about China and one about student climate activism. Just a quick reminder we are still waiting on Covid numbers from WA and the NT. We are not expecting a presser from the territory. From AAP: A Sydney man who police allege was preparing to commit a terrorist act will front court on Christmas Day. Police arrested a 34-year-old man on Friday morning in Caringbah. NSW Police Detective Superintendent Michael Sheehy said he will be charged with offences relating to membership of a terrorist group and collecting and making documents likely to facilitate a terrorist attack. “He is posting a significant amount of material in respect of bombings, beheadings, manufacturing explosives and other material,” Superintendent Sheehy told reporters on Friday. “It is likely he was, and we’ll suggest that he was, preparing to commit a terrorist act and that would have been an act of violence against law enforcement.” The man was charged with using a social media platform to distribute material which may offend, harass or menace in December 2020. He was in custody for six months before he was released in July this year. Superintendent Sheehy said police and government officials had engaged with the man to “attempt to deradicalise him” but he refused to engage in a program and continued to promote Islamic State material online. “Due to his recent escalation in his activities it was necessary for us to act today and arrest him for those offences,” he said. Police have issued a search warrant at the man’s home. In non-Covid news, a federal minister has blocked six research projects from receiving funding in the latest round of grants announced by the Australian Research Council. The winning Discovery Projects for next year were finally revealed in a Christmas Eve announcement. A report published on the ARC website said there were 3096 applications for funding commencing in 2022 - and 587 of those had been approved for funding totalling $259m over five years, for a success rate of 19%. The outcomes report included this nugget: “Of the unsuccessful applications in 2022, 51 were found not to meet eligibility requirements and 6 were recommended to, but not funded by the Minister.” A spokesperson for the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, said the minister had approved 587 of the 593 Discovery Projects the ARC recommended, but did not accept the following six: Playing Conditions: How Climate Shaped the Elizabethan Theatre National Forgetting and Local Remembering: Memory Politics in Modern China China stories under Xi Jinping: popular narratives Finding friendship in early English literature Cultural Production of Religion by Science Fiction and Fantasy novels New Possibilities: Student Climate Action and Democratic Renewal Robert’s spokesperson said the minister “believes those rejected do not demonstrate value for taxpayers’ money nor contribute to the national interest”. “After going through a peer review process, it is clear to the Minister the application of the National Interest Test is not working in every case. This test should ensure taxpayer-funded Australian Government research funding is directed to areas of national importance and delivers public value. It’s why in his Letter of Expectation the Minister asked the ARC to strengthen the test.” Is your Christmas cheer evaporating? Are you doomscrolling yourself into a complete funk?

These gorgeous shows are streaming right now. From AAP: Record sales are expected on Boxing Day as bargain-conscious shoppers shrug off coronavirus concerns to indulge in shopping, both in store and through their browsers. Shoppers have been tipped to spend $4bn – more than last year – in stores and online, based on Commonwealth Bank data. Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra predicted an online record. “The big difference this year will be an even heightened level in online shopping because some people want to avoid crowds,” he said. “We still expect crowds but people will be more organised. There will be less browsing.” Zahra said he expected total sales to exceed last year because people could or would not spend their money on overseas travel during the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 80 domestic flights around the country have been cancelled after airline staff have had to isolate. Absolutely devastating for those trying to see family – and the staff having to isolate. I’ll bring you more on this as I have it. “We have to find a way to live and love, otherwise, we’ll all go insane.” Brigid Delaney says goodbye to 2021 and helps us process this cooker of a year. A must-read today, I reckon. From AAP: An 83-year-old man has died after a light plane crashed on Christmas Eve on a beach in central Queensland. Paramedics and a rescue helicopter were dispatched following the crash just after 8am on Friday at Ball Bay, about 50km north of Mackay. Police confirmed the man, a passenger on the plane, died at the scene. The pilot was airlifted to hospital with minor injuries. Queensland police’s forensic crash unit is working together with the Australian Transport Safety bureau to investigate the cause of the crash. The incident follows the death of four people in a light plane crash north of Brisbane less than a week ago. Professor Angela Webster, an epidemiologist from the University of Sydney’s School of Public Health was just on the ABC. She was asked if we are all going to have to get boosters for the rest of our lives. I think it’s an interesting question – to which she gave an insightful answer. Here it is: “I don’t think that’s the case. What we need to try and do globally is make sure that everybody has had access to vaccination so we can dampen the amount of infection that is circulating. “We know that coronavirus will mutate into new strains when it has a lot of opportunity, when it has a lot of infection around – that’s how the changes take place and that’s how we got Delta and Omicron. “There will be other variants that may become threats, or may not. And it’s likely that over time we will need to tweak the vaccinations, which is quite easy to do, and roll out slightly different versions like we see with seasonal flu vaccines. “I imagine we may reach a situation when coronavirus is less pandemic and more endemic, in the background rather than sweeping around the world as it is at the moment, when we will see we need boosters perhaps yearly to adjust to any different strains that are emerging.” Good afternoon everyone! This is Cait Kelly and I will be with you until the evening. I want to first up just bring you some Christmas joy with this gem: With that, I will pass the blog on to the highly capable Cait Kelly who will keep you entertained and informed this afternoon. A very Merry Christmas Eve for those who celebrate – I’m off to play Paul Kelly’s album on repeat. So case numbers are in for NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, The ACT and South Australia. We are still waiting on the Northern Territory and Western Australia (WA detected a case in a Queensland backpacker yesterday). Marshall welcomes the reduction of the interval between second vaccination and the booster shot. From 26 December, mass vaccination clinics in South Australia will be available to ensure all those who are eligible can receive a booster shot until the rollout expands on 4 January. In addition, people who have had two shots of AstraZeneca and are working in “high risk” settings on the frontline who would normally be eligible on 4 January can receive a booster shot. Marshall: We need to take action. One of the things that we announced late yesterday is that we would no longer make it illegal to sell the rapid antigen tests here in our state. It has been in use for some weeks now in certain settings – medical settings, dental settings, aged care settings. Also settings in specific sectors that we’re very concerned about, for example, in food distribution and also in the mining sector, so it has been in widespread use in South Australia. Now, it is going to be made available to the people of our state. We strongly emphasise to every single person that you use this test for what it is – for its intended purposes which is a screen, a surveillance test for people that are not symptomatic. If you have any symptoms, the only option is to isolate ahead of a PCR test. That’s our strong advice. So the PCR is still suitable for all of those people with symptoms, or close contacts of known cases. But the rapid antigen test is suitable as a screening test and they will be made legal in South Australia as of last night and you’ll start to see those filtering through to stores almost immediately. There are eight people being treated in hospital in SA including one person – a man in his 30s – in intensive care. Marshall says of 484 new cases reported on Wednesday, 50% of new infections weren’t fully vaccinated. Some 70% of cases in the state are the Omicron variant, of the sample that have been tested. SA has reported 688 new Covid cases overnight from just over 20,000 tests. Marshall: If we don’t take action, there is going to be a significant problem for our country. It will overwhelm our health system, not because it is more severe, but just because of the sheer volume of people who are likely to become infected with this variant of concern. Now, South Australia has confronted the situation like this before by working together – we have been able to get through it and we’re going to need all South Australians to continue to work with us through this Omicron outbreak which is occurring right across the country. We have already seen today significant increases in other jurisdictions. This has been the picture right across the country, right across the world, for the last couple of weeks. SA premier Steven Marshall is up. The state is looking at the situation with Omicron “very, very carefully” and is concerned at the “very significant increase” in transmissability. “We do have to take action.” Albanese says the “only explanation” for reducing the booster interval on 4 January and again on 31 January is because of capacity constraints. The government once again hasn’t been ahead of the game when it comes to preparing for the action that is required based upon our own health advice and based upon international experience. This announcement today, which is quite extraordinary given Greg Hunt’s comments yesterday afternoon, follows a very consistent pattern. That pattern was followed with regard to wage subsidies and JobKeeper. Labor says something constructive, the government ridicules it and trashes it and a day or two later, they announced it as their own policy. I want everyone to acknowledge what masterstroke it is that they have come up with. The fact is that this government is always behind. It is always playing catch up ... whether it is the rollout of the vaccine, whether it is purpose-built quarantine, the rollout of the booster, on so many issues relating to this pandemic, the protection of people in aged care, the workforce issues that need to be dealt with, this government ... is always concentrating on the politics, rather than on the response that is required in the national interest. This is a government by echo. Labor says something, then we wait a couple of days to hear it back from the government as if it is its own idea. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is up. He is less than amused at Hunt’s booster announcement today. Yesterday in this very room, I said one of the lessons from overseas is that we need to reduce the time between the 2nd dose and the booster. There are two reasons for that. Firstly, we are way behind with the rollout of the booster. As of the 22 December, Australia was 20th out of 21 advanced economies, with regard to the rollout of booster shots. Only Japan, that has just started to commence rolling out the booster, was behind us in the developed world. Secondly, as we know from the signs and medical evidence, that all the reports from overseas as well as from here is that boosters will be very important, particularly for the Omicron variant of this pandemic. I said that yesterday as a constructive suggestion. The government’s response, even though state governments, including South Australia and New South Wales ... have all called for the same thing. Greg Hunt’s response was quite extraordinary yesterday afternoon. He said that this was utterly irresponsible, utterly inappropriate ... well, less than 25 hours later, he is not only calling for it, he is announcing it. South Australia’s premier Steven Marshall will give a Covid update soon alongside the chief public health officer and SA police commissioner. Back to the boosters, you can read the full statement from Atagi here. An excerpt: Atagi notes that the course of the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly changed in recent weeks. Case numbers of Covid-19 due to the Omicron variant are rapidly increasing and this variant now dominates in some regions of Australia. Internationally, the Omicron variant has become dominant in several countries with case numbers growing rapidly in some. Preliminary data from large superspreading events in New South Wales involving younger people suggested that two doses of vaccine did not provide any significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the Omicron variant. Strong evidence has accumulated over the past two weeks to indicate that booster doses of Covid-19 vaccines are likely to increase protection against infection with the Omicron variant. Although some early data suggest that the risk of hospitalisation due to disease caused by the Omicron variant is lower than that with the Delta variant, this difference would not be enough to offset the impact of high case numbers on the health system. There are now reassuring data on the safety of early booster doses in tens of millions of people, with no new safety signals identified in the United Kingdom where more than 21 million booster doses have been delivered. Atagi expects that booster vaccination alone will not be sufficient to avert a surge due to Omicron. However, maximising booster coverage by expanding eligibility and encouraging high uptake, in combination with enhanced public health and social measures, may prevent a large surge in case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths. ATAGI also acknowledges the demands that the booster and paediatric Covid-19 vaccination programs will have on the immunisation workforce. I like this but I would also add “Omicron” “Domicron” “Diamond Dom” and “Dictator Dan” (the three D’s). The ACT’s numbers are in, and there have been 102 new local cases. There are just two people in hospital, and no lives lost. Active cases are now up to 334. “Get Covid ready” The chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, is up, and thankfully there is nobody in Queensland severely infected with the virus. There are 268 patients being cared for in their homes, and 110 in hospital, with just three being treated for Covid symptoms – none severe. But Gerrard says there will be strains on the hospital system in January. Not because the vaccination doesn’t work, but because thousands of cases will inevitably lead to a number of hospitalisations: This virus is everywhere, and so it is somewhat surprising that despite the fact it is everywhere we are seeing relatively few sick patients in hospital ... but the numbers of people we are going to see with the virus in the next few weeks is going to grow very substantially. D’Ath is now discussing the next phase in the strategy to manage Covid in Queensland – basically planning for getting Covid and how to manage it when/if you acquire the virus. She calls it the “Covid pathway”, and it’s available on the Queensland government’s website: This is how we care for people in the community and in our hospitals ... you can find many materials about how this will be managed, for clinicians, but most importantly for the public. How can you prepare yourself for becoming positive with Covid? And there are fantastic materials and a toolkit prepared. Think of it this way, Queenslanders. You need to get ready ... by getting Covid ready, you are doing the same as when you get ready for bushfires, cyclones, and these we do every year. We have toolkits, materials that are prepared for people to tell them what happens when you get a text ... saying that you are positive ... a plan of who may look after your children if one or both parents end up needing hospitalisation ... having masks and hand sanitiser and gloves, and also making sure that you have enough essentials for two weeks at home ... this is a great step forward to help empower the public to understand exactly what will happen if you get positive, but also how to plan for that to make it as smooth as possible to help you feel confident that you can stay at home. Only two-thirds of Queenslanders are following mask mandates, D’Ath says. It comes as 32 of the 77 local government areas in Queensland have detected Covid cases since the border reopened. “Get ready for Covid”: That reiterates what we said all along, which is that the virus will come to every single community in Queensland. How prepared we are will be dependent on the compliancy with the rules we’re putting in place, and of course the vaccination rates. As great as the vaccination rates are, that is not consistent across the state, and we still expect and require people to get vaccinated as quickly as possible to get the protection. D’Ath welcomes bringing forward the booster shots, labelling it “great news”. I say to everyone who is able to get their booster earlier than planned, based on these timeframes, that we strongly encourage you, particularly going to community pharmacies or GPs, because we know as we move forward we need these boosters to become part of just a normal immunisation program and getting those vaccinations done as quickly as possible. There have been 30,631 new border passes issued in the last 24 hours. This brings us to over 322,000 border passes since we opened on the 13 December, which shows that many people are still flocking to Queensland. There have been 589 new local cases reported in Queensland. The new cases come from over 30,000 tests. D’Ath is up, wishing everyone a merry and safe Christmas. Arguably more normal than “strong”. She thanks frontline health workers as we move to a new phase of managing the virus, and police for manning the borders, and Queenslanders, for getting vaccinated. Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath is about to provide a Covid update from Brisbane. We’ll bring it to you here. Greg Hunt keeping the states and territories on their toes: You can have a little peruse of the full statement on booster intervals here: SA Pathology have posted the latest testing times across the state. As of 10am, there are wait times of more than six hours at Aldinga and Victoria Park but relatively short queues at Mount Gambier, Pinaroo and Bordertown. There are waits of between two and three hours at the airport. Back to disarrayed travel plans, The Australian is reporting Jetstar and Qantas have been forced to cancel flights for hundreds of passengers due to Covid-19 isolation requirements a day out from Christmas. Virgin scratched up to 12 flights between Melbourne and Sydney on 24 December, while Jetstar canned 10 flights between the two cities. More than 20 flights between the major cities and the Gold Coast, Adelaide and Brisbane have also been cancelled across both airlines. A Jetstar spokesperson said: We appreciate the frustration this causes, especially as customers are travelling for Christmas, and sincerely apologise for the impact these changes are having on travel plans. We are working to minimise any delays and re-accommodating passengers on flights as close as possible to their original departure times across both Jetstar and Qantas services. One day later, Greg Hunt: “It is no surprise we will be bringing forward the booster eligibility.” Christmas Eve carnage at Melbourne airport: Update from Tasmania - 19 of those 27 new Covid cases are still being assessed by public health. Meanwhile, testing delays are still causing heartache for travellers crossing borders for Christmas. There’s a huge queue for PCR tests at Melbourne airport this morning. The facility has been closed to domestic travellers due to demand. What are you meant to do if you diligently get tested within 72 hours and don’t receive your result? And off he goes. To recap, Atagi has updated its medical advice, reducing the interval between vaccination doses from five months to four on 4 January, and down to three months on 31 January. Jurisdictions can bring forward these dates if they believe they have the capacity to do so. It is not yet clear exactly how this will work, or if this means we will now be getting vaccinated every three months in the future. Some 7.5 million Australians will become eligible to receive their booster shot on 4 January. And Greg Hunt wants you to have a “strong” Christmas. Greg Hunt is asked why it has taken days for Atagi to update its health advice after increased calls for the booster interval to be reduced to four months: With great respect, that is incorrect. What we have seen is that Atagi has already moved on the basis of international evidence from six months to five months and that has seen a rapid increase in the uptake of boosters and what they have done is again, continuously reviewed the international evidence ... one of the things that has been a hallmark of Australia’s approach to the vaccination program is listening to the medical advice and with the quality of medical advice we received. To finish as we lead into Christmas, I want to give this ... message of thanks to Australians for coming forward to be vaccinated and keeping distance, for doing difficult things that are so contrary to our nation ... that is what has allowed us to be one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, one of the lowest rates of loss of lives ... and at the same one of the strongest economic recoveries ... we got through it better than almost anybody and we will continue to get through it better than almost everybody ... take care, everyone, and have a great Christmas. Tasmania has recorded 27 new Covid cases today, bringing active cases to 79. It hasn’t been confirmed yet whether any cases are of community transmission. My Tveeder live transcription just skipped over from the press conference to Gardening Australia and gave me quite a fright: ... (THEME MUSIC) (CHILD GIGGLES) (BIRD CHIRPS) (CAT MEOWS) (INSECTS BUZZ) (DOG BARKS) (ROOSTER CROWS) (SLEIGH BELLS RING) Hello and welcome to Gardening Australia, our last program of the year. And what a year it’s been! The expansion of the booster program will not impact the vaccination rollout for children aged between five and 11, Greg Hunt says, which is also due to kick off in the new year. He says bringing forward the booster program before 4 January would “displace the older or more immunocompromised” who have been less presently vaccinated: What this does is ... that there are 7.5 million Australians who are eligible from the 4 January that’s including those who already had eligibility, and by then we will have had well past the 2 million figure that will have been boosted. And so that gives them that immediate opportunity and those are overwhelmingly older Australians or more immunocompromised Australians who have been less recently vaccinated. So, of course, there has to be a priority program. The alternative of suddenly putting an extra 4 million people who would displace the older or more immunocompromised and less presently vaccinated is absolutely at odds with the right way. Paul Kelly is asked whether the 4 January and 31 January dates are based upon health advice or just the “sheer logistical challenge” of a rapidly expanded rollout. He says its based on the “science and the medical advice” and Australia has been “leading the world” (after a significant game of catch-up): We know that it is not an immediate thing when the vaccine starts to wear off, it’s a time-based thing. Again, as we have done all the way through the process, is we have prioritised the ones that are at most risk. Nowhere in the world has done – when we got to our peak of vaccination, we’re around 2.2m doses a week. That, on a per-capita basis, was leading the world. That’s what we aim to get to and achieve – and to exceed during January, but at this time, when – and minister has already mentioned the exhaustion of our health workforce, it’s just not feasible to suddenly give those large numbers their doses during this period. Reporter: Atagi expects the booster vaccination alone will not be sufficient to prevent a surge due in Omicron. When you hear the people saying 5,000 in New South Wales, do you think that’s helping people to get the booster or is it, kind of, scaring people? Paul Kelly: I think it’s a bit of both. We have been saying ... for quite some time, cases are not the most important thing at the moment. The vast majority of those cases are mild or asymptomatic. However, we have talked about transmission and so what we’re seeing in other parts of the world is a doubling rate of cases every two or three days and that is what we’re seeing here. We’re not seeing that same sort of increase in hospitalisations or ICU and I think they’re the most important metrics for people to look at. People should be alert to this, take it – particularly with this announcement today, make that booking in the new year to get that booster if you’re eligible. Paul Kelly says it won’t be possible for everyone to rush out and get boosters. Vaccination clinics will need time to prepare: Throughout this vaccination schedule, there’s a sense that everyone wants to be vaccinated on the first day an announcement is made, that is not necessary and indeed is not possible. We know that we have ... around 10,000 places you can get a jab at the moment, and that is continuing. At national cabinet, the PM announced the other day when we had our press conference that the states and territories are doing their bit. They have committed to go back to peak clinic use. We have our GPs, our pharmacists, Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, they’re all available, they’ll all do booster shots, they’re already doing booster shots and that will role out as we go. In terms of the future – that’s the future. Let’s deal with this booster at the moment. Paul Kelly is up. He starts will a callout to anyone in Australia eligible for their first two primary doses to get vaccinated as “the most important component of protection”. Why bring forward the booster? To protect people from severe disease, and to prevent transmission of the virus: We have seen a rise in intensive care patients in NSW in recent days, almost all of those have been unvaccinated, not even a first dose let alone a booster. So that still remains the No 1 priority for the vaccination program. It is four weeks today since we found out about Omicron, this new variant of concern, and in those four weeks we have already gained a lot of information ... particularly around severity and what is the effectiveness of vaccination programs throughout the world ... As has always been our main aim of the program, is to protect those that are most at risk of severe disease. So they remain our priority ... We know two key things. One is that ... protection ... from the first two doses of the vaccine ... wanes over time, hence the time-based change in the boosters. The positive effect of that is that we do know now that boosters do protect and increase that protection against severe disease once that third dose is given or a fourth dose in the case of immunocompromised people. So they are a given. It’s an absolute aim of the program to go forward and do that. The second reason is because boosters at this stage can help about the transmission of the virus. It is unclear how this will work – jurisdictions having capacity to bring forward the booster dates before 4 January. Do state and territory premiers announce if they have capacity to bring forward the dates to roll out boosters? Do individual clinics announce it? If I want to get a booster now, at four months between doses, where do I go? Either way, it once again comes down to an issue of supply. Greg Hunt concludes by wishing Australians a “strong” Christmas: Greg Hunt says jurisdictions can bring forward the reduced booster eligibility, flagged at four months on 4 January and three months on 31 January if they believe they have “the capacity” to do so. This is likely to occur in South Australia based on capacity at state clinics: It is Atagi advice is the jurisdictions who believe that they have the capacity to bring forward any of these dates without displacing older and more eligible people in terms of those that have had a longer period between their second dose and the access to boosters should feel free to do so. As an example, I was speaking to the premier of South Australia last night, he believes that they have very strong capacity and so Atagi has given jurisdictions freedom to move forward with their state clinics prior to then if they have that capacity without displacing. And this is a very important principle – that the stage of the progressive program, as quickly as possible, is what we’re focused on but ... we’re giving the highest priority to those who have the greatest distance in time from having been vaccinated ... so it’s protecting the oldest and the immunocompromised and giving them priority as is appropriate. Atagi has been going through a “constant review process” of international evidence, Greg Hunt says. The cohort will more than double to 7.5 million people eligible for boosters from 4 January when the period is reduced: It’s no surprise we will be bringing forward the eligibility for the booster dose to four months as of 4 January. The planning behind that is that will open up a new cohort. Currently that means that we will go from about 3.2 million people who are eligible today to approximately 7.5 million who will be eligible as 4 January. That means that the cohort has expanded. It will be expanded again on the 31st of January to three months and that will take it out to 16 million Australians who will be eligible at that point in time and as we have said all along, eligibility is the beginning of access, it doesn’t mean that somebody is overdue the very day they become eligible. These dates have been set out of an abundance of caution to give Australians early continued protection and the advice we have is that the protection as it is is very strong against severe illness, but what we’ll see is a much stronger protection against transmission. Greg Hunt says 192,000 doses were delivered yesterday and the 2m booster mark will be reached this morning: On the edge of Christmas, Australians have been coming forward and I really want to thank them for that. And that includes 148,000 boosters yesterday, and this morning we will pass the 2m booster mark. That’s half a million ahead of schedule at this point in time so Australians have been really fantastic in coming forward. I want to thank them for that in particular. That will mean we had about 1.3m doses since the expansion of eligibility from six months to five months just over one and a half weeks ago, so that’s really seen very high rates of vaccination. In fact, we’re now at 42m doses, we have passed 42m doses and all up that means that we now have 94.1% first and 91% second and at this point in time, as I say, this morning will pass the 2m dose mark for boosters. Health minister Greg Hunt and chief health officer Paul Kelly are up. The interval between Covid shots will be reduced to four months from 4 January. And it will be reduced to three months on 31 January based upon Atagi advice, Hunt says. Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath and chief health officer Dr John Gerrard will hold a press conference at 10am AEST. While we wait for Greg Hunt to speak and reportedly announce a reduced interval between Covid shots (he’s due at 9.30am), I got three out of six in the Wordle today. 🟨⬜⬜⬜🟩 ⬜🟩⬜🟩🟩 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 Wordle 187 3/6 What is Wordle, you ask? Read all about the new viral word game delighting the internet: More, if not reassuring, then not horrifically bad news. The Reff is on a downward trend in NSW, seeing a 4.4-day doubling time. Meanwhile, many testing sites in Brisbane are closed over Christmas yet travellers are still required to get day five Covid tests. This site has been open since 8am Queensland time and will close at midday: Another thing to look at is how many tests are coming back positive. We’re still seeing high testing numbers in both states. Some 2.57% of today’s tests in Victoria came back positive. In NSW, that figure is 3.42%. So both are a little up on the seven-day average. Finally, people queuing for something other than a Covid test: So the good news is we haven’t seen a dramatic rise in case numbers in New South Wales or Victoria overnight. They’ve remained relatively stable in both states, and actually dropped a smidge in NSW. Turning to hospitalisations, they have jumped by 35 in NSW overnight, including a further eight people requiring intensive care. In Victoria, hospitalisations are stable, with a small rise in people requiring intensive care – up by three to 75. Numbers are in from NSW, and it’s another high number, though still slightly down from yesterday – 5,612 Covid cases. There has been one death, and there are 382 people being treated in hospital, including 53 in intensive care. Victoria has recorded 2,095 cases and, sadly, eight more deaths. There are 397 people being treated in hospital. This hasn’t been independently verified by Guardian Australia but 10 News is reporting that Greg Hunt is poised to announce a reduction of the booster dose interval to four months: The Sydney fireworks display will still go ahead at this stage, despite record Covid case numbers. NSW MP Stuart Ayres: Ultimately we have got to continue to live with this virus – it’s not going away. Nice weather in Melbourne? It’s a Christmas miracle! It may be Christmas Eve but the news stops for no man! Labor MP Jim Chalmers was up and about on breakfast television earlier today, expressing shock at NSW premier Dominic Perrottet’s slow limp to reintroducing mask mandates. He said mask mandates were just “common sense” right now: It’s a bit strange frankly that they held out for so long and in that period we probably lost a bit of ground when it came to tracing and tracking outbreaks of the virus, particularly the new strain. Jane Halton is asked about an idea NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has floated to force the unvaccinated to pay for hospital treatment. She says it is an “interesting” idea but not a good one: It’s an interesting thought but it’s not a thought which I think should turn into practice. We have a universal health system ... we care for people who need that care. We should encourage people to get vaccinated, it’s the best thing we can do to protect our health, but I don’t think our health system should discriminate. Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations chair Jane Halton is up on Radio National, arguing it’s in the interest of all countries to provide assistance to supply and administer vaccines in the developing world: We have to focus on delivery in these lower-income countries ... to increase their ability to actually administer vaccines. And at the same time we need to make sure ... that protection continues and that’s why we need boosters. I’ve described this in the past as learning to walk and chew gum, it’s not an either/or situation ... if you have significant proportions of the world ... uncovered, you have significant risk of the virus to mutate. We will be watching hospitalisations in NSW today, which have jumped in the past week: The ABC is reporting Shoalhaven Heads lawyer Paul Ell has pulled out of the marginal Gilmore pre-selection race, and endorsed Andrew Constance as the “best candidate”. The Bega MP and former transport minister has a strong backing from local branch members, and found wide popularity during the 2019-20 bushfires. His path to becoming the Liberal candidate is now all but confirmed. Queensland’s deputy premier providing a useful reminder to treat retail staff with the utmost respect and patience today: In non-Covid news, tributes are flowing in for US journalist and author Joan Didion, who has died at 87. The Year of Magical Thinking, accounting the year after the death of Didion’s husband John Gregory Dunne, may be the most powerful book about grief I’ve read. Mary Louise McLaws is asked whether we’re going to see exponential growth of Covid cases from here. She says it’ll be “quite likely” if we don’t quickly administer booster shots. There has been increasing pressure on Atagi to reduce the interval between doses from five months down to four: We have had so much evidence given to us from around the world at the WHO meeting that waning antibodies started about three months, certainly the Israel experience and all other countries now show that, you know, at about four, four and a half months before that booster you’re at a great risk, particularly if you’re young because you have so many social engagements. So I was disappointed that this booster hasn’t been rolled out to at least be given at four months because the majority of the country have had their shot for at least four, five months. Epidemiologist Mary Louise McLaws was just up on ABC News Breakfast, discussing rapidly rising Covid case numbers. Australia has had a 52% increase in numbers since yesterday, “not good news” for those who’ve been infected: It would be really very helpful to hear from the authorities about how mild these cases are and, of course, how many of them are going into hospital. I think it’s too early to be highly disappointed in this ... is this infection more severe, more deadly? All of these things are far too early to know becaus,e particularly in New South Wales, it’s always been an about a 10-day to 14-day delay between peak numbers of infections and peak hospitalisations and let’s hope that we don’t see that same pattern again, that Omicron may be more mild and not need hospitalisation. It’s Christmas Eve and you know what that means: a healthy dose of Mariah Carey, last-minute wrapping and a Love Actually rerun. But first, the news. Caitlin Cassidy is here to run you through it, starting in NSW, where premier Dominic Perrottet backflipped yesterday on his anti-mandate position. Compulsory mask wearing is now in place across almost every state and territory as Covid restrictions are slowly reimposed with infections soaring across the country. NSW will also reintroduce QR codes for hospitality and retail as well as some lower-risk settings, while density limits will return after Christmas. It comes after the state hit a new record of 5,715 daily infections and one death on Thursday, which is up almost 2,000 cases from the day before. Victoria also reintroduced a mask mandate, with the state recording more than 2,000 new infections and 10 deaths on Thursday. Over in Western Australia, Mark McGowan has also been forced to introduce mask mandates after a backpacker who arrived from Queensland tested positive to the virus yesterday. The backpacker was infectious in the community for a number of days, visiting a string of venues across Perth. High-risk, large public events will be cancelled and dancing has been banned except for at weddings. “I know this is not the news we wanted to hear two days before Christmas, but unfortunately this is the reality of Covid-19,” McGowan said. Queensland reported 369 new daily infections, South Australia 484, Tasmania 26 and the Northern Territory 10. The ACT also recorded a new daily case record, with 85 new infections, prompting the territory to update its definition of a close contact. Close contacts will now only be defined as a household contact of a positive case, or someone who has spent an extended period of time with a positive case. Casual contacts will no longer need to fill out a declaration form for ACT health authorities, but will still need to get tested and isolate until a negative result is received. There are also growing calls for the federal government to make rapid antigen tests available for free as concerns rise over a Christmas spike. The NSW government announced on Thursday its intention to make rapid antigen tests free to ease congestion at overwhelmed PCR testing sites. Perrottet said people lining up for a test who didn’t have symptoms or weren’t close contacts should take a rapid test instead. The NSW government estimates about one in five tests are for the purposes of travel, jumping to about 50% in the ACT, according to the territory’s health minister. The blown-out lines at testing clinics around the country have prompted calls for a rethink of entry requirements in states like Queensland which demand a negative PCR test before arrival. Queensland will move to allow rapid antigen tests before travelling but not before the new year. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has called on the federal government to make rapid testing more accessible for people on low incomes. The federal government has put in free rapid testing measures at residential aged care facilities but resisted calls by medical professionals to make the tests free universally. SA will allow the sale of rapid antigen tests in stores from today. Let’s dive in."

          "bodyText": "Some readers may remember, perhaps with a certain fondness, a song called Lily the Pink by the Scaffold (alias John Gorman, Mike McGear and myself) that was No 1 in the charts in 1968. The song was based on an old American folk song, and celebrated efficacious cures for mild ailments. Backing vocalists included some lesser-known figures from the world of music: Graham Nash (of the Hollies), Elton John (then Reg Dwight) and Tim Rice. Jack Bruce (of Cream) played bass guitar. It was the night before Christmas Eve, the year the song hit its peak. We were driving to Liverpool from London after recording it for an Eamonn Andrews show earlier that afternoon. The show was to be broadcast that night on the BBC. Time was very tight. In those days, of course, you couldn’t press record or save on the remote, you couldn’t “watch again”. Once the programme was transmitted, that was it. If you missed it, you missed it for ever. And we were running late. Would we get home in time to watch ourselves on television? Unlikely, as we were still on the foggy outskirts of Nantwich. Suddenly, seeing a light on in one of the houses, we parked outside, rushed to the door and rang the bell. A man in his late 20s opened it. “Excuse me, do you have a telly?” asked John, politely elbowing his way into the living room. “Blimey!” the man said, “It’s the Scaffold! But you can’t be here – you’re there on the TV screen!” Sure enough, there we were, bounding on to the set at Lime Grove in our white suits. The man ran to the foot of the stairs. “Janet,” he called. “Guess who’s down here? The Scaffold!” From upstairs came a muffled scream. “Janet is your biggest fan – she’ll be down as soon as she’s changed and put on her makeup. I’m Dave by the way.” When the song ended, we took a bow in the living room, thanked Dave for his kindness, shouted our goodbyes upstairs and drove back home to Liverpool. Many years later, the white suits long since hung out to dry, I was approached after a poetry reading at a headteacher’s conference in Coventry by a lady who introduced herself as Janet. She told me that she had never believed her husband when he told her about our flying visit. “Was it true?” she asked. “Oh, yes,” I said. Janet raised an eyebrow and came over all headmistressy. “Then why didn’t you wait a few minutes, knowing that I wanted to meet you?” “We wanted to, but we had to be back in Liverpool before it closed for the night.” “It doesn’t matter,” she said. “At first I was tempted to bin all your records. Then, remembering it was Christmas – a time for giving and forgiving – I forgave you.” As I walked away, suitably reprimanded, I remembered more clearly how John, Mike and I felt as we drove home that night. Thrilled at seeing ourselves on telly, of course, but also guilty about not saying hello to our biggest fan. We also vowed that next time, we would ask the BBC to book us into a decent hotel for the night. Safety in Numbers by Roger McGough is published by Penguin, £9.99"

          "bodyText": "José Galvão does not look much like an elf. At 79, he has the weather-burned face and strong labourer’s hands of a man born in the mountains of central Portugal. Yet, for months he’s been beavering away behind the scenes to bring to life what must be one of the world’s friendliest and least showy Christmas celebrations. Every Christmas for the past eight years, the 170 or so residents of Cabeça in the Serra de Estrela mountain range transform their remote village into a rustic winter wonderland. The idea sprang from a competition run in 2013 by the local council, but has since taken on a life of its own, attracting a growing flow of visitors from across Portugal every year. Sitting just off the central plaza with some of his old-boy friends, José breaks off his chinwag to show me the three-inch folding knife in his pocket. “I’m no expert, but I do a bit of carving,” he chortles through a gap-toothed smile. “We’ve all got to muck in, certo? Cabeça is the Christmas Village after all.” He is right on every count. Following his directions, I walk 100 metres or so down one of Cabeça’s narrow streets. Pop-up stores and market stalls line the route, which is busy with Portuguese day-trippers on the hunt for festive fun. I briefly stop at Loripão, a bakery from the next-door village, which has rented a villager’s front room for the fortnight’s celebrations. It’s a paradise of all things sweet and sugary, and its biggest seller by far is the bolo rei (king cake) – the rounded sugary bread topped with crystalised fruits that adorns every Portuguese sideboard at Christmas. Outside, decoration are strung between the square granite houses that characterise the local architecture. Everything is homemade, from the heart-shaped frames swaddled in ferns to the moss-covered stars studded with red berries. The only exception is the thin string of tiny, white Christmas lights that flows higgledy-piggledy between the houses, over the parish church, and around Café Dias – the only business in Cabeça that is open year-round. When the sun sets and the switch is flicked, the hilltop village – hemmed in as it is by steep forested slopes and blanketed in mid-winter darkness – lights up like the Star of Bethlehem. By the steps up to an ancient stone house, I find José’s yuletide contribution. It’s a loving attempt at creating the nativity family, with each figure, carved roughly from a thin tree trunk, about waist height. Pine-tree straight, they don’t have arms or legs, but each has a beatific countenance, graced with crossed eyes, wonky noses and winsome whittled smiles. Joseph even has a flowing, pine-leaf wig, while the baby Jesus is crowned with a nest of autumn leaves. Leaving the happy family, I head up the stairs into what an etched wooden sign describes as the Oficina de Natal (Christmas workshop). The single-room space is quite different from the tat-filled, depot-style emporiums that are the popular image of Santa’s workplace. There’s no shiny tinsel or tacky garlands, nor any plastic packaging or – praise the Lord and the Angel Gabriel – Christmas jingles or mawkish piped carols. Instead, as with the decorations that deck the village, the products for sale are resolutely artisanal. All are made from materials available in the hills around: painted pine cones and woollen baubles, wooden angels and bracken wreaths. It doesn’t take long for Portugal’s only “Christmas Village” to work its magic. Within minutes, the stresses of last-minute shopping and present wrapping dissipate. With an average age of about 68 and only three children under 15, Cabeça knows everything there is to know about taking things slow. I get into the groove with a gentle hike down into the valley. The steep, circular route takes me over terraces of crooked-armed olive trees and down to an ice-cold river. Abandoned stone settlements dot the path, a reminder of the centuries that this secluded community has lived through. The walk leaves me hungry. On Christmas Eve, millions of Portuguese sit down to an evening feast of bacalhau (salt cod) and boiled potatoes, followed by aletria (an egg-noodle dessert). But in landlocked Cabeça, hearty mountain fare dominates; caldo verde (vegetable broth), morcela (black pudding), alheira (a garlicky sausage stuffed with breadcrumbs), and pica pau (seasoned fried beef). I grab a rickety table in a pop-up restaurant in the basement of a two-storey house. Not so long ago, the low-roofed eatery would have been a home for cattle and sheep. The straw and manure are gone, but the stable-like atmosphere feels appropriate. Portugal’s Christmas Village may be steeped in back-to-basics nostalgia, but it’s far from staid. As well as soaking up the atmosphere (and the local aguardente liquors), visitors can enjoy a series of programmed events throughout the two-week season. Highlights include choral concerts, cooking classes and craft workshops. But Cabeça is not the only rural hideaway in Serra da Estrela that throws open its doors to visitors. The 42-strong Mountain Villages network arranges cultural celebrations throughout the year, such as a folk festival in Lapa dos Dinheiros in June, and summer sheep-blessings in Foldosa da Madalena. “It’s a way of not just keeping the traditions alive in these remote villages, but celebrating them,” says Célia Gonçalves, director of the Mountain Villages network and coordinator of the original competition that gave life to Portugal’s Christmas Village. “The pride the villagers get from showing off their culture like this is amazing.” With the night now long drawn in, it’s time to take my leave. Before going, I return one last time to pay my respects at Senhor Galvão’s nativity scene. The baby Messiah is still grinning gayly, his mountain home evidently glad tidings of great joy. The Christmas Village runs until 2 January. The trip was provided by the Center of Portugal Tourism Board (guided by Madomis Tours). Cabeça is a 20-minute taxi ride from Seia, which is well served by buses (Lisbon 4 hours, Porto 3.5 hours). Hotel Casa de Baixo, half an hour away in Alvoco das Várzeas, has doubles from €100 B&amp;B Five more Christmas-y places in Europe Vilnius, Lithuania Lisbon’s Praça do Comércio, New York’s Rockefeller Center, Strasbourg’s Place Kléber and Rio de Janeiro’s Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon are all famed for their annual Christmas tree extravaganzas. But vying to outdo them is the Cathedral Square in Vilnius, which since 2015 has played host to increasingly discombobulating arboreal creations. Featuring giant snowflakes, this year’s stunning exhibit comprises a 27-metre, icicle-white cone topped by a huge shining star. Past themes have included fairytales, chess and the colour purple. Tallinn, Estonia Every neighbourhood has that one house that is fully decked out with twinkly lights and illuminated reindeer. Well, in Tallinn, make that every house. And park. And square. And street. Estonia’s walled capital defies the seasonal darkness by drenching its medieval centre with more than 300 light installations. Especially luminescent is Vabaduse Square, where light fountains shoot upwards into the winter sky. Bruges, Belgium A favourite Christmas destination for decades, the canal-crossed Belgian city is pushing the boat out even more than usual this year with its city-wide Winter Glow festival. Take a stroll along the glittering “Light Trail” as it winds through the city’s cobbled, Christmas tree-lined streets. Take your pick from three Christmas markets: Market Square, Simon Steven Square and Zand Square. Colmar, France Don’t go to Disneyland Paris for a fairytale Christmas; the ancient Alsatian town of Colmar offers the real thing. With five separate markets, the town embraces the yuletide spirit with elfish gusto. As well as an 800 square-metre ice rink and an old-school carousel, check out the Christmas-themed wine cellars and gondola-riding children’s choir. Look out for the night watchman who walks the ramparts every night, as his predecessors have done since the middle ages. Prague, Czech Republic Many Christmases ago, Good King Wenceslas looked out over Prague and – so the carol goes – saw the snow lying “deep and crisp and even”. Today, few places are more lively than the Czech capital at yuletide, with the streets thronging with partygoers, shoppers and tourists throughout December. The city’s famous Christmas market is officially postponed this year, but pop-up Christmas stalls still abound and fixed venues such as Havel’s Market are tinselled up to the nines. One tradition not to miss is the lighting of Charles Bridge’s gas lamps at dusk (around 4pm) each day."

          "bodyText": "Aboriginal health services in the Northern Territory are shutting down over Christmas, prompting calls for the federal government to step in and provide local health support to communities that have been exposed to Covid. Health centres such as Anyinginyi health Aboriginal corporation, which is based in Tennant Creek and the Barkley region, where more than 130 people have tested positive, will close on Friday afternoon and remain closed until Wednesday morning. Northern Territory senator Malarndirri McCarthy says the shutdown was foreseeable and the federal government should step in to provide holiday cover. “It’s concerning that some health clinics in remote Central Australian communities are shutting down over the Christmas period,” the Yanyuwa woman told Guardian Australia. “The federal government should have had contingency plans to support the health of remote communities through the holiday period.” The NT recorded 10 new cases on Thursday, five of which were in Tennant Creek. Tennant Creek is now under a lockout order, which means that double-vaccinated people can move around provided they wear masks. Unvaccinated people, or those who have only received one dose, are still in lockdown. People who are fully vaccinated and can produce a negative rapid antigen test are allowed to leave the town, but only double-vaccinated essential workers are allowed into remote communities. The Northern Territory’s second dose vaccination rate currently sits at 83.7% for people aged 16 and over. But vaccination rates are much lower in the regions. As of last week, just 37% of people aged 16 and over in the Barkley region had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccination. Vaccination rates in communities such as Epenarra and Canteen Creek were even lower, with double dose rates of 20% and 26% respectively. “We have to be mindful that while the territory as a whole has reached its vaccination target, many remote communities are lagging behind,” McCarthy said. First Nations people were part of the first phase of the vaccine rollout, but lack of supplies combined with misinformation campaigns slowed the uptake. McCarthy said that misinformation would have been countered earlier if the federal government had funded public health campaigns in language at the start of the rollout. “It’s great to see First Nations health and media groups providing in-language messaging about vaccines, but we need to see a consistency of funding for this from the federal government,” she said. Anyinginyi has provided daily video updates on social media to explain the restrictions. Chair Ross Jakamarra Williams said that people who have been identified as close contacts of positive cases will be taken to Howard Springs to quarantine. “We know Covid is around us,” he said, in a message posted on the health service’s Facebook page on Thursday. “The government mob, police are doing contact tracing to check on whether some of us might be in close contact with someone who had Covid. Don’t panic, they are doing it for our safety and to protect our community for the virus. They will be taking us to Howard Springs for safety and for safety of our family and community. “Pack your bag with things that you really need and follow the instructions of the police. And once you’ve been tested negative you can come back. Remember we are in a pandemic. We are doing all of this for the safety of our family and our community.”"

          "bodyText": "We are going to put the blog to bed now – thank you so much for spending the second half of Thursday with me. Here were the big stories: A man died after a triple stabbing in Sydney. 20 Victorian Covid-19 testing centres closed due to huge lines. Victoria recorded 2,005 cases, NSW 5,715 and one death, Tasmania 26, Queensland 369, the ACT 85, the NT 10, SA 484 and WA had one new local Covid case. All Victorian frontline police to be equipped with Tasers. Indoor mask mandates to return in Victoria. Hunt says Omicron is not creating a serious increase of cases in ICU. NSW to mandate masks. Chant says roughly 80% of NSW Covid cases are Omicron variant. There were fires at Melbourne hotel housing refugees. And WA to introduce a mask mandate after a community case. And I’ll see you all again tomorrow! The Morrison government has told a tribunal there is “strong public interest” in preserving the secrecy of “business case” documents that may outline the nucleus of the unlawful robodebt scheme. IT expert Justin Warren won access to documents connected to the since-scrapped welfare debt recovery program under freedom of information laws in 2019, but he is yet to receive them after the government appealed against the decision. I suspect many separated families will be asking similar questions. Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne has announced Australia will provide $5m in emergency relief to help the people of the Philippines recover from the devastation caused by Super Typhoon Rai. As many as 2.6 million people have been affected by the typhoon, with thousands sheltering in evacuation centres and many still without access to fresh food and water, power, and basic services. “Australia will continue to partner with the Philippines Government and humanitarian organisations to respond to this disaster,” Payne said in a statement. “Our assistance will include: funding for the Philippines Red Cross and UN Population Fund to distribute relief supplies (including sleeping, shelter and water and hygiene kits) and essential child and maternal health services (including sexual and reproductive health kits) funding for the World Food Programme, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Organization for Migration to provide critical transportation and communications support to the Philippines Government for delivery of relief supplies funding for Australian NGOs already operating in the Philippines to deliver immediate lifesaving assistance (including food and non-food items, shelter and water and hygiene kits), protection and livelihood recovery activities funding for local NGOs to respond to the needs of particularly vulnerable groups in remote areas. “I would like to convey Australia’s condolences and heartfelt thoughts to those families in the Philippines who have lost loved ones or whose lives have been affected by this disaster.” Earlier today, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) put out a statement on Omicron, calling for a system-wide approach to preparing for more Covid cases. ACEM president, Dr Clare Skinner, said: Emergency physicians, nurses and other acute healthcare workers must be included in the conversations and planning for Covid-19 increases. Covid-19 surges have significant impacts on ED demand and workload, which are not reflected in reported numbers of patients admitted to hospital or ICU. Skinner said many of Australia’s emergency clinicians are anxious about Omicron. We experienced this anxiety when Covid-19 first appeared, and then again with Delta. The first waves were challenging, but we worked together, adapted our processes, and worst-case scenarios were avoided. So there are quite a few exposure sites: On 22 December: Aldi and Kmart at The Square Mirrabooka shopping centre and Vinnies Mirrabooka. On 19 December: McDonald’s Girrawheen, Perth Mess Hall, Connections Nightclub, and Geisha Nightclub. On 18 December: Dan Murphy’s Joondalup. On 17 December: the Bloody French restaurant in Subiaco and Palace Cinema Raine Square. On 16 December: the Galway Hooker pub, Scarborough Sunset Markets and WA Museum Boola Bardip. And that’s it for the WA presser, but sit tight and I will get the full list of current exposure sites. Sanderson says the backpacker and his girlfriend are being kept in hotel quarantine. They are in hotel quarantine, and at the moment the department is attempting to find a hotel quarantine for the four campers. Sanderson has been asked if WA’s hospitals and ICU departments are ready. We have made a significant investment in putting online a number of beds, and more than 200 will be online by the end of this year. We have the ability of 300 ICU beds and ventilators and have them staffed. If we put in place sensible public health measures and higher rates of vaccination, we think that will serve us well. The WA health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, is asked how long it will take for people to get results. We have increased testing capacity. [It should take] the same amount of time as it has previously. For some people it is a matter of hours, for others a couple of days, but generally, we are not expecting ... that to blow out at all. Dawson reiterates that anyone who has been in the Perth/Peel region from 16 December who has travelled out of the area will have to wear a mask inside unless in a private residence. Dawson says it is a $50,000 fine for nightclubs that open. “We have had actually good cooperation through the licensed premises,” he says. Dawson says there are no restrictions on the number of people in a home, but people should use common sense. In a private home, there is no restriction in terms of the numbers of people but, again, common sense has to prevail here, so we’re just asking people to use common sense in a private setting. But if you’re going shopping, if you’re going to do last-minute buying drinks etcetera, you will have to wear a mask. While it [comes into effect at] 6pm, it is an arbitrary rule to give businesses and people a chance. Dawson says people need to go and get tested if they have been to those venues or are feeling symptomatic. You do not know who you have been in contact with. The virus does not respect any venue, any road, it will go wherever it goes. Check on the website where those venues are and if you have been, if you are in contact with others that have been to any of these venues, then use your common sense, go and get tested. Clearly, get vaccinated if you have not been vaccinated. Commissioner of police Chris Dawson is up now. 100,000 people have now had the third dose, I know from our statistics, 165,000 others who have had five months lapsed and have not taken the booster. So have it. Testing clinics will be open tonight until 10pm and from 7am to 8pm tomorrow and Christmas Day, and 7am to 10pm Boxing Day. McGowan is asked why police had to use his phone pings to find him. He is 25 years of age and he is a backpacker and goes out a lot. We had to check his phone, knock on the door and tell him the bad news. McGowan says the man is symptomatic. The reason that he went and got tested is that he was unwell, and now the degree of unwellness, I don’t know. But that was the reason that he went and got tested, which is fortunate, and that’s the reason that we know about it now. McGowan says if WA has community spread the February opening day will become redundant. Obviously, if we have community spread of the virus, obviously the February 5 border opening in many ways becomes redundant. McGowan says “this may be the event” that ends WA’s Covid-free streak. I’ve said to you repeatedly over the course of the last couple of weeks, I hope that we make it to February 5 without community spread of the virus. We’ll be lucky to make it that far. This may be the event that provides us with community spread of the virus. ... And that’s why I’m saying to everybody, please go and get vaccinated as soon as you can. If you’re eligible for a third dose, go and get vaccinated. McGowan is asked if it could stretch on to NYE: We don’t know yet. We’ll see what we pick up and see what the health advice is. We’ll see if the testing brings any more cases to light. It’s four campers who are positive and have been all over the place. We’ll have to investigate that. The contact tracing teams will be working on all of these things now and as the minister said, there are a great many contact tracers now working on this. ... So we just want to track down any cases that might be out there and make sure that they’re dealt with appropriately. McGowan on the mask mandates: It’s from 6pm tonight: the mask-wearing mandate, the closure of nightclubs, the shutting down of the music festivals and the like, until 6am on Tuesday morning. McGowan says they believe it is Delta, not Omicron. We suspect that it is Delta but they have to do the whole genome sequencing to work out if it is the Omicron variant. At this point in time, we think that it is the Delta variant. If it is Delta, that’s less infectious than the Omicron variant. Whilst none of this is good news, at least it’s better than the more infectious [variant]. McGowan says if you leave Perth now you still have to wear a mask. I’m saying if you leave Perth now ... the requirement is, at least for the next 4.5 days, that you’re required to wear a mask. Now, that may extend. We’ll just see what we pick up through the testing clinics in the course of the next four days. McGowan says the backpacker is currently being interviewed. There are a lot of questions about when the backpacker came to Australia. WA doesn’t know, but as McGowan points out, there are a lot of backpackers who stayed in Australia over the course of the pandemic. The main priority is to find out where he’s been. Obviously, when you’ve been in the community for 12 days, particularly infectious from the 16th of December, you want to find out every single place that he went to. And I don’t know about you, but if you asked me where I’d been in the last 12 days, every single spot I went to, it’s hard to remember. So the main thing is that we track his movements entirely over the course of that period of time so that we can work out every single place that needs to be declared an exposure site. In terms of his arrival in Australia and the like, you know, I suppose we can ask those questions but the main priority at this point in time is trying to keep people safe. McGowan says they are acting in proportion to the risk. One truck driver who visited a service station and slept in his cab, we probably wouldn’t be doing this. But this is a backpacker who has been to multiple nightclubs, restaurants, bars with hundreds of people, and has been in the community for an extended period of time, so therefore, we are taking this action. McGowan says there are five close contacts currently. Five close contacts we know of, the backpacker’s girlfriend who has shown symptoms and a number of his housemates. The number of close contacts may grow, but at this point in time, in terms of casual contacts, that will [be] in the hundreds. McGowan is asked if it is mandatory for contacts to isolate while they wait for their test results. Close contacts need to isolate and get tested. That’s a two-week period. For casual contacts, it is isolation until you get a negative test. At the moment the vast majority, overwhelming majority of people are casual contacts, so they will need to isolate and get tested. Look, if they have to isolate over Christmas Day, that’s an unfortunate reality, a sad reality, but the reality of Covid. Someone has asked if it will lead to further cases. You don’t know with COVID ... That’s why we are encouraging everyone who has been to any of the exposure sites, anyone who is showing symptoms, please go and get tested. “We are ramping up the staff, expanding hours. They will be open until 10pm tonight, and depending on demand, open until 10pm tomorrow night. And 10pm on Christmas Eve and Christmas. If you see the sites he went to – nightclubs, shopping centres, bars, museums, restaurants, he has been to lots of places, so lots of people who have potentially been exposed. McGowan is asked if he is disappointed in the backpacker because he didn’t get tested earlier. He is a backpacker. He felt unwell. At the time he left Queensland, there had only been a handful of cases in the whole state reported when he left Queensland and came here. I don’t think he would have been thinking he could have been Covid-positive, but it turns out he was. McGowan is asked if visitor restrictions will be put in place for Christmas Day. Christmas Day will proceed as normal. The mask-wearing mandate applies in all public indoor settings, workplaces, shopping centres, hospitality venues, public transport. All indoor settings – hospitals, wherever you might be, except for family homes, those sorts of family lunches and get-togethers. Obviously we are not going to put in place a mask mandate for those. McGowan is asked why WA is not going into lockdown. We are at around 84% double-dosed over 12s, but the over 16s it is obviously even higher. I expect this event will mean far more vaccination occurs, so here we are at very high levels of vaccination – in fact, almost world-leading vaccination. This gives us a level of protection. That’s why I have been saying it, banging on about it, every day for months on end – please go and get vaccinated because you never know what’s around the corner. He came in one hour before the hard border went up with Queensland. He has arrived. We hope there hasn’t been community spread, but there may have been. That’s why we are taking the steps to protect ourselves if there has been spread of the virus. McGowan says the type of venues the Covid-positive person visited and the length of time he was infectious means they have to take these steps. I think [the number of contacts] is in the hundreds. As you can see, he is a backpacker who went out and went to nightclubs, bars, museums, restaurants, and it is in the hundreds. That’s why we are so concerned. He has been to events where there has been lots of dancing, lots of fun, lots of interaction by lots of people in close proximity. That’s why we are concerned about it. Some people are saying we are going too far in our reaction to this because it is one case, but the venues he has been to and the length of time he has been infectious means we have to take these steps. McGowan says this was not what anyone wanted before Christmas. I know this is not the news we wanted to hear two days before Christmas, but unfortunately this is the reality of Covid-19. No matter how hard our border controls ... [Covid] can sneak into Western Australia. We now need to face the potential of community transmission in Perth and Peel. That is why I am asking everyone to please do the right thing over this period. McGowan is introducing some changes to the Perth and Peel region: From six o’clock tonight until at least six o’clock in the morning on Tuesday, December 28 the following rules will apply across Perth and Peel. Masks will be mandatory in all public indoor settings including workplaces, shopping centres, hospitality venues and public transport. The mask mandate will not apply to the home and will not apply people doing vigorous indoor exercise. We are recommending masks be worn outside when you cannot physically distance, so we’re urging people just to use common sense. High-risk, large public events like music festivals will be cancelled during this period and all nightclubs closed. All dancing is banned except for weddings. In addition, the mask rules will apply to anyone who has been in Perth or Peel since Thursday, 16 December and are now located in a different part of the state. McGowan has listed multiple exposure sites – which I will post at the end – and says if you’ve visited them, you need to get tested. The backpacker has been checking in which has enabled us to identify a comprehensive picture of the man’s movements since his arrival in Perth. This has allowed contact tracers to reach out to hundreds of people who have checked in at the same location. It is also an important reminder for us to keep checking in, now more than ever. Obviously some people have dropped away from checking in, but this proves that we need to make sure that if one does the right things that we can keep track of any potential outbreaks. Health staff are very busy working to piece together a clearer picture of the level of risk to our community, but as we know when it comes to Covid, the situation can change very dramatically and very quickly. McGowan says the backpacker is not vaccinated; his girlfriend is symptomatic and has been moved into hotel quarantine. Further investigations have confirmed he has been living with four other people at a house in Girrawheen. These four people have been camping, but they have since been contacted and are now undergoing testing. They will also be directed into hotel quarantine. Health has identified several exposure sites across Perth. Premier Mark McGowan is up. WA has one new local Covid case. In this case it is a backpacker, case 1133, who travelled into Western Australia from Queensland earlier this month, a 25-year-old man who was originally from France. He felt sick on Sunday and got tested yesterday. The result came through this morning and it was a strong positive. The advice at this point is that it is unlikely to be the Omicron strain and therefore more likely to be the Delta variant. Investigations have confirmed the backpacker came into Western Australia 11 days ago on Sunday night December 12. The WA premier, Mark McGowan and health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, will hold a press conference soon with updates on the pandemic. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) has welcomed the reintroduction and extension of vital Covid-19 public health measures. Dr Jacqueline Small, president-elect of the RACP, has expressed relief governments have moved in line with the RACP’s recommendations and those of the country’s senior public health advisers. “What we are seeing with Omicron is that it spreads at lightning speed, and if we don’t take action now, we will have even more challenging times ahead of us,” Small said. “The unprecedented climb in case numbers in NSW shows why we urgently needed public health measures to be put back in place. “We strongly welcome the state governments’ decisions to reintroduce or maintain mask mandates, in addition to QR code check-ins and density limits. Modelling by the Doherty Institute earlier this week had shown the need to remain flexible and prepared to reintroduce certain public health measures, Small said. “We have to ensure that people can continue living their lives and celebrate this time of the year with their loved ones while minimising risks to their health and safety. “These proportionate actions help keep all in our community safer and ensure the health system can meet the needs of those who become unwell,” Small said. Queensland’s deputy premier, Steven Miles, has called in an application mining magnate Clive Palmer made to a regional council to build a large coal-fired power station. Palmer’s application to the Barcaldine regional council was seen by conservationists as an attempt to sidestep consultation on the plan, which Miles himself had suggested could be a “thought bubble.” Miles said this afternoon: “Barcaldine regional council has never assessed a project of this size. This call-in allows the state to address a broader range of matters than the council was able to under their planning scheme. “This will include seeking public comment on the project. I want to make sure the community get their say on a project of this scale.” Palmer’s Waratah Coal company made the application in February 2020 to build a 1,400-megawatt power station near the tiny town of Alpha, about 390 kilometres west of Rockhampton. Waratah Coal has an undeveloped but approved coal mine project about 30 kilometres north of Alpha, and Waratah coal says the mine project is dependent on the power plant. After Miles said last month he intended to call the project in, Waratah Coal wrote that the power plant would have lower emissions than other plants and provide jobs and cheap power to the state, and said the application through the council was appropriate. Dave Copeman, the director of Queensland Conservation Council, said the project should be stopped. “Minister Miles has acted responsibly by calling in this project. Proper government assessment will find what Queenslanders already know; we cannot build a new coal-fired power station in the face of the worsening climate crisis. “New coal in Queensland would lock consumers into higher prices and get in the way of our chance to fully embrace the opportunities of becoming a renewable energy superpower. “Queenslanders want a vibrant and innovative future that takes advantage of new renewable energy technology, not outdated, toxic coal-fired power.” While we’re on SA – I have this from AAP: South Australia’s Covid-19 cases have more than doubled in 24 hours, setting a record for the seventh consecutive day as the paramedics union warns the hospital system isn’t coping. SA Health reported 484 new cases on Thursday, taking the number of new infections since the state’s borders opened a month ago to 1307. Seven people are in hospital with one man in his 30s on a ventilator. SA now has 1214 active infections, most being managed in home isolation. The big jump in cases came as the Ambulance Employees Association said suspected and positive coronavirus patients were kept waiting in ramped ambulances outside the Royal Adelaide Hospital overnight in further evidence of the stress on the healthcare system. Taking to social media on Thursday, the Ambulance Employees Association said one crew was sent to three “severely unwell” Covid-19 patients overnight. It said two patients were ultimately transported in one ambulance while another crew eventually arrived to take the third patient. “Treating paramedics almost ran out of oxygen, they ran out of medications,” the association said. “They were calling for intensive care back-up with none available. Our healthcare system is not coping.” But the premier, Steven Marshall, said all the patients taken to hospital were treated appropriately. “They were triaged, they were treated within the clinically appropriate time frame,” he said. “Our clinicians treat people in accordance to their acuity and the advice I’ve received is that’s exactly what happened.” Marshall said of the four cases transferred to hospital overnight, three were from the same family, so it was acceptable for them to travel in the same ambulance. More on the SA Covid situation here: Western Australian fire authorities are preparing for maximums of more than 40 degrees across WA in the coming days. Fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, addressed the media a little earlier and warned total fire bans are likely to be introduced soon. The forecast weather conditions present significant challenges from a fire weather point of view. [There are] some challenges around the health and wellbeing of those people responding, so it is important from our point of view that everyone plays a role. Total fire bans are likely to be placed in certain parts of the south-western state. They get decided around 4pm on each day for the next day, and people need to monitor WA to make sure that they are aware what bans are [in place] in the area they will be in on any day. Comments from Chris Minns, NSW Labor leader on rule changes: NSW Labor welcomes the decision by the NSW Government to back our calls for a mask mandate, and to reintroduce the 2SQM rule. We’ve already said this is a health crisis and is above politics. Whatever levers we can pull to get this pandemic under control, short of a lockdown, should be used. We all want to avoid a lockdown, and today’s announcements are sensible steps that the community, experts, and Labor have been calling for. We are in a position of strength to get through this, with some of the highest vaccination rates in the world. The NSW transport minister, David Elliott, says he has put brakes on the easing of capacity limits on public transport until January next year. In a statement, he said: This afternoon I instructed Transport for NSW Secretary Rob Sharp to cease the further easing of customer capacity limits on public transport services until late January 2022. Customer capacity limits and green dots across all modes of public transport were set to be removed on Friday 31 December 2021. In light of the current environment and measures announced by the Premier today, I have directed this work to be delayed to keep commuters and staff safe. The current capacity limit of 75 per cent of customers on any public transport service will remain in place. Masks are mandatory for anyone using public transport services across the network. SA Health says seven people are now in hospital, including a child. One man in his 30s is in the Royal Adelaide Hospital on a ventilator. Two new people are in hospital. Two separate fires have broken out in a hotel housing refugees and asylum seekers in Melbourne. Shortly after 1.30pm on Thursday, fire crews and police were called to the five-storey Park Hotel in Carlton – where 34 asylum seekers are being held – after an automatic fire alarm was triggered. Wearing breathing apparatus, some of the 30 firefighters on scene “entered the building and worked to contain the fires, bringing the incident under control at 2.11pm”. Crews are still on scene extinguishing flames and ventilating the building, a Fire Rescue Victoria spokeswoman said. There were fires on the third and fourth levels of the hotel, including one in a room. It is not clear how the fires started. While the FRV spokeswoman said “all occupants were safely evacuated” and some patients were transferred to ambulances, Ian Rintoul, spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, said the asylum seekers, who are staying on levels two and three of the building, were evacuated to level one. Mehdi Ali, one of the asylum seekers being held at the hotel, tweeted that authorities were “keeping us in the building instead of taking us to a safe place”. Victoria Police and FRV will investigate the cause of the fires. Additional reporting: Ben Doherty OK, that was a big presser for NSW. Let’s recap on the big changes: From midnight tonight, masks indoors will be mandatory – that’s until January 27. Next year, rapid antigen tests will be provided for free, but how that will be rolled out is yet to be determined. QR codes will be brought back in a limited way in low-risk settings. People have been asked to work from home if they can. The one person per two square metres rule in indoor hospitality will be reintroduced from 27 December to 27 January. And people in the state are being asked that, unless they are feeling unwell or they have been specifically told to get a PCR test, don’t get one. Hazzard is asked about visitors to households and if they will be restricted for NYE. The phrase I have used is ‘never say never’. We are in a pandemic, one in 100 years; we are keeping it under review, we will make changes as necessary and take public health advice where appropriate. At this stage my view is, Christmas, you know what? Last year we had the northern beaches locked down for Christmas, then we had parts of the eastern suburbs locked down, and parts of western Sydney – we need a break. We need people, as the premier said many times, to take some responsibility for themselves, but we don’t want to impose unnecessary restrictions. Take it easy folks, don’t have too many people over to your house. Open the windows. Hazzard says his advice to the federal government is that NSW “will do our bit”, but he is glad the feds are offering GPs and pharmacists more money. If you’re a pharmacist and already tired from two years of the pandemic, 23 months on Christmas Day, you’re only making $16 a pop for a job, you won’t be too keen because you’ll make a lot more money selling things across the counter, doing prescriptions. The fact the federal government have now said they will step up and pay additional funds to GPs and pharmacists – we should say thank you to the prime minister and thank you to the federal health minister, and hopefully that’ll make a difference. Hazzard says the majority of cases are young people. 10- to 39-year-olds occupy 70% of all of our positive cases. He says one positive case in Newcastle resulted in 250 positive cases. Look after yourself and don’t actually start hanging too close together with people you probably don’t know all that well. As we saw in Newcastle, one person went for a party boat and turned 250 people into positive cases in one nightclub in one night. We are striking a balance of personal responsibility – get sensible, folks, don’t try and mingle too closely with people you don’t know. In some cases, even with people you know. But also, if you can, get vaccinated. Hazzard is back up now: I’d like to see the federal government get advice from Atagi to bring forward the vaccinations [boosters] from the five-month point to the four-month point. Perrottet says the government hopes to offer free rapid antigen tests in 2022. Perrottet has just been asked about elective surgeries – he says the state is catching up. At the moment we have a very strong position and the health team – and I’ll ask a minister to make further comments on this, to give more direction – we are still bringing forward and catching up to those elective surgeries that we had to delay from last year. Perrottet says the pandemic is a balance of health and economic choices. This pandemic is a balancing act and we balance the health needs with the mental health needs, with the economic needs. The decisions of the NSW government has kept our state strong. People are working, being kept safe, low death rate, ICU presentations are incredibly manageable at the moment, particularly given where our case numbers are. We are in a strong position in our state, and the slight changes we have made as we move through until 27 January are modest but cautious, to make sure New South Wales gets through the holiday season ... they will play some role but ultimately, personal responsibility plays the key role. Someone has asked about NSW businesses having to shut if they have a case, because of staff isolating. Perrottet: The alternative is we close everything down. It’s very similar to the challenges we have seen in the school system. We brought kids back into the classroom as quickly as possible which meant from time to time, schools had to close. That was a challenge and difficult, but in the main, schools remained open. We believe the changes made to the close contact definition have made a marked improvement on that front and I’ve heard from the hospitality industry that they have seen a change, but they will be offset as cases increase. This will be a challenging time as we go through 2022 with difficulties, but in the main, we are in a much stronger position. I couldn’t hear the question, but I think it was about the backflip on some measures. Perrottet says: We have always said we tailor the settings ... we have said that through the entire pandemic and that’s what we’re doing today. The concern we have seen [in the past] 48 hours, it is primarily based on health staff and we want to ensure the system is resourced. There are many other pleasing factors so when you look at what we are seeing today, there are a lot more good than bad. The early evidence in relation to Omicron is it is five times less severe than Delta, which is incredibly pleasing. We have seen an increase in ICU but it is very manageable ... we always have our number one priority here in NSW to keep our people safe as we learn to live alongside the virus. We just ask everybody across our state to be cautious over Christmas, treat everyone with kindness and respect, we will get through the other side and we will have a strong 2022. Perrottet is again stressing that if people get pinged from the QR code check-ins, but they don’t feel unwell – they do not need to get a test. Especially when we have a situation when many people in NSW are travelling around the country for holidays to see families, we are doing everything we can to get those test results back as quickly as possible. But if we can reduce the people lining up on those queues who don’t need to do so, that will be very much appreciated from the government and everybody across the state who really does require ... one of those tests. “The last point in relation to that – I look forward to working with the other state premiers about minimising or reducing the time because it is the taxpayers [who] are ... paying for those tests, for people to travel interstate, and the queues are substantial and slowing down the testing but also affecting the health response. Only get a test if you feel unwell or are contacted by health authorities, he said. Perrottet is asking people to use “personal responsibility and common sense and be cautious over the Christmas break.” Perrottet: I think the changes we have made are modest, cautious and precautionary, to make sure, as these case numbers increase over this period of time, that we get through the summer ... and NSW will continue to lead our state out of the pandemic. With the QR codes, the issue for national cabinet’s decision yesterday – it became very apparent to me different states are in different positions. We have much greater cases especially of Omicron; other states aren’t in that position yet but will be eventually. In those circumstances, the effectiveness of having QR codes in every single retail store may work in a WA setting but not necessarily in a NSW or Victoria setting. Perrottet is back – he says the changes they are making today “are proportionate”. While we are seeing low numbers in ICU, very manageable numbers in ICU, it is more in relation to making sure that our health system is able to be well-manned during the summer period. We have already heard from David in relation to NSW Ambulance over the summer months, there are challenges that come our way ... In relation to masks, we are seeing pretty much right across the board, 85% of people wearing masks, that’s incredibly positive. NSW Ambulance acting commissioner David Dutton is up and he is asking people to only call an ambulance in an emergency. Yesterday, we answered an emergency 000 call every 24 seconds. We are asking to save 000 for saving lives. I want to be clear: if somebody is unconscious, if someone has chest pain, somebody has shortness of breath, if there are injuries as a result of a motor vehicle accident – please call emergency 000. I want to be equally clear on the following points: if you can’t sleep, if you have a toothache, if you have a splinter, if you want to check the opening hours of testing clinic, or follow-up on a Covid-19 vaccination, please do not call emergency 000. Those calls that I just referenced potentially delay NSW Ambulance mounting an emergency response, to a member of the community that really needs it. Chant says get vaccinated and wear a mask. Only get tested if you have symptoms or [if] health directs you to, or you know you had contact with someone that is Covid-19 positive. In the current settings, NSW Health will only be contacting and focusing our efforts on people that have entered or worked in high-risk settings. So what we are doing currently as we test people who have a positive result, we give them advice about what they need to do to self-isolate. We also ask them to fill in an online questionnaire. Chant asks people that they dance and sing outside over the festive season. We are introducing those density restrictions and hospitality settings and discouraging activities we know are associated with increased transmission: singing, dancing, things often associated with fun. At this time of year we have to tell it as it is in terms of what are the things associated with risk, especially indoors. Please take those activities outdoors, with lots of social distancing. Chant says more than about 70% of cases are in the age group of 10 to 39-year-olds. It’s really sad to see some very young people in ICU who are not vaccinated. So, again, a big callout to everyone – just because you’re young, this message doesn’t mean you’re necessarily going to be lucky enough to have the mild disease. You can be hit hard. Please get vaccinated. Get your first vaccine, get your second and get your booster. I want to talk about the transmission settings. So at the moment, Covid is circulating in a very young population relatively. We’ve got Kerry Chant now, who says NSW is currently experiencing both the circulation of Delta and the Omicron variant of Covid. Approximately 80% of our cases are currently Omicron. The increase in Omicron largely explains the steep rise in cases. The Delta case numbers did start to rise in mid-December, but we’re now seeing the Delta proportion of cases declining and that large uptick being accounted for by Omicron. Pulling together multiple pieces of evidence from overseas countries such as South Africa and the UK, and using some of our own emerging data, it indicates that infection with Omicron is likely to be milder than infection with Delta, with the risk of hospitalisation being around 60% to 80% less than for Delta. But the issue is the increased transmissibility, leading to high case numbers, and the impact this is having on vulnerable settings, vulnerable people and critical workforces, such as our health and aged care workforce. Hazzard says people who are unvaccinated are still in the ICU. They need to take the opportunity and get the vaccine while they can. In the last couple of weeks, we get the daily announcements on how many people are in ICU but I want to stress people come in and people go out from the ICU. Obviously that’s a good thing when they go out of the ICU, but we had about 60 people in ICU over the last two weeks and 65%, more than two-thirds, are unvaccinated people. Unvaccinated people. My message to those out there who think this is still some sort of pixie-land argument, that it doesn’t exist, is: it does exist. And you might be one of those two-thirds who have ended up in our ICUs in the next week or two or three, it might be you. This is your chance to take it seriously. Hazzard says people need to make sure they get boosters. Because we do know that particularly for older people, and those who had AstraZeneca, whilst it was fabulous for the time, it does have its challenges now [with] its waning effect on immunity, so we need to get a booster. I was one of those. Hazzard says people are also calling out ambulances when they don’t have to and that needs to stop. It’s frustrating for me to hear that ambulances are being called out at a time when we’re so busy dealing with Omicron. Our hospitals and frontline staff are so busy ... people are still thinking that ambulances are for something other than emergencies. They’re not. Ambulances are here for emergencies. Hazzard: If you’re going visiting over the next few days, please don’t go out and just get a PCR test for the sake of it, because next time when you do need a PCR test, seriously, you may not be able to get it because too many people go out and use our pathology system to that extent. Hazzard says testing is “a bit of an issue”. There are too many tests. Go back 22 months, we were excited when we were up around 40,000 tests. We’re now four times that amount, 160,000 tests. But it is sucking the energy out of all the frontline pathology workers, the people who are doing it, doing the tests, people who are then doing the pathology examinations, the administration, people who are sending the details out. I would ask everybody to listen very carefully to the message that if you don’t need to go – if you haven’t got symptoms or haven’t received a message telling you that you must have a PCR test – probably you don’t need to have a PCR test. Move your celebrations into the open air, Hazzard says. Anything you can do over the next few days, if you’re having people around to your house, try and do it out on the balcony or backyard, or if you can’t do that, open all the windows. What we do know is Omicron is not terribly successful when it’s out in the fresh air. It tends to get us when we’re inside in closed environments. Be very cautious. Brad Hazzard is up now – he says “it’s too early” to tell what will happen with Omicron. The Omicron virus seems to be challenging, it is very transmissible. So far it hasn’t been causing the level of anxiety medically that previous variants did. But we’re on high alert. The government is on high alert. I think the community should be on high alert. We don’t know yet. It’s too early. Perrottet: I do know there has been a fair bit of frustration out there. Many people waiting hours in queues, particularly as we come into Christmas. We’re doing everything we can to alleviate that pressure. In addition to the PCR testing, if you’re unwell and those people from New South Wales ... if you aren’t feeling unwell, please do not get a PCR test. Perrottet is now addressing the testing times – he says if you are not unwell, but get a ping through the QR code system, please don’t get a PCR test. At the moment what we’re seeing is that many people across the state who are asymptomatic and do not feel unwell are lining up for a PCR test. This is putting enormous pressure on the system and I thank everybody for their patience as we go through this period of time. But we need to make sure those people who need to get tested get tested in a timely way. If you aren’t feeling unwell ... [if] you receive a notification through the QR code system, the position that we have here in New South Wales is monitor for symptoms. If you do feel unwell, at that point in time, please go and get a PCR test. Perrottet is now talking about the change in QR codes. Many of you will be aware we’ve had those QR codes in place for some time. We kept them in place for high-risk settings. What we will do in relation to retail settings and lower-risk settings is we’ll bring them back in a limited way. The reason we removed those QR codes I think has been slightly misunderstood. It’s not in terms of opening up the economy, it’s to provide the support to the health system. Perrottet says there will also be density limits. We’ll be moving from hospitality venues indoors to two square metres from December 27 to January 27. And also the indoor face mask requirement will also be in place until January 27 as well. That’s just to ensure, as we move through this period of time, we do have that support for our health officers over this summer and holiday period. In addition to that, we’re encouraging people not to mingle ... when you’re out and about at a restaurant or cafe or a pub or a club, please, where possible, don’t mingle. We know that from a case we’ve seen in Newcastle, that singing and dancing and the like has been part of that increase in spread. So we just ask everybody use personal responsibilities, please be cautious as we move through this phase. Perrottet says masks will be mandated inside. As of midnight tonight, we will be requiring that masks are worn in indoor settings. We are encouraging people, particularly over the holiday period, if you can work from home, please work from home. Perrottet says, “it looks like the Omicron [variant] will be five times less severe than Delta.” Perrottet says NSW will be getting 300,000 boosters a week in January. That will be crucial. It’s our best line of defence as we move through this next phase of the pandemic. I want to thank everybody who has gone out and made the effort. Perrottet is talking about boosters, and says the numbers are good. If it’s been five months since your second vaccination, the booster shot is key to keeping you and your family safe, and to see now that health has administered 158,000 booster shots as of December 22 is incredibly pleasing. I congratulate the prime minister and the federal treasurer for their decision yesterday to provide additional financial support for our GPs and pharmacists who will be taking a heavier load when it comes to the booster shots over this period of time, particularly over the next four months. Perrottet begins by thanking frontline health workers. [They] have done an amazing job over the last two years, and particularly going through this most recent period of time, with significant vaccination and our booster shots required. I want to thank you on behalf of the government and the people of our great state for the continued effort in keeping our people safe. Perrottet is up now. We are just waiting for NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, who is expected to address media any moment now ... Here’s more on QLD’s numbers – one person in ICU. Melbourne airport is now only doing pre-departure Covid-19 testing for international flights on the day of departure: From AAP: Queensland planning minister, Steven Miles, will scrutinise an application for a controversial coal-fired power station proposed by Clive Palmer’s Waratah Coal. Waratah, a subsidiary of Palmer’s Mineralogy, submitted a development application for the power plant with Barcaldine regional council in central Queensland. The application was made under a 2006 planning scheme that does not require public consultation. But Miles has called in the application, saying this will make sure a thorough planning assessment can be made on the project and the community get their say. “Barcaldine regional council has never assessed a project of this size,” he said. “This call in allows the state to address a broader range of matters than the council was able to under their planning scheme.” Calling in the project places approval of the power station in the state government’s hands. An earlier notice proposing the call in gave people the chance to make representations which had been considered together with the council’s initial assessment. A Northern Territory environmental group has won a court battle over a Morrison government grant to develop the Beetaloo basin onshore gas field. The Environment Centre NT argued in federal court that the $21m grant for exploration wells was legally unreasonable on multiple grounds. Justice John Griffiths on Friday rejected arguments that the resources minister, Keith Pitt, should have considered the risks of increasing greenhouse gas emissions when he made the grants. And we’ve just found out there will be a NSW Covid update at 2.30pm with premier Dominic Perrottet, minister for health Brad Hazzard, CHO Dr Kerry Chant, and NSW Ambulance acting commissioner David Dutton. A big lineup there! In closing Fyles thanks frontline health workers. In closing want to acknowledge our frontline staff. They’ve worked incredibly hard. It has been a gruelling 20 months and I think all of us thought, heading into the Christmas period, that would be an opportunity to take stock and prepare for the new year, but Covid is here and it has proved a significant challenge. So from the centre to the top end, whether it’s people delivering vaccination, people in our hospitals, or in our quarantine facilities, thank you for all your efforts to our Aboriginal medical organisations. Thank you, and now can we wish you a safe and merry Christmas. NT health minister, Natasha Fyles, says vaccinations are the best gift you can give for Christmas. While it is slowly creeping up ... We’re seeing a number each day, but we certainly would like to see more people vaccinated, and I again reiterate my message about how safe and effective the vaccine is. Of those new cases, five of them are linked to the Tennant Creek outbreak and locally acquired. Currently, there are 11 people in hospital with Covid and one, a woman in her 60s, is in ICU. And that’s it from Hunt. To recap: Hunt said the public health measures discussed at national cabinet had started in some states and territories. 1.8 million Australians have received their booster shot. And while Omicron is becoming the dominant strain, we are not seeing an increase in the seriousness of cases in ICU. Hunt has pivoted from attacking Labor to thank Australians for getting boosters. “Having said that, I want to thank Australians for coming forward to be vaccinated. “Thank Australians for coming forward in record numbers to be boosted, 167,000 boosters yesterday, 54,000 of those in pharmacies. The states have indicated they’ll be stepping up and restoring the capacity, which understandably was wound down when the first and second doses were being completed. “We can do this. We know how to do this as a country. We have done this before. We’ll do it again, no change in ventilation numbers on the latest advice I have, we’ll keep Australians safe, but Australians are doing their part as well. Thank you very much.” Hunt has been asked about remarks Anthony Albanese made this morning about testing sites. This is what Albanese said: “Overwhelmingly, people are waiting in queues because the governments haven’t prepared. The federal government shut down a whole lot of the testing areas.” Hunt has said this is false. “For Mr Albanese to make a false, untrue, incorrect, inaccurate statement, either without thinking or deliberate knowing it was a lie, is the act of someone who is not fit to be prime minister,” Hunt said. Hunt was asked if Vic was prudent to implement mask mandate indoors. “It’s entirely a matter for Victoria.” Hunt has been asked about Victoria mandating masks: “We’re encouraging people, as a result of the advice to national cabinet, to use masks in indoor settings. “It’s a matter for states and territories. But states and territories with their public health orders, whether it’s the QR codes in New South Wales, the masks in Victoria, have responded well.” “I think that it’s very important to show that national cabinet is delivering safer outcomes, but without constraining people’s lives. Across the board, I welcome the actions of the different states.” Hunt is asked about why we are seeing private health providers delay their premiums. “In terms of private health providers – one of the things that we have done is encourage them to have as low a premium as possible, and where they can give people no change for longer, then that’s even better. “And I’m pleased that they’ve responded. The lowest change in 21 years and if some of them have deferred that change, that means people are paying lower premiums for longer. “And so, I think that that is a really good outcome.” Hunt has been asked about how many aged care residents have had their boosters. “We’ve had over 1,500 aged care facilities receive their boosters. “Every aged care facility that has been able and willing to receive, because they were eligible and they were ready, has had their deliveries done so far. “Those that are still to be done are on the basis of their own timing. And so, we’re well ahead of schedule. We’re about 300 facilities ahead of where we’d anticipated and expected to have been.” Hunt is asked if we are equipped to deal with any change to the booster timeline and if hospitals can deal with Omicron. “I have requested that Atagi plans and focuses on continuous review about the booster program. They’ve already shortened it from six months to five months. “There’s the eligibility period. And in that time, what we’ve seen is 1.15 million doses in a 10-day period delivered with regard to boosters. And that’s now tracking at over 160,000 a day.” On Omicron: “But ventilation a week ago was 54 patients with Covid around Australia. As of yesterday, there were still 54 patients on ventilation with Covid. “So despite the increase in case numbers, there had been zero increase in ventilated patients numbers. ICU – what we see is that a week ago, there were 109 patients in ICU. “As of yesterday, the figures provided at midday today by the National Incident Centre, there were 112. So an increase of only three patients in a week. So the two things that we know - the hospital system is well equipped ... “The second thing is, despite an increase in case numbers, we’re not seeing an increase in the serious cases of ICU or ventilation in any significant way, with no increase in ventilation on the latest numbers that I have. “Now, these things can change. There can be a lag. So we’re fully prepared and I don’t want to make false promises on that.” And Hunt says public health measures discussed at national cabinet yesterday have started in some states and territories. “The states and territories have begun to implement the measures discussed yesterday at national cabinet. “There are measures in relation to QR codes in New South Wales and masks in some states and territories. “In terms of vaccination clinics in Victoria. That’s matched with the additional $10 for vaccinations by GPs and pharmacists under the commonwealth system which is being paid immediately as of today. “So, I want to thank all of those people for coming forward. They’re helping themselves. They’re helping their friends, their family and they’re helping to protect the country.” Hunt says there’s been a 2.7% increase in private health insurance - which is the lowest in 21 years. “At the same time, I’m really pleased that we’ve just achieved the lowest change in private health insurance fees in 21 years. “A 2.7% increase. We’ve had progressively the lowest change during my time in 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and now 21 years. “And so, the lowest change in private health insurance in 21 years. That’s good for families. That’s good for private health insurance and what we’ve seen as a result is five successive quarters of an increase in private health insurance uptake. “It takes the pressure off the public hospitals. It shares the load across the system and it means that the Australian model of public and private - it’s not as reliant on the public as the UK system. “It’s not as reliant on the private as the US system. It means that the Australian model is not just being sustained, but it’s strengthening.” Greg Hunt is speaking in Melbourne now – he says the rates of bulk billing are up and that’s a good thing. “We have had bulk billing increase to 89.6% in the July-to-September quarter. “So the last quarter is up 0.7% in terms of bulk billing. And what does bulk-billing mean? “It means that now almost nine in ten visits to the doctor are completely free for people. And that’s a really extraordinary national achievement. “Again, thank you to our GPs and our clinicians right across the country. This is approximately 7.9% higher than for the same period immediately prior to the Coalition coming into government. So a nearly 8% increase in bulk-billing over the life of the Coalition. “It just means more services, more people, more people able to access the doctor without having to dip into their pocket.” With that, I will pass you on to Cait Kelly, who will keep you company for the rest of the afternoon. We are still waiting to hear from Greg Hunt, who was due to front the media at 12.30pm. Over in the ACT, testing numbers have eased at Nicholls but Mitchell’s drive through testing centre is still at capacity. As of 12pm: Mitchell drive through testing clinic (open 8am to 10pm): at capacity Garran testing clinic (open 7.30am to 9pm): 3 hours 30 minutes+ Kambah drive through testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 2 hours+ Nicholls testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 15 minutes+ Still at the Victorian press conference, Foley says fines for mask wearing will vary between $500 and $1,000. There has been no confirmation as to whether he accepted all the advice of the chief health officer but this will eventually be tabled in parliament under the pandemic legislation. The ABC is reporting two positive cases have been identified in Alice Springs. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is strolling in to throw in his two cents around the same time as Greg Hunt (due to front the media at 12.15pm). The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says it would have preferred mask-wearing to be a choice, but recognises it will allow venues to stay open without density limits: A reporter asks if Victoria is looking at going in the same direction as Western Australia, which has become the first jurisdiction to mandate a third vaccination dose. Sutton: I have got no advice on that at the moment. I think people are super keen to get the booster. We need to make it available. We need to ensure that appropriate numbers are available and then see how the booster coverage goes. A reporter asks the difference between getting a booster at four months verses five. Sutton: We can’t say with absolute certainty, and that is why this is not an easy space to provide advice in order to lead a position, but we need to respond to what is in front of us right now as an immediate and urgent concern. That is my view, and I know that people are at risk without the booster dose and I want to see them, especially those that are most at risk ... to have access to the booster ... we can say for certain that people who have not received the booster are at greater risk of dying and ICU. Reporter: So the difference between four and five months? Sutton: The difference is who is eligible to get it right now as we face large numbers of Omicron and having those individuals eligible and perceiving that booster will protect them. We need as many people in that category already boosted as we possibly can, especially those at risk of dying. Sutton is asked: why mandate instead of strongly encourage masks? The difference between highly recommending something and mandating something is the level of compliance that we see. I have just pointed out to you the masks that we saw come off as soon as we went from mandate to strongly recommended. We usually get about 50% levels of cooperation or compliance with a strong recommendation. It goes to 95-99% with a mandate. Why would you introduce a half measure when you need the full measure to be in place? This was the PM yesterday on mask mandates: Sutton reasserts the importance of ventilation and socialising outdoors coming up to Christmas. He made a video about this. Perhaps our TikTok aficionado Matilda Boseley has met her match! I have made a video recently about the importance of ventilation. Meeting outdoors, critically important. If you can, please do. If you can open doors and windows wherever possible if you are meeting indoors, please do. I will be doing a little round for Christmas to open doors and windows whenever I am inside. The video: Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton is up. He got his third dose yesterday, and has a satisfyingly sore right arm. We are reporting over 16,000 doses delivered through state run centres yesterday. That is double what it was a week ago, and a week ago is double what it was the week before that, so it is really ramping up which is fantastic. We also hit another milestone today - 5 million vaccinations delivered through services. A huge effort. One of the biggest in Australia if not the biggest, and as the acting premier said, we have built one of the most vaccinated societies on earth. That puts us in just a fantastic position - a wall of immunity to meet Omicron and it means that we can go ahead with much more confidence than other places in the world ... I know Victorians are concerned about what summer might have ahead, but again, our current vaccination rates are very important in measuring our individual and collective protection. We know that two doses provide good protection against severe illness against hospitalisation, against ending up in ICU. The booster dose, and the evidence is increasing day by day, provides even greater protection against severe illness and hospitalisation. Some 28 more pop-up vaccination sites will open in the coming weeks throughout Victoria, and the current 50 sites will extend opening hours to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The site at the Royal Exhibition Building will stay open as the “iconic flagship site” well into late March 2022. Health minister Martin Foley is up, confirming Victoria is in a “strong position” by any measure worldwide to combat the new variant. In addition to mask mandates, there are new “recommendations”, not orders, to have in place for the festive season. One is working from home, and the second is a recommendation for hospitality venues to, “when they can”, stick to seated service and save dance floors for outdoor, well-ventilated areas. We acknowledge that Victorians have done so much to go out and get vaccinated in such strong numbers. And we’ve delivered on our part of the national plan for reopening. But a new variant of concern has arisen globally and we need to take measures to protect our community from that rapidly spreading variant whilst our health experts ... understand what it means for our community going into 2022. On advice of the chief health officer, the health minister will introduce additional measures to slow the spread of Omicron in Victoria, to remain in place until 12 January. From 11.59 tonight: Face masks will be required in all indoor settings, except private homes, for persons eight and over. Face masks will also be required at major outdoor events for people over 30,000 people. They can be removed when seated. Work from home if you can over the festive period. This is a recommendation. Merlino announces investment in a “major boost” to support the third dose rollout, including more than $31 million to support the commonwealth vaccination program while waiting for Atagi to provide advice on the potential shortening of the interval between a third vaccination dose. I want to be really clear. The interval needs to be shortened and the interval needs to be shortened immediately. That’s the view of Victoria. That’s the view of New South Wales. That’s the view of jurisdictions across the country. It is the clear public health advice we are getting. The interval needs to be shortened and it needs to be shortened immediately. We’re announcing today that we are ready to scale up to meet that demand so this new investment will enable a massive scale-up to support a major expansion of our state-run vaccination centres. Victoria’s acting premier James Merlino is up alongside health minister Martin Foley and chief health officer Brett Sutton, announcing changes to come into effect in response to the new variant. Merlino says Victoria is in one of the “strongest positions” around the world to combat Omicron because of high vaccination rates. Victoria is not considering going into lockdown. As a Victorian even the word “lockdown” is triggering. Tasmania’s premier Peter Gutwein has been providing a Covid update after 26 cases were recorded in the state. There has been no community transmission yet, but it is expected cases will pop up in the days ahead. Gutwein has ordered 100,000 rapid antigen tests to add to the current stockpile, which can be purchased at chemists and supermarkets. Someone PCR test that snake stat: Back to Palaszczuk, who says testing delays “are not just [because of] Queensland”. Let’s be very clear about this, it’s a bit Sydney-sided at the moment ... our response is we have always kept Queenslanders safe, and the measures in place were the measures outlined in the roadmap and the roadmap stands. The press conferences are rolling in, and in a quite civilised manner. We’ll be hearing from Victoria’s acting premier soon, followed by health minister Greg Hunt from Mount Martha. Case numbers in the ACT are in, and they’re up again. There have been 85 new Covid cases. There are three people being treated in hospital, but fortunately none in ICU, and no deaths. Some 123 confirmed Omicron cases have been detected in Queensland, but there’s likely to be more as there’s also a lag in testing, Gerrard says: We’ve tested 123 confirmed Omicron viruses, but there’s a lag in our testing. There’s a lag until we know the total numbers of Omicron. It’s clear that Omicron is becoming dominant and will dominate henceforth. We continue to see infections across the state. So wherever you live, you need to assume that you will be exposed in the coming weeks to this virus. Queensland’s chief health officer John Gerrard is up, making an interesting point about the “necessary” spread of the virus through the state. Masks and other social measures won’t stop the virus but slow it “a little bit” until we receive our third vaccination, he says. I think it is important at times like this as the numbers increase that we reflect on what exactly we are trying to do and where we are going. The spread of this virus, which is now this particular strain Omicron, is extremely contagious. Not only is the spread of this virus inevitable, it is necessary. In order for us to go from the pandemic phase to an endemic phase, the virus has to be widespread. We all have to have immunity. You will all have to develop immunity. There’s two ways you can do that - by being vaccinated or getting infected. There are only two choices, only two ways to do that. And once we’ve done that, once the virus is spreading, once we all have some degree of immunity, the virus becomes endemic, and that is what is going to happen. Queensland is now at 90.1% single dose targets. But the premier is concerned about lagging vaccination rates on the Gold Coast, a major tourist hotspot. We’re on the beautiful Gold Coast but I am still worried that vaccine coverage is not high enough here on the Gold Coast, which is one of the reasons we’re doing this press conference here today. Across the south-east of our state, essentially every area is above 90% except the Gold Coast region. Logan, Ipswich, where we had a huge vaccine drive, they have hit over 90%. In Brisbane, they’re heading towards 95%. On the Gold Coast, it’s 88.8%. This is a tourism hotspot. This is where the tourists are coming from just across the border. If you have not been vaccinated, go and see your GP or your pharmacist or one of our vaccination centres today. It is absolutely imperative that we drive up the vaccination rates on the Gold Coast. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is providing a Covid update. The state has recorded 369 new Covid cases, which she says will inevitably rise. Positive cases have been detected across the state - in Brisbane, Central Queensland, Gympie, Noosa, Redland, Southern Downs, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba, Townsville and the Whitsundays. There is currently one person in intensive care, with “other medical issues”. Wait times for Covid tests are out in South Australia: Heavy rainfall and a possible thunderstorm warning is in place over the Central Coast. The latest update from ACT Health is out, and all testing clinics are currently at capacity. As of 10.15 am: Mitchell drive-through testing clinic (open 8am to 10pm): at capacity Garran testing clinic (open 7.30am to 9pm): 2 hours 30 minutes+ Kambah drive-through testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 2 hours 30 minutes+ Nicholls testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 2 hours 30 minutes+ We are experiencing high demand for testing this morning and all our testing clinics are at capacity right now. Please do not queue on the roads, and come back later. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, however the safety of staff and our community is paramount. Victoria’s health minister Martin Foley will be up later today. No word yet on whether any changes to restrictions will be made in the state. Federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese this morning backed calls for the timing of booster shots to be reduced from five months. All the medical advice from overseas and the experience that we have is that it should be. And I’m sure that Atagi will come up with that recommendation as I’m sure it’s inevitable as well as it is overseas, in order to be considered fully vaccinated, that third shot as the protection against Omicron is particularly important. One of the benefits that we’ve had here in Australia due to our location, where we are, this island continent with natural protections, due to our distance from the world, is that we can see as we did with the first and second waves, we can see what is happening in the rest of the world. And anticipate it and get ahead of it. We need to do that. We need to stop playing catch-up, which is what this prime minister consistently does. Meanwhile, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will hold a press conference at Burleigh Heads in roughly half an hour. Tasmania’s numbers are in. There have been 26 new Covid cases reported - a record high for the state. One active case is in hospital for another medical condition. The Police Association Victoria has welcomed the announcement, which it says has been long advocated for as a “critical non-lethal tactical option”. The $215 million rollout comes as the state’s war on crime has seen spending on police, courts and prisons grow at double or triple the rate of other states and territories over the past decade. Victoria’s police minister Lisa Neville is up now alongside chief commissioner Shane Patton. She confirms all Victorian frontline police and PSOs will be equipped with Tasers, which will be linked to body warn cameras. The rollout of 6,000 of the stun guns is expected to take five years. Specialist training will be provided to officers. A 62 year old man has died following a single-vehicle crash in the New South Wales Riverina overnight, NSW police report. Emergency services were called to Shoards Road, north-east of Temora, late last night, following reports a double truck towing two trailers left the roadway and rolled. A passing motorist called emergency services and attempted CPR on the driver until paramedics arrived. The man died at the scene. A report will be prepared by the coroner. Back to Covid, the good news is high testing numbers. The bad news is the reference rate. Some 3.56% of tests are coming back positive in NSW, and 2.36% in Victoria. That’s a significant growth rate in the past week. Looking for a useful distraction from the pandemic this morning? How about a dip into Guardian staff’s funniest things we saw on the internet. I laughed out loud at this more than once, and not just at my own contribution (the guy with a phone full of QR codes). Thanks as ever to Matilda Boseley for guiding us through this morning’s news and bringing us Jacqui Lambie’s elf costume. With that, I shall pass you over to the amazing Caitlin Cassidy who will bring you the rest of the morning’s news! The Omicron variant of coronavirus appears to be milder, with a 20%-25% reduced chance of a hospital visit and at least a 40% lower risk of being admitted overnight, the first UK data of its kind has showed. But as daily Covid cases topped 100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, experts warned that high transmissibility means the NHS is still at risk of being overwhelmed. In what was described by scientists as a “qualified good news story”, two studies on Wednesday pointed to a lower risk of hospitalisation with Omicron. An Imperial College outbreak modelling team led by Prof Neil Ferguson analysed hospitalisations and vaccine records among all PCR-confirmed Covid cases in England between 1 and 14 December. The dataset included 56,000 cases of Omicron and 269,000 cases of Delta. You can read the full report from Ian Sample and Heather Stewart below: No word yet on when we will be getting a health update from Victoria today. Just to put things into perspective: Just to break the absolute doom and gloom that was those Covid numbers, here is Jacqui Lambie dressed as an elf. Looks as though we will be hearing from Anthony Albanese at 11.50am today. NSW daily case numbers have jumped by nearly 2,000 cases today, with 5,715 new cases. According to AAP, 20 testing sites have closed in Melbourne this morning after reaching capacity. Scott Morrison insists it’s not necessary for the states to introduce mask mandates in response to a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, despite health advice recommending they be compulsory in indoor settings. Speaking after a national cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the prime minister instead said it was “highly recommended” to wear masks indoors, urging Australians to use common sense and to reduce their risk of spreading Covid to their loved ones over Christmas. Health advice circulated to state and territory leaders late last week made the case for mandating masks in all indoor settings, including retail, entertainment facilities and hospitality when not eating and drinking. “Implementation of mask wearing measures should occur prior to Omicron case escalation to have maximum benefit,” said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee advice. You can read the full report below: A man is dead after a triple stabbing in a western Sydney park and a teenager is fighting for his life in hospital, reports AAP. NSW police were called to a reserve at Catlin Close, Whalan, about 7.30pm on Wednesday. Officers found three men – aged 40, 25 and 19 – with stab wounds. The 40-year-old died at the scene and the two injured men were taken to Westmead hospital for treatment. The youngest man is in a critical condition with injuries to his torso and arm, while the 25-year-old is in a stable condition with a cut to his arm. All three men were known to each other. As Covid cases surge in Australia, attention is turning to how the health system is coping. To track the impact of the spread of the Omicron variant on hospitals, we have brought together the data on hospitalisations and new case numbers – both nationally and across states and territories for the last six months. Cases include those infected locally, overseas and where the source is unknown or under investigation. Due to the difference in reporting times between jurisdictions it can be difficult to get a picture of the numbers, trends and impact on the healthcare system. But the seven-day average of new cases shows how cases are trending in each jurisdiction. Experts say there can be a lag of 10 to 14 days from when cases are reported and subsequent hospitalisations. You can read the full data blog below: The NSW government is considering providing free rapid antigen tests in the mail and it’s likely there will be a return to mandatory QR check-ins at retail and hospitality venues, reports AAP. But premier Dominic Perrottet is still resisting bringing back mask mandates at indoor venues, despite NSW Health urging everyone to wear them in high-risk settings. Covid-19 cases are surging in NSW and testing clinics are being overwhelmed. Some 15,815 people have tested positive since 16 December and yesterday’s record daily caseload of 3,763 infections could be smashed today. Perrottet emerged from yesterday’s national cabinet meeting to flag a plan to provide residents with the rapid tests, which are in short supply and expensive: Providing rapid antigen testing kits for those who want to do the right thing will help take the pressure of our testing clinics while giving people confidence to get on with their lives ... This will also help people monitor their symptoms and go about their daily activities in a responsible manner helping protect themselves, their families and the community. The need to relieve pressure on Covid-19 testing sites across the state is becoming more urgent with just two days until Christmas, after days of long queues at the facilities. People wanting to travel interstate or get the all-clear to attend Christmas celebrations are waiting hours to get a PCR test and about 72 hours to get a result. Restrictions eased in NSW on 15 December for all residents, including the unvaccinated, but the government is now expected to announce it will bring back mandatory QR check-ins at supermarkets, shops and hospitality venues. The ABC is reporting this morning that NSW is poised to reintroduce QR code check-ins as well as provide free rapid antigen testing kits as cases surge in the state. Reportedly there isn’t a strict time frame for when businesses will be required to comply with the reintroduced check in-laws, but we should learn more when Dominic Perrottet speaks today. The ABC reports that free rapid antigen tests are being explored as a way to potentially reduce pressure on Covid-19 testing sites. Covid-19 testing clinics are reducing their openings hours during the Christmas period despite “unprecedented demand” and reports of hours-long wait times in several states. Guardian Australia analysis shows 77% of the 490 testing sites listed on the NSW Health website on Wednesday will either close or operate on reduced hours through the Christmas and new year period. This comes amid record Covid cases in NSW and the highest testing numbers in Victoria since the beginning of the pandemic. Victoria reported 92,262 Covid test results on Wednesday, the most processed in a 24-hour period. In Melbourne overwhelming demand for testing forced at least 14 testing sites across the city to shut from 9.45am, after reaching capacity. You can read the full report below: John Frewen has been asked if the hotly anticipated Novavax will be included in the booster program mix. But it seems we will still have a while to wait: Novavax is still going through the approval process. I know they’re getting closer. We’re looking forward to get Novavax into the mix of available vaccines as well. It won’t be until the new year. I don’t know exactly when. As soon as Novavax is ready to go, we’ll be delighted to get it out there. I know some people have been holding out for Novavax specifically. It will be part of our arsenal and we look forward to helping people access that vaccine if that’s what they want. John Frewen: We have got 5m doses on shelves around the country in GPs and pharmacists. We have got record number of deliveries going in this week. We have had orders placed both before Christmas and for the first week of January, we have got an emergency ordering system in place and we also have a cell within the taskforce that’s helping people get connected to stuff that’s sitting on shelves in GPs and pharmacists not being used. Sometimes it’s a pharmacy or a GP around the corner, sometimes it’s across town. The vaccines are there. I encourage any of these businesses to contact the vaccine operations centre and we’ll have them connected to supply. But I assure you that supply is not a concern. We are working hard on the distribution. And then it’s about that great workforce to get the vaccines into people’s arms. Lieutenant General John Frewen (the army guy who is in charge of all our vaccines) has defended Australia’s booster rollout: The booster rollout is proceeding at speed. I think the queues you may be seeing at the moment may be around the testing regime. We have been hitting record days on boosters. We had almost 2 million people have their boosters over the last few weeks. We adapted very quickly to the Atagi decision to shift from six months to five months. We did that in a matter of days. That decision only happened a little over a week ago. We’re postured ready to respond if Atagi shifts the medical health advice around the booster recommendations again and supply is absolutely not a concern this time around. We have got more vaccines than will be needed over the months ahead. Australia’s peak doctors body has criticised an “unethical” proposal to charge unvaccinated people for their medical care that is being considered by the New South Wales government. The state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed the government was looking at forcing people who had not received the jab to pay for their medical bills if they required hospital treatment for Covid. “This is an option under consideration by the NSW government,” Hazzard said in a statement on Wednesday evening after it was first reported by Sydney radio station 2GB. The health minister did not provide any further details about how such a plan would work and did not respond to further questions. You can read the full report from Lane Sainty and Michael McGowan below: Good morning everyone, it’s Matilda Boseley here, and Merry Christmas Eve Eve! As a Christmas treat, I have ... well, more Covid-19 news. Mask regulations are tightening in Queensland cinemas and hospitality venues as Covid-19 case numbers in the state surge into triple figures for the first time. Queensland reported 186 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, prompting the state government to ramp up the requirement for mask-wearing. From 5am on Thursday, workers and patrons at theatres and cinemas will be required to wear masks, while staff in hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants will also have to mask up. Masks are mandated in supermarkets and shops as well as public transport and rideshares. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk vowed Queensland would stay open despite the rapid increase in Omicron infections: We want to keep our restaurants and our cafes and everything operating over Christmas and new year. The rules come as the state on Wednesday hit the 90% threshold for first-dose vaccinations, according to federal government data. Moving south, it’s expected that mandatory QR code check-ins will be reintroduced in high-risk settings in NSW after an informal national cabinet meeting yesterday. These rules were scrapped on 15 December but as case numbers in NSW reached 3,700 yesterday, it appears premier Dominic Perrottet has conceded that Omicron may require some backtracking on the rules. We should learn more when he speaks later in the day. It’s a similar story in Victoria this morning, only this time it’s masks that might be coming back. The acting premier and chief health officer have voiced their support for increased mask-wearing in high-risk settings, so we shall see what the ruling is when they step up later in the day. Well, there is clearly plenty to get through today, so why don’t we jump right into the day!"

          "headline": "Morrison government tells tribunal robodebt documents must stay secret to protect cabinet process",
          "bodyText": "The Morrison government has told a tribunal there is “strong public interest” in preserving the secrecy of “business case” documents that may outline the nucleus of the unlawful robodebt scheme. IT expert Justin Warren won access to documents connected to the since-scrapped welfare debt recovery program under freedom of information laws in 2019, but he is yet to receive them after the government appealed against the decision. Warren’s lawyer argues there is “profound” public interest in release because they may shed light on what went wrong with the scheme, which eventually saw the government reach a $1.8bn settlement with about 400,000 victims in what the federal court called a “shameful chapter”. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is considering the government’s latest attempt to keep the documents secret, heard closing arguments from both parties on Thursday. The tribunal has previously heard the documents include detailed costings and other financial data about the program, which matched yearly income data against a person’s fortnightly reports to Centrelink to send a person a debt. They are also said to include draft “new policy proposal” documents and purported attachments that outline a new plan to ramp up the government’s welfare debt recovery. The tribunal is considering, among other issues, whether the documents were prepared for the cabinet process or were simply being worked on internally by the then Department of Human Services, which administered the robodebt scheme. Counsel for the commonwealth, Andrew Berger QC, insisted on Thursday the documents should not be released because they were prepared for cabinet. “There is a very strong public interest in protecting from disclosure cabinet documents, whether they be at the dead centre of cabinet, such as cabinet notebooks, or further away from the epicentre of cabinet,” he told the tribunal. That extended to “preparatory documents”, such as some of the documents in question, he claimed. The tribunal has heard the documents never made it to cabinet itself, though one is a draft of a document that did, and the commonwealth argues information in other documents also appeared in newer material subsequently considered by cabinet. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In asserting the public interest in keeping the documents secret, Berger argued ministers would not receive full and frank information if there was concern any deliberations would be made public. He also told the tribunal Warren’s public interest arguments weren’t “actually borne out by the information in the documents”. Warren’s lawyer, Tom Brennan SC, said the commonwealth had failed to demonstrate why the documents should stay secret. Senior ministers between 2015 and 2016 included the former social services ministers, Scott Morrison and Christian Porter, who were members of cabinet, and the former human services ministers, Marise Payne and Alan Tudge, who were not. Brennan argued the Commonwealth had not proven that Morrison, as the cabinet minister at the time, had authorised the preparation of the material in question. “If it’s not before you then the case isn’t proven,” Brennan said. Because the commonwealth has appealed an earlier decision, it faces the onus of proof to show why the documents must be suppressed. Brennan said understanding of the “shameful” robodebt scheme would be “significantly enhanced by the disclosure of the documents in issue”. The public interest in release was “profound”, he said. The AAT hearing is one of several efforts the government has made to block the release of robodebt documents. The government services minister, Linda Reynolds, is facing a possible referral to the privileges committee for the government’s repeated refusal to hand over documents requested by the Senate. Labor has also promised a royal commission into the scheme if it wins the election. On Thursday, the Guardian revealed the government had reached a $2m settlement over a class action that claimed another welfare program – known colloquially as “remote work for the dole” – was unlawful on the bounds of racial discrimination. Warren’s case is being run pro bono by Maurice Blackburn and the Grata Fund’s FoI Project. The tribunal deputy president, Peter Britten-Jones, reserved his decision."

          "bodyText": "What if a statistic could speak its own truth? What if a stereotype could confound your expectations? A few weeks back, I was riffling through the local papers when a story jumped out. A schoolboy in Tottenham, north London, had just won an award as a Foyle Young Poet of the Year. At the bottom was printed his poem. Called Welcome to Tottenham, it brought the news from a society that is only a few miles from Westminster but might as well be a whole world away. When historians such as EP Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm took ordinary people’s lives and perspectives as their subjects, rather than stories of kings and generals, their work was labelled history from below. So let’s call this poem news from below, the headlines as if Liz Truss didn’t matter (imagine) and blue-on-blue combat was a soap playing on a far-off screen. The news, in other words, for the country in which most of us actually live. Welcome to Tottenham. Where we wake up to the smell of ‘Chick king’, Mixed with the odour of the corpse from the night before. Where we cover our blood stained streets with dried up gum, Where kids have holes in their last pairs of shoes, Where daddy left mummy and mummy’s left poor. Giovanni Rose wrote his poem in a few hours on a Covid-era Chromebook handed out by his school. The teenager didn’t need to make stuff up; he jotted down the world he’d been born into. In person, he’s neither swot nor class clown, just a kid who keeps his head down and never swears in front of grownups and talks softly in the same rubbery twang as most working-class youngsters in London today. And with the same unblinking clarity that marks his verse, he knows how strangers see him. A 17-year-old black boy, he has been stopped and searched by the police on his local high road and off Oxford Street, even once by armed officers when he was, irony of ironies, making a short film against knife crime. To policymakers, he’s a statistic; to ministers he’s a stereotype; and to the media, people like Giovanni are … what, exactly? Case studies, perhaps, to be allotted their 10-second clip on the evening news and then chucked away. But a democracy that can’t or won’t listen to outsiders such as him is not only missing out: it’s falling down on the job. A political class that hand-waves about “the youth” would be best advised to shut up and listen to them. And the thing about Giovanni, and all the others who get talked over in our politics, is that they don’t fit their cutouts. They are so much bigger. Giovanni knows wearing joggers and a hoodie gets him marked down as a thug – except they’re comfy, so he puts them on anyway. He grew up in one of the most deprived parts of England but he won’t let that define him either. His GCSEs were a string of 8s and 9s, and if his A-levels come in as predicted he should be off next September to study maths at a top university. Let me admit also to a personal interest. To go from Giovanni’s childhood, in the shadow of the Northumberland Park estate, and mine, right by Edmonton Green, takes a mere 10 minutes by bus but nearly three decades of history. I grew up under Thatcher; he’s got Johnson. He is black; I am brown. Our paths cross and abut each other. His landscape is mine, almost, but as foreign as time renders everything. And so, after meeting and speaking a few times, he agreed to show me how my old world looks to a teenage boy today. Where we ride around on stolen scooters, Where we can’t afford tuition so the streets are our tutors. His childhood home is in a street with a church-cum-foodbank but backs on to a drug house: a small terrace cottage out of which industrial quantities of drugs were sold. Every time police raided, the dealers would jump the fence into his backyard. Too young to know what was going on, Giovanni would panic that burglars were breaking in. “The last straw for my mum was when a dealer got Tasered by the police in my garden,” he recalls. “It’s kind of funny now. But at the same time, it’s not normal.” His secondary school has to help hundreds of kids growing up in abnormal circumstances prepare for a world that expects them to behave perfectly normally. “They come in with trauma, having faced violence or sexual abuse,” says Jan Balon, head of the London Academy of Excellence Tottenham. He has recruited what is essentially a mental health unit, which counsels just under 10% of the student body throughout the week. It costs, Balon admits, “a stupid amount of money” but the NHS services are too underfunded and overwhelmed to rely on. I love but I hate my home, I still listen to the voicemails of my dead peers in my phone One night when he was 14, Giovanni was woken by the sound of gunshots. Out of his bedroom window, he could see the aftermath of a drive-by. Seventeen-year-old Tanesha Melbourne-Blake had been killed in a hail of bullets. For years afterwards, the road was decorated with memorials to her. He was only 15 when a close friend went with a younger mate to try to retrieve a stolen £90 pair of trainers. The friend never came home. A 21-year-old man stabbed him 10 times. Not long before, he’d left Giovanni a voice note on Snapchat. “Just random, like ‘How are you, bro?’” Giovanni used to listen to it afterwards. “Because I missed him.” Giovanni came into a world where adults of all kinds could not be automatically trusted: not the local gangsters, nor the police. Nor others who purported to be in authority. He was born as the war in Iraq went from false triumph into naked disaster. He started at primary as the financial crisis turned into a global depression. The year after, austerity began. He was seven when Tottenham erupted over the police killing of Mark Duggan and his family home was a mile away from ground zero of the riots that would consume London and then England. And over the past couple of years, he’s been out of school for nearly six months, his wifi breaking amid remote lessons and pleading with his eight-year-old twin siblings not to disturb him during class. But with his own bedroom, he counts among his peers as lucky. We fight over streets we don’t own Knife crime’s on the rise because the beef can’t be left alone. Giovanni’s mum drilled him well, both in studies and on the streets: stick to the main roads, keep looking over your shoulder. He never just goes for a walk without a destination, always knows who’ll be there and when he should be back (roughly: he’s a teenager, after all). He lives in what Yvonne Kelly, a professor of lifecourse epidemiology at UCL, calls “a state of hyper-vigilance”. “Just constantly worrying who’s about to come up behind him means a high level of cortisol will be swilling around his system,” she says. “If that’s repeated day after day after day, it could make him physically ill.” And so psychological threat can turn into bodily damage. In a couple of weeks, Giovanni will sit his mock exams, having already faced tests that most of us will never know. And then … well, then he wants to get out of Tottenham, leave all this behind. His hero is the rapper Stormzy, “a rich black man who got out of the hood”. That’s his dream, and now it’s within reach. “A bit of me feels: ‘I made it out!’ I’m relieved I survived, but I miss this space. Most of my friends are here, most of my memories are here. Even the smell of the chicken shop.” While he’s revising for his A-levels, ask yourself two questions: how Great can Britain be, if a boy counts himself lucky just to survive here? And what is the value of a childhood home if you’re constantly taught you must leave it behind?

          "bodyText": "You can sense the sudden political alarm in Westminster. What, if anything, can be done to cushion the blow of higher energy bills that will hit consumers next April? It seemed until recently that ministers’ plan A was to pray that wholesale gas prices in Europe would fall after their surge in the early autumn, thereby limiting the increase in average annual household domestic energy bills to £250 or so. There is not even a remote chance of such a gentle outcome now. Gas prices have been setting new highs this week, coupled with mentions of the word “unprecedented”. The current wholesale price of 400p-ish a therm compares to 60p-ish at the start of the year. Five months of the latest six-month “observation window” for calculating the level of the next price cap have passed, meaning everybody can make a reasonable estimate of what the backward-looking formula will spit out in February. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight says £1,865 per annum, versus £1,277 currently. Analysts at bank Investec think the figure will be closer to £2,000. Call it an average annual increase of about 50%, if the price-cap formula is applied mechanically. And, critically, future gas prices suggest no relief in sight. Russian and German wrangling over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, French nuclear shutdowns and higher demand for gas as backup to renewables are not factors that will disappear overnight. Stop thinking about a price “spike”, cautions Investec, and consider “a high likelihood of both prolonged and even higher gas prices through winter with an impact that stretches out over the next two years”. Cornwall’s early estimate of the next-but-one adjustment to the price cap in October 2022 produces a figure of £2,240 per annum. Thus the belated scramble in government to explore a few fiddles to bills. Annual charges covering renewables incentives, one of the minor components, could be deferred. So, too, network charges, a bigger element. A similar smoothing process could be applied to the looming £2.5bn cost of absorbing the failure of 26 energy suppliers since August. Add it all up, though, and Investec reckons such “mitigations” only amount to £300. Sky-high gas prices dominate everything. And it would be bold to try to use all the deferral fudges in one go; the policy equivalent of maxing out on the credit card. Only waiving VAT, payable at 5% by households, looks straightforward. Current Westminster thinking seems to be edging towards bigger interventions to shield low-income households from the full blast. The winter warm homes discount scheme could be turned into an all-year affair. But again, unless the cost can be buried in general taxation and borrowing, it would mean other bill-payers picking up the difference and paying even more for their energy. That, in turn, raises deep questions of fair redistribution and who would qualify for a discount. There is no precedent to fall back upon. The numbers at stake are colossal. If nothing changes, the additional annual energy bill for households will come to £18bn – or 1.3% of total consumer spending – on Investec’s numbers, and an overnight switch to average bills of £2,000 would add 1.8 percentage points to headline inflation in April 2022. Covid aside, there will be few bigger running political headaches in early 2022. Doing nothing – in other words, letting the price increases rip under the standard formula – does not look politically feasible. But that’s as far as the thinking seems to have progressed. Ministers have about a month, that’s all, to find a strategy. Landsec reaffirms faith in prime retail estate The plan is to “reimagine retail”, says property giant Landsec, about half a decade into its confrontation with the growth of online shopping. It’s certainly having to reimagine what its shopping centres (thankfully not the largest part of its portfolio) are worth. In a doubling-down transaction, Landsec is buying a 25% stake in the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent for £172m, adding to the one-third holding it already has. The interesting bit is how Bluewater has fallen in value over the years: the decline is about two-thirds since 2014, when Landsec first bought in. That’s an enormous movement for a shopping centre that, even now, is almost the definition of prime retail estate. Landsec is punting, in effect, that the bottom has been reached. The thesis is reasonable since there is early evidence that rents in retail “destinations” are finally starting to stabilise. You have to wonder, though, what the group was thinking in 2014. Its acquisition timing back then was horrible."

          "headline": "Federal government to pay out $2m to settle class action over ‘racist’ work for the dole program",
          "bodyText": "The federal government will pay a traditional owners corporation representing some of the poorest communities in Australia more than $2m after settling a class action that argued the remote “work for the dole” program was racist. The Community Development Program (CDP) has required about 30,000 jobseekers in remote communities to work up to 25 hours a week to receive the dole. Participants, 80% of whom were Aboriginal, were said to have faced tougher welfare penalties than those in other parts of Australia. After sustained criticism from Indigenous leaders who claimed the program was racist and even “modern-day slavery”, Western Australia’s Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku and the Ngaanyatjarra council launched a class action in 2019 on behalf of 680 CDP participants. Following a year of confidential mediation, orders issued this month by the federal court Justice Richard White officially approved the settlement, revealing the government will pay $2m to the Ngaanyatjarra council. The court said the council “represents the interests of around 2,000 Ngaanyatjarra, Pintupi and Pitjantjatjara Traditional Owners (Yarnangu) who reside in the Ngaanyatjarra Communities”. It said it intended to use the money for an infrastructure program and an arts project at Warburton, the largest community in the area. The government also agreed to redesign the CDP scheme for jobseekers in the 10 communities covered by the class action. Without referencing the case, the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, announced in the May budget that the government would overhaul the entire CDP. The government made no admission or concession of legal liability, while the class action members waived the right to recoup lost welfare payments or damages. The government will also pay the applicants’ costs, worth $278,897.19. Families and lives ‘upended’ The Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku president, Damien McLean, who led the action, said the government’s decision to overhaul the program was very welcome. He said the CDP program had been “just terrible”. “For communities with high costs of living and high levels of poverty, it was very difficult, very stressful,” McLean said. “That’s why we’re glad the commonwealth has had a good look at it and seen the problems it is causing.” He said the CDP required people to be “punished”, which “upended their families and their lives”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The class action represented 10 remote Aboriginal communities who told the court their residents’ per capita income was the lowest on mainland Australia. They alleged the CDP breached sections 9, 10 and 13 of the Racial Discrimination Act. The class action argued it was tougher for those in the Ngaanyatjarra communities to meet their obligations due to “remoteness of their communities, their low levels of education and literacy, and other aspects of their socio-economic status”. The communities, based in sparsely populated land near the Northern Territory and South Australia borders, first raised concerns about the program to the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2016. They filed a lawsuit when mediation at the commission failed. It is the second time in 12 months the Morrison government has settled a class action over claims its welfare programs were unlawful, after it reached a $1.8bn deal over the robodebt scandal in June. The CDP followed a similar trajectory to that scandal, with the government steadfast for years despite sustained criticism from Aboriginal leaders, the Australian National Audit Office, a former Liberal Aboriginal affairs minister and even the government’s own review, which found 36% of participants said their communities were worse off under the scheme. Northern Territory Labor MP Chansey Paech labelled the CDP “modern-day slavery” in 2018, while John Paterson of the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory called in 2019 for the CDP to be abandoned and replaced with a “positive Aboriginal-led model”. No guarantee of recouping individual payments The CDP was introduced in 2015 by the Coalition government and contracted organisations, including the Ngaanyatjarra council, to run employment services for jobseekers in remote areas under the scheme. It soon sparked outrage, with analysis showing a 740% increase in financial penalties for jobseekers compared to the previous remote job and communities program. CDP participants who failed to meet their mutual obligations requirements – such as work for the dole activities, job search or meetings with an employment services provider – had their payments docked by $50 a day. Repeated “non-compliance” could result in eight weeks without any payments. Crucially, analysis by Australian National University researchers found people in remote areas were 25 times more likely to face these penalties than those in non-remote areas. In its orders handed down this month, the federal court noted that the 680 CDP participants involved in the class action had lost $1,291,438 in welfare income, or an average of $1,793.29 a person. Taking into account the class action group definition of the lawsuit, however, the court said “the probable total” that group members could have tried to claim back was $534,628.77, an average of $786.22. Explaining his decision to approve the settlement, White said “the potential recovery for each group member … would, while no doubt significant for that group member, be modest”. There were also “risks” or “even the probability” many would not be able to make out the case they should be paid back by the government, he added. White said there was “extensive community engagement in the mediation process” which gave him confidence of “wide community support” for the settlement. McLean told Guardian Australia recouping lost welfare payments for the class action members “wasn’t on the table”. “That would have required the commonwealth to agree that the program had been discriminatory, which they insisted it hadn’t been,” he said. “Recovering individual payments … would have required a very long court action … And there would be no guarantee of success anyway.” Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, said in May the program would be replaced by a new remote jobs program in 2023 following a re-design. The Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku is among the sites hosting a trial of the new program, which is voluntary and will see people in work-like placements receive supplementary payments of up to $190. Wyatt’s office was approached for comment."

          "headline": "How Charlamagne became Tha God of headline-grabbing interviews",
          "bodyText": "Last Friday, Charlamagne Tha God had a remote sit-down with Kamala Harris for his new late-night chatshow Tha God’s Honest Truth on Comedy Central. It was a big moment for a legendary provocateur who in little more than a decade has gone from dismissable radio sidekick to the leading interviewer on urban radio, as at ease grilling presidents as japing with Migos. During his interview with Harris, it seemed as if the host, real name Lenard Larry McKelvey, would bite his tongue and give the vice-president space to hit back at the legion of critics who moan about her not doing more. But what seemed like a softball interview quickly changed tone when Charlamagne asked her, point blank: “Who is the real president of this country, Joe Biden or Joe Manchin?” As soon as he asked the question, Harris’s spokesperson Symone Sanders swooped in and demanded a stop to the interview, citing audio difficulties. Seated in a gaming chair, Charlamagne swiveled around to face his studio audience. “They’re acting like they can’t hear me, y’all,” he snarked. When Harris confirmed that she could indeed hear him, he repeated the question. “C’mon, Charlamagne,” she scolded with a wagging finger. “Don’t start talking like a Republican. It’s Joe Biden, and I’m vice-president and my name is Kamala Harris.” Her defiant response might have gone down as one beleaguered politician’s attempt to win points with her boss if it hadn’t been followed by news of Manchin’s Senate-chamber nuking of the Biden administration’s signature Build Back Better legislation the next day. Rather surprisingly, Charlamagne had stumbled into something that’s become increasingly rare in Washington: a genuine moment. The Harris interview now enters the pantheon of Tha God’s honest gotcha moments. Before that, there was Biden telling Charlamagne during the 2020 election that African Americans who didn’t turn out for him “ain’t Black”. (Biden’s handlers tried shutting down that interview, too.) There was him calling Elizabeth Warren “the original Rachel Dolezal” while cross-examining her about her false claims to Native American ancestry. And there was him going all Jim Acosta on Hilary Clinton when the then presidential candidate came clean with her habit of carrying hot sauce in her purse. “Now,” he joked, “I just want you to know people are gonna see this and say, ‘OK, she’s pandering to Black people.’” To which she asked, “Is it working?” If the Moncks Corner, South Carolina, native has a gift for producing cringey exchanges, it’s because Charlamagne learned from one of the best line-steppers while a sidekick to Wendy Williams in the late aughts on New York’s WBLS R&amp;B radio station and on VH1. But where Williams, although risqué, could reliably flirt her way back to safety in interviews, Charlamagne became notorious for rankling the industry’s popular and powerful. He spent a year out of work after parting ways with Williams before the iHeart radio network brought him back to New York in 2010 to anchor the hip-hop station Power 105.1’s Breakfast Club show: a kind of Good Morning America for the streets known for its no-holds-barred interviews with Black luminaries in music, on screen and in sports. And while he’s done as much as the co-hosts DJ Envy and Angela Yee to elevate Birdman’s walkout, Soulja Boy’s meltdown and Monique’s Netflix controversy into memes, it’s Charlamagne’s sociopolitical curiosity that’s made the show an important stop for thought leaders and policymakers. Two bestselling biographies have only given him further standing to lead those discussions. All the while a shadowy past looms just as large. He’s talked openly about serving jail time for dealing drugs as a teenager. In 2018, he was forced to reckon with a 2001 rape charge when his accuser, who was 15 at the time, sought to reopen the case. (Ultimately, a special prosecutor declined, citing the three years’ probation Charlamagne served after agreeing to a plea deal on a less serious charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.) Around the same time, a 2015 podcast interview resurfaced in which Charlamagne seems to characterize his first sexual encounter with his now wife, Jessica Gadsden, as rape, saying that she was too drunk to meaningfully consent. (“For the record, in 1997 I was having consensual sex,” he’d say later. Gadsden, too, appeared on the Breakfast Club in his defense.) None of it this has appeared to dim his stardom, nor has it stopped him positioning himself as an ally of the #MeToo and social justice movements. If anything, Charlamagne’s career has taken the same shape as those of Don Imus and Howard Stern before him. Which is to say he’s a Teflon-grade, old-school shock-jock. Before the late-night chat with Harris, who stopped by the Breakfast Club during her presidential campaign to reminisce about her days as a weed-smoking Howard University sorority girl who now vibes to Tupac and Snoop, it was Charlamagne scoring the first interview with Travis Scott since the Astroworld festival disaster that had the media buzzing. But for all of his confrontational instincts, Charlamagne doesn’t have the combative chops of John Oliver or Jordan Klepper, who cut their teeth on Comedy Central. He is largely deferential to distinguished “gets”. Even the testy exchange between Charlamagne and the vice-president ended with him telling her, with a hand on heart, “we need you to be the superhero who saves democracy” and her gesturing in kind while saying “I wanna see those babies”. By that, of course, she means his kids, an indication that these two sparring partners might actually be friends."

          "headline": "Covid could overwhelm ‘chronically understaffed’ health facilities in western NSW",
          "bodyText": "Health facilities in western New South Wales are “chronically understaffed” and the situation could be exacerbated as Covid-19 cases climb in regional local health districts before the holiday period. The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association raised the alarm about growing nurse vacancies in the state’s west with communities such as Lightning Ridge left with more than 140 vacant nursing shifts in their multi-purpose services over the coming month. The widespread inability to fill rising nurse vacancies and critical gaps in rosters led to senior nurse managers in 12 health facilities across western NSW taking the unprecedented action of stopping work for two hours on Tuesday. This problem comes as Peta Rutherford, the chief executive of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, said there were continued outbreaks and increasing numbers of Covid-19 cases in regional Australia, with the expectation that cases will rise as more people travel during the holiday period. Brett Holmes, the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association general secretary, said nurses, particularly nurse managers, were doing excessive additional hours, working unbroken periods of more than 18 days straight, often more than 16 hours a day. The situation was at “the point of totally exhausting the nursing workforce”. “These services can’t continue to operate without minimum nursing staff levels and we can’t fill even those,” Holmes said. “These facilities are chronically understaffed. “Every day is a potential patient disaster waiting to happen. Nurses live their lives knowing that anything can come through their door unexpectedly and they may not be able to deliver the care they know these patients need.” The rising number of Covid-19 cases in NSW had the potential to make the situation even more dire, he said. In many locations it only took one nurse having to isolate to make the health service unviable. Holmes said any acutely ill Covid patients would require transfer to a larger hospital in a regional centre or Sydney but, because nurses had to wait with the patient for the transport to arrive in case of the need for resuscitation, they would not be able to look after the aged care residents they were also responsible for in multipurpose services. Mark Spittal, the acting chief executive of the Western NSW local health district, said that on average 25 people a day were being infected with Covid in the region, with case numbers rising. Spittal said 40 staff were unable to work because they had been infected or were a close contact of someone who was. “We recognise as Covid-19 numbers grow amongst the community, so they’ll grow amongst our staff … At the moment we’ve been able to manage those staff exposures,” Spittal said. “We are expecting to see a significant increase in the numbers of cases across NSW and across our district, but I have to stress Covid-19 in the context of a community that is 96% double vaccinated is a very, very, very different scenario to what it was back in July before vaccination got taken up by the community.” Asked if the rising case numbers would exacerbate the problem of unfilled nursing shifts, Spittal said it was “always a possibility moving forward” but that a pandemic response, similar to natural disaster response, would see the NSW health system come together to deploy staff across the state. But Rutherford said the Rural Doctors Association, at both state and federal level, had flagged that there was limited surge workforce capacity because most of it had been taken up by demand in capital cities or large regional centres, where there have been much larger outbreaks. “We’ve got an overstretched workforce that was already short on the ground pre-pandemic that is now being absorbed through the testing and vaccination clinics, and now that we’re getting cases in these communities, the workforce shortages are being felt and being felt hard in these hospitals,” Rutherford said. When Covid-19 broke out in Mildura, she said, despite the talk about surge capacity “we know on the ground” it was the local workforce that absorbed the demand, working extra shifts and overtime. Of the 3,057 cases reported to 8pm Monday night in NSW, most emerged in the Hunter New England local health district, with 820 infections. Peter Wark, a conjoint professor at University of Newcastle and a senior member of the Priority Research Centre for Healthy Lungs, said there had not been a significant increase in hospital admissions but quite a lot of people were receiving in-home care. Wark said it was probably too early to see the full impact, but he expected the next few days to be “telling”, as hospital admissions typically increase seven to 10 days after infection, with the super-spreader event at the Argyle House nightclub having been held last Wednesday. He said the potential increase in presentations would come at “a tricky time of the year as it is a time when the system steps down rather than steps up”. It was a struggle for a regional and remote area where there was never any surge capacity in the first place, and it would not be made any better by the Christmas period. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Wark said the outbreak was “very much urban-centred” in Newcastle but “that will inevitably change”. Of communities experiencing their first outbreak, Rutherford said: “It is concerning we do know that many of our rural and regional locations still have not got well-drafted or well-coordinated plans in place. “Often it’s not until communities get their first case that we see true development of a cohesive plan in relation to treatment of Covid patients. And that’s unacceptable.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

          "bodyText": "With Omicron spreading in the UK the potential for disruptions to Christmas plans are high, whether you’re limiting your contacts or have been forced to isolate. But the fact you can’t meet in person doesn’t mean all the festivities have to stop. It will not be quite the same but you can still join your family and friends and have a good time virtually. Here are some ideas to help keep you connected over the festive period – whether it’s checking in for a chat or sharing entertainment. Easy video calling Video calls are most people’s first port of call. You can use almost any device with a camera, but tablets or laptops are the easiest to set up for longer chats if you have them. Zoom is one of the easiest cross-platform services available with an app available for most devices. It can be used for free for up to 40 minutes at a time. For those in the Apple ecosystem, FaceTime is built into every iPhone, iPad or Mac, is very easy to use and now you can send invites to those on Android or Windows for calls in their browser. Google users can use Meet on Android, in Chrome on a computer or iPhone and iPad apps. Those sitting on their own should use headphones to avoid feedback and help keep conversations more natural, and shorter video chats are usually better to avoid fatigue. Place a tablet or laptop at the end of the table if someone can’t make a gathering. Party games over video call Chats can get old quickly, so why not try party games over video calls. Some things are easier to do than others. Charades is a natural fit: just prop up your video calling device and make your shapes to the camera. Pictionary is also fairly easy to do over a video call using pen and paper, or you can use a shared drawing service such as the free Microsoft Whiteboard to see what other people are drawing on their screens or tablets. Quizzes are a video chat favourite, too. You can try using Google Docs or similar services, but the old(er) fashioned way of pen, paper and a bit of screen sharing if any pictures are involved often works better. Share films, TV shows and music over video calls The latest addition to the growing list of video call activities is watching videos or listening to music at the same time. Apple’s new SharePlay offering makes this easy – it’s built into FaceTime as of the latest software updates. While you’re on a FaceTime call you can start watching a TV, movie or playing music in an app that supports SharePlay, such as Apple’s Music and TV, Disney+, Pluto TV and TikTok, and it will sync up with the others on your call when you tap on “play for everyone”. It works on every Apple device, including the Mac or an Apple TV streaming box so you can watch the movie on the big screen. Watch movies together without needing to call If you’d rather not see the faces of others when watching a film, or you don’t use Apple devices, you can still watch on-demand services together remotely. Disney+ has a feature called GroupWatch built in, which is easy to use and works on most devices. It lets you invite other people with a Disney+ subscription to join you to watch the content at the same time. Amazon’s Prime Video Watch Party can do similar via Android devices, computers in the browser or Fire TV devices. Group watching on Netflix is more limited at the moment, requiring the free Teleparty Chrome or Edge browser extension on your PC, Mac or Chromebook, so it won’t work on your smart TV, phone or iPad, but you can text chat with other viewers in a bar to the side. The BBC launched a pilot service called Together last year that allows you to group iPlayer, Sounds, Bitsize, News and Sport on a computer. But don’t forget, if you pause it your end for a quick pit-stop it’ll pause it mid-action for everyone else too, which they might not thank you for. For a low-tech alternative you could just tune into a live broadcast on TV or stream and chat with WhatsApp. Play video games remotely Multiplayer and co-operative video games are big business and they can be exceptionally rewarding when you can’t physically be together. All the big consoles support online multiplayer with voice chat, and there are many games to choose from. Typically you need to pay for the online service, but many can be bought monthly including £3.49 for Nintendo’s service, £6.99 for Microsoft’s Xbox Live Gold and Sony’s £6.99 PlayStation Plus. Some games such as the hugely popular Fortnite can be played for free online on most platforms, including consoles, PCs, phones and tablets. There are lots of great shooting, racing and adventure games to play together, while a crop of excellent party games such as Among Us, which is the modern reinvention of wink murder offer something a bit different. Shared Christmas playlists or a roaring (digital) fire If it is simply some of the communal Christmas atmosphere you are looking for, and live radio doesn’t quite cut it, then a shared music playlist might be the answer. Spotify is the best known for collaborative playlists allowing everyone to add tracks using either free or paid accounts. But you can at least share a basic playlist you’ve made by sending friends a link from the various apps for Apple Music, Amazon Music and most others services if they also subscribe. For a bit of ambience, you can put a recreation of a roaring fire on your TV too, so you’re all watching the same mesmerising dancing flames. The easiest way is to play one of the surprisingly large libraries of fire videos on your streaming service of choice, be that Netflix, Amazon, YouTube or others. There are smart TV apps available too for most platforms. Just search for “fireplace”."

          "bodyText": "The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron variant represents the biggest threat to the NHS since last December’s rise of the Alpha variant. The NHS only managed then by reducing much non-Covid work and by putting a brake on the rise of cases with the second lockdown in January 2021. A year later, the lack of urgency in the government response is a danger to us all. NHS staff are exhausted. They have been working flat out for almost two years. For some of that time they had to struggle with rising numbers of seriously ill patients with Covid-19. When each wave subsided, they turned to the backlog of cases that had built up in the meantime – this enormous backlog started before the pandemic and numbers almost 6 million people. Meanwhile, Covid patients still make up about a quarter of occupied critical care beds. The risks to the NHS come from three sides. First, Omicron has grown faster than any variant seen to date – including the original spread of Covid-19 in March 2020. The UK Health Security Agency reports that cases of Omicron have been doubling every two days in most regions of the UK. A certain percentage of newly infected people will need hospital treatment – even if Omicron causes less severe disease than Delta. Let’s say that the risk of hospitalisation with Omicron is half that of Delta, although the analysis from Imperial College London suggests this may be optimistic. With a variant that is doubling every two days that gives us only a two-day advantage. Whatever the eventual percentage of people with Omicron who will need NHS care, the absolute number seeking care will also double every two days. Because it takes seven to 14 days from infection to needing hospital, this rapid increase in demand for NHS services will not be seen immediately – probably not until after Christmas – but it will happen. Modelling by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group – which reports to the Sage committee – suggests that by the time we see this impact, four doublings may have passed. This means much higher levels of pressure on the NHS which we can’t do anything about if we wait for hospitalisations to rise before we act. Last Thursday, Sage estimated that without reducing transmission further (over and above plan B), there will be at least 3,000 daily admissions to hospital in England (equivalent to the first wave in 2020), and it could be much worse even than last January. So the question is not whether it will be bad for the NHS, but whether it will be just dreadful or catastrophic. The second risk comes from only focusing on the numbers of patients alone and not staff capacity. It is very likely that staff absences due to infection will also have a severe impact. Fortunately, almost all will have had boosters so they are at little risk of serious illness or death, unlike in the early days of the pandemic. But we know that those who have been boosted are being infected and must isolate. And when a neurosurgeon is isolating, their entire team may be unviable. It also exacerbates the strains placed on those who can still work. The NHS in London is already struggling with major staff shortages due to Omicron: Guy’s and St Thomas’ trust has already had to cancel services and the London ambulance service currently has hundreds of staff off sick. The speed with which Omicron is rising makes it inevitable that we will lose many critical staff just as demand surges. The number of NHS hospital beds in England has more than halved over the past 30 years, with the UK being among the countries with the lowest ICU capacity per population across western Europe. And we already have far fewer doctors than other parts of Europe. The third risk comes from the way we have taken the efforts of NHS staff for granted. Throughout the pandemic, NHS staff have adapted remarkably to unbelievably difficult situations. They have learned new skills. They have created new ways of working, such as remote consultations (with much maligned GPs seeing many more patients than before). They have repurposed facilities, turning conventional wards into intensive care units. They have provided support for one another when things seemed to be getting too much. But at some point they can do no more. Many staff have left and many more are burned out and cannot face the trauma of another winter desperately helping people to breathe. Many have developed long Covid with more than 3% of health and social care staff reporting persistent symptoms from Covid-19 for 28 days or more, the highest across all occupations. After nearly two years of dealing with crisis after crisis, the NHS just does not have the resilience it had at the beginning of the pandemic. This means that pressures are now higher at lower levels of Covid-19 hospitalisations than in previous waves. As a society, we have a duty of care to the NHS, as well as care-home staff, who have looked after us through incredibly difficult circumstances. We are failing them. We need to urgently protect our health and social-care staff with adequate personal protective equipment. We need to provide all staff with high-quality PPE (including FFP2/3 masks), so they can protect themselves and their families, and reduce in-hospital transmission which can cost lives. We need measures that can reverse the rise in cases rapidly. Vaccine boosters are crucial, but they take effect over weeks rather than days. We have lost the opportunity for less severe early action. The only thing that could work in time is a short circuit breaker to limit indoor social interaction (and return the rule of six when outside, while keeping outdoor hospitality, shops and schools open), as proposed by Independent Sage and Sage. New data on severity and spread is arriving by the day and if good news, the circuit breaker can be lifted rapidly. But we need to act now.

          "headline": "Gabriel Boric’s triumph puts wind in the sails of Latin America’s resurgent left",
          "bodyText": "At the age of 14, Gabriel Boric – the great-grandson of a Croatian migrant and an avid reader of Marx and Hegel – formed a city-wide student union in the Chilean city of Punta Arenas. At 21, and by then a law student, he led a campus sit-in for 44 days in Santiago, Chile’s capital, to oust a senior professor accused of plagiarism and corruption. Two years later, in 2011, he was elected figurehead of a massive student rebellion against profiteering private universities, and in 2013 became a congressman for his remote home region. After protests over meagre pensions, living costs and police brutality brought millions more on to the streets from October 2019, Gabriel Boric helped channel public rage into a peaceful outlet: the redrafting of Chile’s dictatorship-era constitution. And on Sunday, Boric, 35, trounced José Antonio Kast – a Catholic law-and-order candidate nostalgic for the bloody dictatorship of Gen Augusto Pinochet – by a 12 percentage-point margin to become the youngest president in Chilean history. Turnout on Sunday was the highest – at nearly 56 percent – since voting became voluntary in 2012. When he takes office on 11 March, Boric will be Chile’s most leftwing leader since Salvador Allende was overthrown in 1973 – and the first from outside the centrist blocs that have swapped the presidential sash since the return of democracy in 1989. The triumph of the avowed feminist and environmentalist has also been hailed as historic by his progressive counterparts across Latin America, who after nearly a decade in the doldrums have won a string of electoral victories in the past year – and are set to notch up even more in 2022. Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – who pollsters predict will deal a thumping defeat to another far-right dictatorship-apologist, Jair Bolsonaro, in late 2022 – shared a grinning picture of himself wearing a Boric-branded baseball cap, and said he felt “happy for another victory of a democratic and progressive candidate in our Latin America”. As Chile went to the polls, Gustavo Petro, a Colombian former guerrilla who is currently leading in polls ahead of presidential elections in May, favourably compared Boric as a “social democrat” against Kast, the son of a card-carrying Nazi. The Peronist president of neighbouring Argentina, Alberto Fernández, invited Boric to “work together to end inequality in Latin America”. Luis Arce of Bolivia’s Movement towards Socialism (MAS), which returned to power a year ago with an even greater electoral margin after dislodging a rightwing caretaker government, also praised Boric’s win fulsomely, calling it “the triumph of the Chilean people”. In Peru, the leftist teacher turned president Pedro Castillo – who narrowly avoided impeachment earlier this December after a chaotic four months in office – tweeted: “Your victory is shared by all Latin American peoples who want to live with liberty, peace, justice and dignity.” Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s authoritarian leftist ruler, praised Chileans “for their resounding victory against fascism”. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s old-school leftwing president, spoke of his “joy” at Boric’s victory, adding that “the people of Chile had “given an example to Latin America and the world”. But some responses to Boric’s win – or the absence thereof – hinted at dividing lines of a generational and philosophical nature within Latin America’s left. The Cuban leader Miguel Díaz Canel expressed his wish to improve ties with the Chilean public and the incoming government – perhaps a nod to Boric’s remarks in July that his “solidarity” was with Cuban protesters and not the country’s Communist government. Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua’s Sandinista strongman, made no comment – perhaps reflecting Boric’s recent comments – soon after Ortega was elected to a fourth consecutive term after first jailing most of the opposition – that the Central American country “needs democracy, not fraudulent elections nor persecution of opponents”. Xiomara Castro, the progressive incoming president of Honduras has also made no comment so far. This reluctance to immediately jump on the Boric bandwagon perhaps reflects not only geographical distance but the gulf between what Javier Rebolledo, a journalist and writer, described as the traditional “Marxist” left and the softer, more Scandinavian cut of Boric’s politics. But few Chileans see themselves as locked in a continental battle between left and right, cautioned Rebolledo. Most are fed up with a threadbare welfare system and a society systematically stacked in favour of the rich, concerns to which Boric has spoken eloquently for a decade. “Boric is part of the path that Chile has been walking for a long time,” he argued. Fears of Venezuelan-style socialism and economic ruin pushed some voters into Kast’s arms. But conversely, the sobering example of racial hatred and mob violence stirred up by Donald Trump, and the deadly incompetence of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro – on whose watch nearly 620,000 Brazilians have died from Covid-19 – may have helped inoculate Chileans against far-right populism. “Chile today demonstrated that we can choose for ourselves,” said Daniela Pardo, a midfielder for a Santiago football club. She had donned a crown of paper flowers to join the jubilant Boric supporters in the emblematic plaza called Dignity Square by anti-inequality protesters. “In the United States and Brazil, far-right governments terrified the public. It was good to learn that lesson.”"

          "bodyText": "Off he stomps in his union jack socks, the pantomime John Bull who caused so much damage by doing his master’s bidding. As David Frost, the former Brexit minister, departs in a self-important huff, his reasons for going illuminate the strange decline of a once great election-winning machine. Frost’s resignation letter – which takes aim at Covid restrictions – usefully captures the Tory party’s deranged state of mind. Its call for “a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy” brims with a primal yearning to liberalise health, safety and food regulations, and workers’ rights. Recently he warned that Brexit will fail if “all we do is import the European social model”. Of all the airily out-of-touch Conservative party conference speeches, his was the wildest: “The British renaissance has begun!” He walks away just as all the world can see the consequences of Brexit: acute job vacancies, supply blockages, daffodils set to rot in the fields, pigs incinerated on farms and the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showing £12bn lost in EU trade in October alone. Frost was a bellicose negotiator who lacked the cunning, tact or subtlety for the job, reneging on the Northern Ireland protocol in his own deal: his value was slavish obedience to Boris Johnson, who plucked him from obscurity at the Scotch Whisky Association, after he had left a career at the Foreign Office. But he’s a useful emblem for the state of a party whose fact-denying Brexit disease now infects every other policy. These irrationalists, like the court of King Canute, think the waves of Covid can be commanded by cabinet fiat, defying Sage’s dire warnings that the NHS will be overwhelmed without stronger restrictions now. Ten cabinet ministers, a third, are reported to be resisting. Though Frost’s letter calls for a post-Brexit Britain at the “cutting edge of modern science”, these eccentrics deny science, evidence, probability and numbers. After “freedom day”, where were their preparations for this variant – or the next? They share Johnson’s contempt for the precautionary principle, despite the public seeing security as any government’s first duty: will voters ever forgive him for an NHS meltdown or more preventable deaths after his capitulation on Monday? Look at how out of kilter this party is with most opinion. “High on their own supply,” as one pollster tells me, their ideologies are not shared by Tory voters, or even Tory members, as Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, finds. The party has lost the ballast of those “men in grey suits” who used to get a grip on the guy ropes. Now even Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, is damning current restrictions as a “disastrous assault on liberty” that evoke the Soviet Union. In contrast, the pollsters at Savanta ComRes find half of voters support a two-week lockdown and 64% would ban large events. The public is not blase about this disease. Meanwhile, in the Sunday Telegraph, a flurry of hand-wringing rightwingers beseech: “We need to return to our core beliefs and remember what makes us Conservatives.” (Danny Kruger MP, co-author of that article, was stood down by Michael Howard as a Tory candidate after calling for “creative destruction” in public services.) Old Labour hands will laugh knowingly at Tories responding to public rejection by diving deeper into their more obscurantist true religions: that’s usually the far left’s affliction. People in Westminster normally worry about getting “cut-through” to voters; everything is upside down when voters see how little cut-through their own views have with the party in power. When exactly did the Tories lose their chameleon talents? Labour used to despair of the party’s skill at remaking its image with whatever it took to tune into the public mood. Remember David Cameron’s pre-2010 brand, his hugging huskies, his “big society” – disguising the austerity axe to come. That self-preserving instinct deserted them the day they set aside caution and chose Boris Johnson, knowing his every fault, his reckless life of alternative truths and his unfitness for any responsible job. The Faustian pact yielded them gold in the 2019 election – but now the price is paid. Their punishment is disaster after disaster. Much worse may happen if the unexpurgated tapes of former No 10 spokesperson Allegra Stratton emerge. Long recordings of her rehearsals exist, reports the Mail on Sunday, where she is thrown all the unanswerable questions about Johnson’s “love children”, “mistresses”, his money and every lifelong wrongdoing. No wonder they scrapped those press conferences. If Downing Street parties took place, 63% of people say the prime minister should resign. The Guardian’s picture of his cheese-and-wine event in May 2020 was taken when the rest of us could meet just one person outside for a single hour, two metres apart. The Tories steel themselves for a possible brutal verdict from Sue Gray, the new head of the inquiry into whether several parties took place in Downing Street and elsewhere (she is dubbed the “battleaxe” by nervous insiders). If the Tories purge their leader, they’ll install someone infected by yet more unpopular small-statery. It’s in their nature. But it’s those who chose Johnson who are the problem, too many of them are the fanatics and fantasists who brought us the great Brexit delusion. Look how Steve Baker just “cancelled” the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, from his 100-strong Clean Global Brexit WhatsApp group of MPs to see quite how divided and factious they are; how remote from voters. Can they recover from this frenzy in time? Never underestimate their focus on power, but what would it take to revive a party that lionised David Frost, and basks in all this outlandish Steve Bakerism? Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Davos economic forum delayed until summer amid Omicron fears",
          "bodyText": "The annual Davos gathering of world leaders, billionaires and business chiefs planned for next month has been delayed until the summer amid mounting concerns over the coronavirus Omicron variant. The World Economic Forum (WEF) – which has been putting on the gathering of the global elite at a Swiss ski resort each January for half a century – said it would hold a series of online sessions next month to bring together global leaders to discuss the world’s biggest challenges instead. A full annual meeting is planned for early summer. Regarded as a key event on the calendar for international relations, business and the world economy, the event was scheduled for 17-27 January with a theme of “working together, restoring trust”. However, the organisers said current pandemic conditions made it extremely difficult to put on a face-to-face meeting. It comes amid a fresh wave of coronavirus infections fuelled by the Omicron variant, leading countries around the world to impose tougher travel controls and a return to tighter government restrictions. “Despite the meeting’s stringent health protocols, the transmissibility of Omicron and its impact on travel and mobility have made deferral necessary,” the WEF said. The decision to push back the event is the second year running that Covid-19 has forced changes. The gathering on a remote mountain top in Switzerland would usually welcome about 3,000 people, including the world’s super-rich flying in by private jet to discuss challenges such as the climate emergency, inequality, business, and technology. The last time world leaders gathered at Davos was for its 50th anniversary meeting in January 2020 – before Covid-19 spread across the world – with campaigners including Greta Thunberg and 53 heads of state, including the then US president, Donald Trump. Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF, said: “Public-private cooperation has moved forward throughout the pandemic and that will continue apace. We look forward to bringing global leaders together in person soon.”"

Manchester Art Gallery until 10 April With Jarman’s paintings as its core, this retrospective looks at the development of this restless spirit who moved first into theatre and movie design, and then into film-making. The show also charts his radicalisation as an HIV-positive artist in the mid-1980s. With music videos for the Smiths and Pet Shop Boys, we also revisit his later, coruscating canvases and tarry reliquaries, and the garden he created at Dungeness. Derek Jarman Protest! Runs concurrently with a show at the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton and a film retrospective at Manchester’s Home, starting in January. Read the full review. 4. Jean Dubuffet: Brutal Beauty Barbican, London, now closed The everyday and the extraordinary collided in the Barbican’s Dubuffet exhibition, which took us through the twists, turns and leaps of the career of this complex and contrary man. Bustling bistros, crowded buses, bonkers traffic, wonky people: Dubuffet approached his subjects with hilarity and horror, subtlety and a perversely sophisticated cack-handedness. Collector of outsider art, loners, people driven by some private need (which he termed Art Brut), Dubuffet learned from, and was freed by these wayward individualists. Read the full review. 3. Sophie Taeuber-Arp Tate Modern, London, now closed The Swiss-born abstractionist, applied artist, painter and sculptor, maker of humorous marionettes, stained-glass, interior design and textiles brought visual pleasure, curiosity, seriousness and joy to whatever she did. For a long time, like Sonia Delaunay and Anni Albers, her reputation languished in the shadow of her male partner the sculptor Jean (Hans) Arp. Her applied art was also relegated to a secondary position. An introduction to an artist whose unbounded energies were cut short by her death in 1943, this exhibition (now at MoMA in New York) is more than a corrective, it is a lesson in openness and freedom. Read the full review. 2. Life Between Islands: Caribbean-British Art 1950s–now Tate Britain, London, until 3 April Windrush and carnival, the rise of the Black Power movement, social injustice, racism and pride are some of the themes of this important and overdue show. Looking not just at artists who came to Britain from the Caribbean, and those of Caribbean heritage, but also at artists who have travelled in the opposite direction. Flawed and fascinating, this is a show of great richness and impact. Read the full review. 1. Theaster Gates: A Clay Sermon Whitechapel gallery, London, until 9 January For Gates, working with clay is as much cultural and bodily language as it is a procession of useful, decorative, commemorative and sculptural objects. Gates’s show takes us from Han dynasty storage jars to the work of Dave the Potter, a hugely talented 19th-century enslaved worker, and from there to Peter Voulkos, the controversial clay sculptor who died in 2002. Amid it all, Gates’s own ceramics, and a related film, delve into materiality and mourning, pushing clay, and ideas, to their limits. Wonderful. Read the full review. Jonathan Jones’s best art shows of the year 5. Gold of the Great Steppe Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, until 30 January Nomads have long been looked down on as the outsiders of history, raiders and rovers who never created anything of their own. This is a hugely important exhibition that refutes that. The ancient Saka people of the east Kazakhstan steppe made dreamlike images of deer, eagles and big cats in gold, and dressed their horses as fabulous dragons. The loans here are so newly dug up you can almost smell the earth. A poem of a show that marries emotion and science. Read the full review. 4. Peru: A Journey in Time British Museum, London, until 20 February Pottery will never look the same after you see how ancient Peruvian peoples stretched clay into surreal shapes, used it to make panpipes and giant drums, then painted it with scenes of sex and death. Human sacrifice and drugs are prominent themes. It includes such unforgettable masterpieces as a 2,000-year-old burial shroud embroidered with dancers swinging severed heads and a scene of musicians inspired by hallucinogenic cactus. A mind-altering encounter that changed my artistic map of the world. Read the full review. 3. Yinka Shonibare CBE RA Stephen Friedman Gallery, London, now closed Shonibare is my artist of the year, setting out a theory of creativity as a hybrid, even “monstrous” process in brilliant sculptures that put African masks on classical European statues, then bringing the same vision to coordinating the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition as a truly global event. Shonibare’s pop art cultural mashups knowingly allude to Picasso’s mask-robbing and the surrealist concept of the marvellous. He’s a visionary who knows how to steal from the past to make the future. 2. Poussin and the Dance National Gallery, London, until 3 January It takes brilliant curatorial insight to turn one of the most apparently remote and cold artists in the canon into a wild and passionate rebel you’d love to have a few glasses of wine with. I finally saw the point of Poussin in this exciting, sharply executed rethink of his early career that is also a beautiful poem to the Rome he loved – a city of classical learning, clerical largesse and plentiful sex, at least to judge from his bacchanalian art. Read the full review. 1. Jean Dubuffet: Brutal Beauty Barbican, London, now closed This phenomenal exhibition turned the story of modern art upside down. The true revolutionary of the 20th century who paved the way for all today’s most exciting impulses turns out not to be Duchamp or even Warhol but this champion of graffiti and children’s art whose cult of the “raw” burst apart every convention. From his grotesque yet moving portraits to landscapes layered in mud and stone to abstractions rivalling Pollock’s, he emerged as a great artist as well as incendiary prophet. Oliver Wainwright’s best architecture of the year 5. The Cosmic House From first entering the Cosmic Oval lobby, lined with disorienting mirror-panelled doors, to ascending the momentous Solar Stair, each step marking a week in the solar calendar, Charles Jencks’ house takes visitors on a whimsical journey of cosmological enlightenment – with a good dose of postmodern kitsch. The house of the late architectural theorist opened to the public this year, unleashing a wonder-world of ornament, symbolism and historical in-jokes, a temple to the man who championed eclecticism and wit in the built environment. Who else could have commissioned a whirlpool bath in the shape of an upside down baroque dome? Read the full article. 4. Becontree Forever The largest interwar council estate in the world, Becontree in Barking &amp; Dagenham celebrated its centenary this year. It wasn’t your usual local council anniversary jamboree, but a carefully curated series of permanent interventions across the estate, led by arts group Create. It included a pair of colourful new playgrounds designed by Yinka Ilori and Eva Rothschild, as well as (forthcoming) new public squares on the estate’s corner plots, by Nimtim architects. One of the most eye-opening projects was by Verity-Jane Keefe, whose exhibition at the RIBA recreated several of the estate’s customised facades, featuring crazy paving and pebbledash alongside doric columns and golden cement lions. Read the full article. 3. East Quay, Watchet Standing as an anarchic, piratical encampment on the windswept harbour front of Watchet in Somerset, the East Quay arts centre shows how coastal regeneration can be done differently. Many are the shiny new arts centres that have been airlifted into struggling seaside towns, but this one is different. Initiated by a group of local mothers, and developed in partnership with the town’s community, it provides a series of airy studio spaces for artists and makers alongside a gallery, classroom, restaurant and shop, as well as a geology workshop, print studio and paper mill – all topped with a cluster of quirky holiday rental pods. Read the full article. 2. Serpentine summer pavilion At just the moment when the 20-year-old annual commission seemed like it might be reaching the end of its useful life, along came a young, largely unknown architect from South Africa to show why it still has the power to inspire. Rather than designing a singular object, Sumayya Vally assembled a mesmerising landscape of ghostly architectural fragments. It was a dreamy collage of steps, plinths, columns and niches, sampled from places across London that all held significance for migrant communities. It was one of the few recent pavilions that made you want to sit, lounge or lie down and while away a few lazy hours. Read the full article. 1. Sara Cultural Centre, Skellefteå While building regulations in England might be making it ever harder to use timber in construction, Sweden is leading the way with wood, showing what a bold new future of “plyscrapers” might look like. The Sara cultural centre and hotel in Skellefteå stands as a 20-storey beacon of pine and spruce, glued and cross-laminated to form super-strong beams, columns and floor slabs – making it stronger than both steel and concrete, relative to its weight. With all the trees harvested from within a 60km radius of the site, and processed nearby, the project shows what locally sourced, low-carbon architecture can be. Read the full article."

          "headline": "Fast, furious and futuristic – Extreme E looks to turn a corner",
          "bodyText": "As his engineers tinkered away with the car parked in the tent just behind him, the former Formula One world champion Nico Rosberg looked down the mud-splattered paddock and said: “For all sports in the world, this is the direction we need to go in.” Rosberg, now a full-on sustainability entrepreneur since hanging up his racing gloves, was back competing, albeit this time as founder and chief executive of RXR racing. “This is the first motorsport ever to be built on a social cause. We are a global role model for sport.” His new role has brought him to deepest Dorset in the middle of winter for the final race in the inaugural season of the innovative Extreme E championship, an FIA-sanctioned series for electric off-road SUVs. This new concept of racing is designed to shine the spotlight on the climate crisis by holding races in remote parts of the world affected. After events in Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Greenland and Sardinia, the season should have ended in Patagonia but for pandemic reasons it’s being held at Bovington Army camp on the south coast of England. This race has been named the Jurassic X-Prix, certainly not a reference to any dinosaurs, more a nod to the famous coastline nearby. Just a few tents down from Rosberg’s was the car belonging to a very familiar foe and the only one that could stop him from lifting this year’s title – the purple liveried X44 team, formed by Sir Lewis Hamilton. “How cool is this?” the German said. “Not only are we fighting for a championship, we’re also in it for a good cause. The more intense our battle, the more impact we’ll have, the more awareness we can raise – that’s amazing.” All weekend, much like the rest of the season, the two teams had dominated, going head to head down to the final lap of the season (stop me if you’ve heard this one before). In the end the X44 car was by far the strongest on this course, driven by Cristina Gutiérrez of Spain and the seven-time world rally champion Sébastien Loeb of France. It put them level on points with RXR, who finished fourth here, but Rosberg’s team claimed the title by having more race victories. Agony for Hamilton’s team (again). The paddock was full of motorsport celebrities. Jenson Button was there, in charge of his team JBXE, while the former rally world champions Carlos Sainz and Loeb were both driving. Jutta Kleinschmidt, the first female Dakar Rally winner, was there too, as was Jamie Chadwick, the first winner of the all-female W Series in 2019, who followed up with victory again this year. This is because gender equality also plays a major part in Extreme E’s philosophy. Unique in the world of motorsport, each team has to field one male and one female driver, with equal roles to both. Catie Munnings, the 24‑year‑old British driver for the Andretti United team, only made her debut in the world rally championship last year but this year she has been racing against heroes such as Loeb. She is the unofficial face of Extreme E and even represented them at the recent Cop26 in Glasgow. Button is fully behind the mixed‑gender racing of Extreme E. “Motorsport has been a male‑dominated sport for decades,” he said. “But this brings a lot of awareness to female drivers, which is great. It means we’re going to see more girls at a young age get interested and that will filter up.” Each of the nine teams has one car, a fully electric SUV named Odyssey 21. These futuristic machines are nearly identical, the only alterations the teams are allowed to make are with the bodywork. The batteries have been developed by Williams Advanced Engineering, designed to withstand the extreme temperatures, conditions and terrains. They can produce a maximum power output of 470kW (equivalent to approximately 630bhp) enough to project the 1,780kg SUV from 0-62mph in 4.5 seconds at gradients of up to 130%. To power up the batteries, Extreme E is using pioneering hydrogen fuel cell technology which will enable its race fleet to be charged using zero emission energy. This innovative, off-grid solution from AFC Energy uses water and sun to generate hydrogen power. Not only does this process emit no greenhouse emissions, its only byproduct is water, which is utilised elsewhere on site. The racing for this X-Prix was held over three days, rather than two for the others, due to the shortage of daylight, with two sets of qualifying on the first two days followed by semi-finals and then a five‑car final on the Sunday. There was also a “crazy race” thrown into the mix, a kind of repechage, in which the slowest qualifiers vie with each other to win the last spot in the final. Every race consists of three laps of the 3.8km circuit: two laps by one driver then a quick changeover in a designated “switch zone” before one lap by the other. It’s fast, furious and futuristic. The defining feature of the course is the 5.4metre “knife edge” jump, which features a 23‑degree slope, making the cars airborne. The noise from the cars is a mix of electric screeching, much a like a pig squealing, and the clatter of stones sent flying. One of the key components to Extreme E’s global adventure is docked in Poole harbour for the duration of this round. Instead of using carbon-heavy air freight to transport all the kit for the championship around the globe, the organisers transformed the former Royal Mail ship, St Helena, which had been serving in the South Atlantic for 26 years. She isn’t fully electric yet, as she proclaims in bold down the side of her hull, instead running on a low-sulphur marine diesel, known as “champagne” in the industry. At every venue for an X-Prix this season Extreme E’s scientific committee has selected a legacy project, a chance to highlight and provide help with a local environmental issue. In 2022 the National Trust is hoping to reintroduce beavers for the first time in 400 years to the Little Sea area near Studland, in the wetlands at the heart of its dune system. Wetlands are particularly vulnerable areas when it comes to changes in climate and biodiversity, but beavers act as nature’s water engineers. This weekend’s final race was held in front of no spectators, just a small gathering of sponsors witnessing the action. This was a decision by the organisers to keep fans away and reduce the carbon footprint their attendance produces. As soon as the race had finished in Dorset, the usual motor-racing rituals had to be played out. Then, once all the champagne had been sprayed and post-race interviews completed, Rosberg and his two ecstatic drivers jumped into the quagmire together and rolled around with delight."

          "bodyText": "And with that, we are going to put the blog to bed for the evening. Thank you everyone for going through the evening’s news with me – as always a total pleasure. Let’s quickly recap the big moments from today: Clean-up continued on Sydney’s northern beaches after ‘mini-cyclone’. Later, emergency services said a microburst was to blame for northern beaches wild weather. Strike announced that will stop Sydney trains overnight. NSW recorded 2,501 new local Covid-19 cases, Victoria 1,302, ACT 13, Queensland 59, SA 105 and Tasmania recorded three. NT recorded three new Covid cases and the lockdown was extended in Tennant Creek At least 10 Melbourne Covid testing sites shut after reaching capacity – wait times we’re long in Victoria, NSW and SA. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet said public health is a “personal” decision and he would not mandate masks. The PM announced he would discuss Omicron outbreak with premiers at snap national cabinet meeting on Friday. Refugee activist Shane Bazzi lodged an appeal against Dutton defamation decision. And NSW approved the construction of a gas-powered station in Hunter. And that’s it! I will be back with you tomorrow – we can do it all again. I reckon what your Monday night needs is this great TikTok from Matilda. From AAP: A monolithic steel cask designed to withstand an earthquake and a jet strike will arrive in Sydney next year, carrying two tonnes of radioactive waste. For security reasons authorities won’t say when the hulking capsule - containing four 500kg canisters of ‘intermediate-level material’ - will arrive from the UK. But it will hardly be an inconspicuous affair: the cask itself weighs 100 tonnes and resembles something from NASA’s space program. Its forged steel walls are 20cm thick, it’s 6.5m long and three metres wide. Back in 2015, when the first cask of its type arrived, it was carrying 20 tonnes of Australian nuclear waste that had been reprocessed in France. About 600 police and security officers were involved in the mission to truck it from Port Kembla, near Wollongong, to Lucas Heights, the southern Sydney suburb that serves as the country’s nuclear technology hub. It is safe to assume that next year’s arrival will involve an equally elaborate, high-security operation. Mining giant Glencore has defended its plans to dig a $1.5bn coalmine in Queensland after telling the federal government more than a dozen threatened species could be on the site, Graham Readfearn writes. An internet outage left residents of a Top End remote community unable to buy food for four days, with critics arguing the situation was worsened by forced welfare income management policies. Maningrida, an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory home to about 3,000 people, suffered through an outage of 3G and 4G internet services from 11am Thursday until Monday afternoon. The NSW government has approved the construction of a $600m gas-fired power station backed by the Morrison government in the state’s Hunter region. Snowy Hydro has received its planning approval to build the 660 megawatt power station in Kurri Kurri from Rob Stokes in one of his final decisions as the state’s planning minister and after a fast-tracked environmental assessment. The Morrison government announced in May it would spend up to $600m on the project after warning it would step in if the private sector did not commit to building at least 1000MW to replace the Liddel coal-fired generator in 2023. Labor had called for the government to release its business case for the taxpayer-funded project. The project’s environmental impact statement showed the Kurri Kurri plant would be rarely used. “This project will improve energy reliability and security in the National Energy Market as it brings on renewable energy from wind and solar farms, and transitions away from coal-fired power generation over the next 10-15 years,” a spokesperson for the NSW department of planning, industry and environment said this evening. A severe storm on Sydney’s northern beaches on Sunday that left one woman dead and three injured, tore the roof off buildings and felled trees, was a microburst event, according to New South Wales emergency services. On Monday, NSW State Emergency Service superintendent Stuart Fisher said: “At approximately 3.45pm yesterday, a microburst appeared out of nowhere, situated over the northern beaches, resulting in over 550 requests for assistance and 150,000 phone calls.” From AAP: A yoga instructor heading home from a neighbourhood Christmas gathering has been identified as the woman killed in a brief but ferocious storm in Sydney. The storm, which ripped roofs off apartment buildings and took out power for 35,000 homes, struck as 68-year-old Susan Cobham was heading home from a party near Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club on Sunday afternoon. “Lightning hit a massive Norfolk pine which subsequently fell, crushing her and hitting two other women,” her son Ben Porter posted to her Facebook page. “It was an unlucky freak accident and she has left us far too early and will be sorely missed.” Cobham, who was educated in Uruguay and previously worked as a scientist for AstraZeneca, was “a terrific person, a real bright spark and will be much missed”, friend Penny Auburn posted. Former AstraZeneca colleague Karishma Pai said Cobham was “a great colleague and even better a friend to many of us who worked in the lab alongside her”. Surging demand at Covid testing clinics across Australia has led to waiting times of up to five days for results, with travellers now worried they won’t get a negative result in time to cross state borders for Christmas. Waiting times in Victoria have averaged between 40 minutes and an hour during the past week, while a busy ACT site reached capacity by 9.30am on Monday. We’ve got a little bit of wet weather on the way for some states ... From AAP: Conservation groups have reached the Supreme Court to challenge key environmental approvals granted to Woodside’s Scarborough Gas project off northwest Western Australia, in order to prevent what they call “staggering amounts of pollution”. Woodside reached a final investment decision in November for the joint $16 billion LNG development. Part of the proposal is to pipe gas from the field, approximately 375km west of the Burrup Peninsula near Karratha, to its existing onshore Pluto LNG plant. At the heart of the challenge are amendments to the project’s environmental approvals, which the EPA agreed to in August. The changes were then approved by WA Environment Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson. Lawyers for the Environmental Defenders Office, acting on behalf of the Conservation Council of WA, told the court in Perth the changes would allow for “significant” extra greenhouse gas emissions, which EPA chairman Matthew Tonts had not properly assessed in deciding on the approvals. “The inference to be drawn is that the chairman didn’t reach his own decision,” Henry Jackson SC, representing the EDO, told the court on Monday. We mentioned earlier that the PM is holding a previously unscheduled meeting with national cabinet, here Katharine Murphy has the full run down. The shadow education minister Tanya Plibersek has written to the auditor general about an “unacceptable delay” in the Australian Research Council announcing 2022 grant funding round outcomes. There have been significant delays to announcements of grants awarded in the ARC’s Discovery Projects, Linkage and LIEF schemes. Plibersek wrote: “With only seven working days left this year, researchers across the nation are yet to receive a decision about their 2022 Australian Research Grant applications. We understand this is the longest delay in announcing these grants in thirty years. This is causing significant uncertainty for around five thousand Australian researchers who don’t know whether they’ll have a job next year or whether their projects will have funding. In our view, the Government’s unacceptable delay in announcing Australian Research Grants is a serious failure of public administration – a matter of national interest that bears further scrutiny. The delays come after months of controversy for the ARC. In August, the council was widely criticised for deeming grant proposals ineligible due to a rule banning applicants from citing preprint materials. The rule was later scrapped and affected applicants had an appeal upheld. The ARC’s chief executive Sue Thomas said this month that she would step down in January. Epidemiologist Prof Mary-Louise McLaws has spent the past week dialling in to meetings of the World Health Organization’s [WHO] infection prevention and control group, and said: “I don’t know of any outbreak manager who would not support wearing masks at the very minimum” in cities where Covid-19 cases are rising. “WHO keeps reminding the world that vaccines are not the only answer because this virus keeps changing,” McLaws said. “Vaccines certainly reduce the risk of death and severe infection. But you do need other measures, like physical distancing, and masks.” The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, continued to resist additional measures to mitigate the spread of Omicron on Monday, saying, “The pandemic is not going away. We need to learn to live alongside it,” while ruling out mask mandates and further restrictions for now. “The government can’t do everything,” he said. Like Perrottet, Scott Morrison said booster vaccines are key to living with the virus, a view echoed by Dr Nick Coatsworth, one of Australia’s deputy chief medical officers, on Twitter. Read more: A Labor-led committee will scrutinise the problem-plagued light rail system in Sydney’s inner west, reports AAP. The parliamentary inquiry comes after cracks were found in all 12 vehicles used on the L1 line, forcing commuters onto replacement buses and ferries. “With light rail services suspended from Central to Dulwich Hill for up to 18 months, thousands of individuals and businesses have been significantly impacted,” committee chair Daniel Mookhey said. “The committee seeks to shed light on how and why this has happened, its impact on the community, and importantly, how those impacts can be mitigated until the line is reinstated.” The inquiry will also examine services in Sydney’s southeast and Newcastle as well as the procurement, operation and maintenance of the systems. Hearings will be heard in the new year, with submissions and a questionnaire closing on 31 March. Outgoing Transport Minister Rob Stokes announced last month that all 12 trams on the city’s inner west line would be decommissioned for up to 18 months to fix major cracks - up to 30cm long - on the rolling stock. But last week he revealed the seven-year-old light rail cars would be back up and running in less than a year. Former police minister David Elliot will take over the transport portfolio from Tuesday after Premier Dominic Perrottet’s first major cabinet reshuffle. Looks like it could be a scorcher in Perth this Christmas. From AAP: Sydney train commuters have been warned of major disruptions to the network overnight as union members plan on further strike action. The work stoppage will disrupt the Sydney Trains-operated network as Rail, Tram, and Bus Union members plan to strike from 8pm on Monday to 4am on Tuesday. Transport for NSW has warned train frequency will slow from 6pm and people could be left stranded. Buses will replace train services on all lines between 8pm and 4am, but Sydney commuters are being encouraged to avoid travelling on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning. Intercity and regional services will also be affected, with some of the services suspended from 3.30pm on Monday before resuming at 5.30am on Tuesday. The union says it remains at loggerheads with Transport for NSW as they negotiate a new enterprise agreement covering more than 10,000 staff. Federal parliamentarians from across the political spectrum have pleaded with the Western Australian government to strengthen new state laws designed to protect Aboriginal heritage, amid concerns the McGowan government has not taken into consideration lessons learned from the destruction of a sacred site at Juukan Gorge in 2020. Members of the joint standing committee on northern Australia wrote to Stephen Dawson, WA Aboriginal affairs minister, on 10 December, to express their concern about the WA Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Bill, days before it was passed into law. The committee previously conducted a review into Rio Tinto’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old cultural site at Juukan Gorge. The committee’s chair, federal LNP MP Warren Entsch, said the new WA bill “falls far short of the reforms advocated” advocated in his committee’s final report. Entsch noted the committee’s recommendations called for “consistency with the principles of free, prior and informed consent by Indigenous people”, and said the WA bill “conflicts with these principles by giving the Minister the ultimate power to decide whether mining or other activities can go ahead if traditional owners do not agree”. Entsch also criticised the consultation process behind the WA bill, saying it “was not centred on culturally based protocols, was not undertaken in language and was not linked to elements of Aboriginal culture”. Last week, after the bill passed, Labor senator Pat Dodson, who co-wrote the letter to Dawson, blasted the Western Australian government for failing its one opportunity to protect Aboriginal heritage and stop the “tyranny of cultural genocide”. Read more about the WA bill here, from Lorena Allam, Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs editor: Specialist forensic interviewers from NSW are being briefed by Tasmanian police today before they interview young witnesses of the tragedy in Devonport. They will start interviewing some of those students at the school within days. There’s been a lot of heat in the debate today about if NSW is right not to mandate masks. Some people are arguing the government needs to stay out of lives, treat people like adults – essentially how Perrottet put it this morning. Here is what the University of Sydney’s Prof Julie Leask – who I am sure I don’t have to remind anyone is a leading infectious disease and immunisation expert – had to say. SA has recorded triple digit Covid cases, officially recording 105 new cases. They are 11 children, six teenagers, 39 women aged between 18 and 93 and 49 men aged between 18 and 67. Refugee activist Shane Bazzi has lodged an appeal in the federal court in relation to the defamation action brought against him by Peter Dutton. Bazzi, through his lawyers, said on Monday that Dutton “succeeded on only parts of his claim before justice Richard White”. “Bazzi will be arguing that the judge erred in finding [his] tweet carried the meaning found by the judge, namely that Mr Dutton ‘excuses rape’,” his lawyers said in a brief statement. The appeal should be heard in 2022. In November, the defence minister won his defamation case, with damages of $35,000, over a tweet labelling him a “rape apologist” which the court agreed did convey the defamatory imputation he “excuses rape”. Bazzi’s lawyers asked for the costs bill to be reduced, citing a discretion to do so if the win was worth less than $100,000 or the court decided the case could more suitably have been brought in another court or tribunal. White in early December ruled Dutton would not receive his full legal costs from Bazzi because it would have been more appropriate to pursue the case in a lower court. Bazzi’s tweet, since deleted, said “Peter Dutton is a rape apologist”. It included a link to a 2019 Guardian Australia article reporting comments by Dutton that some female refugees were “trying it on” by making claims they had been raped, and needed to travel to Australia from offshore detention to receive abortions. The tweet was published on the same day Dutton had said he didn’t know the “she said he said” details of Brittany Higgins’ allegation of rape. From AAP: The death of two children, their father and a pilot has been described as a “terrible incident” as the plane at the centre of the joyride tragedy is recovered near Brisbane. Investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) have begun collecting evidence after the operation in “quite inaccessible” mangroves off Scarborough, following the crash on Sunday morning. The wreckage is being taken to a secure location at the Redcliffe Aerodrome where investigators will try and recover specific components to send to Canberra for analysis. Recorded data, weather information, and pilot and maintenance records will also be examined, and ATSB investigators have begun interviewing witnesses and those involved. The Rockwell Commander 114 single-engine light aircraft crashed into the water near the shoreline shortly after take-off, coming to rest upside down. There were no survivors. Queensland minister Stirling Hinchliffe, whose electorate of Sandgate is near the crash site north of Brisbane, led tributes on behalf of the state government on Monday. “Obviously all of the appropriate investigations will be undertaken … and we hope that we can get to the bottom of what might have caused this awful, terrible incident,” he said on Monday. From AAP: The majority of new COVID-19 infections in the ACT have been linked to outbreak hotspots including Sydney and Newcastle. The national capital recorded 13 new infections on Monday. The health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, said a large number of cases stemmed from people who tested positive after arriving in Canberra from interstate. There have been 40 infections linked to the Omicron variant since the new strain emerged. “The majority of our cases were interstate acquired, rather than being locally acquired, so we still weren’t seeing a high level of local community transmission,” she told ABC radio. Vaccination bookings for children aged between five and 11 have opened ahead of the rollout starting from January 10. An estimated 46,000 children will be eligible. The PM is now spruiking the family home guarantee, which is a government program targeting single parents. It allows them to buy a home with a 2% deposit. This is targeted towards single parents. And it’s getting them out of public housing, getting them out of unpredictable rents, and now they are buying their first home. Can you imagine what that means to a single parent, that they can get the kids into their own home and not be fighting in the rental market. He says 177,000 Australians have bought their first home this year, “up from less than 100,000 just three years ago.” I’m no economist, and I don’t want to take away how good that must feel for those parents – but I feel like it would help more people if houses were like, you know – cheaper. Too wild? IDK I’m not in politics. And now we are on another crisis – housing affordability. The PM says the government is helping more than any other government in the history of Australia. He’s citing the government’s First Home Loan deposit scheme and the Home Builder programs as the reasons first homebuyers have been able to get in the market. It is really hard to buy your first time. It’s always been very hard but it’s even harder as time goes on. That’s why we introduced those programs so people would be able to buy first time with a smaller deposit. Since we have done that 323,000 Australians have got into their first home since the last election. That’s extraordinary. I wonder how many first homebuyers have been priced out since the last election? The mask mandate has been a hot issue today – and the PM says the government will take advice from medical experts. There will be circumstances where masks are commonsense and I have noticed that, especially with the increase in Omicron. There is not that requirement in NSW at the moment but anybody who has been out there recently know that people are taking responsibility for their own health. He says he was at Carols in the Shire last night and a lot but “not all” people were wearing masks. The PM says he will discuss the rising number of Omicron cases and the issue of state borders with the premiers at an unscheduled meeting of national cabinet. National cabinet was not due to meet again until February. What’s very important ... under the national plan we are now at more than 90% double dose vaccination rate. It is important that we do what we have also sought to do and save lives and livelihoods, protect lives and livelihoods ... we want to stay safely open so the economy can continue to grow and people can get jobs. The PM is asked if he is concerned about the effect on the airline industry – he says something vague about Australians needing to know that if they get on a plane, they can get off it at the other end. He says they are taking Omicron seriously. Remember, we have been doing that for coming on to two years and what has been the result of the approach we have taken? The lowest death rates in the world, the strongest economies, coming out and through the pandemic, one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. That’s what happens when you keep your head, keep focused on the future, deal with the problems in front of you and you work together and you do so in a commonsense and calm way. The PM is asked if Australia will return to lockdowns next year like parts of Europe are doing now: We will make our Australian way through this, we always have, the situation in the northern hemisphere is different to Australia. They are not standing over there in the Netherlands in 34 degrees, it’s winter and people are more indoors, we know the virus does move differently in different seasons. What’s important is people get their booster shots. Anyone who is concerned and who is ready to have their booster shot, I would urge them to go and get it. Because that is the best defence against Omicron, especially for making sure against serious illness ... That is the key advice we have received and if we do that, then we can keep our nerve, keep calm and carry on. The PM says he welcomed Annastacia Palaszczuk’s announcement this morning about extra health funding. We have to keep moving forward with this. This is why Australians rolled up their sleeve, this is why Australians have worked so hard. The cases will rise with the Omicron variant, what we will continue to work through with states and territories is making sure we manage the impact on the hospital system in the primary health network. I welcome the decision the premier made here today; we have a 50-50 funding arrangement with all states and territories when it comes to their COVID-19 cost we put in place at the start of the pandemic, and we are doing this hand in glove. He says there are “plenty” of boosters: Doses sitting in the fridges, at the distribution points, 9000 around the country right now, there are 13 million doses in Australia, right now... There was some pressure but that’s been overcome now, and people will be able to get on and do that over the course of the summer break. The PM, Scott Morrison, is talking in Brisbane now ... A lot of people on (and I suspect off) Twitter are asking why RAT aren’t free today. As the political year draws to a close and an election looms, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has been busy filling diplomatic appointments. Australia’s foreign minister has confirmed that the former Liberal frontbencher and Senate president Scott Ryan is bound for Canada as Australia’s next high commissioner. When Ryan departed the Senate presidency earlier this year rather than seeing out his full term, the internal speculation pointed to a looming diplomatic appointment. And so it was. In a statement issued today, Payne notes that Ryan has served in a number of ministerial roles as well as being president of the Senate between 2017 and 2021. Payne says: Australia and Canada have a close relationship founded on shared values and experiences. We are proud liberal democracies and federal systems. Australian and Canadian defence personnel have served side-by-side for over 100 years. We also share a deep commitment to celebrating our indigenous heritages. Our bilateral economic relationship is substantial. Two-way trade was worth $6.4bn in 2020, and Canada is our 11th largest source of foreign investment, with two-way investment currently standing at $159bn. Canada is a vital partner in a range of international forums, particularly the United Nations, APEC, WTO, G20 and the OECD. Our two countries work together closely through the Five Eyes group. We cooperate on international issues such as climate change, global peace and security, human rights, and the empowerment of women and girls. Australia stands with Canada against the use of arbitrary detention and we welcome Canada’s growing engagement in the Indo-Pacific. Ryan will replace the current high commissioner, Natasha Smith. SA premier Steven Marshall says the state has recorded “about 100” new Covid cases. The official figure will come this afternoon, around 3.30pm ACDT so we’ll bring you more info then. The 19-year-old pleaded guilty to charges of not using a QR code and failing to wear a mask in two settings, AAP reports. With big business backing Labor’s climate policy and net zero gaining bipartisan support, the climate battle is transitioning into a new phase, writes Adam Morton. For those who had Santa swimming with sharks on their 2021 bingo card Boost for open borders! The first death of a child with Covid-19 in New Zealand has prompted calls for Māori children to be prioritised in the next stage of the vaccine rollout, as the country grapples with racial inequalities compounded by the pandemic. A Māori boy, under the age of 10 and who had tested positive for the virus, died last week, becoming the youngest New Zealander to die with Covid, the Ministry of Health confirmed. Acting chief minister Nicole Manison said there were 3,207 Covid tests taken in the Northern Territory in the past 24 hours. The mask mandate has been lifted for Katherine. Thirteen Covid patients are in hospital in Alice Springs. The three new cases are: A man and a woman in their 30s from Walkabout Bore outstation. They have both spent time in Tennant Creek. And the other is a child from Tennant Creek who was already in quarantine. The Tennant Creek lockdown and mask mandate for Barkly region has been extended by 48 hours until 5pm Wednesday after the territory recorded three new cases. More testing trouble in Melbourne ... There are plans to open up more testing clinics in Melbourne after people report waits of more than two hours. A reader contacted me earlier to say he had waited in line for two and a half hours in Preston this morning – and the testing site only had one nurse: There is legit only one testing staff and hundreds of people waiting. Another reader in Fairfield waited more than an hour – with three nurses working. The demand is being driven by a combo of more people having to isolate and people getting tested before they travel interstate. In response, the state government announced three new Covid testing sites have been set up today and 20 across the city will open one hour earlier. We’ll see over the next few days if that helps make a dent ... And that is it from Queensland. Just to recap: There are 59 new Covid cases across the state and they’re seeing roughly a doubling of cases every 48 hours. Omicron is quickly becoming the dominant strain and the government is recommending that people wear masks indoors. Some patients in Queensland are being treated at home, Gerrard says: There are 66 patients in hospital but, of those 66 patients, only one of them is there for medical reasons. There are other reasons why patients might be in hospital with Covid-19, such as isolating them from sick relatives, etc. We are increasingly managing patients with Covid-19 in their homes. And quite a number of patients have been shifted to home care in the last few days. In fact, there are 32 cases currently being cared for in their home or in another suitable residence. Gerrard: In terms of the Omicron strain – Omicron is clearly becoming dominant in Queensland. We’ve had 43 confirmed Omicron cases in Queensland so far and of those tested yesterday, there were 13 Omicron cases and eight Delta cases. John Gerrard says today’s cases bring the total number of cases in Queensland to 2,356, with 197 cases active and 33 under investigation: In terms of the locations of cases, very similar to what we’ve seen in the past few days, including Brisbane south and north, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba region and Townsville. Queensland’s CHO Dr John Gerrard is speaking now. He is giving a rundown of the state’s cases: We’re seeing roughly a doubling in the number of cases every 48 hours roughly. So we do expect the cases to increase significantly and the trend has continued as we head into January. He says the state has one patient in hospital who is recovering well at the moment, which is great news: I was told last night and she was not vaccinated. Having said that, our cases are still ... Our case numbers are still small. Only a couple of hundred cases over the past week. And we know that people are most likely to get seriously ill in the second week of their illness. So it will be very instructive to learn in the next one to two weeks what pattern we see in the hospitals. Palaszczuk: We had extra money from stamp duty and extra money from coal royalties and I believe that this is a necessary step to make sure that health has that extra money there. This is already on top of the $22bn in the health budget. So that’s some good news. Palaszczuk is now talking about the government’s announcement that it will create 108 new jobs for paramedics: Today I’m announcing an extra boost to Queensland Health and that is an additional $200m. As we enter this new phase of dealing with Covid and the pandemic, we will be dealing with more and more people in the home environment and we want to make sure that we have the best technology. We’re giving people the best care possible because a lot of this will be managed at home rather than our hospitals unless people are seriously ill. Palaszczuk has thanked Queenslanders for wearing masks and strongly recommends people wearing them inside: We’re not mandating it, but I will be wearing my mask when I go in and out of cafes or restaurants and, when you’re sitting there, you can take your mask off. This is just an added precaution until we get to that 90% fully vaccinated. But also, too, until we need Queenslanders to get their boosters. It’s really important if your boosters are due – please go and get your booster. Annastacia Palaszczuk says cases will spike over Christmas: I expect to see more and more cases coming up into Christmas and over new year, but we are well prepared for this. We now have had 13,395 tests in the last 24 hours – 10,520 vaccines were administered by Queensland Health and the good news is that we are now at 89.67% first dose and we are looking at 84.51% of eligible Queenslanders are fully vaccinated. We also have had 197,546 border passes issued. So again, you can see that there’s a lot of people who are reuniting with families and friends coming into the Christmas and new year season. In Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is speaking ... Days after introducing controversial heritage laws widely criticised by peak Aboriginal advocates, WA Aboriginal affairs minister Stephen Dawson has been stripped of this portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle. On 17 December premier Mark McGowan announced that Dawson will become the minister for emergency services, innovation and ICT, medical research and volunteering “after delivering important reforms in his portfolios”. The reshuffle comes just a week after the the Aboriginal cultural heritage bill 2021 passed WA parliament. Kado Muir, WA Ngalia cultural and community leader and chairman of National Native Title Council, said traditional owners had been left in the dark after the cabinet reshuffle: The fleeting impermanence of ministerial appoints show the stark contrast of experiences and laws. We the Aboriginal people are left with an intergenerational burden of bad laws, while the minister representing the settler state rides off into the unknown and into obscurity. Muir said there needed to be a new relationship between Aboriginal people and the settler society that takes into account First Nations laws are ancient and enduring: In contrast, whitefella laws come and go but create unending uncertainty and sadness to my people. He called for the new portfolio minister Toni Buti to build a relationship on respect, and earn the trust of Aboriginal people. The new laws, which will replace the Aboriginal Heritage Act, were designed to allow proper consultation with traditional owners before the destruction of sacred sites – after the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge caves in the Pilbara were blown up last year by Rio Tinto. But the bill has been widely criticised by advocate groups and the peak body for lawyers in the state as it removed the rights of traditional owners to appeal against any destruction to traditional sites. Hello everyone – this is Cait. Firstly, thanks to Matilda Boseley, who as always – completely smashed it this morning. I’m going to take you through the afternoon – so hold on to those hats! With that, I shall hand you over to the always amazing Cait Kelly to take you through the afternoon of news. See you tomorrow! Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai has denied that she accused a former senior official of sexually assaulting her, in what is believed to be the first foreign press interview since her November essay caused a media storm: I wanted to make this very clear: I have never claimed, or written about anyone having sexually assaulted me. With regards to Weibo, it’s about my personal privacy ... There’s been a lot of misunderstanding … There [should be] no distorted interpretation. The claim apparently contradicted a 2 November social media post, in which Peng accused the former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of having coerced her into sex. The essay was taken down less than 30 minutes after it was published, and Peng became the centre of a global media storm after disappearing from public view for more than two weeks after the essay. You can read the full report below: Summer in Australia is synonymous with seafood, from fish and chips at the beach to prawns on the barbie. But how do we know if the seafood is sustainable – that is, harvested from healthy stocks with minimal negative environmental impacts? More than a third of the world’s fisheries are being harvested at unsustainable levels, according to the latest figures from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation. Research shows public awareness of the problem is growing. But 62% of the seafood Australians eat is imported, which can make it hard to determine the food’s provenance. While comprehensive sustainable seafood guides like the Australian Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish are readily available, we know some people find them daunting and time-consuming to use. To make it simpler, we’ve put together five tips for better seafood-buying, focusing on holiday favourites. You can read all the best tips on how to make your feast of summer seafood sustainable below: We can expect to hear from the Queensland premier at about 11.30am Brisbane time, so in about an hour. Usually, this is when we get the state’s Covid-19 numbers as well so looks as though we might have a little while to go. Today the NSW premier also announced that the party’s candidate for Sydney’s inner-west federal seat of Strathfield would be Bridget Sakr, whose daughter Veronique was 11 when she and her three cousins were killed by a drunk driver in Oatlands. Dominic Perrottet: To have someone like Bridget put her hand up and run in public life, the Liberal party is blessed – with the people of Strathfield even more. To have someone of her value and virtues to put a hand up to public life is an incredible testament to her to have the most heartbreaking tragedy that no parent could ever imagine going through, but the way that she dealt with the and particularly her forgiveness that was so striking, and every person across our state was incredibly moved by that tragedy but I think we were moved even more by the family’s response. Reporter: Hospitalisations up 30% on yesterday, doesn’t that set off alarm bells because people who test positive this week potentially won’t go to hospital for two to three weeks? Perrottet: We monitor that. As I said, of the ICU presentations – 33 – 26 of those people are not vaccinated. Vaccination has been crucial, New South Wales is standing strong. We are going to leave the nation out of the pandemic. There is always concern. We look at these, we look at the data every day. We consider the position every day. But if not now, when? It is time for New South Wales to go to the next level, it is up to New South Wales to continue to be strong and lead the nation out of the pandemic. It is exactly what we’re going to do in this state. We monitor that situation every single day – yes, there will be challenges. But ultimately where we sit today with the strongest health system in the nation, we are ready. There will be, we know, there will be hospitalisations. We have said that from the outset. When we opened up, I said numerous times, when we opened up my as mobility increases, case numbers will increase, case numbers will lead to hospitalisations and hospitalisations will lead to ICU presentations. But we cannot live in a world where there is not Covid. We have to live in the world as it is. And as it is, the best thing we can do is have a high vaccination rate. Dominic Perrottet says the only reason other states have closed their border is that Labor ministers have not invested enough in their health system. (Only WA now has its border closed, so not totally sure who is now “closing their borders”.) Perrottet: When I look around the country right now and I see borders closing, they are closing for one reason. They are closing because they have not invested in their health system like we have in New South Wales. Liberals and Nationals are not known for health but now, if you look around the other states, it is the Labor states that are closing their borders because they have not invested in their health system. We have the best health system in the nation, if not the country. We can open up safely. I am completely focused with the health minister on ICU presentations, we monitor this every day. Perrottet: To have 95%, 95% of our population here in New South Wales having a first-dose vaccination, yet, 26 of the 33 people in ICU in New South Wales are unvaccinated. The numbers speak for themselves. Dominic Perrottet: Rest assured, every single day, we meet with the health minister and discuss these matters on an ongoing basis. But we need to stand strong. The people of New South Wales are incredibly resilient. We have got through the last two years, we are going to get through this period as well. As the key to that, if you look at the evidence – and there is a great recap today, if you get the chance to see it in the Australian Financial Review – that shows over the last period of time that while case numbers have increased with Delta and previous variants, hospitalisations are not at the same levels as they were. We continue to monitor that information, we continue to look at the evidence and we will tailor our response accordingly. But the key message from the government is look after each other, socially distance when you can, if you can’t – wear a mask. That is our message and it is pleasing to see the public are responding. The public are listening to those messages. Dominic Perrottet says if the state “needs” to change its approach due to Omicron, it will. This is interesting as a number of top experts have said it should be. Perrottet: We are taking a balanced and proportionate response. It is completely focused on keeping people safe while at the same time opening up our economy and ensuring that people are able to work, be in jobs and provide for their families. There will always be new variants of this virus. The pandemic is not going away. We need to learn to live alongside it. I appreciate as premier there is concern in the community. but now is our time to stand up, to stand tall, to look after each other, to treat people with kindness and respect and we will get through it. As I have said, from the outset, we will always tailor our response to the circumstances that are in front of us. When it comes to face masks, we recommend face masks in areas where you cannot socially distance. It is a time of personal responsibility for our state. We are treating the people of our state like adults. We need to tailor our responses from time to time and we will. There are challenging times today, there will be challenging times tomorrow. We have come through what has been an incredibly difficult 12 months and we still stand strong and accept there are differing views from time to time. Jumping back to Dominic Perrottet for a moment, here is what he has to say about the hospitalisation rates in NSW: The first point I want to make in relation to the ICU presentations is very important. We are currently on a first-dose vaccination at close to 95%. In relation to the ICU presentations, which is the key metric for the state, we have 33 people in ICU; 26 of those 33 are unvaccinated. The evidence is clear. The numbers do not lie. Getting vaccinated protects you and your family, and that has been the key success for our state in opening up. I just want to encourage you again today. It has been five months since your second-dose vaccination, please make an appointment because booster shots [are] keeping people safe. He reassures people that vaccines will still be available over the Christmas break:. I know as we head into the Christmas break, many of you will be aware that GPs go on holidays. So our vaccination centres are not going on holidays, they will be opened by people to visit and receive your booster shot. The Northern Territory has opened its borders to travellers who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 as quarantine requirements for arrivals end, reports AAP’s Aaron Bunch. Travellers now have to return a negative PCR test taken within three days of their arrival in the territory. They also need to get re-tested within three days of arriving and again on their sixth day in the NT. Unvaccinated travellers have been barred, with only returning residents exempt. Travellers will need to show proof they are vaccinated or evidence they are ineligible for the jab. Tests are free at NT government coronavirus testing facilities and travellers are not required to isolate while they wait for the results. Authorities are also handing out free rapid antigen test kits at the airport for use at home if people develop symptoms. Arrivals must stay in high-vaccination areas, such as Darwin and Alice Springs. The are also required to download the G2G Now app and complete location check-ins when ordered. Most travellers are banned from dozens of remote communities where vaccination rates remain below 80%. Unvaccinated people who try to get into the territory will be turned away and could face a fine of more than $5,000. Those allowed in must quarantine at their own expense for 14 days. Speaking of ... The Victoria government says they are doing what they can to boost testing capacity as centers around the state are overwhelmed. OK, time to hear from the NSW premier who is laying out his government’s cabinet recent reshuffle, with members expected to be sworn in to their new roles tomorrow. This includes nine members who are new to the cabinet. After this shakeup, there will then be seven women and 19 men, which, rather scarily is actually an improvement for NSW gender equality. Dominic Perrottet: I want to congratulate those members and I’m here today with Wendy [Tuckerman] who will be appointed tomorrow as a minister for local government, Natasha Maclaren-Jones will be appointed the minister for disability services also, another appointed for small business in fair trading and James Griffin who will be appointed as a minister for the environment and heritage ... Big curveballs come have come our way and we wanted a team here New South Wales [who] will continue the great work that this government has laid and the infrastructure and driving a state through challenging times but ultimately, to take New South Wales the next level and I know, that every one of these new ministers who will be appointed tomorrow has the experience but importantly, the passion and energy to take New South Wales to the next level and that’s what this is all about. Edward says there were a number of “near misses” that resulted in people receiving only minor injuries. We had people hit by debris that had a lot of bruises and cuts that were assessed, and those people did not require transport to hospital. Superintendent Paul Edwards has given some more detail on the incident that claimed the life of one woman during the northern beaches storm over the weekend. It was a difficult situation, managed extremely well. We got early calls in the afternoon about the storm in this area that was quite widespread and it soon became evident that the priority was this location. On arrival, we had a surf lifesaver who performed an amazing job, looking after the patient before our arrival. Unfortunately, one of the patients was deceased. There were two that were critical. There was one with minor injuries. Communication was amazing. They were two rescue helicopters dispatched and we brought medical teams into the site to assist the patient. One patient was in her early 20s with head injuries and spinal injuries and the second patient with severe internal injuries. It became evident with the amount of people looking after these people that the best option was to transport them by road to Royal North Shore hospital. One of the medical teams assisted with the paramedics. Essentially, a medical team, we have the ability of bringing in the ED department to be seen. It seems that surf lifesavers were the first on the scene after a woman was fatally struck by a fallen tree in the northern beaches, and were later assisted by ambulance and fire teams. Fisher says 10 families have been forced to leave their homes on the northern beaches in Sydney due to storm damage. Only a small number have been displaced. We are looking at about 10 properties, mainly units, at this point in time. Air crews are working through those homes that have roof damage so that may increase but at the moment it is minimal. Let’s go to Sydney now where emergency services are giving an update on the freak storm that wreaked havoc on Syndey’s northern beaches yesterday, and has so far led to the death of one person. Superintendent Stuart Fisher: At approximately 3:45pm yesterday, a microburst [weather event] appeared out of nowhere, situated over the northern beaches, resulting in over 550 requests for assistance and 150 000 phone calls. According to the US government’s national weather website, a microburst is “a microburst is a localised column of sinking air (downdraft) within a thunderstorm and is usually less than or equal to 2.5 miles in diameter”. They can cause a hunger amount of damage to infrastructure and, as we have seen, can be fatal. Currently, the SES have over 15 teams out in the field along with support from our FS, New South Wales Fire and Rescue, council and other local government authorities. We expect to have the majority of those jobs are sorted today and tomorrow, although we are working closely with Ausgrid who are working through restoring power to over 26,000 homes ... The main damage were trees and power lines down as well as minor to moderate and major property damage workplaces lost roofs. Places ... lost their roofs and the majority were trees down and sadly one person was deceased as a result of a falling tree. As a little break from all the doom and gloom Omicron news, please enjoy this story about an ungodly fish that’s washed ashore in California. As NSW continues to set national records for daily Covid-19 infections, the premier is resisting calls to reinstate mask mandates but says he will act if required, reports AAP. A day after NSW recorded 2,566 new COVID-19 cases and with Christmas fast approaching, Dominic Perrottet has written an editorial in the Daily Telegraph calling for calm. Case numbers are bound to rise, just as the modelling predicted, and we are all likely to have a close encounter with Covid ... This is not to be taken lightly. The safety of the community is and always will be our top priority, and if the trajectory of an outbreak appears likely to put our health system under excessive pressure, we will change our approach, tailoring it to the circumstances and the evidence ... For now, that is not the case. NSW is urging people to keep wearing masks indoors while other health experts are calling for mask mandates to return in those settings. However, Perrottet said it is a personal decision. It is time to shift the balance back to personal responsibility, because a strong, healthy society is built not on the dictates of government, but on the common pursuit of the common good. Overwhelming testing demand has created long queues and forced several sites to shut, as Victoria reported 1,302 new Covid-19 infections and no deaths, reports AAP’s Callum Godde. It is the first day the state has not reported a Covid-related death since 16 September, and there are 13,175 active cases in the community. A total of 406 patients are in hospital, 81 of whom are actively infected with the virus in intensive care and 43 on ventilators. The seven-day hospitalisation average has risen by seven to 387. About 4,800 people were vaccinated in state-run hubs on Sunday, while 71,491 tests were processed. Strong testing demand in the lead-up to Christmas is putting the state’s testing system under pressure, with long lines forming on Monday morning. At least 10 testing sites across Melbourne were temporarily shut at 9am after reaching capacity. They include Alfred Health’s walk-through clinic in the CBD and Aughtie Walk in Albert Park, Montague Street in South Melbourne, St Vincent’s hospital walk-through site in Fitzroy, La Trobe University’s Bundoora campus and Monash University at Clayton. A long queue was also seen outside the Bourke Street walk-in site, with people facing a wait of several hours to tested. Acting premier James Merlino said on Sunday that opening times at centres had been extended considering the number of people wanting to be tested as they prepared for leave or holiday travel during Christmas week. I know that there are particular sites where the wait is long but the average is 45 minutes to an hour or so ... I ask people to be patient. We’re expanding and extending it as much as we can. The state government has increased capacity by about 55% since October, with about 260 sites now in operation across Victoria. This means that NSW’s numbers are nearly double that of Victoria, a reversal of a weeks-long trend of more infections below the border. Sydney train commuters are facing major disruptions with another strike due to hit the network, reports AAP. The action will disrupt the Sydney Trains-operated network as Rail, Tram, and Bus Union members take action from 8pm Monday to 4am on Tuesday. Transport for NSW has warned train frequency will slow from 6pm and people could be left stranded. Buses will replace train services on all lines between 8pm and 4am but Sydney commuters are being encouraged to avoid travelling on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning. Intercity and regional services will also be affected, with some of the services suspended from 3.30pm on Monday before resuming at 5.30am on Tuesday. Transport for NSW says there will be flow-on effects throughout the week, as many services are nearly fully booked as people travel home for Christmas. NSW TrainLink chief executive Dale Merrick said in a statement: This is significant disruption that means many regional and rural customers will not be able to travel, have a dislocated journey on road coaches or will need to make other plan. The strike comes after industrial action last Tuesday when RTBU members refused to drive foreign-built trains used on about 75% of services. The union and Transport for NSW are at loggerheads as they negotiate a new enterprise agreement covering more than 10,000 staff. RTBU NSW secretary Alex Claassens has said the government is refusing to deliver on “basic hygiene, safety and privatisation commitments”. Transport for NSW said workers had been offered new enterprise agreements, including a 2.5% pay rise in the first year. The union wants a 3.5% wage rise. The Morrison government has been warned a coordinated interference campaign unleashed by foreign states or malicious actors through social media platforms is a serious risk to manage in the looming federal election campaign. With the federal contest now imminent, a Senate select committee established in late 2019 to investigate the risks posed to Australia’s democracy by foreign interference through social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and WeChat has used its first report to urge the Coalition to adopt better protocols before the poll. The new report concludes Australia currently lacks some of the institutional architecture needed to respond effectively and proactively to the threat of foreign interference. You can read the full report below: A freak weekend storm on Sydney’s northern beaches that killed a woman, ripped roofs off buildings and uprooted trees has left thousands of households without power, reports AAP. Described as a “mini-cyclone”, the storm tore across suburbs from Mona Vale to Forestville, causing a trail of destruction. A massive Norfolk pine tree hit powerlines, which fell on three women who were trying to take shelter at a car park at Ocean Street Narrabeen. A 68-year-old woman died at the scene, while two other women – aged 19 and 71 – were critically injured, police said. The two injured women were taken to Royal North Shore hospital, where they both remain in a serious but stable condition. The State Emergency Service responded to nearly 600 calls for help and volunteers are still on the ground with police and NSW Fire &amp; Rescue crews who are helping people clear debris and secure homes that have lost roofs. Adam Jones from the SES told ABC most calls were for leaking roofs and fallen trees that were blocking roads as well as downed powerlines and people who were stuck in lifts. We can’t promise that we’ll have everyone ready for Christmas but that is the goal of every member out there today ... Powerlines are incredibly dangerous. If they are down, stay away from them. Do not assume that they’re turned off because they’re on the ground. Try to stay 16-20 metres away from them. More than 35,000 homes lost power, with areas including North Turramurra, Frenchs Forest, Forestville and St Ives still affected. Ausgrid says employees were working around the clock to restore services. A freak storm has lashed Syndey’s Norther Beaches over the weekend, with many still without power and hundreds of hours of clean up work to go. I’ll bring you more updates on the situation there over the morning. From prisoners to the homeless and people living with disabilities – these are some of the at-risk communities hidden from public view during the pandemic. Now the health workers working with them share their stories. Covid was a little bit outside our realm because we were in a relatively protected environment. That whole barrier of being isolated was somewhat beneficial as long as the virus stayed out of there. There was always going to be an outbreak [though]; you can only build a net, it’s never a wall, and eventually something will get through there. Now they were in a closed community where people live together, many who aren’t vaccinated, so it didn’t take long for the virus to spread. Prison’s a little bit like a game of Jenga – not every bit of wood can go next to every bit of wood – so to move guys around takes a lot of logistics. It was really interesting trying to deliver care through a metal door which was locked. A flap would open up, a finger would come out and you’d do a set of observations, you’d do a temperature [check] and make sure they were OK at least once or two times a day. You can read the full report below: A man who was confined to his room at his Melbourne sharehouse and forced to go to the toilet in a bucket after being diagnosed with Covid has prompted calls for better awareness of support available for people isolating during the pandemic. Melbourne man Qas Ansari, 37, said he was worried he would pass Covid onto his three housemates, so they sealed off his room using plastic sheeting, building an airlock over his door, and for two days he used a bucket for a toilet and did not shower. “I understood why it needed to be done, the hardest bit was using a bucket, but if I kept using the bathroom and kitchen I would create more opportunities to get ill,” Ansari said. You can read the full report below: Kaldor says the national reopening plan needs to be able to react and adapt to the landscape of Covid-19 across the world as it changes: Every plan needs to be responsive to changes in circumstances, and what we’ve seen with Covid is that there are twists and turns that are unexpected. And when Omicron emerged, the first thing to figure out – as with any new variant – is first of all, how infectious and secondly, how much disease is caused and particularly how well are the vaccines working? And we’ve got the answer to the first one of those three, but we haven’t got the answer to the second and the third is yet. Kaldor has warned that Australia shouldn’t base too many of their decision on the extremely early studies that suggest Omicrom may cause a less severe form of the disease. So there have been reports from South Africa that strongly suggest it’s less severe than Delta. But we need to take that information cautiously in our contexts, for a couple of reasons. First, the information for it is largely from younger people who have traditionally had lower severe outcomes. But also it’s a population in South Africa that’s had a lot of exposure to circulating virus and maybe a lot of people whose immune systems are more primed than ours would be here. In a report by the Sydney Morning Herald, the director of the Doherty Institute, Prof Sharon Lewin, who advised on Morrison’s national plan to ease Australia into living with Covid-19, says we should pump the reopening brakes as concerns grow about the Omicron variant. She called for the return of mask-wearing indoors and stopping large gatherings at pubs and nightclubs. And she isn’t the only one. Prof John Kaldor, an epidemiologist at the Kirby Institute tells ABC radio that we just don’t know enough about Omicron just yet. This is a big unknown because we have very good information about how much protection we get from the vaccines against the previous variants, but we have very little information about how much protection we get against Omicron. There is evidence from overseas and from studies in the laboratory that there will be reduced efficacy, so particularly in the absence of a booster it may actually be a much more severe outcome in terms of its severity. Butler has been asked if Labor would be calling for booster shots to be moved forward to four or even three months, as a number of other countries have done, but he says they will be sticking with Atagi’s official advice. The opposition [will follow] the public health advice. Atagi has decided not to shorten it from five to four or even three months. Right now the government’s rollout isn’t even meeting the demand of a five-month eligibility ... let alone being able to meet the extra demand for a four-month or three months eligibility would provide. Now it’s time to talk about the booster shot program, and this morning Labor is coming out and attacking the government hard over this. The shadow health minister, Mark Butler, tells ABC radio that Australia is once again falling behind the rest of the developed world. The first six weeks so far we’ve done a little more than 1 million boosters. By the end of next week, we’d have to have delivered 4 million. 4 million people are supposed to receive their booster shots this month. There’s no way we’re going to achieve that under Scott Morrison’s program. Liberal party members will select a new candidate to run in former attorney general Christian Porter’s seat after he announced he wouldn’t contest the next election, reports AAP. The Perth-based seat of Pearce was held by Porter on a 7.5% margin at the last federal election in 2019 but is now considered a much tighter contest after a boundary redistribution. Labor has preselected City of Wanneroo mayor Tracey Roberts. Roberts’ council colleague Linda Aitken is touted as a potential Liberal candidate, as is former navy officer Miquela Riley. The election is due to be held by May. Porter has held the seat since 2013 and the seat has remained in Liberal hands since its inception in 1990. The former minister said he wouldn’t recontest the seat after being dumped from federal cabinet following him accepting legal fees from a blind trust. In a lengthy Facebook post, he said he wouldn’t be able to give the next three years his all after “experiencing the harshness of modern politics more than most”. Porter sued the ABC after it published a story about allegations an unnamed cabinet minister had raped a now-deceased woman in 1988. He strenuously denied the allegations after outing himself as the accused minister and has since settled a defamation case against the national broadcaster. But it was then revealed in September anonymous donors had paid for part of Porter’s legal fees. Porter denied any conflict of interest and said no banned donors contributed money to the fund, but nonetheless tendered his resignation from cabinet rather than publicly reveal the donors. The party members will make their selection on Monday. Good morning everyone, it’s a lovely Monday morning (as much as any Monday can be) and there is plenty of news to get through. It’s Matilda Bosley here and why don’t we jump into the day. Today after months of strict border restrictions the Northern Territory is opening up to the rest of the country – well, the rest of the vaccinated country at least. Travellers from all around Australia will now be able to travel anywhere in the territory as long as they avoid remote communities where less than 80% of the eligible population is vaccinated. Arrivals must also record three negative PCR tests, one before crossing the border and two in the days afterwards. In other news, the federal government has committed to spending another $78m to help Australia’s aviation sector recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has announced a “aviation recovery framework” which he says is aimed at rebuilding the workforce and upgrading regional infrastructure. This will involve a “strategic aviation advisory forum”, whose job it will be to brief the federal government and provide annual “health checks” about the state of the sector. The funding includes $4m to increase the number of women in the sector and $15m to upgrade remote aerodromes. Another $29m will be made available through the third round of a regional aviation infrastructure program. A $30m rebate program will help aviation operators upgrade aircraft safety. OK! With that out of the way, why don’t we jump right into the day!"

          "headline": "Residents in Northern Territory Indigenous community unable to buy food for four days after internet outage",
          "bodyText": "An internet outage left residents of a Top End remote community unable to buy food for four days, with critics arguing the situation was worsened by forced welfare income management policies. Maningrida, an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory home to about 3,000 people, suffered through an outage of 3G and 4G internet services from 11am Thursday until Monday afternoon. Speaking before the outage was finally fixed at 12.30pm on Monday, the mayor of West Arnhem regional council, Matthew Ryan, said the situation was dire. “There are food shortages, people are not able to access food from the retail shop,” he told Guardian Australia. “Some of them are closed due to the lack of internet access. The ATMs are closed. Ryan said some residents were going hungry or leaning on extended family for food. “Even fuel has been scarce,” he said. Telstra said the problem was fixed at 12.30pm on Monday and apologised to local residents. Before then, critics argued the situation for some Maningrida residents was further complicated by the basics card, and its successor, the cashless debit card, which are both forms of forced income management. Under the basics card program, which has been in place in the NT since the Intervention in 2007, a proportion of person’s welfare payments is placed on a debit card that does not allow cash withdrawals and cannot be used to buy prohibited items. While Eftpos machines were down during the outage, some of the town’s ATMs have been operational at times. Maningrida resident Olga told ABC Radio Darwin the ATMs were drained “pretty much on the first or second day”. “A lot of the money is tied up in basics cards,” she said. “That means that income management system has totally failed people here with regards being able to purchase food. That’s since 11am on Thursday.” Olga said the council had organised “cook ups” most nights and encouraged people to bring containers so they could take food home. “That’s how desperate it is,” she said. The Northern Territory Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy said it was unacceptable that families were going hungry. “This wouldn’t be accepted in Melbourne or Sydney, it should not be accepted in Maningrida,” she said. McCarthy said the “latest internet outage in Maningrida is just another example of how dysfunctional and punitive compulsory income management is”. “Families who have no choice but to go on the basics card or cashless debit card by the Morrison government cannot even access their own money,” she said. The government argues the cashless debit card reduces social harm. Labor has promised to scrap the card, which operates in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, and with the basics card in the NT. It has not announced its plans for the basics card. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ryan said he had written to the federal Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt in October complaining about the continual outages in the area but had not received a response. He drew attention to the impact of outages on cashless debit cardholders. “It’s a big human rights issue in our community,” Ryan said. Nic Danks, the regional general manager for Telstra in the NT, said there was an “intermittent issue impacting services in the community since 16 December”. He said landline services and NBN internet services were not impacted. “The cause was found to be a hardware issue at the local telephone exchange that was impacting the transmission network,” he said. “Telstra apologises for any inconvenience caused to local residents during this time and will continue to monitor the site over coming days to make sure it continues to operate effectively.” Danks said Eftpos machines could also connect via fixed line or wifi and the telco encouraged “stores across the NT to have a backup connectivity option”. Hank Jongen, a spokesman for Services Australia, which manages the basics card, said the agency worked with “communities, stores and service providers during outages of any length to provide support”. “Grocery stores can accept the purchase of essential items by local residents and then transactions are processed once the outage is resolved,” he said."

          "bodyText": "Today’s Covid blog will be shutting down but please join us here for all the latest coronavirus developments. UK ministers continue to debate whether measures should be introduced before or after Christmas in order to curb the spread of Omicron. British prime minister Boris Johnson is mulling urging the public to limit household mixing at Christmas, the Telegraph reports. Johnson has been presented with three options by officials for further restrictions to curb the spread of Omicron, out of which the lowest level of action would see families asked to limit indoor contacts, without legal enforcement, the report said. The prime minister is also weighing mandate curbs on household mixing, the return of social distancing and an 8pm curfew on pubs and restaurants, it added. Option three is a full lockdown. Britain’s finance minister Rishi Sunak is one of 10 cabinet ministers who are resisting the introduction of new restrictions before Christmas to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, the Times reports. The UK government’s chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance told ministers over the weekend that new restrictions should be introduced as soon as possible to stop the NHS being overwhelmed, the newspaper said. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, yesterday refused to rule out a “circuit breaker” that would ban household mixing and said the government might need to act before the data was clear. “If we wait until the data is perfect, it may be too late,” he said. It’s Samantha Lock here taking over from my colleague Jem Bartholomew. As I’m reporting to you from Sydney, here are some Covid numbers out of Australia. There were 1,302 new coronavirus cases recorded in Victoria with no deaths. NSW recorded 2,501 new local Covid-19 cases. The numbers are nearly double that of Victoria, a reversal of a weeks-long trend of more infections below the border. Today after months of strict border restrictions the Northern Territory is opening up to the rest of the country. Travellers from all around Australia will now be able to travel anywhere in the territory as long as they avoid remote communities where less than 80% of the eligible population is vaccinated. Arrivals must also record three negative PCR tests, one before crossing the border and two in the days afterwards. In other news, the federal government has committed to spending another $78m to help Australia’s aviation sector recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Here’s a round-up of Sunday’s developments from around the world on Covid and Omicron. The Netherlands entered a strict lockdown that meant the closure of non-essential stores, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places until 14 January to push back the new wave. Germany followed France and tightened restrictions from Britain, mandating a 14-day quarantine for incoming travellers to avoid an Omicron wave. Pressure builds on UK prime minister Boris Johnson after the Guardian published a picture of him with wine and cheese in the No 10 garden, suggesting a social event, during a strict UK lockdown. No 10 insists the meeting was for work. Poland confirmed seven Omicron cases in total as an official warned the variant is spreading at “unprecedented rate”. A further 15,976 Covid cases were recorded. Peru, the country with the highest Covid deaths per capita and sixth-highest total death toll, detected its first four Omicron cases. The UK recorded above 80,000 new daily cases for only fourth time since pandemic began, and clocked another 12,000 Omicron cases – taking the tally to over 37,000. Health secretary Sajid Javid refused to rule out new restrictions on the Sunday broadcast round. Cases are up 72% in one week. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, said the Omicron variant has “extraordinary spreading capabilities” and is “raging through the world”. Ireland said Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid after an estimated 52% of its cases – 5,124 new cases on Sunday – were from the highly mutated variant. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency warned of political violence from the country’s anti-vaccine movement with its connections to the far-right. Iran detected its first case of Omicron. Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said on Sunday the country is in a fifth Covid wave and urged people to step up vaccinations. US Senator Elizabeth Warren tested positive for Covid after a routine test. She has mild symptoms. 30,000 people in Vienna, Austria commemorated the country’s 13,000 people who have died from the virus with a “sea of lights” march. Italy detected 24,259 new Covid infections, a 62% climb on the 15,010 new cases on Sunday two weeks ago. Sri Lanka will require Covid vaccine certificates for entry to public places from New Year’s Day. Russia recorded 27,967 new Covid infections, a 13% slide on the 32,031 new cases on Sunday two weeks ago. France reported 48,473 new Covid infections, a 15% climb on the 42,252 new cases detected on Sunday two weeks ago. Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa asked for greater law enforcement protection on Sunday after a flurry of threats following its decision to approve Covid vaccines for children aged five to 11. President Jair Bolsonaro, who has played down the virus’s risks, has publicly pressured the agency over the decision. That’s all from me, Jem Bartholomew in London, and I’ll be back on Wednesday. Do get in touch via email or on Twitter with tips and stories for then. I’m particularly interested in hearing from clinically vulnerable people in the UK about their experiences during the Omicron wave, so far without government support. Now, over to my colleague Samantha Lock in Australia. On Sunday a chain of 13,000 candles stretched out along the baroque streets of Vienna, Austria. Then, 30,000 people went silent. Tens of thousands of people in Vienna on Sunday took part in a “sea of lights” commemoration for the people who have died during the pandemic. They observed a moment of silence in a demonstration intended to show solidarity with healthcare workers after weeks of anti-lockdown protests. “We are simply people from civil society who want to send a signal,” organiser Daniel Landau told newspaper Kurier. Austria has recorded 13,000 deaths from Covid-related illness. Another 24 people were added to the country’s toll on Saturday. Austria experienced rising Covid cases in late November, with daily infections often above 15,000. They have since declined, with 2,167 people on Saturday receiving confirmation they’d been infected. “Thousands of people gathered in Vienna this evening to commemorate all those who were torn from their lives by the virus with a #Lichtermeer &amp; thank our health workers,” said chancellor Karl Nehammer on Twitter. US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she’s tested positive for Covid and is experiencing mild symptoms. Warren, the 72-year-old Democrat for Massachusetts, said she is vaccinated and boosted. The Senator, who ran to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2020, said: “I urge everyone who has not already done so to get the vaccine and the booster as soon as possible – together, we can save lives.” The New York Times has this sobering report on the scale of the global challenge to tackle the new mutated variant: Most of the World’s Vaccines Likely Won’t Prevent Infection From Omicron. Severe disease can still be prevented, which is good news. But the costs of infection mean not just strain on health systems around the world, the Times’s Stephanie Nolen reports, but could lead to further variant escapes. For instance, global vaccine program Covax has delivered 67 million Oxford-AstraZeneca doses, much of it across sub-Saharan Africa, and 90% of people in India got the AstraZeneca shot. One study showed it had no ability to stop infection after six months. All vaccines still seem to provide a significant degree of protection against serious illness from Omicron, which is the most crucial goal. But only the Pfizer and Moderna shots, when reinforced by a booster, appear to have initial success at stopping infections, and these vaccines are unavailable in most of the world. The other shots — including those from AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson and vaccines manufactured in China and Russia — do little to nothing to stop the spread of Omicron, early research shows. And because most countries have built their inoculation programs around these vaccines, the gap could have a profound impact on the course of the pandemic. A global surge of infections in a world where billions of people remain unvaccinated not only threatens the health of vulnerable individuals but also increases the opportunity for the emergence of yet more variants. The disparity in the ability of countries to weather the pandemic will almost certainly deepen. And the news about limited vaccine efficacy against Omicron infection could depress demand for vaccination throughout the developing world, where many people are already hesitant or preoccupied with other health problems. Read the full story here. Peru detected its first four cases of the Omicron variant on Sunday, a health ministry official said. Minister of health Hernando Cevallos told reporters that four cases of the variant had been detected. “One is a traveller arriving from South Africa to our country, while three of them have been detected within Peru and we are taking the necessary measures to follow up and carry out contact tracing,” he said. Peru reported 3,559 new infections on Saturday, alongside 78 new deaths. The Omicron news raises concerns as the highly-mutated variant reaches a nation already ravaged by the pandemic. Peru has recorded 202,000 deaths from Covid-related causes, the world’s sixth-highest tally, and is the country with the worst per capita death toll. Adding to our post on the impact of the Netherlands’ snap new lockdown (10.39am GMT), The Guardian has a report on the impact on Dutch shopkeepers, who say they have been “broken” by the measures amid the busy Christmas shopping period. As of Sunday, all non-essential stores, bars and restaurants in the country are closed until at least 14 January, and schools and universities shut until 9 January. Retailers that weathered the first rounds of lockdown say they are crushed without a compensation scheme for the new restrictions. “Nowhere in Europe is there such a strict regime as in the Netherlands,” said Jan Meerman, the director of INretail, the Dutch retailers association. He added: “From a health perspective, I understand that something needs to be done, but then it is important that the cabinet also makes a grand financial gesture and generously reimburses entrepreneurs. As far as we are concerned, 100% compensation. Many colleagues are still heavily indebted from the first lockdowns, they can’t take this any more … They are broken by these harsh measures.” Full report available here. Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said on Sunday the country is in a fifth Covid wave and urged people to step up vaccinations. In a televised address, Bennett said he expected a surge of sickness within weeks, despite the strict travel measures Israel took in recent weeks to keep out the Omicron variant. He told citizens to take precautions such as working from home. Israel has detected 134 confirmed Omicron cases and another 307 suspected cases. 167 are symptomatic. “The time we bought [with travel bans] is running out,” Bennett said. “The numbers are still not high but it’s a very contagious variant, doubling itself every two-three days, as we see around the world. It’s possible to say that the fifth wave has begun.” Meanwhile, a health ministry advisory committee recommended Israel add the US to its red-list countries, where citizens cannot fly without special permission. Israel banned the entry of foreigners on 25 November and has imposed three to 14-day quarantine orders for Israelis returning from abroad. Israel reported 696 infections on Saturday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The country experienced rising cases last September, recording upwards of 7,000 cases a day, before new infections dropped to the hundreds in October. The health regulator in Brazil, Anvisa, asked for greater law enforcement protection on Sunday after a flurry of threats following its decision to approve Covid vaccines for children aged five to 11. The right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, is putting pressure on Anvisa over the decision, and has repeatedly sowed doubts about the dangers of the virus and the value of getting vaccinated, saying he is not vaccinated himself. After Anvisa’s decision to approve vaccination for children this week, on Thursday Bolsonaro said he’d asked for the names of the officials involved and threatened to make their identities public. It continues a months-long political storm between Anvisa and Bolsonaro over the agency’s ability to approve vaccine shots. The regulator said threats had jumped in the past 24 hours, and it was giving details to law enforcement agencies. “Anvisa is firm in its mission to protect the health of citizens,” it said. In October Brazil’s Senate accused Bolsonaro of crimes against humanity for his handling of the pandemic, during which more than 617,000 people died from Covid-related causes, the second-highest death toll in the world behind the US. Bolsonaro’s popularity has dropped this year. France reported 48,473 new Covid infections on Sunday, a 15% climb on the 42,252 new cases detected on Sunday two weeks ago. A further 75 people died from the virus, down from 162 on Friday. (Reported figures tend to be lower at weekends.) Over 121,000 people in France have died from Covid-related causes, the 12th highest global total. France restricted travel to and from Britain on Thursday in an attempt to block entry of the Omicron variant, a move followed by Germany tightening its restrictions on travel from Britain on Sunday. The prime minister, Jean Castex, asked mayors on Friday to cancel New Year’s Eve firework displays and festivities as cases rose. He urged people to get tested before Christmas celebrations. Paris town hall cancelled one of its public parties on Saturday. Castex also announced France will change its health pass into a vaccination pass, meaning from January it can only be used by double-vaccinated people. FRANCE 24 has been reporting on the impact of cancelled plans: Jonathan Clark, chaplain at Saint Michel’s Church in Paris, said: “We’ve had to cancel our social events and they’re important to people, particularly the lonely, so it’s really hard.” By now safety protocols have become a habit. “We wear masks the whole time. We distance, we separate groups of people, we halve the number of people at a service, and we have to ventilate so we keep doors open.” “The services are running as normal, because for some people, it’s the only social contact they’re going to get to come to church and see some people,” Clark said. “And we can sing behind masks. Last year we couldn’t sing – that was much harder.” Pressure continues to build on Boris Johnson after the Guardian revealed an image of him in the garden of Downing Street, the UK prime minister’s official residence, with cheese and wine on 15 May 2020, suggesting a social event when the country was in a hard lockdown. No 10’s insistence the event constituted a “work meeting” has been called into question by the presence of wine and cheese and 19 people in groups. Bottles of wine are in evidence, there is a lack of social distancing and 19 people are gathered in groups across the Downing Street terrace and lawn. At the time social mixing between households was limited to two people, who could only meet outdoors and at a distance of at least 2 metres. In workplaces, guidance said in-person meetings should only take place if “absolutely necessary”. Angela Rayner, the deputy leader of the Labour party, described the picture as “a slap in the face of the British public”, adding: “The prime minister consistently shows us he has no regard for the rules he puts in place for the rest of us. Alleged drinking and partying late into the evening [at No 10] when the rest of us were only recently getting one daily walk.” The prime minister has faced a string of allegations of partying and socialising in No 10 while Covid restrictions were in place. He was forced to order a civil service inquiry, though its head stepped down on Friday over allegations of his own Christmas party. A Downing Street spokesperson said people drinking at work was not against regulations at the time. “Downing Street is the prime minister’s home as well as his workplace. The prime minister’s wife lives in No 10 and therefore also legitimately uses the garden,” they said. Read the full story here. Poland has detected a total of seven Omicron cases, the deputy health minister, Waldemar Kraska, said on Sunday, jumping from one case on Thursday. The Omicron mutation is “highly contagious” and it “is spreading at an unprecedented rate”, Kraska said, according to Polskie Radio. The infections include a seven-year-old girl from Gdańsk, who was tested on 10 December and confirmed with Omicron on Sunday, after sequencing, and a three-year-old girl from Warsaw. Poland only sequenced its first Omicron case on Thursday, when a 30-year-old woman who had recently traveled from southern Africa was confirmed to have the highly mutated variant. In response, ministers introduced new measures this week. Nightclubs are closed until further notice, and other entertainment and leisure centres are at a maximum capacity of 100 people until 31 January. Poland recorded 15,976 new cases on Sunday, a 29% decrease on the 22,394 new cases recorded on Sunday two weeks ago. Poland experienced rising cases in late November and early December and saw a gradual decline in recent weeks. It’s unclear whether cases will climb again amid Omicron’s spread or the recent wave will provide a barrier of antibodies in recently recovered people. A further 70 people died with the virus in the past 24 hours, down from 566 on Friday. (Reported figures tend to be lower at weekends.) Russia recorded 27,967 new Covid infections in the past 24 hours, a 13% slide on the 32,031 new cases two weeks ago on Sunday. After daily cases jumped in early November, Russia is on a downward trajectory with its epidemic. But daily deaths remain high. A further 1,024 people died from Covid-related causes on Sunday, with deaths largely above 1,000 a day since late October. It’s unclear whether Omicron will send cases skywards again. After researchers at the University of Washington and Swiss pharmaceutical firm Humabs Biomed found the Russian Sputnik V vaccine provided “no neutralizing activity against Omicron” this week, Russia rejected the findings. Sputnik has not been approved by the World Health Organization. Italy detected 24,259 new Covid infections on Sunday, a 62% climb on the 15,010 new cases on Sunday two weeks ago. A further 97 people died from Covid-related causes in the past 24 hours, a 126% rise from 43 two weeks ago. (Reported figures tend to be lower at weekends.) As of 16 December, arrivals from other European Union countries must take a negative Covid test before entering Italy, in a move ministers hoped would block the Omicron strain circulating. But Omicron is spreading quickly in Italy already, the national health institute said on Saturday, with cases rising in the north and south of the country. Germany’s health minister ruled out a Christmas lockdown but said mandatory vaccination was the only way to stop the pandemic. “There will not be a lockdown before Christmas here. But we will get a fifth wave – we have crossed a critical number of Omicron infections,” Karl Lauterbach told broadcaster ARD. “This wave can no longer be completely stopped.” Germany banned unvaccinated people from entering non-essential places at the start of December amid rising cases. About 70% of the population is double-vaccinated. “I believe we can defeat this if we close the gaps in vaccination with mandatory vaccines. That is my clear conviction,” Lauterbach said. Germany reported 55,603 new Covid infections on Saturday, jumping 142% from 22,945 cases on Sunday two weeks ago. A further 426 people died with the virus on Saturday, up from 81 two weeks ago. (Reported figures can be lower at weekends.) Germany is also tightening restrictions on travel from Britain, which has detected a total 37,000 Omicron cases, which will require travelers from 11pm GMT on Sunday to quarantine for a mandatory 14 days, even the double-vaccinated. Here are those latest UK case numbers in context throughout the pandemic. This has been a record-breaking week with Omicron pushing daily figures above the record three days in a row. This is the barometer scientists and ministers will be looking at very closely over the next week: the speed at which hospitalisations jump, and whether it’s in line with new cases. If admissions tick up significantly it may be difficult for policymakers to ignore implementing further restrictions, which UK health secretary Sajid Javid did not rule out on Sky News today. This is Jem Bartholomew in London for the next eight hours covering the international Covid blog. Do get in touch with stories or tips from around the world. Email me here. Message me on Twitter here. The UK detected 82,886 new Covid cases on Sunday, a 72% jump on the 48,071 new infections recorded last Sunday. A further 45 people died from Covid-related reasons, down from 111 on Friday. Sunday’s figures are slightly lower than recent record-breaking daily case rates – it was above 90,000 on Thursday. Reported figures tend to be lower at weekends. It comes after the UK reported 12,133 new cases of the highly transmissable Omicron variant, taking the total tally to 37,101. (The majority of cases are not sequenced.) • Britain’s health secretary, Sajid Javid, has made clear that tougher Covid restrictions could be imposed in England before Christmas, after the government’s Sage committee warned that hospitalisations could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless action is taken. Javid acknowledged that data about the Omicron variant remained incomplete – but suggested it might be necessary to make decisions before a full picture is available. • Shops in the Netherlands were closed and people’s Christmas plans were in disarray as the country began a lockdown on Sunday aimed at limiting an expected Covid-19 surge caused by the rise of the Omicron variant. Thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in central Brussels on Sunday for a third time against reinforced Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Belgian government to counter a spike in infections and the emergence of the worrying omicron variant. • Ministers in Britain have been accused of failing to protect the most vulnerable people from rising Covid cases after it emerged that people with blood cancer now account for a higher proportion of coronavirus deaths than earlier in the pandemic. With daily case numbers at record highs as a result of the Omicron variant, charities warn that people with suppressed immune systems who had been helped to shield at the start of the pandemic felt obliged to put themselves at risk at work, were confused about how to access treatments and less likely to have protection from vaccines. • Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid-19 in the Republic of Ireland, according to authorities, who said that recent measures had slowed down the spread somewhat. The deputy first minister of Northern Ireland’s power sharing executive, Michelle O’Neill, has warned that Omicron will hit the community there “like a ton of bricks” • Iran has detected its first case of infection by the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, state TV has reported. The United Arab Emirates has moved to limit entry to government institutions to people who have been vaccinated. • The easily transmissible Omicron variant is “raging through the world, ”the US infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, has warned. He also cautioned that travelling will increase the risk of infection, even among vaccinated people, in an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press. Concerns about a new impact on mental health are being expressed in the Netherlands, which has become the first European state to implement a nationwide lockdown. “Because people have no view or feel control, they experience a ‘learned helplessness,’” the Dutch news channel, NOS, was told by Andrea Evers, a professor of health psychology at Leiden University. She saw the announcement of the latest Dutch lockdown as a missed opportunity on the part of Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, to provide more perspective about future plans that might help people to make sense of the situation. Unlike other lockdowns in the past, this one differed in that Covid-19 looked set to remain for the time being and there was not the same optimism around the arrival of vaccines. Saturday’s announcement of the lockdown, which starts today, came as a shock to many Dutch people as they headed into the Christmas and New Year period. Many people rushed out on Saturday to stock up on presents and food and to get a last-minute haircut. Entry to all government-run institutions in the United Arab Emirates will be restricted to people who have been vaccinated, according to the state news agency. Sri Lanka will require the showing of a Covid-19 vaccination certificate compulsory for entry to public places starting from New Year’s Day, in a renewed attempt to prevent another spike in infections. Tourism minister Prasanna Ranatunga made the announcement on Sunday in an abrupt switch from the gradual ending of restrictions put into place after the country was confronted with a third wave of infections in April caused by the Delta variant. Ranatunga said health officials were drawing up arrangements on implementing the decisions, the Associated Press news agency reported. Covid-19 related staff absences will affect all sectors in the UK including the health services, education, police, transport and key national infrastructure unless transmission is not reduced, a leading public health expert has warned. Sir Jeremy Farrar, who resigned in November from a national advisory body in disagreement with the government’s approach, said on Twitter today that Covid-19 and the highly infectious new Omicron variant was not just health issue but also an “economic, education, national infrastructure issue even a security issue.” Like other healthcare experts and practitioners, Farrar has been picking up on a report on Saturday in the Health Service Journal (HSJ) that the number of National Health Service (NHS) staff in London absent due to covid has more than doubled in four days. One in three of the workforce would be absent by New Year’s Eve if the growth rate continues, it added. The UK reported more than 12,000 further confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in the latest daily figures provided by health authorities on Sunday. The UK Health Security Agency said on Twitter there had been an additional 12,133 confirmed cases of Omicron over the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 37,101. The first case of Omicron was announced on 24 November by South Africa, with the first positive sample dating back to 9 November. Since then it has been found in multiple countries around the world, including the UK, where the first cases were reported on 27 November in two people in England with links to travel to southern Africa. But the first known case is not the same as the first infection. Echoeing the views of other experts, Prof Oliver Pybus, the co-director of the Oxford Martin school’s programme on pandemic genomics, said that, in his reading, Omicron has likely been circulating for at least a month. Thousands of peaceful protesters demonstrated in central Brussels on Sunday for a third time against reinforced Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Belgian government to counter a spike infections and the emergence of the worrying omicron variant. A strong police presence was deployed on the streets in anticipation of the crowds, given how previous protests had sometimes descended into violence, arrest and injury. The marchers – some with placards reading “free zone”, “I’ve had my fair dose” and “enough is enough” – came to protest against the government’s strong advice to get vaccinated, and included Belgian healthcare workers who will have a three-month window in which to get vaccinated against coronavirus from 1 January or risk losing their jobs. On Sunday, the Brussels-based European Commission agreed with Pfizer-BioNTech to accelerate the delivery of vaccines starting in a few weeks. The pharmaceutical giant will deliver an additional 20m doses from January to March to European Union member states. The Belgian protest comes one day after similar protests in other European capitals, including Paris and London. A Brussels demonstration last month spiralled into violence as several hundred people started pelting police, smashing cars and setting garbage bins ablaze. Police responded with teargas and water cannon. Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid-19 in the Republic of Ireland, according to authorities, who said that recent measures had slowed down the spread somewhat. As Ireland’s Department of Health confirmed that there had been 5,124 new cases of Covid-19, it said that it an estimated 52% of reported cases are as a result of the Omicron variant. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan told RTE News: “It has taken less than two weeks for Omicron to become the dominant strain of Covid-19 in Ireland, revealing just how transmissible this variant is. The deputy first minister of Northern Ireland’s power sharing executive, Michelle O’Neill, has warned that Omicron will hit the community there “like a ton of bricks”. She said that modelling presented to her and other officials suggested that, in a worst-case scenario, it could be facing 30,000 Omicron cases a day. Americans have been urged to get their booster shots and continue to wear masks by the US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci. Fauci said on Sunday that the easily transmissible Omicron variant is “raging through the world”. According to Reuters, he also cautioned that travelling will increase the risk of infection, even among vaccinated people, in an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press. Omicron will hit Northern Ireland “like a ton of bricks”, the deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill has warned. PA Media reports that O’Neill said modelling presented to Stormont ministers suggests that in a worst-case scenario, the region could be facing 30,000 cases a day. Executive ministers are involved in discussions about the situation ahead of a formal meeting on Wednesday, when it is expected new restrictions to be applied after Christmas will be announced. O’Neill told the BBC Sunday Politics programme that ministers will act before then if it is deemed necessary. She said: “In terms of what we know, we know that this is going to hit us like a ton of bricks. “We know that by the end of the year this will be the dominant strain of Covid, we know that we will peak in the middle of January, we know it is going to spread rapidly. “What we don’t yet know is the impact in terms of our hospital situation, and we expect to understand that a bit more tomorrow and that is when we will engage again. “Then we decide when to intervene and what is the appropriate intervention.” In England, the NHS was given a target to administer 1m vaccine shots a day to beat Omicron. And on Saturday they were getting pretty close, as our political editor Heather Stewart tweets: Queues to get booster shots were long again on Sunday, with people lining up to get their jabs at the Wembley Stadium vaccination site: New York state has reported that nearly 22,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday – eclipsing Thursday for the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. Amid fears over the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, more than half of the positive results were in the city. The Rockettes on Friday cancelled remaining performances of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic”. Saturday Night Live taped without an audience and with reduced crew. Lines at some testing sites stretched around the block and at-home tests remained hard to find or pricier than usual. But new hospitalisations and deaths are averaging well below their spring 2020 peak and even where they were this time last year, during a winter wave that came as vaccinations were just beginning, city data shows. The Kremlin is convinced that the World Health Organization (WHO) will recognise Russia’s flagship Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine within a few months, the Interfax news agency cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying on Sunday. The Kremlin on Tuesday said Russia had still not handed over all the information needed for the vaccine to be approved by the WHO because of differences in regulatory standards. The British government’s health minister, Sajid Javid, has made clear that tougher Covid restrictions could be imposed in England before Christmas, after the government’s Sage committee warned that hospitalisations could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day unless action is taken. Javid acknowledged that data about the Omicron variant remained incomplete – but suggested it might be necessary to make decisions before a full picture is available. Asked to rule out new measures pre-Christmas, he said: “We are assessing the situation; it’s very fast-moving,” adding, “There’s a lot of uncertainty, there are gaps in the data, but we must work with the data we’ve got, we mustn’t let perfection be the enemy of the good.” Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Javid stressed that it was already clear that Omicrom spread very quickly, adding that there were likely to be many more cases than official data is showing. In minutes published this weekend, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) urged the government to reintroduce “more stringent measures … very soon”, warning that cases were set to reach between 600,000 and 2 million a day by the end of the month if action was not taken immediately. Israel’s prime minister has warned citizens against the spread of the new, highly infectious variant of coronavirus on Sunday and urged them to vaccinate. Naftali Bennett told ministers that there was already community transmission of the omicron variant in Israel and a rise in the country’s coronavirus infection rate. He called the omicron variant “very infectious”. “It must be understood that the collective and national protection that the state provides is not enough,” Bennett said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. He urged Israelis that “every citizen must see to themselves, their family, and their children. Don’t rely on the neighbours to vaccinate themselves and their child. It won’t help much.” Israel rolled out a world-leading vaccination campaign, and more than 4.1 million of Israel’s 9.3 million people have received a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The country’s health ministry has reported at least 134 confirmed cases of the omicron variant since its emergence in late November. French education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer has said on BFM television that the government has no plans to extend the Christmas school holidays because of the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Some European countries have brought Christmas holidays forward, and French conservative presidential candidate Valérie Pecresse has called for an extension of them in order to help ensure any infections caught over year-end holidays are discovered before children return to school. Piers Corbyn, a leading Covid-19 denier, has been arrested on suspicion of encouraging people to burn down MPs’ offices. The Metropolitan police said a man in his 70s – whom it did not name – was arrested in Southwark, south London, in the early hours of Sunday. “The arrest relates to a video posted online in which people were encouraged to burn down MPs’ offices,” the force said. Earlier, the Met said it was assessing a video that appears to show Corbyn, 74, calling for MPs’ offices to be burned down. The video, shared on social media, shows Corbyn, a prominent anti-lockdown protester and brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, criticising politicians who voted for Covid restrictions. After urging the crowd to “hammer to death those scum who have decided to go ahead with introducing new fascism”, Corbyn appears to tell a crowd in the video: “You’ve got to get a list of them … and if your MP is one of them, go to their offices and, well, I would recommend burning them down, OK. But I can’t say that on air. I hope we’re not on air.” Spain’s prime minister has called on the country to keep its guard up as the Omicron variant spreads and as the number of cases per 100,000 people in Spain rose to 511, writes the Guardian’s Sam Jones in Madrid. “Although the incidence is still lower than in neighbouring countries, it isn’t good because it’s a clear and real warning of the threat to the health of our fellow Spaniards and as such, it must compel us to intensify our actions as the virus grows,” Pedro Sánchez said in a televised address on Sunday morning. The prime minister said Spain’s regional presidents would attend an online emergency meeting on Wednesday afternoon to discuss next steps. “The virus is still among us and fighting it must continue to be a priority for all the authorities,” said Sánchez. “But I would urge people to remain calm and confident. We have come through the most painful part of this together and we will come through this by protecting the health and lives of our fellow citizens.” However, he said that the situation appeared far better than a year ago: “It’s worth pointing out that the characteristics of this new wave are different. Although the infection numbers are higher, our hospitalisation and ICU admission figures are lower than last year. The first conclusion that should be drawn is that the vaccines work.” To date, 89.7% of those aged over 12 in Spain have received two doses of the vaccine, and the rollout to children under 12 began earlier this week. Shops in the Netherlands were closed and people’s Christmas plans were in disarray as the country began a lockdown on Sunday aimed at limiting an expected Covid-19 surge caused by the rise of the Omicron variant. Prime minister Mark Rutte announced the sudden shutdown on Saturday evening, ordering the closure of all but the most essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places from Sunday until at least 14 January. The news came as a shock to many Dutch people as they headed into the Christmas and New Year period, Reuters reports. Many people rushed out on Saturday to stock up on presents and food and to get a last-minute haircut. Hospitality workers demanded compensation for lost income in the holiday season, while gym owners stressed the importance of exercise during a health crisis. “Closing all bars and restaurants in such an important month is incredibly painful and dramatic. We need compensation and an exit strategy”, the Dutch association for hospitality services said. All schools will close a week early for the Christmas break on Monday and will remain shut until at least 9 January, while households are recommended to receive no more than two visitors and gatherings outside are also limited to a maximum of two. Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have dropped from record levels in recent weeks after a night-time lockdown was put in place late last month. But cases involving the Omicron variant have increased rapidly since the beginning of December and the strain is expected to become dominant before the end of the year. This will pose a big problem for hospitals, which have been cancelling regular care for weeks as they try to avoid running out of beds due to the high numbers of Covid patients on their wards. Mass lateral flow testing cut the number of people needing hospital treatment for Covid by 32% and relieved significant pressure on the NHS when the measures were piloted last year, a study in north-west England has shown. Liverpool conducted the first city-wide testing scheme using rapid antigen tests in November last year, amid debate about whether or not lateral flow tests (LFTs) were accurate enough to detect the virus in asymptomatic carriers. It expanded the project to cover the whole of the Liverpool region, offering people LFTs whether or not they had symptoms. Key workers did daily tests before going to work to show they were not infectious. Fresh analysis has shown that it was more successful than Liverpool’s scientists and public health teams had anticipated, after they compared Covid cases and outcomes in the region with other parts of England. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has been talking about the potential for serious acts of political violence coming from the country’s anti-vaccine movement, in which organised far right activists are increasingly involved in some regions. Thomas Haldenwang, the president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, said in an interview with journalists from the Funke media group: “It is true that there is a difference between talking about violence and committing it,” But he cited the case of a 49-year-old German citizen who was arrested in September on suspicion of shooting dead a petrol station worker who refused to serve him while he was not wearing a mask. Asked about possible murder plots in future, he replied: “With violence-oriented rightwing extremists and in the radicalised corona protest milieu, no scenario can be ruled out.” Most of the parties he had planned to go to have been cancelled or scaled back and he wont’t be having the same number of hugs with his elderly mother, Britain’s health minister has told the BBC. “It’s time to be more cautious. We know this thing is spreading rapidly,” Sajid Javid told broadcaster Andrew Marr. He was not ruling out a new “circuit breaker” increase in restrictions coming in even before Christmas. “There are no guarantees in this pandemic. At this point, we just have to keep everything under review.” Iran has detected its first case of infection by the new omicron variant of the coronavirus, state TV reported on Sunday. The announcement comes as the variant spreads around the globe less than a month after scientists alerted the World Health Organization to the concerning-looking version. Iran has vaccinated 60% of its population of roughly 85 million people with two doses of coronavirus vaccines. The coronavirus has killed more than 131,000 people in Iran, the worst fatality rate in the Middle East. On 24 August alone, 709 people died of the illness. The number of deaths has decreased in recent months due to the vaccination, experts say. Iran accelerated vaccinations in recent weeks. More than 50 million Iranians have received their second shots, and 3.5 million have received a third jab. New restrictions in England that would governing social distancing and household mixing are “inevitable”, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said. “If we don’t bring in restrictions sooner rather than later you are going to see even more positive cases and potentially public services like the NHS (National Health Service) on the verge of collapsing if not collapsing,” he said in an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. The UK health minister, Savid Javid, also came under pressure on Sky News to say whether the government would implement stronger restrictions, in line with what experts have been recommending. Parliament would be recalled if this was necessary, he said. “We have shown in the past that we will do what is necessary, but it has got to be backed up by the data,” he added, though he insisted that the UK was in a “different place” in terms of the defences that vaccines and new treatments could provide. He also faced questions about whether the public would follow any new rules – particularly in England – given recent allegations about the apparent flouting of pandemic restrictions during 2020 by staff at Downing Street, other departments and in the governing Conservative party. “I believe the British people will respond in the same way as they have done throughout this pandemic, where if they understand the issues, know just how important it is for their families, they will respond accordingly,” said Javid. Britain’s health minister, Sajid Javid, has said unvaccinated people are “taking up hospital beds” that could be used for someone else. Speaking on Sky News, Javid said 10% of the population – more than 5 million people – still had not received their jabs, and about nine out of 10 of those needing the most care in hospital were unvaccinated. He added: “I just cannot emphasise enough the impact that they are having on the rest of society.” “They must really think about the damage they are doing to society by … they take up hospital beds that could have been used for someone with maybe a heart problem, or maybe someone who is waiting for elective surgery.” “But instead of protecting themselves and protecting the community they choose not to get vaccinated. They are really having a damaging impact and I just can’t stress enough, please do come forward and get vaccinated.” UK government ministers have been accused of failing to protect the most vulnerable people from rising Covid cases after it emerged in England and Wales that people with blood cancer account for a higher proportion of coronavirus deaths than earlier in the pandemic. With daily case numbers at record highs as a result of the Omicron variant, charities warn that people with suppressed immune systems who had been helped to shield at the start of the pandemic felt obliged to put themselves at risk at work, were confused about how to access treatments and less likely to have protection from vaccines. More than 3,000 people with blood cancer – just over one in 100 of all those who have the disease in England and Wales – have died of Covid, according to analysis of official data by Blood Cancer UK. This is despite these patients having spent long periods shielding to avoid contact with the virus. Large swathes of England, including several major cities, have no vaccination walk-in centres, it has emerged, sparking fears the government will miss its target of offering all adults a booster jab by the end of this month. As the tide of Omicron cases surges, thousands seeking a third vaccination without having to wait days or weeks for an appointment are driving miles to neighbouring counties. People without transport and those for whom a walk-in centre is the only option – because they do not have a GP or an NHS number – have no access to Covid booster jabs. Several cities, including Norwich, Peterborough and York, have no walk-in centres. And there are no walk-in boosters available in entire counties, including Oxfordshire, Hampshire and Buckinghamshire, although some offer third doses for people with weakened immune systems. The reimposition of new Covid restrictions in England have been cited as one of the reasons for the resignation of a key UK government minister. The departure of Lord Frost, who was the government’s ‘Brexit’ minister in charge of overseeing the continuing difficulties surrounding Britain’s departure from the European Union, presents yet another political setback for the increasingly beleaguered prime minister. It comes after month in which one after another has popped up like – as one minister put it – a “bad advent calendar.” Conservative MPs were already warning Boris Johnson that he must regain control of the government to survive as leader until the next election when it emerged on Saturday night that Frost is to leave the government after frustrations over Brexit negotiations and broader concerns over the government’s Covid policies and tax increases. The peer has been vocal in recent weeks about his concerns over tax increases and the reimposition of Covid restrictions. He is understood to have spoken out against a rise in national insurance to pay for health and social care spending. He also has concerns about plan B Covid measures, which provoked the largest Tory rebellion under Johnson’s leadership. At a conference last month he said: I am very happy that free Britain, or at least merry England, is probably now the freest country in the world as regards Covid restrictions. No mask rules, no vaccine passports, and long may it remain so. Hello and welcome to coverage of all Covid-19 related news, internationally and here in the UK, where the scale of the threat posed by the Omicron variant has been laid bare by government scientists who warned that there are now hundreds of thousands of infections every day in Britain. They warned daily number could reach between 600,000 and 2 million by the end of the month if new restrictions are not brought in immediately. In other developments: • Nations across Europe moved to reimpose tougher measures to stem a new wave of Covid infections, with the Netherlands leading the way by imposing a nationwide lockdown. • Germany is tightening restrictions on travel from the UK in an attempt to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. • The World Health Organization reported on Saturday that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been detected in 89 countries, and Covid cases involving the variant are doubling every one-and-a-half to three days in places with community transmission and not just infections acquired abroad. • Kamala Harris has conceded that the Biden administration was blind to the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants of Covid-19, and said she fears “misinformation” over vaccines will prolong the pandemic well into a third year in the US. • Australia’s federal health minister has said it is unlikely the country will follow the Netherlands and impose significant lockdowns to suppress surging Omicron infections, although the deputy chief medical officer, noted that the new variant was highly transmissible This is Ben Quinn in London.

          "bodyText": "The UK health secretary has criticised people who have chosen not to be vaccinated against coronavirus as they “take up hospital beds” that could be used for patients in need. Sajid Javid said the unvaccinated – about 5 million people or 10% of the eligible population – were having a damaging impact on society and creating extra pressure on the health system. “They must really think about the damage they are doing to society,” Javid told Sky News on Sunday. “They take up hospital beds that could have been used for someone with maybe a heart problem, or maybe someone who is waiting for elective surgery.” “But instead of protecting themselves and protecting the community they choose not to get vaccinated,” he added. About nine out of 10 Covid patients needing the most care in hospital were unvaccinated, Javid said, referring to people requiring extra corporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure between July and November. Javid’s comments came after Prof Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the health service was on a “war footing”, with plans being developed to treat 15% of Covid patients at home, with remote monitoring of their oxygen levels. The strategy would allow patients “the same care they would [receive] in hospital but from the comfort of their own home”, Powis told the Sunday Times. “This is better for patients, it is better for their families and it is better for the NHS, as it limited the spread of the virus, which we know at the minute is rising exponentially.” Powis added that plans for “care hotels”, in which the NHS would pay for patients to be looked after by live-in carers, were being drawn up, with three hotels in southern England already operating. An army of 20,000 NHS reservists – former doctors, nurses and non-clinical staff – may be called on to solidify services. Javid urged the unvaccinated to come forward and get jabbed. “They are really having a damaging impact and I just can’t stress enough, please do come forward and get vaccinated,” he said. Javid on Sunday did not rule out the possibility of further Covid restrictions. He said ministers were discussing Covid data “almost on an hourly basis” with advisers. Scotland is ahead of other UK nations in vaccinating its population, with 9% of eligible people still unvaccinated, compared with 10% in Wales, 11% in England and 14% in Northern Ireland. Out of 57.5 million over-12s in the UK eligible for the vaccine, 51.1 million had received one jab (89%) while 6.4 million (11%) had not, according to data from the UK’s health agencies for vaccinations delivered up to 5 December. The UK broke its record daily Covid case tally three days in a row this week, with cases jumping above 90,000 on Friday. On Sunday, the total number of Omicron cases detected surged to more than 37,000. As of 16 December, there were 7,611 people in UK hospitals with Covid and 875 occupying ventilation beds, according to government data. • This article was edited on 21 December 2021 to provide further detail about the figures given by Javid for the proportion of unvaccinated people requiring “the most care” in hospital."

          "headline": "Manchester City illustrate gulf in class with thrashing of Newcastle",
          "bodyText": "The so-called Gulf derby turned into an ultimately painful exposure of the yawning chasm in class separating the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City and the Saudi Arabian-controlled Newcastle United. Both clubs may be regarded as “trophy” purchases on the part of their oil-rich overlords but only table-topping City are likely to secure silverware anytime soon. Creditably, Eddie Howe’s side refused to surrender but television viewers in Riyadh and Jeddah may have felt the need to watch through their fingers whenever Pep Guardiola’s players, and the outstanding João Cancelo in particular, assumed possession. “All that money and you’re going down,” the visiting fans chorused in response to taunts of “We’re richer than you” – and, given that Newcastle have won only one game all season, it is hard to disagree. Despite certain bright spots, most notably Joelinton’s performance in midfield, it took Howe’s team until the 82nd minute to register their first shot on target when Callum Wilson’s fine header stretched Ederson to the limit. Goodness knows what might have happened had City been at their best, rather than playing within themselves. “The first half was one of the worst we’ve played all season,” Guardiola said. “But the second half was much better.” The Newcastle supporters who shrugged off Covid-related anxieties to swell the attendance to 52,127 deserved more from their willing but limited and error-prone side on the day St James’ Park was stripped of the unattractive Sports Direct advertising hoardings which blemished the ground during Mike Ashley’s ownership. Yet if the off-field aesthetics were much improved, on it, little had changed. Certainly not for Howe who has now lost all his 11 Premier League encounters with a City team on a run of eight successive league wins. The former Bournemouth manager said he had selected a team of “really good athletes” full of “energy and vibrancy”. However his new players’ shortage of streetwise nous was pinpointed as they conceded in the fifth minute after gifting Rúben Dias a free header two yards out. That moment of almost unprecedented generosity served as a microcosm of long-standing defensive ills. It began with Oleksandr Zinchenko stripping Miguel Almirón of possession and chipping a slightly overhit pass into Cancelo’s path. No matter; City’s impressively assured right‑back retained sufficient control to hook the ball back across the box. At that point Martin Dubravka could have come for it but, with Ciaran Clark seemingly well placed to clear, he instead remained on his line, watching horror-struck as Clark inexplicably ducked beneath the ball, permitting Dias to apply the final headed touch. Something had clearly been lost in translation between Howe’s goalkeeper and centre-half with the latter primarily culpable. Already, Cancelo was not merely excelling but reminding everyone he is a total footballer rather than a mere full-back and, emphasising this point, he swiftly doubled City’s advantage. Appropriately, Cancelo initiated the move, exchanging passes with Riyad Mahrez before assuming possession inside the home half and embarking on a slalom-style advance infield which left Joe Willock on his bottom and Isaac Hayden blindsided before he swept a superb right-foot shot beyond Dubravka from 20 yards. Newcastle were subsequently rightly aggrieved not to be awarded a blatant penalty after Ederson upended Ryan Fraser in the wake of Cancelo’s defensive interception. However Martin Atkinson’s refereeing could not be blamed for a defeat in which the sight of the immensely improved, apparently reborn, Joelinton – once again Howe’s best player – dropping back into central midfield and channelling his inner Patrick Vieira appeared emblematic of a Newcastle team slowly improving under their latest manager’s tutelage but taking baby steps at a time when a Great Leap Forward is required. Accordingly even Allan Saint-Maximin’s second-half introduction failed to faze Guardiola’s defence during a 45 minutes in which Dubravka performed wonders to tip Gabriel Jesus’s close‑range header over the bar after Cancelo’s dissection of the black and white backline. With Kevin De Bruyne finally making his presence felt in City’s midfield, remote hopes of a Newcastle comeback faded completely when, following a protracted spell of visiting possession, Mahrez connected with Zinchenko’s cross and sent a first-time volley whizzing past the goalkeeper. Although City’s third goal was initially, erroneously, ruled out for a marginal offside, a VAR review corrected that judgment, leaving travelling fans taunting locals with chants of, “You should have gone shopping.” By the time Jesus shrugged Jacob Murphy aside and rolled a pass across the box for Raheem Sterling to tap in the fourth, Howe was hunting for positives. “The physical effort from my players was extraordinary,” he said. “The result looks bleak but the game’s reality felt very different. We’re heading in the right direction … but there’s a very long way to go.”"

          "headline": "The hottest product this US holiday shopping season? Buy now pay later",
          "bodyText": "Supply chain issues. Labor shortages. Rising prices. Mask mandates. These are some of the biggest challenges facing small merchants this holiday season and I can tell you on behalf of many of my clients that it’s not making for a very merry Christmas. But there’s thing that is saving the season for thousands of business owners and no, it’s not Rudolph. It’s a financing program called buy now pay later, or BNPL. And its use has exploded recently, particularly among small businesses. “It’s one of the stars, actually, of the holiday season for us,” Dan Schulman, the CEO of the payments service PayPal told CNBC. “During Black Friday, our volume on buy now, pay later was up almost 400% year over year. We did some 750,000 transactions alone in one day.” PayPal says it had more than a million first-time users in one month and its BNPL usage is “well over 10 million consumers”. BNPL has become so popular that a report from marketing insights agency C+R Research says that about 60% of US adults have used it when buying products and of those who’ve used it, 80% plan on using it for holiday gift-buying, according to data intelligence firm Morning Consult. Younger people love the option too. Nearly 60% of Gen Z and millennials have bought a product on social media using a buy now, pay later option, according to a study from StitcherAds. E-commerce firm Adobe’s Digital Economy Index, which analyzes direct consumer transactions online, said revenue on Cyber Monday from buy now, pay later plans rose 21% from a year ago. So what is BNPL? It’s not a new concept. In fact, your grandparents will probably recognize it. That’s because BNPL is just like the old layaway programs they used back in the day, but with a 21st-century twist. In the olden days, layaway programs were only used for big purchases like a dining room set or a new Zenith color TV (with remote control!). But today’s BNPL programs are being used for smaller transactions, both online and in store, and consumers can walk away with the product after making their first payment. PayPal Credit, Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay are among the most popular platforms used by merchants of all sizes. For a small business, BNPL is easy to set up. A consumer wants to buy something. The BNPL service is offered as a plug-in payment option on an e-commerce site or in-store by the merchant. The consumer usually has an interest-free period where they make installment payments over a period of a few weeks or months. There’s usually no credit checks and consumers can avoid using their credit cards where they have to pay off their balance that month. Of course there are some downsides. For consumers, late fees and interest payments could be steep – as much as 25% in some cases. Credit limits are smaller and credit reports can be affected if payment isn’t made on time. For merchants, most BNPL arrangements still require a fee which, according to the Kansas City Federal Reserve can range from 1.5 to 1.7% of the purchase value (including tax), as compared to the cost of a typical debit or credit-card transaction, which ranges from 1 to 3%. But on the other hand, it makes it easier to sell products. And research shows that when BNPL is offered, customers actually buy more. In fact, BNPL users plan to spend on one gift what the average shopper plans to spend for the entirety of their holiday shopping this season, according to the above Morning Consult report. “I think there is an impulse element to this, and that these companies do make a lot of money by partnering with retailers,” Joe Buhrmann, senior financial planning consultant at eMoney Advisor, told MarketWatch. “There’s a lot of data that people spend more when they use buy now, pay later, [and] they come back again and again.” Is that such a bad thing? Maybe for the undisciplined consumer. But considering all the other headaches small businesses have to deal with this holiday season, BNPL is providing (almost) as much cheer as a glass of eggnog. If your business hasn’t signed up for one of these plans, you may be missing an opportunity."

          "headline": "‘We are family’: the Israelis sharing life and hope with Palestinians",
          "bodyText": "In the plywood hut in which Palestinian Iman al-Hathalin and her family have lived since their home was bulldozed by the Israeli authorities in 2014, the warmth from a rickety samovar is welcome. Outside the only window, the winter sky is blinding white: it floods the room with an icy light and sends shadows dancing up the flimsy walls. Everyone has been ill lately, it seems, including Hathalin’s two-year-old daughter, who sleeps fitfully on her lap, and Maya Mark, her Arabic-speaking Israeli guest. “It is not exaggerating to say Maya is like my sister,” the 28-year-old said. “I was so worried when she was sick. We are family.” The friends are catching up in a village deep in the south Hebron hills, about as remote as it’s possible to get within the confines of the West Bank. This rocky, difficult place is one of the fiercest frontlines of the occupation: Palestinian homes, paved roads and water cisterns are repeatedly demolished thanks to a near-total ban on construction, while illegal Israeli settlements flourish. Rather than collapse under these pressures, however, the local community has become a deep wellspring for non-violent Palestinian activism, which has often worked hand in hand with the anti-occupation movement in Israel. In the absence of any meaningful top-down peace process, Hathalin and Mark are part of a new generation of activists who are quietly taking an extraordinary new step. Together with Nnur Zahor, another Israeli Arabic speaker, Mark has created an immersive language-learning course for like-minded young Israeli activists, taught by eight local Palestinian women, including Hathalin. Over the course of several months, the project has helped to forge deep relationships between the students and people across several villages, and the Israelis’ presence is countering a rising tide of settler violence. The project – it has no official name or title – is possible thanks to decades of work by older activists who built up trust between the communities: it is unlikely that it could scale up or be replicated elsewhere. But nothing quite like this grassroots, long-term idea has ever happened before, and everyone involved agrees it is a richly rewarding undertaking. “The people here don’t need us at all,” said Mark, 26. “Being here has taught me to be more modest about activism and about my role. It’s inspiring and a priceless experience, getting to understand the depth of resistance here.” According to the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, a unique cave-dwelling culture has existed in the Hebron hills since at least the 1830s, the natural shelters used as homes and for keeping sheep and goats. In the decades since Israel’s creation, Bedouin families expelled from the Negev desert have also made their way to these arid foothills, north of their ancestral lands. The territory was captured by Israel in the war of 1967, and is now part of Area C, the 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli control. But Palestinian shepherds and farmers are no longer the only people living here. Dozens of Israeli settlements have been established since the 1980s – many illegal not just under international law, but Israeli law too. Encouraged by Donald Trump’s unyielding support for Israel’s right, the settlers have grown bolder in the past few years, seizing more and more land that Israel classifies as “state land” or “firing zones”, and their tactics have become increasingly violent. The UN recorded 410 attacks by settlers against Palestinian civilians and property in the West Bank in the first 10 months of 2021, including four killings, up from 358 in 2020, and 335 in 2019. Rather than intervene, the UN and rights groups say, Israeli security forces more often stand by or even join in. The Palestinians can also turn to violence. Earlier this week, gunmen ambushed a car with Israeli license plates as it left Homesh in the northern West Bank, killing a 25-year-old and wounding two others. Stone-throwing, shooting with live ammunition, cutting down or burning crops and olive trees, killing sheep and vandalising property are common. In one of the most recent high-profile incidents, in September dozens of armed men from two nearby outposts smashed through the Hebron hills village of Mufakara, breaking windows and solar panels, slashing tyres, overturning a car and injuring six people. Before the pandemic, Hebron locals were often supported by international volunteers who helped escort children to school on dangerous roads between outposts, and challenged settlers who trespassed on to private Palestinian land. But as the world’s borders closed, preventing travel, local activists decided to turn to Israeli friends. “A few of us decided that we wanted to invite them to come. Not everyone in the area is OK with it, they don’t understand what we are trying to achieve. But before we had to wait to report settler problems, now our Israeli allies can get very close and document everything,” said Nasser Nawaja, a well-known local activist. “The Israelis are learning what it is like to live here. And our children are learning that Jews are not just settlers and soldiers.” Small groups of Israelis have been rotating around a handful of villages in the Hebron hills since spring, although the volunteers asked for their exact locations to be withheld for security reasons. There’s little that seems to bond the 10 or so volunteers on the surface: they come from all over Israel, from different family backgrounds, and while all would describe themselves as politically on the left, they debate what that means. The students have Arabic classes two mornings a week, with a curriculum Mark and Zahor designed especially for native Hebrew speakers. They get to practice in everyday life and there is no ban on discussing political topics, unlike most Arabic programmes in Israel. “When I came, I remember thinking, ‘What am I going to do here? How will I interact, how will I support this community?’ I didn’t understand anything being said in the summer, but now I get about 50% of the conversation. It’s very exciting,” said Maya Eshel, 26, during a group meeting with the Observer at a community centre on a bleak, cold day last Thursday. The group spend the rest of their time helping out as needed. They are most useful as watchdogs: if someone calls to say settlers are approaching a village, or won’t let shepherds reach their land, the volunteers leap into action, grabbing binoculars and cameras equipped with long-distance lenses donated by B’Tselem and hustling to their cars. Sometimes their presence, or Hebrew conversation, can be enough to diffuse the situation. At the very least, they can record what happens and give testimonies to the police, although so far only one incident of dozens reported has been followed up. During our visit, the relaxed end-of-the-week mood in one village shifted dramatically after a little girl ran up to the prefab houses, shouting she had seen two settlers approaching a Palestinian olive grove from the large settlement on the other side of the valley. The adults and the Israeli activists rushed to the nearest clear viewpoint; the village dogs barked. Through the binoculars, they decided the two figures looked like young boys. One appeared to be carrying a saw. On noticing the adults on the ridge, the children stopped, eventually walking back up to the settlement. “Sometimes I am driving somewhere in the jeep, maybe it’s the middle of the night, to somewhere I’ve never been, and I stop and think to myself: ‘What the fuck am I doing here?’” said Matan Brenner-Kadish, 25. “This idea is really not for everyone and, long term, we are just plugging holes in a boat. If what drives you is anger and shame, then this would be exhausting. But if you come from a position of accepting that this brings benefits for both us and them, it’s a different perspective.” The project is not without risk. Earlier this month, three of the group were detained at a police station overnight on charges of not intervening to help a settler who was pushed to the ground by residents when he tried to enter a Palestinian village. Cameras, laptops, phones and a car were confiscated – all without a warrant. The three detained members could technically face sentences of three years in prison. “One of the arguments the settlers use is our presence is a justification for more violence: one explicitly blamed us, said they are attacking because of us,” said Itai Feitelson, 26. “They’d be violent if we were here or if we weren’t here. It shows that what we are doing is working,” said Brenner-Kadish. “And, at the end of the day, if the Palestinians can do this their whole lives, so can we.” • This article was amended on 22 December 2021 with regard to data on Palestinian civilian casualties; the UN recorded four killings, not “murders” as an earlier version said."

To recap the main Covid news; NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has ruled out reintroducing mask mandates or other restrictions, saying it is a matter of “personal responsibility”, despite the state setting another record for daily Covid infections. NSW reported 2,566 cases on Sunday, taking the tally for the past five days to more than 10,000. The federal health minister Greg Hunt says it is unlikely Australia will follow the Netherlands and impose significant lockdowns to suppress surging Omicron infections. In the Northern Territory, health authorities will announce tomorrow whether the lockdown affecting Tennant Creek will be extended, saying an extension is “likely” as seven new cases were identified in the Tennant Creek and Barkly regions. Later on Sunday, an additional case was identified in Ali Curung, 170km south of Tennant Creek. Ali Curung is an Indigenous community of about 500 people, and it is now in lockdown until 5pm Wednesday 22 December. Meanwhile, Victoria recorded 1,240 new Covid-19 cases, out of 76,033 tests. The state reported that 392 patients have been hospitalised with the virus; of these 81 active cases are in the ICU, of whom 41 require ventilation. A positive Covid case has been identified in a member of the media covering the second Ashes Test at Adelaide Oval. Tasmania is mandating masks indoors as the state recorded three new Covid-19 infections after reopening its border. South Australia recorded 80 new Covid-19 cases. In total across Australia there were 3,959 new cases: 2566 in NSW, 1240 in Victoria, 80 in South Australia, 42 in Queensland, 18 in the ACT, 10 in the Northern Territory and three in Tasmania. In other news; Police commissioner Darren Hine announced with “a heavy heart” that a sixth child has died after the tragic jumping castle accident that occurred at a Devonport primary school end-of-year event on Thursday. The 11-year-old boy named Chace Harrison died on Sunday afternoon. Police are investigating the accident. Four people have died following a plane crash near Redcliffe this morning. Police and emergency services responded to reports a small plane crashed in waters off the coast of Redcliffe shortly after 9am. The deaths include two children. Police have retrieved the body of a man from waters off Lennox Head, in the northern rivers region of New South Wales. The crew of PolAir 5 had been searching the area after a 19-year-old swimmer was reported missing. One person has died, and two others have been critically injured by a fallen tree during a storm on Sydney’s northern beaches today. The Bureau of Meteorology has released its Christmas Day weather forecast. The liveblog will be back tomorrow morning to take you through the news of the day. Until then, stay safe. Eighty new Covid cases have been reported in South Australia, with 309 active cases in the state and four people in hospital. SA Health urged “anyone who has been out in the community to monitor closely for symptoms and get tested as soon as they appear”. A person has died, and two others have been critically injured by a fallen tree during a storm on Sydney’s northern beaches today. From 3.30pm, emergency services received multiple reports of storm damage across the northern beaches area with trees and powerlines down across suburbs from Mona Vale to Forestville. Officers from Northern Beaches Police Area Command along with NSW Ambulance paramedics, Fire &amp; Rescue NSW, and the Westpac helicopter responded to a carpark on Ocean Street, Narrabeen, after reports a tree and powerlines had come down. One person was declared dead, while two others were critically injured and transported to Royal North Shore Hospital. The area is still considered hazardous, and members of the public are advised to avoid the area. In order to stay safe, treat all powerlines as if they are ‘live,’ NSW police said in a statement. There have also been reports of severe damage to homes and other buildings. Looks like the northern beaches in NSW are copping some rough weather. Elsewhere in NSW, severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds over the next several hours in parts of the Central Tablelands, Southern Tablelands, Central West Slopes and Plains and South West Slopes districts. Meanwhile in Victoria, a severe thunderstorm warning for damaging winds and heavy rainfall has been issued for those in East Gippsland, West and South Gippsland and parts of North Central and North East forecast districts. And if you want to know what to expect weather-wise for Christmas Day, you can read this piece by Lane Sainty: Some breaking news from the Northern Territory, where nine new Covid-19 cases were announced today. An additional case has been identified in Ali Curung, taking new cases in the NT to 10, eight of those in the community. Ali Curung is an Indigenous community of about 500 people, and they are now in lockdown. Darren Hine says it is too early to say how long the investigation into the jumping castle tragedy will take: A lot of pieces of the investigation need to be pulled together. We don’t want to rush it but we also understand that the community wants answers. We have lost another life and we’ll need to respect the family and give them space as well. Asked whether a state memorial will be held, Peter Gutwein says: I think we need to ensure that our thoughts at the moment with those two children that are still critically hurt and we will work with, obviously, the families, and understand their wishes as well. None of us can understand just how difficult it is for those six families who have lost children. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein: I am certain all Tasmanians share with me a deep sadness and heartache that young Chace Harrison, another child involved in this terrible tragedy, has now passed away. I know that our community, which is so connected, will be deeply saddened for the family involved and indeed all the families of the now six children who have lost their lives in this tragedy. We all feel this terrible loss. To all of the families impacted by this terrible tragedy, we will continue to support you. Welfare officers were with Chace’s family, the premier said. Commissioner Darren Hine said the investigation would take some time: We are working tirelessly with all parties concerned to ensure the extensive investigation is completed as a matter of priority for the coroner. The investigation is being led by Devonport criminal investigation branch, with assistance from officers from Launceston CIB, under the direction of the coroner. Their priority will be to interview all witnesses, gather and analyse forensic evidence and all environmental aspects, including weather patterns and conditions at the time of the incident. Given the magnitude of this critical incident and the need to speak to a large number of traumatised children within a short period of time, we have accepted an offer from NSW police to assist in conducting interviews in relation to the investigation. Four forensic child interviewers will travel to Tasmania today to help conduct interviews with young witnesses over the coming days. It is paramount we don’t pre-empt any outcome until all evidence is gathered and the investigation is complete. This will allow the coroner to determine the findings based on all the available evidence and facts. Community recovery arrangements are in place, and our thoughts continue to be with the families, loved ones and all those affected by this tragedy. The loss of six young lives will be felt by our community for a long time – so please take care of yourselves and those around you. For anyone in need of assistance, there is a range of 24-hour support services available: • Kids Helpline – 1800 551 800 • Mental Health Services Helpline – 1800 332 388 • Beyond Blue – 1300 224 636 • Lifeline – 13 11 14 Police commissioner Darren Hine says it is with “a heavy heart” he has to announce a sixth child has died after the tragic accident: An 11-year-old boy died this afternoon, his name is Chace Harrison. Our thoughts continue to be with his family and all other families and loved ones of the children involved. Nine children were seriously injured in Thursday’s incident. Devastatingly, six children have now passed away. Two children remain in critical condition in the Royal Hobart hospital. Another is now recovering at home. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein will shortly hold a press conference on the jumping castle tragedy on Thursday, in which five children were killed. Addison Stewart, 11, Zane Mellor, 12, Jye Sheehan, 12, Jalailah Jayne-Maree Jones, 12, and Peter Dodt, 12, died in the incident. They were taking part in end-of-term activities at their primary school when the jumping castle and Zorb balls were hurled into the air by a gust of wind. From AAP: The Bureau of Meteorology has released its first official Christmas Day forecast and it’s promising warm and dry weather for much of the country. A high pressure system moving east to west across southern Australia will lead to mild and settled conditions, said meteorologist Jackson Browne. There’s a chance of rain and storms for the northern half of the country, including places including Weipa in the Gulf of Carpentaria and extending into the Northern Territory. That’s thanks to tropical moisture coming in from Indonesia and the Coral Sea. The mercury in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide should peak between 27 and 30 degrees. Perth residents will be sweating a little more, with an expected top of 34 degrees. That’s the same top as Darwin, where there’ll be a shower or two. Browne said it would be hot across the interior of the country, including a top of 39 degrees in Alice Springs, and the heat will extend north into WA. But cooler minimum temperatures mean people shouldn’t expect heatwave conditions. In Hobart, the maximum expected temperature is 23 degrees. The bureau emphasised that the forecast could change. Browne said: We know Australians eagerly await our Christmas Day forecast. Should Christmas lunch be inside or outside, will the surf be safe for a swim, will it be wet on the roads; these are just some of the questions we help you answer each year. Victoria has published the daily chief health officer update: 94.3% of Victorians aged 12 and over have now had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 92.5% have had two doses. There are 392 Covid-19 cases in hospital in Victoria. This includes 81 active cases in ICU, with 41 of those on a ventilator. As mentioned earlier in the blog, Victoria was notified of 1,240 new cases of Covid-19 yesterday. All cases were locally acquired except for one case which was acquired overseas. The 10 local government areas with the highest number of new cases are Casey, Whittlesea, Hume, Wyndham, Brimbank, Greater Dandenong, Melton, Moreland, Melbourne and Moonee Valley. There are 13,093 active Covid-19 cases in Victoria. 76,033 Covid-19 tests were processed yesterday. There are now more than 31,000 active primary close contacts in isolation in Victoria. There were five new confirmed cases of the Omicron variant identified in Victoria yesterday. The total number of confirmed Omicron variant cases in Victoria is 24. Of the Omicron cases in Victoria, 16 acquired their infection overseas and eight acquired their infection in Australia. The Department of Health has been taking a cautious approach to the designation of contacts of known Omicron cases. The department directly advised a number of non-household contacts to get tested and quarantine for seven days if fully vaccinated (or 14 days if not). These settings were applied on a case-by-case basis. Going forward, contacts in Victoria are now following the standard protocols regardless of variant: household contacts quarantine for 7 or 14 days, but non-household contacts (such as social, workplace or education contacts) are advised to get a PCR test and isolate until they get a negative result. Cases and contacts can find more information about these protocols at www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/checklist. A pre-Christmas booster blitz for state vaccination clinics has also been launched. Capacity is being ramped up at state-run vaccination clinics to assist the commonwealth’s booster vaccine rollout before Christmas. More on the positive Covid case linked to the second Test at Adelaide Oval: Queensland has recorded 42 new Covid-19 cases, more than doubling its daily number in 48 hours, AAP reports. Chief health officer Dr John Gerrard said of those cases 24 are still under investigation, one was overseas-acquired, seven were linked to interstate travel and eight are contacts of known cases. Two of them, though, had no known link or travel history. After 20 total cases on Friday, and 31 just 24 hours ago, Gerrard expected the number to continue to surge after Queensland opened its borders to fully vaccinated interstate travellers on Monday. He said the new cases were “spread right across the state” with remote north-west town of Mount Isa the latest to be affected: It is likely most Queenslanders will be potentially exposed to this virus in the coming weeks. Forty-two may seem like a relatively small number but this is double the number we saw just 48 hours ago. If this rate continues, we will see significant numbers in January as predicted. Gerrard said no one was in intensive care, with only one of the 42 new cases showing symptoms after 18,312 tests in the last 24 hours. But he said the “moderately unwell and breathless” woman had been unvaccinated. Gerrard said Omicron was emerging as the dominant strain in Queensland at a much faster rate than expected. Four people have died following a plane crash near Redcliffe this morning. Police and emergency services responded to reports a small plane crashed in waters off the coast of Redcliffe shortly after 9am. A multi-agency operation is under way with Queensland water police officers and divers along with the forensic crash unit assisting other agencies, including the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, as investigations continue. There is no further information about those on board at this stage, Queensland police said in a statement. The families are asking media to respect their privacy during this difficult time. A positive Covid case among a member of the English media is causing some chaos on the first morning of the Adelaide Test, the Australian reports. Nine new cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the Northern Territory. Territory health minister Natasha Fyles said the lockdown in Tennant Creek may be extended, with no final decision made. The lockdown was announced on Friday and was due to end at 5pm on Monday. But this was “likely” to be extended, with health authorities continuing to discuss the situation, Fyles said. As of Sunday afternoon, 236 close contacts in the Northern Territory have been identified. Of the nine new cases, two are in international travellers in quarantine at Howard Springs. Seven are local cases in the Tennant Creek and Barkly regions. Fyles: So, considering these case numbers in Tennant Creek, we are actively considering extending that lockdown, but we haven’t made a final decision on that. We will get more information from our health teams ... and that decision will be made tomorrow. But it does look likely that we will extend that lockdown. Of the new Tennant Creek infections, four are in residents from the Wuppa town camp. These include a woman in her 60s with vulnerabilities, and she has been transferred to Tennant Creek hospital. A woman in her 50s from the camp is also very unwell and has been transferred to the same hospital. A man and a woman in their 40s from the same town camp have been transferred to the Alice Springs hospital. Fyles: We also have additional cases, a male and female in their 20s, and they’re at the Tennant Creek hospital. Then we have a child who is from Tennant Creek and is a known household contact. We believe that all of these cases are linked to the Katherine cluster, so we’re working through that in terms of the genomic sequencing and trying to establish that link. In the meantime Wuppa town camp residents have all been tested and are isolating. Northern Territory police apprehended two young women yesterday evening after they absconded from quarantine in Howard Springs a few hours earlier. The teenagers from Katherine were nearing the end of their quarantine period and had returned negative test results on their last test. They absconded from the centre at 3.30pm. Police resources used to locate the pair included a drone, police dogs and CCTV operators. Police apprehended the 16-year-old girls in Bakewell about 7pm and they were taken back to Howard Springs. As I mentioned earlier Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein has announced masks will be mandated indoors. At a press conference, Gutwein said masks would be mandatory for all indoor settings including offices, restaurants, pubs, clubs, public transport including taxis and ridesharing, retail settings and supermarkets: In terms of the mandate, it is a strong recommendation that from today that you start wearing your mask indoors. But it won’t be mandated until Monday night and, importantly, I’d encourage everybody to fall into line with this, do the right thing, and let’s keep our community safe as we move forward. A light aircraft has crashed off the end of a runway and into the water off the coast of Redcliffe in Queensland. Tasmania is mandating masks indoors as the state records three new Covid-19 infections after reopening its border, AAP reports. It takes the number of active cases in Tasmania to seven. One of Sunday’s new cases was a woman who arrived in Launceston from Sydney on Wednesday and visited a number of retail venues. Another was a man who arrived in Hobart from Melbourne on Friday and the third was a family member of a previously confirmed case. Premier Peter Gutwein told reporters: What we’re seeing occur at the moment is not unexpected. We said that we would see Covid in the state. Masks will be mandatory across all indoor settings, public transport and ride shares from 12.01am on Tuesday. Gutwein said: We’ve done this before. It’s important. In fact, a lot of Tasmanians are already doing it. Slightly more than 91% of Tasmanians aged 16 and older are fully vaccinated. There are lengthy delays at the Covid testing sites in Launceston, according to police. In particular, the site in Henry Street, Launceston is experiencing a back-up of traffic. Motorists are requested to avoid the area if possible. Police request that people lined up for the site pull over to the far left hand side of the road. I thought I’d take a quick look overseas as Omicron continues to spread worldwide. The Omicron variant has now been detected in 89 countries. In London, mayor Sadiq Khan has declared a “major incident” to help ease the pressure on the capital’s hospitals amid a surge in cases being driven by Omicron. On Friday, Britain reported the largest 24-hour increase in the number of new cases since the pandemic began. A major incident enables different public agencies to share information more closely but also acts as a warning that emergency services and hospitals are unable to guarantee their normal level of response due to unusual circumstances. Although there has been some early data to suggest Omicron may cause milder disease than Delta (though there is not enough data to say for sure), what we know is Omicron is definitely highly infectious. Milder but highly infectious viruses can still cause a lot of stress to health systems if they spread to the most vulnerable too quickly. Even a milder virus can cause severe disease and death, especially in immunocompromised people, or unvaccinated people with co-morbidities. That’s why governments around the world are moving to slow the spread even in highly vaccinated populations, and even amid suggestions the virus may be more mild. The World Health Organization said this weekend: There are still limited data on the clinical severity of Omicron. More data are needed to understand the severity profile and how severity is impacted by vaccination and pre-existing immunity.” But the WHO warned that with cases rising so rapidly, hospitals could be overwhelmed: Hospitalisations in the UK and South Africa continue to rise, and given rapidly increasing case counts, it is possible that many healthcare systems may become quickly overwhelmed. UK scientists have called on governments to bring in restrictions now or face up to 2m daily Covid infections as Omicron spreads. Due to the rising cases, Germany and France have implemented travel restrictions banning tourists from the UK. Meanwhile, the Netherlands will spend Christmas in lockdown. Non-essential shops, bars, gyms hairdressers and other public venues will be closed until at least mid-January, the BBC reports, while two guests a household will be allowed – four over the holidays. I’ve wrapped up all of the information from the NSW press conference which took place this morning, where NSW premier Dominic Perrottet rejected enforcing mask mandates despite the state setting another record for daily Covid infections – 2,566 new cases were reported today. Leading epidemiologists have called for masks to be reintroduced to indoor settings such as retail in NSW, and have expressed concernabout mask mandates lifting as the Omicron variant appears to be partly driving a spike in cases. Victoria was due to lift mask mandates for retail settings earlier in December but has delayed doing so due to Omicron and rising case numbers. Today Perrottet emphasised vaccination and booster shots as key to keeping hospital admissions down: What’s key to us is personal responsibility. Vaccination has been key, booster shots are crucial to keep people safe, and as we move through the next phase, case numbers will increase. That is the new normal. We’ll continue to monitor the situation. It’s a time for calm. But it’s also an important time to go out and get your booster shot. Because vaccination here has been key to New South Wales’s success. That’s not on the government, it’s on the people and our fantastic health teams. World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week warned governments against becoming complacent about Omicron, even if it turns out to be milder than Delta, saying its infectiousness alone is enough to overwhelm health systems: Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant. Surely we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril. You can read the full report on the NSW press conference here: There is some sad news to report as I take the live blog into the afternoon. Police have retrieved the body of a man from waters off Lennox Head, in the northern rivers region of New South Wales. The crew of PolAir 5 had been searching the area this morning after a 19-year-old swimmer was reported missing. The body of a man has been recovered by divers. While the body has yet to be formally identified, it is believed to be the man reported missing. He had been swimming at Lennox Head about 6pm on Friday. The man’s family were at the beach this morning and have been provided with support by local police. Police have thanked members of the Lennox Head-Alstonville surf life saving club, Marine Rescue NSW, the Westpac Helicopter crew and the local community. A report will be prepared for the coroner. That wraps up my time on the blog this morning. And that’s my last live blog for the year! Thank you so much for joining me on Sundays over the last few months. I’m handing over to the brilliant Melissa Davey, who will keep bringing you the news this afternoon. Let’s take a look back at what we learnt at this morning’s press conference with health minister Greg Hunt. Hunt says it is unlikely Australia will follow the Netherlands and impose significant lockdowns to suppress surging Omicron infections. Asked about the prospects of fresh statewide lockdowns given the new restrictions in the Netherlands, the federal health minister told reporters in Canberra the circumstances in Europe were quite different to Australia. Read the full story from Guardian Australia political editor Katharine Murphy. Further to my last post, NSW police believe the missing swimmer is a 19-year-old man. A PolAir helicopter crew and police divers have joined the search for a man who went missing while swimming at Lennox Head, New South Wales, on Friday. Officers attached to Richmond police district were called to Seven Mile beach by a woman, who reported she’d seen a swimmer in difficulties in the surf about 6pm. NSW police said officers were on site within minutes and immediately coordinated a search. Personal belongings were found unattended on the beach near the surf club and, about 7pm, a man approached police at the scene with concerns that his 19-year-old son had not returned from a swim. The search resumed at 6.30am. One Twitter user wrote to me asking if we have any data on the number of Covid-19 cases in Victoria over time. Thankfully Guardian Australia’s data team have pulled together this super helpful article with all the figures in one place for Australia as a whole, as well as the states with current outbreaks. A whopping 98.3% of those aged 12 and over in the ACT are fully vaccinated. Health experts are urging Australians to wear face masks and opt for outdoor gatherings as Covid-19 infections continue to climb in the lead-up to Christmas. Our friends at AAP have the story: Infectious diseases pediatrician Robert Booy doesn’t expect infections to fall until February after an anticipated January peak fuelled by holiday travel. “There are so many simple things we have been doing already that work that we can continue doing without too much fuss,” he told the Nine Network on Sunday. “We don’t have to be locked down, but we can observe simple measures like masking indoors, like spending more time outdoors where it is ventilated, social distancing by a metre to two metres.” Booy thinks QR codes should be continued or brought back to help control the spread and avoid a return to lockdowns. “Even then, we can do things like a partial lockdown where people can get on with their lives, but they limit the amount of time in pubs, clubs, hotels and the like,” he said. Brad Hazzard is asked about calls from the Australian Medical Association for NSW to reintroduce some restrictions, due to the state’s rapid rise in cases. AMA president Omar Khorshid told ABC News yesterday: “It’s very bizarre timing from the New South Wales government to pull out a mask mandate just when you are seeing an incredible spike in cases that matches what’s happening around the world.” Hazzard: Look, again, the AMA, I ... respect their views, I have heard their views, particularly the federal AMA. But I have also heard a range of other epidemiologists and I get to see more when I want you TV programs at night. I will take the advice of New South Wales Health and weigh up all the other issues that we have to add ... At the moment I don’t seem to be, I don’t see any reason to jump down that path. Health minister Brad Hazzard says the figures that come out of other countries are “not naturally analogous to our state”. But he says the state is on “high alert”: At the moment the figures here are very low and so we are also looking at modelling that is coming from overseas. NSW is in a different position at the moment. We are in summer, so we are not seeing the huge uptake of what you would expect anyway of people, for a variety of other reasons other than just the ... variants we are dealing with at the moment. It is hard to distinguish or understand the full impact until we see more weeks of experience in what is going on here in New South Wales as to whether or not it is going to really lift our hospital intake or not. We are on high alert, as you would expect us to be. Dominic Perrottet is asked what the downsides to mandating masks are, given that doctors and nurses are calling for this. The premier says authorities “strongly encourage it” but won’t go so far as to issue a mandate, saying: “There’s always different views, there’s always different debates.” He does suggest that mask mandates may be reintroduced in the future, especially as Australia heads into winter or as new variants emerge: When we believe there’s evidence in front of us we need to potentially tighten restrictions we will. And it’s almost certainly as we move through, as we see overseas, as they head into the winter months, certain challenges will come our way. There will be curve balls, certain things we don’t expect. There’s almost certainly to be other variants that may come our way, and we’ll need to respond. Reporter: What will your threshold to reintroducing restrictions? What would it you take for you to do that? Dominic Perrottet: We’ll look at that. What is key to us as well is personal responsibility. And you know, we have mandated masks in high-risk settings. We strongly encourage the use of that. Everybody today is responding incredibly well. We monitor the situation. ICU presentations are the key metric for us. We want to make sure that our health system has the capacity as we move through this next challenge of the pandemic. And I’m incredibly confident as premier that our health system is the strongest in the country. That we can deal with the challenges that come our way. One journalist points out that the NSW government’s response to Omicron is very different to how authorities, like the UK and the Netherlands, are responding. They ask Dominic Perrottet whether he is doing enough. The premier says he thinks NSW is, and has always, struck the right balance. He says that state is focused on getting people vaccinated: What has been our leading aspect here in New South Wales has been the effort that everyone has undertaken to get vaccinated. We have not only the highest vaccination rates in the country but in the world. That enables us to learn to live alongside the virus. If you look over the last two years, to be in a position where we’re having incredibly low death rates and, in addition to that, our economy is strong, and we have been able to open up in a way that keeps people in work and allows them to provide for their families. And we’ll continue that approach. We’ll continue to monitor the situation ... It’s a time for calm. But it’s also an important time to go out and get your booster shot. Health minister Brad Hazzard clarifies that NSW saw 57,000 booster shots given by state health facilities alone this last week. This is up from 15,000 doses the previous week: By the end of January, we expect that 40% of all people who have been vaccinated … I think we were all hoping for a really good year next year. I think we can still hope for a good year next year. We need to get our booster shots and take the basic precautions. This virus is now this new variant, Omicron. We can’t be sure we won’t have other variants along the way, but the basic rules apply. If you have symptoms, stay home. Don’t put your family and workmates at risk. If you have any symptoms, go and get tested. Maintain that social distancing and, of course, if you’re in close proximity to people inside and it’s a big group of people, consider wearing a mask. We also have to live our lives in amore normal way coming into 2022. We’ll continue to strike the balance. Dominic Perrottet adds that the NSW first-dose vaccination rate is now at 94.9% (it is unclear whether this is for those 16 and older, or those 12 and older). NSW premier Dominic Perrottet is speaking, and is urging residents to get their booster shot, if eligible. More than 50,000 people in the last week came forward for it, he says: We said vaccination is key to ensuring we’re able to open up as quickly as possible, as safely as possible. And to see so many people go out and receive that booster shot, particularly as we go into Christmas, has been incredibly pleasing. We are standing by to hear from NSW premier Dominic Perrottet. I’ll bring you the updates as we have them. Finally, Greg Hunt is asked about data emerging from the UK health security agency that shows AstraZeneca is weak at preventing a symptomatic infection from Omicron (based on a very small sample size). He is asked whether booster timeframes could, or should, be shortened for those who had the AstraZeneca vaccine: There’s lots of information coming in. Much of it preliminary ... Our advice remains that all the vaccines provide clear and strong protection against serious illness and loss of life. In terms of Omicron, there’s emerging data. I haven’t had any indication at this point in time of a vaccine-specific set of booster timeframes. So what we do is just as we’ve done with the TGA ... with Atagi, we encourage and really defend and protect their independence. And sometimes we’ll see others with a medical expert background or others with just a passing medical background give differing views. But by having the two outstanding bodies, one the regulatory agency, the other the vaccine advisory body, as strong and independent bodies that make their assessments, we get the best advice. Greg Hunt said none of the states or territories have indicated that there will be changes to Covid-19 restrictions in the lead-up to Christmas or in 2022: The direction of Australia is overwhelmingly towards opening up. Obviously, seven states and territories are now reunited and Western Australia has set their timeframe. So, it’s that direction towards opening up which has been set. But Hunt acknowledged that “individual measures might be adjusted from time to time depending on circumstances”. Federal minister Greg Hunt said that it is up to states to “make their own decisions” about whether to shorten the wait time between a second dose and a booster shot beyond the five months that Atagi has advised. Guardian Australia reported yesterday that New South Wales health officials are considering breaking with commonwealth advice by shortening the Covid vaccine booster interval to four months, amid concern about spread of the Omicron variant. Deputy chief medial officer Dr Sonya Bennett responds to a question about the UK view that there are two pandemics – Delta and Omicron: We have always considered Omicron would be more transmissible ... It’s hard for both ourselves and even countries around the world to completely understand what proportion of their cases are Omicron versus Delta. There is a belief that the majority are Omicron in the UK. But it’s very difficult through testing to completely confirm that. That just underscores the fact there’s still a lot of uncertainty about this particular variant ... we continue to watch all the emerging evidence and it will adjust as necessary ... For us it’s about focusing on what we as a community can do now, whilst we enjoy that time with family and friends at Christmas. And it’s a combination of vaccination and those other measures that I mentioned, such as mask wearing and being Covid-safe. Greg Hunt is asked whether there is going to be a problem with the booster rollout, given that a lot of GP clinics close over the Christmas period. The journalist asks whether the states should ramp up their vaccination clinics to compensate. The health minister says the system has shown it can “ramp up from 500,000 [doses] a week ... to now over1m in the last seven days”: The second thing, though, is we [prepared] extremely large volumes of vaccines to cover the Christmas period, over 5m vaccines are in place, with another 2m-plus being expected to be delivered in the lead-up to Christmas and then in the days beyond. And then a third thing is that the states do have a very important role. We’ve been in contact with the states and territories, encouraging them to continue their state clinics. Hunt adds that the role of pharmacies is also increasing, and that they’ve gone from administering 15,000 doses a day to more than 50,000 on weekdays. Sonya Bennett seems to suggest that we should have mask mandates but doesn’t go so far as to call on the NSW government to reintroduce them. Instead, she says that people should act before mandates come in: I think we know mask mandates work. We know mandates work generally. But I think my plea to the community is we don’t need to wait for mandates to tell us what is sensible to do. That particularly applies to masks. They’re simple, we’re used to it. Most people around the country have worn masks at some stage. It’s a simple, easy, effective tool to continue to use when necessary. I ask the community to consider that they use that. That they make their own choice to use a mask when necessary. Greg Hunt is asked whether, given the fact that the Netherlands is going into lockdown, there is a chance we’ll see more state-wide lockdowns in Australia. The journalist also asks whether New South Wales will be prepared to bring back its mask mandate and QR codes? Hunt says what is going on in the Netherlands is “quite different to Australia, as well as the fact they’re going into a cold European winter”: In fact, they’re already there. But they’re going into the depths of winter with a vastly higher case rate and, sadly, having had a vastly higher loss of life. So a different country, different circumstances. Sonya Bennett says that, despite Australia’s high vaccination rate, the rate of transmission for Omicron is still concerning. She urges people to wear masks while doing their Christmas shopping: It was really pleasing to see, you know, a large proportion of people still wearing masks. But probably not large enough. It’s a simple thing we can all do. In saying that, she admits that she forgot to wear her mask at the shops: I didn’t have it, but it reminded me that in the future I will certainly be taking a mask to anywhere that’s crowded, particularly around Christmas time, because it’s an effective, another effective layer of protection. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Sonya Bennett says there is “there’s still a lot of uncertainty” surrounding Omicron, “particularly with respect to how severe we think Omicron might cause disease and various opinions”: We are seeing rapid escalation of case numbers around the globe, particularly in the UK, with the UK recording over 90,000 cases yesterday. We are seeing case numbers rise here ourselves in New South Wales, particularly, with 2,500 cases, or thereabouts, yesterday as well. So, it is highly transmissible and appears to rapidly escalate with what’s called the doubling time of around two days. Which is obviously concerning. Greg Hunt adds that Australia’s first dose rate is at 93.8%; while 90.4% Australians are fully vaccinated. Federal health minister Greg Hunt is speaking from Canberra. Meanwhile, Victoria recorded 1,240 new Covid-19 cases, out of 76,033 tests. The state reported that 392 patients have been hospitalised with the virus; of these 81 active cases are in the ICU, of whom 41 require ventilation. Let’s take a closer look at those numbers coming out of NSW this morning. The state recorded 2,566 new Covid-19 cases today, the highest daily total since the pandemic began. Yesterday NSW recorded 2,482 cases, and 2,213 cases the day before. An impressive 148,937 tests were administered across the state yesterday, as residents get tested before travelling interstate for Christmas. The state also reported that 227 people are in NSW hospitals being treated for Covid-19, with 28 in intensive care. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet will announce his new cabinet today. Minister for water, property and housing Melinda Pavey said yesterday that the premier had told her she would not be continuing as a minister. The cabinet also won’t include special minister of state Don Harwin, or local government minister Shelley Hancock who, as reported yesterday, both told the premier that they will step down, and won’t contest the next election. Researchers working to improve the lives of people with chronic neurological conditions and brain cancer are among the scientists who may benefit from a $276.4m injection into medical research, AAP reports. The government says the funding, drawn from the $20bn medical research future fund, will improve health outcomes for all Australians and tackle global health challenges. The new funding rounds also include grants in maternal health and chronic respiratory conditions, as well as digital innovations in primary healthcare. The government says the funding will support projects that benefit healthcare consumers by answering research questions that are more relevant and responsive to community needs. Good morning, everyone! It’s Justine Landis-Hanley here to bring you the live blog this morning, Sunday 19 December 2021. Experts have called for state governments to reinstate some Covid-19 restrictions after Australia recorded more than 4,000 coronavirus cases yesterday, the highest national daily total yet. NSW recorded 2,482 cases, more than quadrupling its daily case tally in just five days, just days after the NSW government decided to remove almost all remaining Covid restrictions, including wearing masks in crowded retail settings. Guardian analysis also shows that Australia could take well into the next year to hit an 80% booster vaccination rate, with the rollout now ranking almost last out of 70 countries. This is because Australia’s slow initial vaccine rollouts means that more than half of all second Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered in the final four months of 2021. Guardian Australia reported yesterday that the NSW government is considering breaking with commonwealth advice by shortening the Covid vaccine booster interval to four months, amid concern about spread of the Omicron variant."

          "bodyText": "Backpackers who are being deported from Australia for submitting fake work details in visa applications arranged by a third party over email say they resorted to the scheme because there was not enough farm work for them to comply with their visa conditions. Backpackers on a working holiday visa must show they have worked for 88 days in specified occupations in regional or remote Australia, if they want to extend their stay beyond 12 months. The operator providing the visa application service, known as “Golden Fish” because of their email handle, appears to have been targeting backpackers from the UK, offering to provide false work information as part of visa applications for working holiday makers at a cost of $1,000 each. In one email exchange seen by Guardian Australia, Golden Fish said they had been operating since 2009. Golden Fish’s email address has been shared around by word of mouth for years, according to one backpacker who used the service. Once backpackers contact it, they are asked to fill out a 29-point questionnaire and to transfer $1,000 once the visa has been approved. Another email outlined what happens next. “When we lodge your application, immigration contact farm owner and check your details,” the email said. “After that, most of [the] cases would be approved but sometimes immigration request further information. We will respond upon their request so there is nothing to worry about from your end. “If anything happens we will act on [your] behalf,” Golden Fish said. It is unclear how many people used Golden Fish’s services, but Guardian Australia is aware of almost 20 set to be deported for using fake documentation. One Irish backpacker who used Golden Fish and is currently appealing his deportation said it was common practice. “This is huge, it’s everyone I know,” he said. When Australia’s international border was shut due to Covid-19, the agricultural industry complained about a shortage or workers – but some working holiday visa holders who remained in the country say they struggled to find enough work. Some said farmers were hesitant to take on travellers and held on to the workers they already knew. Cameron, who did not wish to use his real name, said the Golden Fish email was passed around in the backpacker community. “No one knows who Golden Fish is, but you contact this email asking to get help to get the 88 days over the line,” Cameron said, referring to the amount of time visa-holders are required to work in regional areas. “They upload documents and you pay them $1,000 for the service and the visa gets approved. Mine came through straight away.” Cameron travelled to Ayr, an hour south of Townsville, when the pandemic hit to complete his 88 days. But over more than four and a half months he was only able to secure 50 days of work on different farms. “I had to wait six weeks to just get my first day of employment – the season was only just starting and there were more people than jobs,” he said. Nine months later he received an email from the immigration department saying it had caught him using false documents and he would have to leave the country. Cameron is currently on a three-month bridging visa. His partner is Australian and in a last-ditch attempt to keep him in the country the pair will apply for a partnership visa. “I had every intention to do my farm work,” he said. Brisbane lawyer Ellison McMullen has worked with eight clients who used the fake visa application scheme. She said all of them tried to get farm work, but there just wasn’t enough work to fulfil their visa requirements. Facing almost instant deportation, she said the desperate backpackers used Golden Fish’s services to forge their working documents. “Every one of them made attempts but they were doing it at a time where state borders were closed,” McMullen said. “Fruit picking is seasonal and they move around the states, but they weren’t able to do that.” On top of the eight cases McMullen has worked on over the last two years, Guardian Australia is aware of nine others all in the process of being deported. Some are appealing the deportation, but others can’t afford a lawyer. Many of them have been given a three-year ban on returning to Australia. None of the appeals have been successful to date. McMullen said there had been a recent increase in deportations. “The regulations we had before, there was a discretion there. The government and case officer could decide on a point by point basis whether or not it was appropriate to forgive it. “That seems to have gone by the board. “They’re getting more and more rigid, there is less and less room for any kind of discretion.” She said there had also been an increase in people using fraudulent work experience documents who had not been able to fulfil their visa requirements. The horticulture sector has been reliant on overseas workers, with the main source of the labour force being backpackers. Under the new trade deal between Australia and the UK, British backpackers will be exempt from the requirement to work on farms – a scheme which has been riddled with claims of exploitation and sexual harassment. McMullen said the program ending was more reason to show lenience and let those at risk of deportation stay in the country. “It’s not in Australia’s interests to deport them. Of the eight people I’ve worked with, one was a teacher and seven were skilled nurses. These are in desperate need at the moment,” she said. The Department of Home Affairs was contacted by Guardian Australia but did not reply to questions asking if they were aware of Golden Fish, how long they had been operating, and how many people had used their services to obtain visas fraudulently. It said it would not comment on individual cases, but stated they had “no tolerance for visa fraud, illegal work, worker exploitation and worker underpayment of any kind”. Jay, who did not wish to use his real name, has just been given three months to leave the country. A teacher by trade, he and his girlfriend, who is a nurse, had hoped to permanently move to Sydney. “I’m more than disappointed. I’ve spent quite a lot of money, the best part of $5,000 on legal fees,” Jay, whose appeal was not granted, said. The pair, who were in Mildura, spent 10 weeks at the start of the pandemic phoning farms in the area but could only get a handful of days of work. Text messages between them and the hostel operator, who often acts as a conduit between farms and backpackers, show they had repeatedly asked for work without success. “There was definitely less work than what there had been,” Jay said. Running out of savings, they returned to Sydney so his girlfriend could take up nursing work which would count towards her 88 days. That’s when Jay emailed Golden Fish. “We’re just backpackers who tried to get work,” his girlfriend said. “So we did what we felt we needed to do at the time … so we can stay.” Golden Fish did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia."

          "headline": "NSW to add two wetlands to national parks under 33,000ha land purchase",
          "bodyText": "Two nationally significant wetlands in far north New South Wales will be added to the national parks estate as part of a 33,000ha land purchase by the state government, Guardian Australia can reveal. The property, Brindingabba-Bindra, is 150km north of Bourke in the Cuttaburra basin, and part of the Paroo and the Warrego floodplains in the Murray-Darling’s northern basin. The acquisition includes the Lake Wombah wetlands on the Queensland border, and more than 7,000ha of the Yantabulla Swamp. These wetlands are a vital breeding ground and habitat for birdlife, including black swans, pink-eared ducks, herons and Australia’s rarest waterfowl, the freckled duck. The wetlands are estimated to host some 70,000 waterbirds, as well as an array of small native mammals and insects. NSW National Parks have also confirmed that the property is home to a rare and endangered marsupial, the kultarr – a small sandy coloured mouse-like mammal with a white belly. Other threatened species include the grey-crowned babbler, the hooded robin and the brolga. The area is traditional country for the Budjiti and Barkandji people, and the property is believed to contain extensive evidence of cultural artefacts and other items of significance. “With this acquisition, 597,000 hectares have now been reserved or acquired for reservation since March 2019 –an increase of 8.3% to our national parks estate,” the NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, said. The acquisition is the latest in a series of land purchases since 2019, which brought to an end the long hiatus in national parks estate acquisition since the Coalition took power in NSW more than a decade ago. Since 2019, the NSW government has added almost 600,000ha of land to its conservation estate, nearly tripling its initial target of 200,000ha by 2022, and bringing the state closer to its historical average of approximately one million hectares a decade. The acquisition has been met with enthusiasm by environmental scientists. Prof Richard Kingsford, river ecologist and conservation biologist at the University of NSW, said the wetlands in the area were “magnificent”. “This is part of the Murray-Darling that’s in really good health and that’s largely because there’s no river development upstream, and Queensland and NSW have agreed to keep that a free-flowing river,” Kingsford said. “It’s a really great example of prevention being better than cure in terms of conservation.” Kingsford said he had been surprised by the government’s increased national parks estate acquisitions, but said it was good to see the program targeting areas that have not been traditionally well-represented, such as arid and semi-arid zones. Wetlands are vital habitat for threatened and endangered species and, because many of the more remote locations haven’t been intensively studied, there will likely be “surprises in terms of biodiversity” at the new sites, Kingsford said. “It’s always one of the challenging things with conservation, to add to the protected area estate, but it’s one of the most important ways of carrying out conservation,” Kingsford said. Guardian Australia has previously reported concerns that the state’s national parks service would require significantly more resourcing to manage the increased estate properly."

          "bodyText": "Be it the crest of an icy mountain peak, the depths of the dense native bush, or the slopes of sleeping volcanoes, New Zealand’s wild and remote landscapes are coveted by outdoor enthusiasts the world over. But what really sets the country’s nature apart from the rest is what is at one’s disposal when nature calls – spectacular loos with views. These scenic spots – small, remote, and lacking in plumbing – are a curious quirk in New Zealand’s landscape, and offer up some of the best panoramas in the country. “It’s pretty funny when you get to the end of an amazing track, you get to a hut, and it’s just absolutely stunning, and that view is not lost from the long-drop,” keen tramper and photographer Julie Gursha says. Originally from Portland, Oregon, Gursha moved to New Zealand just prior to the pandemic. She has hiked all over the world but says New Zealand’s loos with views stand out. “There are 360 degree views in a lot of places in the States, but I have been backpacking there with my tent. Having the option to be in a hut that comes with a nice loo, that is definitely unique to New Zealand and pretty special,” she laughs. Her personal favourite is at the Cameron Hut in the Hakatere Conservation Park, near Ashburton in the South Island. “That one is just a little more off the beaten path – it’s a really special one.” The department of conservation is responsible for the extensive network of landscape latrines and holds the unusual gong of “managing more toilets than any other organisation in New Zealand”. “The department of conservation manages 2,200 toilet buildings, with about 3,500 toilet pans … many of these sit in stunning locations,” says Steve Taylor, its heritage and visitors director. The department has been appealing to trampers to please “poo in the loos”, saying while most do take the opportunity to relieve themselves in the toilets provided, others sometimes use the walking tracks. Last year, the department reprimanded New Zealanders for not respecting their back yard, as closed borders ramped up domestic tourism. “If it’s done in nature, it can be unsightly, smelly and unhealthy,” a 2019 campaign video states. Taylor said: “There aren’t many toilets in our wild places. Remember to always go before you start your trip and if you’re heading out for a longer walk, be properly prepared and use a loo when you can.” Many of the impressive long-drops are linked to some of the 970 huts dotted through the more remote and striking parts of the country, and require helicopters to fly the waste out. The department says it is looking at ways of reducing helicopter flying to reduce cost and carbon emissions. In some places where the climate is suitable, roughly 100 composting toilets are used, though these are based at more accessible campsites. The oldest toilet is believed to be a 90-year-old pit toilet at an old farm homestead now managed by the department as part of Rakiura national park called “Island Hill Run” on Rakiura/Stewart Island. The toilet with the most impressive altitude is at Empress Hut, 2,500m up New Zealand’s highest mountain, Aoraki/Mt Cook in the Southern Alps."

          "headline": "Deserted stores, less choice … has shopping changed for ever?",
          "bodyText": "After nearly two years of disruption, Covid-19 has changed how we shop for ever. It has altered not only what we buy, but how we buy it. Big purchases involve clicks, not shopping trips, and remote working has turned the home interiors market into the new fast fashion. It has also signalled the end of overwhelming choice for consumers, analysts say, as gaps on shelves and long delivery times for items such as cars and sofas become a frustrating fact of life. Lifestyle changes due to health or environmental concerns are also helping new services get off the ground. Investors are pouring billions into rapid grocery delivery, while buying secondhand clothes and renting furniture is entering the mainstream. On high streets, cheaper rents are starting to attract independent stores. Here is a look at some of the big changes taking place. Grocery shopping The pandemic has caused major upheaval in the UK’s £212bn grocery industry. The return of the weekly shop during the strictest periods of lockdown looked as though it had saved the big supermarkets from a midlife crisis, only for an army of rapid grocery delivery firms, such as Getir, Gorillas and Jiffy, to emerge with the promise of delivering your groceries in less than half an hour. The IGD, the trade body for the food and consumer goods industry, says this so-called quick commerce has “exploded” on to the scene and is now a “channel in its own right”. It estimates 13% of UK shoppers now use these services, with sales hitting £1.4bn this year and on track to double within five. Bryan Roberts, an analyst at Shopfloor Insights, says the health crisis has created the kind of market conditions where people are “willing to pay a delivery fee for a 20-quid, 15-minute, delivery experience”, although he adds: “Time will tell if these models are going to be sustainable.” The expanded online services offered by the big chains have also won millions of new customers during the pandemic, but with inflation running at a 10-year high, the sands are shifting again, with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl the likely winners in the coming months as Britons seek out cheaper stores. There may be more ways to shop these days, but the supply chain problems in the background have prompted the major grocery brands to take a leaf out the discounters’ book and reduce their ranges to become more efficient. Richard Wilding, professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield School of Management, says that the “abundance of choice we’ve had is going to change”. “You used to be able to buy 60 different types of pasta in the supermarket: then, during the pandemic, manufacturers started rationalising their ranges so all of a sudden you could only get 20 types,” he says. “Having new and interesting products has traditionally been a way of creating consumer demand, but companies are basically saying ‘we’ve got to focus on the higher-margin things’.” Working from home The shift to home working has had such a profound impact on how we live that it has become a retail super-trend in its own right. It has altered spending priorities, as money usually spent on foreign holidays or commuting is ploughed into home furnishings and revamps. Being home 24/7 has also resulted in an acceleration of the shift to online shopping. It took eight years for online sales to double their share of spending to 20%, but within just nine months during the pandemic, that figure touched 36% last year. This year’s easing of restrictions saw it fall back to a still substantial 26%. “Working from home has changed both the pattern of shopping and the pattern of demand,” says Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst. “The shape of markets like fashion, food, beauty and homewares have changed, but the question is: have they alighted on a new, permanent position? It’s still very fluid because no one knows what proportion of people are going to continue working from home.” The profile of consumer spending has changed dramatically: for example, shoppers have spent an extra £503m in DIY stores this year, according to figures from retail data firm Kantar. Britons also took up new pastimes: 1.2 million new gardeners spent an extra £51m on plants and related paraphernalia. “Not everybody’s job is home-based but generally the way we are socialising and shopping is much more centred around the home,” says Joanna Parman at Kantar. “We are travelling less far at the weekend for shopping trips or to eat out. So we’re much more likely to be visiting local or independent stores than before.” She adds: “Lots of people are divested in how they look and invested in how their home looks so it is Instagrammable and is looking nice in the background when you’re on your phone or video call. They are investing a lot more in their homes and you could argue we are seeing some ‘fast homewares’ trends coming through.” Fashion Britons have swapped style for comfort during the pandemic: witness the 88% increase in loungewear sales last year. The closure of high street stores for long periods forced shoppers to buy the clothes they needed online and there may be no going back. The data firm Retail Economics estimates that half of the £51bn spent on clothing this year will have been bought on websites. Come 2025 it thinks that figure will be two-thirds of the total. This is already the case for electricals, which has been one of the fastest markets to move online. “What’s clear from the pandemic is that we as a nation have been able to adapt and shift our behaviours, sometimes overnight,” says Parman. “There’s not a lot of policy saying we shouldn’t socialise but people have already stepped back from eating out. We drive a lot of the change in our habits and the longer they are in place, the more likely they are to stick.” There are other big forces at work in this market too. The fashion industry is a big polluter and under growing pressure to get itself on a more sustainable footing, so more companies are experimenting with selling secondhand clothes or even renting them out, a model that has previously focused on outfits for special occasions. The UK’s biggest clothing retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer, is running a small trial to test demand for renting its dresses and coats – a trend that is more advanced in furniture, where the likes of John Lewis are renting out sofas, sideboards and desks. As always, fashion-conscious teens got there first and are already spending their cash on secondhand clothes sites such as Depop and Vinted, which are reporting big sales increases. Parman thinks the clothing rental market is a “trickier” model but predicts the pre-loved fashion market will take off even more in 2022. Cars The secondhand boom has already arrived in the car market, where soaring used car prices, up 31% since April, are stoking inflation. Usually about 2.5 million new cars a year are registered in the UK but that number sank to 1.6 million in 2020 with a similar figure expected this year as a shortage of computer chips hits production. This shortfall is one of the factors pushing up secondhand prices. Ian Plummer, commercial director of the Auto Trader marketplace, says Covid has forced a reluctant industry to embrace the web. Buyers want to be able to do more of the legwork online, from getting a valuation for their current car to applying for finance. However, given the cost involved – in expenditure terms, a car is second only to a home for the average household – “seeing, touching, smelling” your chosen vehicle remains an important final step. There has been some upside to the tumult, with the most recent figures showing a doubling of sales of electric vehicles. Almost 22,000 pure electric vehicles were registered in November, more than double the figure in the same month of 2020. “A new electric vehicle launched every 10 days in the course of 2021 and there are even more cars coming next year,” says Plummer. “It’s a big shift in the market: more supply, more marketing, creating more excitement, which has been spurred on by the fuel crisis.” Stores The rapid spread of the Omicron variant has been devastating news for store-based retailers as shopper numbers tail off on what are among the most important trading days of the year in the run-up to Christmas. With the Covid crisis seemingly far from over, the jury remains out on what the long-term consequences will be for the high street. The stream of household names that failed pre-Covid was accelerated by the lockdowns. Recent British Retail Consortium data shows the number of empty stores sitting at a record high of 14.5%. The crisis has pulled down rents but eye-watering business rates remain a big problem that the government seems reluctant to deal with. There are glimmers of hope, though, with the same data pointing to a declining vacancy rate in some regions, as independents move in to fill the spaces left by defunct chain stores. But there is, without question, more painful change to come. Hyman points to the £90bn of non-food sales that have moved online over the past 20 years, a period when there has been no “meaningful” reduction in store space. “The cost of selling something in a shop is now much more expensive because you’ve got a high fixed cost base and lower sales,” he says. “When all this is over, we are still going to have too many shops and too many websites.”"

          "headline": "Millions of daffodils ‘will rot’ if Brexit denies UK farmers foreign workers",
          "bodyText": "Millions of daffodil stems will be left to rot in the fields this spring, as growers face a critical labour shortage that they fear could spell the end of the entire industry. “If we can’t recruit more pickers, there won’t be a daffodil industry left. The situation is very grim,” said James Hosking, of Fentongollan Farm, near Truro in Cornwall. Some growers expect up to 75% of their crop will be left unpicked this spring due to a lack of workers. Many smaller growers are planning to give up daffodil growing entirely, with attempts to recruit locals failing to bring enough people to the fields. Cornwall’s mild climate and light intensity make it the heart of the UK’s £100m industry, with around 80% of the world’s daffodils grown in the duchy. Harvesting begins in the first week of January and a workforce of around 2,500 people is needed to pick over a billion stems. Over the past couple of decades, growers have relied on eastern European labour to do the back-breaking work of picking each daffodil by hand in all weathers. The end of free movement following Brexit and Covid restrictions, however, made the 2021 spring season one of the toughest ever for recruiting workers. Around 275 million stems were left in the ground. This coming season looks set to be even more challenging. “If only 50% is picked this spring, the following spring you’re looking at 25% of that. And that means you’re out of business,” said Hosking, who is the fourth generation of his family to grow daffodils at Fentongollan. “There’ll be no alternative but to stop growing daffodils. That’s the end of an industry the UK leads the world in. “Daffodils are a symbol of spring – they bring people cheer and hope when the days are still gloomy. There won’t be as many in the supermarkets this spring if nothing changes. You can’t import daffodils from anywhere else – Cornwall is the only place that can grow them at this time of year. But if you can’t harvest your crop, you haven’t got a business. Full stop.” Hosking and the owners of Varfell Farms in Penzance, one of the largest growers in the country, say they have tried to recruit locals but with very limited success. Varfell recently held an open day at the farm that was widely publicised on local social media groups and newspapers. Only four people turned up. Hosking also struggles to employ locals. “We always have three or four local pickers, but we need 60. At the moment I have about 20 mostly people who return to us every year and who already have settled status to be in the UK,” he said. The best pickers can earn up to £30 an hour and the average wage at Varfell last spring was £14 an hour. But outdoor working in all weathers is not proving attractive. Many farms are also remote, needing its workers to live on site. “These are seasonal jobs that cannot be mechanised and are not attractive to the local labour force,” Alex Newey, owner of Varfell Farms, said. He is expecting to pick only a quarter of this coming season’s crop due to a lack of pickers. The government has promised to extend a visa scheme allowing farmers to bring in seasonal workers from overseas. At the moment it only applies to fruit and vegetables, with non-edible crops excluded. Kevin Foster MP, the immigration minister, however, last week told MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee that non-edible crops will be added to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (Saws). But with just two weeks to go until picking is due to start and no formal announcement, growers say they need to start recruiting now if they are to save this year’s harvest. “If, next week, the government announces a visa scheme that includes ornamental crops, we could potentially get up to speed with recruitment by early February. At least then the industry has a future,” said Newey. “We’re hopeful it will happen, but it has to happen soon.” “We’ve heard promises from the government before,” said Hosking. “We’re still waiting.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was contacted for a comment but did not respond."

          "bodyText": "Sandy beaches and a lively buzz, Sicily I spent September travelling around Sicily alone, mostly on foot, and I wanted to flop on a beach before going home. I settled on Cefalù on the north coast, because of its rare combination of sandy beach and medieval town – and it was love at first sight. I had heard that the tiny town gets unpleasantly packed in summer, but by late September there was just a lively buzz. Cefalù seemed a distillation of everywhere else I had been: Sicily in miniature. I gazed up at the mosaic-bright Christ Pantocrator in the twin-towered Arab-Norman cathedral. I came face to face with Antonello da Messina’s enigmatic Portrait of an Unknown Man, a masterpiece in the unassuming (and empty) Museo Mandralisca. I climbed La Rocca, a huge crag that looms over the town, to a fourth- or fifth-century temple and ruined castle. I pottered around the cobbled streets, popping into ceramic shops and a gelateria; joined the passeggiata along the seafront at sunset; and idled in piazzas drinking Campari spritz and eating pasta con le sarde. In fact, it wasn’t until the last afternoon that I finally found time to laze on the beach. Rachel Dixon Bay-hopping in Croatia Looking like a huge misshapen claw, Telašćica nature park dangles from the southern end of the Croatian island of Dugi Otok, near the islands of Kornati national park. But while the Kornatis are scrubby barren dots of sheep-covered land, most of Telašćica is lusciously green – all the better to show off its contrast with the vivid blue of the Adriatic. Within this strange claw are 25 bays and six islets surrounded by olive groves, vineyards and forested hills heavy with the scent of pine. I followed a road up to a viewpoint in an old Habsburg fort, from which I could see glistening pools of the Adriatic flowing between green mounds, and moored sailing boats. Nearby is Mir, a saltwater lake skirted by limestone cliffs. It’s a popular swimming spot for day-trippers from Zadar, so I headed instead to Jaz bay for a swim off the pebbly shore. Here I found the peace that was lacking in Mir, which, ironically, translates as peace. Luckily, here at Telašćica, there’s plenty of that to go round. Mary Novakovich Rousseau’s romantic retreat When an unexpected cold snap descended on Lac Annecy and forced us off the pedalo, we headed into nearby Chambery for a hot chocolate – and discovered the signs for Les Charmettes, the museum and former home of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. A teenage Rousseau met Madame de Warens, 13 years his senior, in 1728. He called her “maman” and they moved into Les Charmettes farmhouse together in 1736. With no guards or velvet ropes, visitors are free to wander around Rousseau’s bedroom and Madame’s more romantic quarters (with hand-painted wallpaper). Downstairs, there’s a clavichord, a chaise longue and a table set for lunch à deux. Rousseau wrote that in the five years he spent there, he “enjoyed a century of life and total and complete happiness.” He passed the time devising a numerical form of music notation, hiking in the Chartreuse mountains and advancing his philosophical “storehouse of ideas”. The gardens include rare vines, beehives and an orchard with views that have barely changed since Rousseau gazed across the valley. His philosophy influenced the French Revolution and Charmettes became a place of pilgrimage after his death. Jon Bryant The world’s longest wooden staircase, Norway Spending my summers growing up in Glencoe means I’m constantly carrying the emotional impact of its serene mountains and lochs at the back of my mind. Which is to say that when I’m travelling I’m always assessing nature’s most awe-inspiring sights in comparison, even if that often ends in disappointment. So the first thing that struck me while climbing to the top of the world’s longest wooden staircase, all 4,444 steep steps above the roadless village of Flørli in south-west Norway, was how empty it was. Barring a handful of hikers from Stavanger behind me, I was alone and that was slightly unnerving, if thrillingly welcome in late summer. It was almost unreal. The second thing I’ll never forget was the heart-in-mouth panorama at the top. From the Ternevass dam, the deep-blue Lysefjord and the mammoth cliffs of Preikestolen across its sun-brushed surface jostled for my attention. The landscape was naked and almost Caledonian, and yet it was a Norwegian wilderness to dream on. So, in a salute to my temporary hosts, I indulged in friluftsliv, the Nordic idea of open-air living and outdoor adventure, and came back for more the next day. Mike MacEacheran Wine from Flanders? I nearly spilt my beer French people tend to give you a strange look when you talk about wine from Belgium, a country more readily associated with beer, mussels and frites. But my eyes were opened during a vineyard and foodie tour of the bucolic corner of west Flanders known as Heuvelland, the Hilly Land, not far from the sombre war memorials of Ypres. It is a surprise to discover these hills covered with vines and young, dynamic vignerons opening their cellars for tastings of wines whose quality really impresses visitors. Martin Bacquaert makes some outstanding sparkling vintages at Entre-deux-Monts, following the classic méthode traditionelle made famous by champagne makers. Over at Monteberg, wine lovers can sit out at a panoramic terrace, feasting on cheese, charcuterie and fruit from an organic farm while sipping bubbly, a fruity red or trying artisanal gin. Heuvelland’s tourism office excels at recommending visits. A romantic spot to stay is B&amp;B De Rentmeesterhoeve, an ancient manor house surrounded by a moat and gardens. John Brunton Rambling to Portugal’s mountain villages My visit to Peneda-Gerês, Portugal’s only national park, had been a long time coming, Covid-postponed from spring 2020. But finally, in late August, I found myself rambling around its granite massifs, along shepherd tracks and pilgrim trails – and into Soajo. This little mountain village is one of Peneda-Geres’s most traditional, with tight-knit alleys, an ancient pillory (carved, usually, with a smiley face) and an abundance of espigueiros, the region’s typical stilted, stone granaries. I stayed at Casa do Eiró, an old house by the main square. It has been in owner Rosa Rocha’s family for generations; her photos and knick-knacks are still scattered inside. Each morning Rosa brought a breakfast basket, with fresh bread from Soajo’s bakery and peaches from her garden. In the evenings I ate at restaurant Saber ao Borralho where Rosa – also owner-chef here – cooked up huge portions of carne de cachena (local beef) and fig cheesecake. Sarah Baxter Mosques, minarets and moreish food, Istanbul “As I was going to Üsküdar,” sang Eartha Kitt in the 1950s in her fabulous rendition of the Turkish song Kâtibim. Üsküdar, a neighbourhood on the Asian side of Istanbul, had somehow passed me by … but now I had Eartha’s voice in my head as I boarded the ferry for the short scenic trip from Karaköy on the European side. Two things drew me there: a particular lokanta (restaurant) and a famous waterside mosque. The chestnut pilav and dolma at Kanaat Lokantası, set up by the Kargılı family in 1933, was as good as I’d been told by friends, the setting distinctly old fashioned, the food moreish and rich. Then a five-minute walk back towards the ferry dock took me to Mihrimah Sultan mosque), built in 1548 for the daughter of Süleyman the Magnificent. Strikingly beautiful with its slender minarets and stained-glass windows, it is but one of Üsküdar’s many historic mosques, giving reason to return. Caroline Eden The ‘improbably pretty’ Welsh Marches It was while reading Jan Morris’s book, Wales: Epic Views of a Small Country, during lockdown that it dawned on me how little of this “damp, demanding and obsessively interesting country” I had visited. Previous trips had traced the usual tourist routes from Cardiff’s Millennium stadium and the beaches of Pembrokeshire to Snowdonia. My post-lockdown resolution was to explore a part of the country that often gets bypassed – the drive-through borderlands of mid-Wales. The first surprise was that we arrived in the middle of a heatwave. The second came when we climbed up to the ruins of the Norman castle in Montgomery and took in the view. It was expansive, filmic even: an improbably pretty scene with the church tower of the little town in the foreground, and the green pastures of Powys and Shropshire running out to Corndon Hill in the distance. Another line from Morris came back to me: “To look at, the nature of Wales is deceptive. Within its small expanse the style of terrain changes so often, the mountainous countryside is so constantly corrugated, this way and that … the scene in short is so cunningly variegated.” Andy Pietrasik A navy lark in Puglia, Italy The port city of Brindisi has never bothered much with tourists. In its 2,600 years of history, the doings of soldiers, seafarers and traders in its huge natural harbour were far more important. While in the past decade it has added a smart seafront promenade lined with restaurants, bars and gelaterias, its old town, with all the windy stone streets and churches you’d expect, still sees little in the way of crowds. The archaeological museum next to the cathedral is even free to enter. Its collection of ancient Greek vases and lovely Roman mosaics rivals those in Naples and Sicily, yet we had it to ourselves on a sunny autumn afternoon. The imposing 13th-century castle is not open to the public because – imagine! – it’s still in military use, a base for the Italian marines. There’s plenty of civic life too: Brindisi bursts on to the streets for the early-evening passeggiata, particularly along palm-lined Corso Giuseppe Garibaldi (the 4Erre bar, on the corner of Vicolo Sacramento, does a very generous Aperol spritz). Below the castle, Antica Osteria La Sciabica served us fishy starters and pillowy pizzas on a waterside terrace overlooking moored trawlers – and a big grey gunship. Liz Boulter Glamping and milking cows in Romania I heard about Dobraia – a new glampsite high in the wild Cerna mountains – thanks to Romania Private Tours. The remote camp inside the Domogled-Valea-Cernei national park, in Romania’s little-visited Banat region, is not easy to reach: it’s a seven-hour drive from Bucharest, and then a steep two-hour hike (a rough track reaches the spot, but you need an off-road vehicle). Yet it’s worth every step when you finally see four white bell tents (each costing about £35 a night) gazing at limitless mountains. All meals are homecooked by the self-sufficient owners, the Raduta family – every ingredient is organically grown or produced by them. I went in August with my husband and two young children, who loved helping bring the cows home from foraging in the forests, then milking them by hand; and we swayed in hammocks under plum trees, picnicked in orchards and walked to isolated hamlets strung among the peaks. It’s so bucolic I half expected the Greek god Pan to appear with his flute. Kate Eshelby The best of the Pennine Way Some of the Pennine Way can be miserable. Days are spent trudging across desolate moors. Even when it’s dry, secret bogs lie beneath, hungry for tired legs. Cottongrass is the only thing able to stomach the acid below and gloom above. But there’s ancient majesty in those 268 miles. West of Middleton in Teesdale, the path runs along the river and the shrubs thicken with juniper, a relic of the end of the ice age. Soon, the water gathers pace and becomes High Force, a 22-metre waterfall that plunges over a shelf of dolerite formed 295 million years ago. Two hours west and the skies widen as the river yawns around Cronkley Scar. The grass flows in the breeze, tickling the tummies of the Belted Galloways from Widdybank Farm. Above, curlews and lapwings soar with delight. When I was there, the sun perched above Cauldron Snout. It seemed to wait for hours, as if loath to turn its back on the beauty below. James Gingell The only way is Essex churches It began, like all the best travel discoveries, by chance. I was in Brightlingsea on the Essex coast when someone recommended All Saints Church. There I discovered a dado trail of 211 large square tiles girdling the interior, each recalling a local sailor lost at sea. Starting in 1872 with a father and son drowned off Hartlepool, it continues through terrible winters, giving a few details: Samuel Bridges, for example, was “washed overboard from the Mary Anne of Aberystwith 15 miles north of Bishop Light”. There was even a local man on the Titanic: steward Sidney Siebert, who leaped overboard but died in the lifeboat. Essex churches repay your dedication. Too many are locked, or open rarely, but be persistent: St Clements in West Thurrock, is a flinty-faced 12th-century chapel overshadowed by a soap factory , a visual oxymoron and magnet for film scouts (remember the funeral part of Four Weddings?). Walk down the Thames from Purfleet station past a feast of graffiti art and industrial architecture. Kevin Rushby Going Gothic on Germany’s Baltic coast Flanked by the Baltic Sea with its lively harbour dipping into the Ryck River, I spent two days in the Western Pomeranian city of Greifswald during a blisteringly cold October break. It was the first time I had visited the beautiful Hanseatic city, 50 miles from the Polish border. Around every corner was yet another magnificent piece of architecture with an equally impressive history – from its St Nikolai cathedral, peeping above its central square, to the former Cistercian monastery, Eldena Abbey, on the outskirts. Stood in the centre of its marktplatz you are cocooned within renovated Gothic-style buildings in shades of crimson, sunshine yellow and dusky pinks. These buildings were immortalised in the paintings of its most famous son, the Romantic period artist Caspar David Friedrich. There is an exceptionally lively bar scene due to the city’s 15th-century university and a chance to go on a boat trip to the nearby charming town of Wieck with its traditional salted fish restaurants. Nazia Parveen Surprising safaris on the Isle of Wight Funnelling into the thick canopy of trees at dusk, I felt as though someone suddenly turned out the lights. “Can you see anything?” I whispered to my guide Dave Fairlamb, as my eyes strained, hoping to make out the shape of an elusive and endangered creature. “Not yet,” he replied as we continued to feel our way along the footpath on our nocturnal safari. When it comes to observing and photographing wildlife in its natural habitat – particularly in Britain – my brain automatically wanders north, picturing deer and pine marten in Scotland’s Cairngorms, seal pups on the Isle of Mull, or puffins on the cliffs of Northumberland’s Farne Islands. Yet 2021 was the year I discovered that we have a really wild isle further south – the Isle of Wight. I visited this summer to spy sea eagles at Brading Marsh, red squirrels in Borthwood Copse, wall lizards at Ventnor, stingray at Thorness Bay and, guided only by the light from the moon, elusive dormice in Alverstone. And though some of my safari was spent in the dark, I felt like a light had been shone on the wilder side of this Victorian beachside favourite. Phoebe Smith A monster trip to Loch Ness While there are beautiful parks near us, we do live in the middle of a concrete jungle in east London and I often dream of being in the wilderness. So, in October, in celebration of our third wedding anniversary, we got on a train to Inverness. The eight-hour train journey was one of my favourite parts of the holiday. I loved seeing the distance I was putting between myself and the place I had felt so stuck in for so long and finally having the time to read. We spent a few days driving across different areas of the Highlands, from Loch Ness to the Isle of Skye. In Inverness, I loved visiting Leakey’s secondhand bookshop, and the Culloden Battlefield. The boat ride in Loch Ness is unmissable – even on a rainy October day – as is the wonderful walk we went on in Kinloch Forest and the castle, Eilean Donan. I particularly loved how small I felt driving around the North Coast 500 route. It was an important reminder that after more than a year of feeling my world close inwards, there are so many things much bigger than me. Aamna Mohdin Pigs trotters with prawns in the Pyrenees With Spain under partial lockdown for much of the year, and inter-regional travel off the cards, living here I found it a great relief to have the varied landscapes of Catalonia close to hand: its ragged coastline of long, sandy beaches and hidden bays; the rice paddies of the delta to the south; the crystal-clear mountain lakes and fragrant pine forests to the north. Up here near the border with France, on the roads that wind through the foothills of the Pyrenees, is where you’re most likely to stumble across one of Catalonia’s greatest charms – the random apparition of the sort of restaurant city-dwellers can only dream of. Thick stone walls, garden tables dappled with shade, and a blackboard trumpeting the sticky chargrilled soul food that should always round off a day’s hiking. And so it was with Restaurant Girul, just outside the village of Meranges. Oxtail stew, pigs’ trotters with prawn, and doormat-sized T-bone steaks share the billing with trinxat (a Catalan take on bubble and squeak) and a tray of snails just as they should be: not bland, not rubbery, just the right amount of garlic. Three courses and a bottle of decent local red brought the bill for two to €70. Sally Davies Following Hippocrates into Greece’s therapeutic springs As someone who starts shivering as soon as the mercury sinks below 15C, I’m a firm fan of Greece’s hot springs, which surge out of the ground at blood-warming temperatures. Said to cure everything from eczema to arthritis, they’ve been popular since antiquity: celebrated physician Hippocrates was convinced of the therapeutic properties of thermal water and fifth-century BC historian Herodotus was also a huge fan of balneotherapy, appropriately enough in a country where legend has it that baby Achilles became (almost) invincible after his mother dipped him in the Styx’s spring-fed waters. I discovered the hot spring lake of Vouliagmeni while exploring the Athenian riviera, 30 miles of beach- and tavern-fringed coastline stretching from the chic suburbs of Palaio Faliro to Poseidon’s temple at Cape Sounion. Surrounded by pine forests, the lake is actually a sunken cave fed by thermal springs that bubble up at about 21C. Wallowing in the (slightly stinky) sulphur-rich waters where Greeks have bathed away their aches and pains for 2,500 years was a legendary experience. A day pass is €15-18 and under-fives go free. Heidi Fuller-Love The Clarion call of Britain’s last socialist refuge I came across Clarion House by chance, driving home from Roughlee, in Lancashire. There, by the roadside, was a pretty, single-storey red-and-white building, with a simple trumpet for its logo. It was built in 1912 for mill and factory workers who came up into the countryside around Pendle Hill to escape the grime and noise of increasingly congested towns such as Colne and Brierfield. Inside are posters from the Spanish civil war, a beautiful piece of stained glass and a banner emblazoned with “Workers of the world unite”. Soft sunlight streams in through the windows. Long benches are laid out for chatting over a cup of tea and the Communist Manifesto. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Clarion Houses popped up in several rural areas – many linked to cycling clubs – including Halewood in Merseyside and Sheldon in Birmingham. Sadly, the Clarion House I “discovered” in 2021 is the only one still standing. In my dream future, there are Clarion Houses dotted all over the regreened, rewilded UK, serving as waystations and watering holes on “slow ways” that join up all our hamlets and villages, towns and cities. That’s my clarion call for today. Chris Moss Drinking in the atmosphere of Valletta’s back streets Like most of my favourite places around the world, this one was uncovered by accident. Dropped off at the wrong address down a backstreet in the Maltese capital, I scanned the warm limestone walls, balconied and shuttered, and wondered which housed our restaurant. Early for our seating, we climbed a set of steps expecting an empty alley and looked up at what appeared to be a makeshift restaurant cascading towards us. Tables and bright wooden chairs wobbled on the slabs, couples sipped cocktails and shared deep-fried duck rolls and steaming pizza. Waiting staff appeared from wooden shutters in the walls and strings of golden bulbs zigzagged from one side of the street to another. Warm, inviting, quiet enough to chat, noisy enough to blend in, Saint Lucia Street was the perfect spot for a pre-dinner drink, bare shoulders and flip-flopped feet still warm in the salty coastal air. Monisha Rajesh Riverside hike near Belfast In May, I spent a week exploring the wild green spaces around Belfast: the basalt cliffs of Cave Hill, heather-covered Black Mountain, the glens of Antrim and the wooded beaches of North Down. One revelation for me, even in the rain, was the popular 11-mile towpath beside the River Lagan to the neighbouring city of Lisburn, with trains back to Belfast. Walking upstream from the ceramic big fish sculpture, celebrating the river’s 1999 regeneration, I detoured through the clematis-covered arches and 1840s palm house of Belfast’s Botanic Garden. Cows were grazing the flowery Lagan meadows, two miles further on, and a lock-keeper’s cottage stood under pink-and-white apple blossom. My favourite stretch was Minnowburn with its mossy waterside beeches, winding waterways, and van selling tea and cake. There were clouds of cow parsley, clumps of yellow kingcups, herons in the willows, and a swan nesting right by the path. Phoebe Taplin The industrial landscapes of Luxembourg It was an interest in migrants from Cape Verde that took me to the south of Luxembourg. Most visitors to the Grand Duchy make first for the capital and then, if they go anywhere else at all, venture into the hilly Ardennes region in the north. But the former industrial landscapes that nudge up towards the French border are real hidden Europe territory. This southern fringe of Luxembourg is wou dat roud Gold gegruewe gou – Luxembourgish for “where the red gold was dug”. The red gold was iron ore. The foundries and smelters in the Alzette Valley are long gone, and the region around Esch is now the hub of one of Europe’s most-ambitious programmes of regeneration and urban renewal. There’s real visual drama in these erstwhile industrial areas and I fancy we’ll be hearing a lot more about this region in 2022 as Esch-sur-Alzette steps into the limelight as a European Capital of Culture.

          "bodyText": "This is where we’ll leave our live coverage today. Here’s a quick recap of what happened: Australia has recorded more than 4,000 coronavirus cases in one day for the first time ever. New South Wales and South Australia both recorded their highest daily totals since the pandemic began. A new Covid case was reported in Tasmania, bringing the tally to four since the state reopened this week. Queensland, which also reopened its borders this week, recorded 31 new cases. Prime minister Scott Morrison and his wife Jenny paid their respects to five children who died in a tragic jumping castle incident in Tasmania. He also announced an $800,000 support package to fund counselling for those affected by the tragedy. Tasmania has banned the use of jumping castles in schools in response to the incident. The New South Wales government is pushing to narrow the gap between people getting their second Covid-19 vaccination shot and getting their booster to four months in response to the Omicron variant. And a senior public health expert has criticised the NSW government’s decision to remove mask mandates despite the huge spike in cases, saying that unless Australia is “a country of total whiny babies” people can continue to wear a mask with no discernible impact on their lives. And that’s the day. If you are heading out to see family or buy gifts for family, please stay safe. We’ll see you again tomorrow. In feral pig news: the Australian and South Australian governments have pledged $1.2m to fund pig culling efforts on Kangaroo Island for the next two years. More from AAP: Before the devastating 2020 bushfires, which scorched the western half of the island, the feral pig population was thought to number about 5000. But the fires killed off many and destroyed much of their habitat, presenting an opportunity to eradicate the animals completely. Efforts over the past winter involved about 220 hours of flight time using thermal imaging, during which 243 feral pigs were culled, taking the total since the start of the program to 777. Only about 200 pigs are thought to remain. Eradication efforts have been funded jointly by the state and federal governments, with another $1.2 million allocated to continue the work into 2022 and 2023. Environment minister David Speirs said the community on the island, including primary producers and tourism operators, were supportive of the eradication program. “We know how damaging feral pigs on Kangaroo Island are for our livestock and horticulture industries as well as the environment, which is why we are doing everything we can to eradicate this pest,” he said. Here’s more from my chat with public health expert Prof Nancy Baxter: Australia has recorded more than 4,000 cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, the highest daily tally since the pandemic began. It comes just two days after passing the benchmark of more than 3,000 cases in a day. There are currently almost 247,000 active cases in Australia, although only 110 people are in intensive care. The cases were reported in: NSW: 2,482 Victoria: 1,504 South Australia: 73 Queensland: 31 Tasmania: 1 Western Australia has not reported any new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. This is not surprising — it’s still not letting anyone in. The hard border rules changed again overnight, with NSW upgraded from a high risk category – only permitted people allowed in subject to a negative PCR test, being vaccinated, and 14 days of hotel quarantine – to extreme risk – pretty much no one allowed in except for MPs and necessary government officials. As of Monday, the border will also be tightened against Queensland, which will go from low risk to medium risk, and Tasmania, which will go from very low risk to low risk. That means no travellers from any jurisdiction in Australia will be able to enter WA without quarantining. But, as WA premier Mark McGowan said in a comment that surely doesn’t even track well in Perth after almost two years of isolation, Santa Claus will be allowed in. You may have missed the story about security vulnerabilities in widely used software Log4j – you can read about it here. Now you’re up to speed: it’s affecting kindergartens. More from AAP: The ramifications of recently discovered security flaws in a commonly used piece of software known as Log4j are so widespread, even kindergarten teachers are being warned of the risks. The Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution is used in everything from webcams to navigation apps, but contains a critical flaw which could give cyber criminals password-free access online systems, allowing them to access data and even plant malware. A week ago the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) issued an alert about Apache Log4j, and on Wednesday it publicly confirmed the vulnerability is being actively exploited in Australia. “We know that malicious online actors are scanning networks in attempts to locate vulnerable servers, so it’s critical that Australian organisations act, and act fast,” Assistant Defence Minister Andrew Hastie said. The vulnerability has sent companies and other organisations scrambling to install patches to protect against malicious intrusions into their IT. Victoria’s education department even had to warn kindergartens and childcare centres, telling them late on Friday to be on the alert “for any strange computer or application behaviour”. The alert may be of particular concern given that early childhood centres store confidential, sensitive information regarding young children. Early childhood centres have been told to notify IT if they notice anything strange - but many do not have their own IT technician, and have been given a department phone number instead. Technicians have been advised to disconnect vulnerable servers and computers from the internet. Kindergartens and childcare centres that have already closed for the Christmas break have been told to contact the department’s hotline immediately. Interestingly — or frustratingly, depending on your perspective — South Australia has not lifted its ban on the use of at home rapid antigen tests. Per the SA Health website: In South Australia, the use of rapid antigen tests by the general public is currently prohibited given the low level of COVID-19 in the community to date and the wide availability of gold-standard PCR testing. This is due to the known inaccuracy of rapid antigen tests when there is not significant community spread of COVID-19, and the risk of false positive and false negative results. The continued restriction of this test in South Australia when it is permitted in other states reflects the different levels of COVID-19 in communities throughout Australia. The Chief Public Health Officer will determine when there is sufficient community spread of COVID-19 to make rapid antigen testing a useful additional public health tool. You can read the full post here. It is the highest ever daily case toll for South Australia – beating the record of 64 cases set just yesterday. South Australia has recorded 73 new cases of Covid-19. It brings the total number of active Omicron cases in the state to eight. Twenty-nine cases were locally acquired in South Australia and have been linked to a positive case, and four more acquired the infection locally but are unlinked. Two more are linked to infections interstate and 37 acquired the infection somewhere in Australia, with no known source. One is a person who acquired the infection overseas. The cases include 11 children, two teenagers, 34 women aged between 18 and 67, and 26 men aged between 19 and 74. Of the 73 cases reported today, 29 were fully vaccinated, four were unvaccinated, and 40 have an unknown vaccination status. WA firefighters are headed out to Marble Bar, which holds the reputation as the hottest town in Australia, to respond to a bushfire burning out of control north of the town. The fire was first reported on Wednesday. There’s a watch and act warning in place for people travelling along Marble Bar Road and surrounds. The alert was upgraded on Saturday morning because the fire was moving fast in a northerly direction along the road. Marble Bar Road is closed from the Great Northern Highway to the Marble Bar townsite. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area and drive slowly and carefully due to smoke. The township itself is under an advice level alert. There is no current threat to lives and homes but people are advised to stay alert and monitor their surroundings, and watch for signs of bushfire. People who are isolating due to Covid-19 infection, or risk of infection, “must do whatever you need to protect your life”. That includes leaving your house. or evacuating if necessary. Police in Western Australia have charged four men with “endangering the life, health or safety of another person” over a disturbance at a Perth cinema on Thursday night. The four men, aged 19 to 20, were allegedly “yelling profanities and throwing items into other people” at a 7.30pm screening of a movie at Karrinyup cinema. In a statement, police said: Security were alerted and the movie was stopped and lights turned on. The group resisted being removed from the complex and both security and members of the public were assaulted. The four men were arrested on Friday and charged with a series of offences including endangering the life, health or safety of another person and disorderly conduct. They were scheduled to appear at Perth magistrates court today. The NSW special minister of state, Don Harwin, and local government minister, Shelly Hancock, have announced they will retire from politics at the next election. Harwin and and Hancock both told NSW premier Dominic Perrottet that they did not want to be considered for re-election in 2023. More from AAP: Perrottet says they have both “been strong advocates for the people of NSW in their respective roles as ministers throughout their careers” and wished them well as they “continue to do what they do best by serving the great people of NSW”, even outside of parliament. Harwin says he has been “giving consideration to whether I could commit to another eight-year term”. “I have now decided I will not recontest my seat and therefore, this is the right time to end my ministerial service,” the longstanding MP said in a statement on Saturday. Harwin was first elected to the state’s upper house in 1999 and has held ministries including energy and utilities, resources, public service and employee relations, Aboriginal affairs, heritage and the arts. He has also been special minister for state since 2017 and leads the government in the upper house. Harwin says “at this stage” he plans to finish the remainder of his term in the upper house and bow out at the next election. Hancock first joined parliament in the legislative assembly in 2003, where she later served as speaker for close to eight years before her current ministry role. Hancock says “challenging family circumstances” and the departure of Gladys Berejiklian, who resigned as premier in October ahead of appearing before the Independent Commission Against Corruption, influenced her decision to step down. She described the former premier’s resignation as “a loss for New South Wales and a personal loss for me, and something that I have found difficult to move past”. Hancock says the premier who replaced Berejiklian needs to have more women in his cabinet. “It is often difficult being the only woman in the room, or one of a handful, therefore it is essential that women make up a larger part of the cabinet to provide our views and perspectives,” Hancock says. The soon-to-be-shuffled cabinet includes five women, including Hancock, across 21 positions. Prime minister Scott Morrison and his wife Jenny Morrison have visited the memorial to the five children who died in the Hillcrest Primary School jumping castle tragedy in Devonport, Tasmania. Prof Nancy Baxter, the head of Melbourne University’s school of population and global health, says Australians should keep wearing face masks to protect against the spread of Covid “unless we are a country of total whiny babies”. It comes as NSW has this week abolished rules requiring people to wear face masks on public transport, at airports and if they are unvaccinated front-of-house staff in a restaurant or cafe. That was the wrong call, says Baxter. Masks protect you and others without affecting your life. Masks don’t stop you from doing anything. Unless we are a country of babies, unless we are a country of total whiny babies, we can still wear masks. They do not cost us a thing. If you are still wearing your mask and intend to keep doing so, Baxter says consider swapping out the cloth mask you made and/or purchased in 2020 for a well-fitted P2 mask. You can buy them at the hardware store. Cloth masks will protect others if you are sick, she says, but will not protect you from breathing in the Omicron variant. You need to protect yourself. Get a P2 mask. Good afternoon folks, I will be your guide on this (where I am at least) warm and windy afternoon. Thank you to the indomitable Steph Convery for taking us through the past few hours. I’ll get to some other news in a minute but first off, I had a chat with Prof Nancy Baxter a short time ago about the Omicron variant and Covid risk going into Christmas and wanted to share her thoughts. I’m going to hand over the reins of this blog to darling Calla Wahlquist now, who will take you through the news of the afternoon. Be well, be safe, wear sunscreen! The New South Wales government has committed to outlawing the historically overlooked form of intimate abuse known as coercive control following an inquiry. The attorney general and domestic and sexual violence prevention minister, Mark Speakman, released the government’s response on Saturday, indicating support for 17 of the inquiry’s 23 recommendations. The remaining six have “been noted as further consideration continues”. Some of the recommendations being adopted include the introduction of a new, stand-alone offence for coercive control as well as amendments to existing laws. “No person deserves to live in fear, and it is part of our responsibilities in government to uphold the safety and human dignity of all of our citizens,” Speakman said. Victoria’s department of health has released its detailed daily Covid data, which shows that 94.3% of Victorians aged 12 and over have now had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 92.4% have had two doses. There are 384 people with Covid-19 in hospital in Victoria – 84 in ICU, with 43 of those on a ventilator. Of those people in hospital yesterday, 62% were not fully vaccinated. 92% of those in ICU were not fully vaccinated, while 87% had received no vaccination dose at all. There were no new confirmed cases of Omicron identified in Victoria yesterday. There are 19 known cases of Omicron in the state. There are 30 confirmed Covid-19 cases linked to the Peel Hotel, Collingwood (16 cases), and Sircuit Bar, Fitzroy (14 cases). One of these cases was confirmed as the Omicron variant. NSW Health has apologised to singer Delta Goodrem for the Instagram post that included a picture of her face with syringes pointing to it as a stand-in for the Covid variant Delta. “NSW Health was attempting to convey an important public health message but recognises it made an error of judgement and sincerely regrets the offence caused to Delta Goodrem,” a NSW Health spokesperson said. “The message has now been removed by NSW Health.” In the wake of New South Wales breaking its own and the country’s daily case record today, you might find this piece from Caitlin Cassidy illuminating. Tony Blakely, a University of Melbourne epidemiologist, said the dramatic easing of restrictions in NSW as case numbers spiked was consistent with a strategy to build resilience to the virus. But although worrying, the arrival of the new Omicron variant might well be the pathway out of the pandemic, he said. Thunderstorms incoming for New South Wales; watch out for wind gusts, hail and heavy rain. Erm, so it appears singer Delta Goodrem has taken NSW Health to task on Instagram for using a picture of her face as a stand-in for Covid variant Delta in its factcheck story series yesterday. NSW Health appears to have deleted that particular story. Online age verification for alcohol purchases is being trialled in Australia, new documents reveal, as the federal government considers whether similar technology could be applied to gambling and adult sites. The Morrison government has tasked the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, with developing a “roadmap” for an age verification system for adult content by the end of 2022, but documents released under freedom of information laws reveal options are already being trialled. Draft talking points and a slide deck from early August released on the transparency website Right to Know this week, show the Digital Transformation Agency has been preparing for age verification and digital ID trials from September this year. According to the talking points, the trial was to be conducted with online retailers in Australia, using external ID providers Australia Post and Mastercard. The beta trials had been expected to run for between three and six months, with 100 users per use case, starting first with online alcohol purchases in September, and then gambling websites at a date to be determined. Read the full story: Another reminder to get your booster shot as soon as you are eligible. If you’re aged 12 or over and are severely immunocompromised, you are encouraged have a third primary dose of vaccine (as distinct from a booster) from two months after your second dose, NSW Health says. Talk to your GP! Further to the below, NSW Health has said a total of 226 cases of Omicron have been confirmed by the required additional testing in NSW. However, they believe that Omicron likely accounts for the majority of today’s cases. The death recorded today in NSW was a woman from south-western Sydney in her 90s who died at the Gillawarna Village Aged Care Facility in Georges Hall – also where she acquired Covid-19. She had received two doses of a vaccine and had underlying health conditions. This is the fourth death linked to an outbreak at this facility. New South Wales Health has just announced that it’s only going to do genomic sequencing for Omicron “where it will make a clinical difference to the care of a patient”. The humble bogong moth is in trouble. Not very long ago, they would carpet Canberra in their annual 1,000km migration from southern Queensland to the mountains of Victoria – including Mount Bogong, the state’s highest peak. But in 2019, after decades of gradual decline in the population, scientists reported a sudden catastrophic drop: mountain caves that were once dense with mind-boggling numbers of the insects – as many as 17,000 moths per square metre – now contained so few that they could be counted on just one hand. Read the full story here: Something Christmassy! That’s what we need. The lovely Caitlin Cassidy has a great story today about people who love Christmas and Christmas decorations. Here’s a lil glitter taster with the full story chaser: A search has resumed for a swimmer missing overnight at Lennox Head on the NSW north coast. Police were called to Seven Mile Beach by a woman reporting she had seen a swimmer in difficulties in the surf about 6pm on Friday, AAP reports. Officers immediately began a search involving local lifesavers, the force’s marine rescue command, ambulance personnel and the Westpac rescue helicopter. Personal belongings were found unattended on the beach near the surf club before a man approached police with concerns his 19-year-old son had not returned from a swim, around 7pm. The search continued until 10pm without success and resumed at 6.30am on Saturday. Water police and Marine Rescue NSW are currently conducting sweeps off the coastline. More on those Covid cases in Tasmania, from AAP: Recent arrivals from Newcastle are being contacted after the first three cases were linked to superspreader events there. Positive wastewater samples have been collected from Norwood in Launceston, where there are no known cases. Anyone in the area is advised to get tested immediately if they experience any symptoms, no matter how mild. Tasmania requires people arriving from high-risk areas to return a negative test in the 72 hours before they travel. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein said on Friday the state government was considering a mask mandate at indoor venues and would have more to say in coming days. Tasmania had no active cases when the state reopened. A fourth person has tested positive for Covid-19 in Tasmania, four days into the island’s reopening. AAP reports the latest case is a teenager who flew to Launceston from NSW on Thursday. He was tested after NSW Health notified him he had been at an exposure site, but before the notification arrived he visited a cafe and a JB Hi-Fi store on Thursday afternoon. Those two venues are now exposure sites, along with Launceston airport’s baggage carousel. Close contacts on board the man’s flight and people who checked in to the venues he visited around the same time have been contacted by Tasmanian public health services. Two other confirmed cases are linked to an early Wednesday morning Qantas flight from Sydney, one of the first planes to land after the border reopened. Another person who was confirmed positive on Friday flew from Melbourne on Wednesday afternoon. There are three people in hospital but nobody in intensive care or on ventilators. 98.3% of ACT residents aged 12 and over are fully vaccinated. More from Morrison on our Covid response – I can’t hear the questions but I presume they are touching on NSW’s record case numbers: Living with the virus under the national plan is not about case numbers ... I’m not going to alarm people on case numbers. What matters is hospitalisation, ICU, people on ventilators and severe illness. That’s what matters ... We’re past the time where we just talk about case numbers. We planned to live with the virus, we didn’t plan to live shut in. Back to the PM in Hobart (sorry to give you all press-conference whiplash). He’s talking about our Covid response. “Australia is not the UK, it’s not North America,” Scott Morrison says. He’s emphasising that policy settings “have to protect lives and livelihoods”: You don’t jump at shadows, you wait for the best information ... Australia can’t go back. We have to go forward. We have to live with this virus. We have to live with it safely. The $500,000 from the state government will be rolled together with the money from Smith’s GoFundMe – more than $1m has been raised there so far – and Rockcliff says people who want to help the Devonport community should direct donations to that newly established community public fund. ABC News has just cut to the mayor of Devonport, Annette Rockcliff, who is speaking live now, with Zoe Smith, the woman who established the GoFundMe page that was gathering donations for the Hillcrest primary school community yesterday. I just want to announce this morning that council, together with [the] state government, and with Zoe as well, have launched the Hillcrest community public fund. This fund will help the families directly, the directly affected families, as well as the whole Hillcrest community. It’s been set up by the state government and my state will support it. It will support the families, it will go directly to those families and that community. It will be overseen by a group of people, including Zoe Smith here, the principal of the school, myself, a representative from MyState, and Craig Limkin, who works for the premier. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, is speaking now, thanking Morrison for his support after the Devonport tragedy and the offers of support from state leaders around the country. He says the financial contribution from the federal government is building on a financial support package that his state government announced yesterday: We’ve put in place the Regional Social Recovery Committee under our State Emergency Management Act to deal with matters like this, and that committee has already met. It has members including the Devonport City Council, and others from across our departments. And one of the recommendations from that committee was that the government should immediately make a first-stage ... $500,000 to support counselling and other supports in the community. Morrison is announcing a financial support package for the community after the jumping castle tragedy. We are providing $800,000 to support the families and communities affected in counselling support, $250,000 for first responders, $550,000 for the broader community. This will be paid to Tasmania’s Primary Health Network. It will be provided over an 18-month period, because we know support won’t just be needed in the next few weeks, it will be needed for many, many, many months, to try and begin that process of healing. There’s additional trauma counselling in the $250,000 for those involved, and training for those services in trauma, of informed care and psychological first aid to assist in recovery. The $550,000 includes $200,000 for additional trauma counselling in the community. There’s $200,000 for the local Headspace trauma care and training, and expanded supports for young people. There’s $100,000 to support return-of-school in 2022, including training and counselling for teachers and staff, and $50,000 in community mental health and wellbeing grants to support the community. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking in Hobart now about the Big Ship (that’s the RSV Nuyina). He’s acknowledged, though, that the timing is not great, given the tragedy at Hillcrest Primary in Devonport this week: I’m very pleased to be here in Hobart today for this very important event ... But, sadly, the events of the last few days mean it’s a terribly, terribly awful time for Tasmanians. And, on behalf of Jenny and I, and all Australians, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the five families in particular who have lost those precious young ones, and we think also of the families of the three who are still in a terribly critical condition. We think of the entire community that is just heaving with sorrow. As I said yesterday, there are no words, only prayers, for our fellow Australians in Tasmania, and for the community that will carry this burden. And it will be a heavy burden. It will weigh them down. But I want to say to them, whether they’re the first responders, the teachers, the friends, the family, the P&amp;C at Hillcrest – the whole community – that Australia is one with them. And we grieve with them and we mourn with them, and we want to do everything we possibly can to help them through this terrible, terrible, unthinkable, unimaginable tragedy. The Queensland chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, has just been speaking about the latest case numbers: We expect the Omicron strain to become dominant in Queensland in the coming weeks. In addition, I can say that there have been some cases in the healthcare setting. Because we are aware that the virus is widespread, it is inevitable that people in the healthcare setting will develop infection, and that is going to happen more and more in the coming weeks and months. So, there are a number of venues, healthcare venues across the state, where there have been either staff or visitors with Covid-19 in them. These include: the North West Private Hospital in Brisbane, Toowoomba Hospital, Princess Alexandra Hospital, BlueCare Homefield Residential Aged Care Facility in Mackay, and at least one general practice in Brisbane. This will continue to occur in the coming weeks and months. Queensland health authorities are providing an update now: eight of the cases are contacts of known cases. Five are linked to interstate travel. One case caught the virus in Queensland community. Queensland sports administrators Tracy Stockwell and Rebecca Frizelle will join the organising committee for the 2032 Brisbane Olympics and Paralympic Games, AAP reports. Sport minister Richard Colbeck and special envoy for the Games Ted O’Brien have also been nominated by the federal government to be on the organising committee. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said both women will bring years of experience and understand what’s needed behind the scenes to create success on the field and in the pool. “The Brisbane Olympics Games in 2032 will showcase the best of Queensland, providing our athletes with the ability to thrive on the world stage on home soil,” he said on Saturday. “But it will also provide economic opportunities for many and create a legacy for generations of young sporting Aussies, so we must get it right.” A successful US Olympian before settling in Australia, Stockwell is vice president of Swimming Australia and a member of the Committee for Brisbane Advisory Council. She is also a founding member and past president of Womensport Queensland. Frizelle was appointed to the board of the Gold Coast Titans NRL club in 2014, going on to be appointed the first female chair in the NRL. She is a director of Paralympics Australia and a member of the Griffith University Council. The Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games Arrangements Bill 2021 passed the Queensland parliament earlier this month and provides for the organising committee to be established. Others already selected for positions include Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates, AOC chief executive Matt Carroll, Paralympics Australia president Jock O’Callaghan and athlete representatives Bronte Barratt and Kurt Fearnley. This is a really interesting graph, illustrating daily case numbers in New South Wales against the number of people in hospital. The National Disability Insurance Agency’s (NDIA) spending on private law firms to battle participants appealing its decisions rose 30% last financial year, new figures show. Data released under freedom of information laws shows the agency paid about $17.3m in 2020-21 to firms representing the agency in “external matters” such as legal challenges at the administrative appeals tribunal. The figure is an increase from $13.4m the previous financial year, the data shows. It underlines how the rapidly increasing number of national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) participants challenging decisions to cut or deny them support can create a windfall for law firms paid by the taxpayer. While spending on fees to law firms has increased, community law centres funded to represent people with disability have told Guardian Australia they are at capacity and struggling to take on new clients. Read the full story here: Here’s a picture of the big ship from back in October, when it first arrived in Hobart. In 2010, an Indian mining company bought some tenements over a giant and untapped coal basin in the west of Queensland. That purchase, by the conglomerate Adani Group, kickstarted one of the most controversial and politically divisive resource projects in Australia’s history – the Carmichael coalmine and rail project. Before the year is out, and about eight years behind schedule, Adani says it will finally export its first coal, destined to be burned in a power station. The moment will be celebrated as a victory by its supporters, including many regional Queensland MPs and senators and conservative commentators. But for its opponents, including climate change activists and some traditional owners, the Carmichael project always meant danger and it became the focus of a campaign with an uncompromising two-word slogan: Stop Adani. So as the first coal waits to wind its way through the Great Barrier Reef’s shipping channels, what now for that campaign? Read more from Graham Readfearn and Ben Smee: The environment minister, Sussan Ley, is at the launch of Antarctic research ship the RSV Nuyina. The ship is heading off to Antarctica on Monday. Ley made some comments on ABC TV just now, saying the ship – which cost $1.9bn – is: ... the most advanced polar research platform in the world, giving scientists the ability to study the ocean depths, the sea ice, and the upper atmosphere for climate science. Today’s Covid figure in New South Wales is the highest daily total of any state in Australia since the pandemic began. Victoria recorded 2,297 cases on 14 October, which was at the time the grim national record. Today’s 2,482 cases in NSW also exceeds the state’s own previous peak – the 2,213 cases recorded only yesterday. The chainsaws outside my window have now been replaced by leaf blowers. Who authorised this?! Ahead of the prime minister’s appearance in Tasmania today, I highly recommend reading Katharine Murphy’s latest analysis of Morrison’s strategy so far in the lead-up to next year’s election: When he’s not trialling new made-for-TV grabs (a new “shake and bake” analogy, which I think was invoked first in relation to emissions reduction, and now has morphed into something broadly economy adjacent, or “jabs and jobs” which was Friday’s innovation), the prime minister has taken to listing things. Morrison’s current list includes saving lives during the pandemic. Shoring up the health system “with more than $33bn from the federal government in additional investment”. Saving livelihoods with “the single largest economic rescue package in our history”. Presiding over economic recovery after the waves of the pandemic – “more than 350,000 jobs created in a five-week period after the lockdowns were lifted, and through the crisis, we have maintained that AAA credit rating”. At the risk of stating the obvious, prime ministers don’t have to list their achievements if they are confident voters have already logged them. Seven people have died in Victoria with Covid-19 since yesterday. One person has died and 26 people are in intensive care. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is in Tasmania today. He’ll be attending the launch of the RSV Nuyina in Hobart this morning. The RSV Nuyina is a great big ship – an Antarctic icebreaker, to be precise. Morrison is also understood to be heading to Devonport later today. It’s also going to be hot and gusty in New South Wales today, with fire warnings for southern and northern Riverina areas. My colleague Nino Bucci has been covering this fascinating case in the NSW supreme court over the last few weeks: Sydney man Raymond McClure was as wealthy as he was lonely. But in the final months of his life he became closer with his GP, Dr Peter Alexakis, the court heard. Alexakis spoke fluent greek like McClure and was the only person who regularly visited the 83-year-old in hospital. And because McClure was suspicious about other medical professionals and lawyers, he became increasingly reliant on Alexakis for more than just social interaction, Alexakis said. The extent of this reliance, and whether it unduly influenced McClure’s decision to leave 90% of his $30m estate to Alexakis, is central to the court case over the will. It’s going to be a hot and windy day in Victoria today. Stay hydrated, wear sunscreen, water your plants early, make sure your bird baths are full. Shout out to the two gardeners doing some hedge maintenance outside my window this morning, love a good double-chainsaw grind at 8.15am on a Saturday. New South Wales health officials are considering breaking with commonwealth advice by shortening the Covid vaccine booster interval to four months, amid concern about spread of the Omicron variant. Guardian Australia understands that NSW health department officials were meeting with vaccine providers in the state on Friday and canvassing the prospect of how they would cope with an influx of people eager to be vaccinated ahead of schedule. A source familiar with the vaccine rollout in NSW told Guardian Australia health authorities in the state were concerned about record transmission levels this week as well as a potential waning of protection, given that a large number of people in the state received AstraZeneca. Read the exclusive story here: Good morning, I’m Stephanie Convery with you on this, the last Saturday before Christmas (DON’T PANIC). It has been a helluva week, and yesterday we capped it off with a huge rise in Covid-19 cases in New South Wales and Victoria, jumps in Queensland and South Australia too, plus a fair bit of general anxiety about what the surge might mean and how much case numbers might grow. The rises came as Covid-19 testing sites came under strain ahead of the busy Christmas period. Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory went into lockdown after four Covid cases were found there. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced yesterday that mask mandates would be returned to retail settings over Christmas and the New Year while Western Australia announced it would tighten travel rules for arrivals from Queensland and Tasmania arrivals. NSW and Victoria scrapped their three-day isolation requirements for international arrivals. (They will now need to get a PCR test within 24 hours of arrival and isolate until they get a negative result.) Australia also passed a vaccination milestone: 90% of over-16s are now double-dosed. Australia’s chief medical officer moved to reassure people that the vaccine is still effective against severe disease, urging those who are eligible to get their booster shot. Still, it remains to be seen how much havoc Omicron will wreak on our Christmas holidays. We’ll bring you all the Covid news of the day as it comes our way. We also learnt the names of the five children who died in the awful jumping castle incident in Tasmania. The Tasmanian education department announced a ban on the use of jumping castles at all state schools late on Friday. Schools were told the ban on “all jumping castles and inflatable amusement equipment” would be imposed indefinitely. All right, someone bring me a coffee, please! Let’s get stuck in."

          "bodyText": "That’s all from me today. Here’s some of what we covered this evening: Another Covid surge has sparked cancellations as the Omicron quickly variant spreads. NFL games this weekend had to be postponed due to a spike in player infections and the Rockette’s “Christmas Spectacular” was put permanently on pause. The CDC is trying out a new plan to keep kids in school, issuing a “test to stay” strategy. Unvaccinated students will be able to go to class if they test negative twice, even after an exposure. The Biden administration policy requiring large businesses to vaccinate workers or issue testing and mask-mandates is likely headed to the supreme court after being upheld in a federal Appeals court. San Francisco mayor London Breed declared a state of emergency and pledged to crackdown on crime, alarming advocates and constituents. Also, this happened: Thanks for reading along! Have a great night. On Friday San Francisco mayor London Breed declared a state of emergency in the Tenderloin district — an area near the heart of the city with high levels of homelessness and devastating numbers of drug overdoses — in a pledge to crack down on crime. New plans to aggressively address issues on what she called the “nasty streets” in her city, including bolstering the budget for policing, were also accompanied by a stunning shift in rhetoric for a leader of one of the country’s most liberal cities. “We are in a crisis and we need to respond accordingly,” she said at a news conference on Friday. “Too many people are dying in this city, too many people are sprawled on our streets.” The emergency declaration, which is intended to last 90 days and must be ratified by the Board of Supervisors within 7 days, was issued to limit red tape around zoning and planning codes and enable funds to flow to the mayor’s plan more freely. But the move targets more than drugs. The crackdown also comes weeks after San Francisco was targeted by coordinated thefts, where groups of people raided high-end stores armed with crowbars and hammers. In response, the city deployed police to the downtown area in full-force, bumping officer overtime to roughly 8,000 hours. California governor Gavin Newsom has also responded to the incident — and the national attention it sparked — with a $300 million plan to target organized crime. “We recognize this moment requires us to do more,” Newsom said during a news conference. “These organized efforts have created tremendous fear and anxiety to many Californians.” But experts have highlighted larceny and the overall property crime rate have fallen in the city. Before the pandemic crime rates in many categories were also falling across the state. Once a vocal champion of criminal justice reforms and a reducing the reliance on police in favor of stronger social programs, Breed is now embracing an approach she acknowledges is at-odds with what her progressive constituents have long-advocated for. “It’s time that the reign of criminals who are destroying our city, it is time for it to come to an end,” Breed said, joined by the city’s Police Chief Bill Scott. “What I’m proposing today and what I will be proposing in the future will make a lot of people uncomfortable,” she added, “And I don’t care.” The first two parts of a three-phased approach, described in a press release issued Friday, is already underway, and includes a significant increase in police presence instructed to target both drug sellers and users. Breed said that more than two people are dying per day to drug overdoses, mostly to fentanyl. Fatalities are on the rise and outpaced Covid deaths in the city last year by 2 to 1. “We are collectively committed to a long term solution that includes law enforcement, redeploying resources, and including our @SheriffSF to assist with mitigating challenges with access to support and services” Supervisor Ahsha Safai wrote on Twitter this week after joining Breed in the announcement of the new plan. Safai added that one part of the plan will focus on unlicensed vendors selling goods on the streets and another will focus on drug-use. “We must have cleaner safer streets” he said. “Enough is enough.” But statistics collected by the San Francisco Police Department show many types of crime, including larceny, are actually down from where they were in 2019. Breed’s plan also includes an expansion of police surveillance, a point that has sparked concerns from privacy experts and advocates that the mayor is attempting to circumvent San Francisco’s privacy laws. “The Mayor’s proposal to massively expand police presence in San Francisco is regressive and harmful to those who are already underserved and overpoliced,” Public Defender Mano Raju said in a statement issued Tuesday, noting that Breed made promises to divest in policing after the murder of George Floyd. He added that an increase in policing won’t help address the root causes of crime, including poverty, addiction, disease, and trauma. “Piling more resources into policing and punishment” he said, “— strategies that have consistently succeeded only in creating intergenerational trauma — have never been the solutions to public health crises, in the Tenderloin or elsewhere” A Biden administration rule that employers with more than 100 workers must require vaccinations or have to undergo weekly Covid testing and mask mandates was upheld by a federal appeals court today, overturning a lower courts ruling. “The record establishes that Covid-19 has continued to spread, mutate, kill and block the safe return of American workers to their jobs. To protect workers, Osha can and must be able to respond to dangers as they evolve,” Judge Jane B Stranch wrote in an opinion. The new ruling is expected to be appealed to the supreme court, the Washington Post reports: More than two dozen Republican-led states, private businesses and conservative legal groups challenged the policy. Before the legal challenges filed in courts throughout the country were consolidated at the 6th Circuit, a different appeals court temporarily halted Biden’s plans. The Louisiana-based 5th Circuit Court of Appeal said the Labor Department exceeded its authority and ordered the OSHA to not take any further steps to implement or enforce the rules.” Citing “increasing challenges from the pandemic” the producers of the famed and beloved Radio City Music Hall show starring the Rocketts called it quits on the rest of the season. The “Christmas Spectacular” was scheduled through 2 January, with several shows on each day. On Friday, producers announced that there had been breakthrough cases and that the day’s performances were off. By the evening, they’d canceled all remaining shows. “We regret that we are unable to continue the ‘Christmas Spectacular’ this season,” they said in a statement. “We had hoped we could make it through the season and are honored to have hosted hundreds of thousands of fans at more than 100 shows over the last seven weeks.” They aren’t alone. Several Broadway shows have had to shut down due to the surge in cases impacting New York City again, the New York Times reports. New York state has also experienced the highest single-day spike in new infections — with 21,027 cases reported Friday — breaking a previous record set on 14 January. From the NYT: The decision comes as Broadway has had to endure a raft of cancellations unlike any in its history. Several shows, including “Tina,” a jukebox musical about Tina Turner, “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” and “Hamilton” have all had to cancel at least one performance in recent days. On Thursday, six of the 32 current shows canceled performances, including “Moulin Rouge!,” where many patrons were already in their seats when the decision was made. In a sign of the increasing level of concern over the Omicron variant, the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday became the first major performing arts institution in New York to unveil a booster mandate: Beginning Jan. 17, all employees and audience members eligible for booster shots will be required to show proof that they have received them in order to enter the opera house.” In an attempt to keep kids in the classrooms in the face of the fast-spreading Omicron variant, the Biden administration released a new strategy to increase Covid testing. Rather than sending children home, schools can now employ the CDC’s “test to stay” strategy, enabling unvaccinated students to remain in class if they test negative at least twice even if they have been exposed to the virus. “If exposed children meet a certain criteria and continue to test negative, they can stay at school instead of quarantining at home,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing on Friday. Omicron is quickly gaining speed and could soon become the dominant variant in the US, surpassing Delta. Vaccines are still a strong line of defense against the virus but only 18% of kids between the ages of five and 11 have received one dose, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Roughly 61% between the ages of 12 to 17 have gotten a shot. But studies done by the agency show that the new strategy is effective at stopping transmissions and limits school days missed. The CDC cited how the program, used at 90 schools in Illinois was able prevent 8,000 missed school days, NBC News reports. In Los Angeles county, where the strategy wasn’t used, students lost 92,000 school days. “The studies demonstrate that ‘test to stay’ works to keep unvaccinated children in schools safely,” Walensky said. Gabrielle Canon here in Los Angeles to take you through the rest of Friday’s news. Three NFL games planned for this weekend had to be rescheduled due to a Covid outbreak among players, the New York Times reports. With the season winding down, the quick-spreading Omicron variant is having an impact on the important games leading up to the Super Bowl and more than 130 players have tested positive. The NFL said in a news release that the games will be postponed due to the “new, highly transmissible form of the virus this week, resulting in a substantial increase in cases across the league.” New protocols have also been issued, including mask mandates and limitations placed on in-person activities. From the NYT: If the outbreak worsens, the NFL has little room to maneuver. Only four more weeks of its regular season remain, and there are no breaks in the schedule besides the week before the Super Bowl, which is scheduled for Feb. 13. Games cannot be played in rapid succession, like in other leagues, because of the necessary recovery time for teams between games. And with just 17 regular season games, a forfeit or game that cannot be rescheduled could drastically affect who qualifies for the playoffs.” That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Gabrielle Canon, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden once again underscored the urgent need to pass national voting rights legislation, which has stalled in the Senate due to Republican filibustering. “This battle is not over,” Biden said at South Carolina State University’s commencement ceremony this morning. “We’re going to keep up the fight until we get it done, and you’re going to keep up the fight, and we need your help badly.” Omicron is expected to soon become the dominant strain of coronavirus in the US, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. “Although Delta continues to circulate widely in the United States, Omicron is increasing rapidly, and we expect it to become the dominant strain in the United States, as it has in other countries, in the coming weeks,” Dr Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing today. A Capitol insurrectionist was sentenced to more than five years in prison for attacking police officers on 6 January. The punishment of Robert Palmer represents the longest sentence given to a Capitol rioter so far. Palmer told the judge overseeing his case, “I’m really, really ashamed of what I did.” Roger Stone invoked his fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination today, when he appeared for his deposition with the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. “I did invoke my fifth amendment rights to every question – not because I have done anything wrong, but because I am fully aware of the House Democrats’ long history of fabricating perjury charges,” the Trump ally and political operative said. A report suggests that former Texas governor and energy secretary Rick Perry was the author of a controversial text sent to Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, on 4 November 2020. The text was revealed as part of the documents that Meadows turned over to the select committee investigating the insurrection, and it reads, “HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS.” Gabrielle will have more coming up, so stay tuned. A new report suggests that former Texas governor and energy secretary Rick Perry was the author of a controversial text sent to Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, on November 4, 2020. The text was revealed on Tuesday night as part of the documents that Meadows turned over to the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, before the former Trump aide ended his cooperation with investigators. The text reads, “HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS.” CNN reports: A spokesman for Perry told CNN that the former Energy Secretary denies being the author of the text. Multiple people who know Rick Perry confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number. The cell phone number the text was sent from, obtained from a source knowledgeable about the investigation, appears in databases as being registered to a James Richard Perry of Texas, the former governor’s full name. The number is also associated in a second database as registered to a Department of Energy email address associated with Perry when he was secretary. When told of these facts, the spokesman had no explanation. Democrats had warned that the text message indicates Trump and his allies were working to overturn the results of the 2020 election even before a winner was declared in multiple battleground states. One House progressive suggested he felt betrayed by the Senate’s failure to pass the Build Back Better Act after he supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “The House acted in good faith and passed the infrastructure bill, on the promise that the Senate would do the same with Build Back Better,” congressman Ro Khanna said. “It’s time for the Senate to hold the vote that the president promised.” It’s worth noting that six House progressives – Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib – opposed the infrastructure bill out of concern that its passage would slow momentum for the Build Back Better Act. And indeed, since the infrastructure bill passed last month, centrist Democrat Joe Manchin has raised more objections to the Build Back Better Act, leaving a deal out of reach as the end of the year approaches. Set the DVR: Joe Manchin will be speaking to Bret Baier on Fox News this Sunday, as the centrist senator’s talks with Joe Biden over the Build Back Better Act drag on. The interview comes as Biden has acknowledged that Democrats’ $1.75tn spending package will not pass this year, largely because Manchin is not yet on board. Manchin’s reluctance is enraging progressives, who have warned that the party will suffer widespread losses in the midterm elections next year if Congress cannot deliver. “It is actually delusional to believe Dems can get re-elected without acting on filibuster or student debt, Biden breaking his BBB promise, letting [the expanded child tax credit] lapse, 0 path to citizenship, etc,” congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter today. “We need to act now.” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell has said the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection is seeking facts that “the public needs to know”. Speaking to Spectrum News yesterday, the Republican leader said of the select committee, “I think the fact-finding is interesting. We’re all going to be watching it.” McConnell did not offer any review of the committee’s performance so far, but he acknowledged the importance of the investigators’ work. “It was a horrendous event, and I think what they’re seeking to find out is something the public needs to know,” McConnell said. The Kentucky senator made similar comments earlier this week, telling reporters on Capitol Hill, “We’re all watching, as you are, what is unfolding on the House side, and it will be interesting to reveal all the participants who were involved.” It should be noted that Senate Republicans blocked the creation of a 9/11-style commission to study the insurrection earlier this year. Caroline Wren, one of the organizers of the January 6 rally that culminated in the attack on the Capitol, also met today with the House select committee investigating the insurrection. Wren did not respond to questions when a CBS News reporter approached her earlier today: Wren was a top fundraiser for Donald Trump’s campaign, and she was listed on the permit paperwork for the January 6 rally as a “VIP adviser”. The select committee issued subpoenas to Wren and other organizers of the rally in late September. Meanwhile, Brandon Straka, who spoke at a “Stop the Steal” rally the day before the Capitol insurrection, appears to have provided the government with information that may impact his sentencing after he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct during the riot. Politico reports: It’s an indication that Straka, one of the few Jan. 6 defendants who is also of interest to congressional investigators, has cooperated with prosecutors in a substantive way. Straka, who describes himself as a ‘former liberal,’ became a relatively prominent figure in Trump-world in 2018, when he founded the ‘WalkAway campaign’ to encourage liberals to abandon Democrats. He was one of just two speakers at pro-Trump events on Jan. 5 and 6 criminally charged for their roles in the Capitol attack. Owen Shroyer, an InfoWars broadcaster and ally of Alex Jones, also faces misdemeanor charges in the case. Straka pleaded guilty in October to a single misdemeanor charge and was set to be sentenced next week. But prosecutors have asked for a 30-day sentencing delay so that his new evidence ‘can be properly evaluated.’ The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection has also asked the National Archives to provide all Trump White House documents related to Straka. Roger Stone confirmed that he did invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination this morning, when he appeared for a deposition before the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. “This morning, in fulfillment of a federal subpoena, I did my civil duty, and I responded as required by law,” the Trump ally and political operative told reporters on Capitol Hill. “I did invoke my Fifth Amendment rights to every question -- not because I have done anything wrong, but because I am fully aware of the House Democrats’ long history of fabricating perjury charges.” Stone challenged the legitimacy of the inquiry, attacking the investigation as “witch hunt 3.0”. “I stress yet again that I was not on the Ellipse. I did not march to the Capitol,” Stone said. “I was not at the Capitol and any claim, assertion or even implication that I knew about or was involved in any way whatsoever with the illegal and politically counterproductive activities of January 6, is categorically false.” According to the statement the committee issued when it subpoenaed Stone, investigators are interested in his movements on January 5 and allegations that he used members of the far-right group Oath Keepers as personal security guards while he was in Washington. Stone claimed his actions on January 5 amounted to “constitutionally protected free speech” and were thus not a legitimate avenue of inquiry for the committee. One of the participants in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol has been sentenced to more than five years in prison for attacking police officers during the riot. The AP reports: Robert Palmer, 54, of Largo, Florida, wept as he told U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that he recently watched a video of his actions that day and could not believe what he was seeing. ‘Your honor. I’m really really ashamed of what I did,’ he said weeping. Palmer was one of a few rioters sentenced on Friday in District of Columbia court for their actions on Jan. 6 when the angry mob descended after a rally by then-President Donald Trump to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. Scores of police were beaten and blooded, five people died and there was about $1.5 million in damage done to the U.S. Capitol. Palmer is the 65th defendant to be sentenced overall. More than 700 people have been charged. Palmer’s punishment represents the longest prison sentence given to a Capitol rioter so far. That unwanted record was previously held by Jacob Chansley of Arizona and Scott Fairlamb of New Jersey, both of whom received 41 months in prison. Leading progressive Democrat Pramila Jayapal is voicing the frustration felt by many as the year looks set to end with a legislative whimper not a bang for Joe Biden and his administration. The Washington state congresswoman just tweeted: Liberals tweeted their support, including this cartoon of the bill metaphorically bearing down on Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema on a bicycle made for two (centrist Democrats), who thus with the shakiest of platforms, hold it at bay: New data analysis has revealed that if US Democratic voters were to make up their own country, it would have one of the world’s most vaccinated populations, with over 91% of adults having received at least one shot. Meanwhile, only approximately 60% of Republican adults have received their first shot, according to data research by the New York Times. And the gap in Covid’s death toll between blue and red states that voted mostly Republican this fall widened more quickly than at any previous point of the pandemic. A total of 25 out of every 100,000 residents in counties that voted for Donald Trump died of Covid in October, compared to the 7.8 per 100,000 in counties that voted heavily for Biden, according to the data analysis from the Times. October marked the fifth consecutive month that the percentage gap of death rates in red and blue counties widened. Charles Gaba, an independent health care analyst, said that in October, the “reddest” tenth of the US saw death rates from coronavirus six times higher than the “bluest” tenth. “Those numbers have dropped slightly in recent weeks,” he told National Public Radio. “It’s back down to 5.5 times higher.” Counties where Trump received over 70% of the vote experienced an even higher average of Covid-19 deaths compared to counties where Trump won at least 60 percent, the new data research revealed. On the contrary, Covid-19 deaths in heavily Biden counties and swing counties did not rise over the past two months, despite the nationwide surge in cases. The US Postal Service (USPS) and NAACP have reached a settlement in a lawsuit over election mail. USPS agreed for the 2022 mid-term congressional election to take the same extraordinary measures used to deliver ballots in the November 2020 election, Reuters writes. The agency further reports: The Postal Service also agreed for elections through 2028 to post guidance documents publicly reflecting its “good faith efforts to prioritize monitoring and timely delivery of Election Mail. The NAACP president, Derrick Johnson said in a statement, “With the NAACP’s ability to now monitor the performance of the USPS during national elections, we will ensure that the right to vote is protected for of all citizens, including those often suppressed.” Johnson also reiterated the need to pass national voting rights legislation, saying, “While this is an unprecedented victory, we are now laser-focused on passing federal voting rights protections through the Senate.” Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden once again underscored the urgent need to pass national voting rights legislation, which has stalled in the Senate due to Republican filibustering. “This battle is not over,” Biden said at South Carolina State University’s commencement ceremony this morning. “We’re going to keep up the fight until we get it done, and you’re going to keep up the fight, and we need your help badly.” Omicron is expected to soon become the dominant strain of coronavirus in the US, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. “Although Delta continues to circulate widely in the United States, Omicron is increasing rapidly, and we expect it to become the dominant strain in the United States, as it has in other countries, in the coming weeks,” Dr Rochelle Walensky said at a press briefing today. Roger Stone appeared on Capitol Hill for his deposition with the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Stone’s lawyer had previously indicated that his client would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination to avoid complying with the committee’s subpoena, which was issued last month. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Major US companies are now pulling back on plans to return to in-person work in light of the Omicron variant’s rapid spread across America. Employers planning to call remote workers back into the office in the new year are now pausing those efforts, and they are wary of setting new return dates only to push them back once again in the face of continued uncertainty and risks from the pandemic. The pandemic is also driving changes in how in-person employees work, with a renewed push for strikes and unionization across several industries where workers have frequently faced long hours and unsafe conditions. Alphabet’s Google, Meta, Apple, Uber, Lyft, Ford, DoorDash, DocuSign and Fidelity are among the companies that have delayed returns to the office. “It’s warranted, given the uptick that we’ve seen in cases,” Bradford Bell, director of the Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies at Cornell University’s ILR School, said. The delays also depend on where the offices are located, he said. “They’re very much looking at this on a location-by-location basis.” The White House pandemic response team coordinator, Jeff Zients, reassured vaccinated Americans that, if they contract Omicron, their case will “likely be asymptomatic or mild”. “We are intent on not letting Omicron disrupt work and school for the vaccinated. You’ve done the right thing, and we will get through this,” Zients said. But the White House official issued a dire warning to unvaccinated Americans, saying Omicron poses a serious risk to them and their communities. “For the unvaccinated, you’re looking at a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families and the hospitals you may soon overwhelm,” Zients said. “Our message to every American is clear: there is action you can take to protect yourself and your family. Wear a mask in public indoor settings, get vaccinated, get your kids vaccinated and get a booster shot when you’re eligible.” Joe Biden issued a similar warning yesterday, saying the unvaccinated face “a winter of severe illness and death”. The White House pandemic response team held a briefing this morning to provide an update on the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in the US. Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at least 39 states and more than 75 countries have now reported confirmed cases of the Omicron variant. “Although Delta continues to circulate widely in the United States, Omicron is increasing rapidly, and we expect it to become the dominant strain in the United States, as it has in other countries, in the coming weeks,” Walensky said. The CDC director noted that the agency is seeing cases of Omicron among people who are both vaccinated and boosted. But Walensky added, “We believe these cases are milder or asymptomatic because of vaccine protection.” During South Carolina State University’s commencement ceremony this morning, Joe Biden also received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the historically Black college. In his remarks at South Carolina State University’s commencement ceremony, Joe Biden also addressed Congress’ failure to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Biden noted he has gotten to know George Floyd’s family well in the year and a half since the Black man was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020. The bill bearing Floyd’s name has passed the House, but it has stalled in the Senate, after bipartisan negotiations over policing reform broke down earlier this year. “On police reform, I share the frustration,” Biden said. “It’s not been passed in the Senate, but the fight’s not over.” Joe Biden is now speaking at South Carolina State University’s commencement ceremony, and he once again underscored the urgent need to strengthen voting rights. “We have to protect that sacred right to vote, for God’s sake,” Biden said. “I’ve never seen anything like the unrelenting assault on the right to vote.” The president’s comments come as Senate Democrats are discussing potential changes to the filibuster to allow voting rights legislation to advance in the evenly divided chamber. Senate Republicans have used the filibuster to block multiple voting rights bills, as Democrats do not have the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster. “This battle is not over. We must pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. We must,” Biden told the graduates of the historically Black university. “We’re going to keep up the fight until we get it done, and you’re going to keep up the fight, and we need your help badly.” House majority whip Jim Clyburn noted that his wife, Emily Clyburn, graduated from South Carolina State University as well. Emily was the person who encouraged her husband to endorse Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. That endorsement was crucial to Biden’s victory in the South Carolina primary, which was the start of his successful comeback campaign. “When I looked among those 20-some odd candidates running for the Democratic nomination, several of whom were very close friends of ours, I remembered what she said to me,” Clyburn said. “And I followed her directions, just as I did for the 58 years that we were married.” Emily passed away a few months before the South Carolina primary, so she did not live to see Biden’s victory and inauguration. The commencement ceremony at South Carolina State University is now underway, and Joe Biden is expected to soon begin his remarks. Prior to the president’s speech, House majority whip Jim Clyburn, a graduate of the historically Black university, delivered remarks as well. Clyburn encouraged the students to never give up on their goals, recounting how he lost three races for Congress before being elected to the House. “If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again,” Clyburn said. “No matter how many times you attempt, you keep trying until you get it right.” During the commencement ceremony, Clyburn will walk across the stage because he never got the opportunity to do so when he graduated from the university in 1961. The Washington Post explains: In December 1961, James E. Clyburn was a 21-year-old at South Carolina State University who had completed all his credits and was set to graduate. However, because the school at the time allowed only one commencement ceremony a year — usually in the spring — Clyburn received his diploma in the mail instead of marching alongside his classmates. He could have returned to walk in the 1962 ceremony, but by then he was busy with a new teaching job in Charleston. Sixty years later, Clyburn, now an 81-year-old Democratic congressman from South Carolina and the House majority whip, will get the opportunity to experience the pomp and circumstance of the college graduation ceremony he never had. And a special guest will hand him his diploma: President Biden, who is giving the commencement address at the school on Friday. ‘It means a great deal to me,’ Clyburn said Thursday on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ Trump supporters and members of far-right extremist groups who took part in the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January are raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from online crowdfunding sites by portraying themselves as maligned American patriots, martyrs and “political prisoners”. Several of the highest-profile participants in the “stop the steal” insurrection which attempted to disrupt Joe Biden’s certification as US president are raising substantial sums on fundraising sites. They include members of the far-right Proud Boys and many of the 6 January individuals being detained in a Washington DC jail, awaiting trial for allegedly attacking police officers. In their donations appeals they are drastically rewriting history. Their scripts transform 6 January from what it was – a violent attempt to overthrow the democratic results of the 2020 presidential election on behalf of Donald Trump – into the fantasy that it was a peaceful and patriotic protest to uphold voter integrity. “It’s shocking to say, but America now has legitimate political prisoners, en masse,” says the fundraising page titled American Gulag for Jan 6 Political Prisoners which has so far raised $41,000. The page, created by Jim Hoft, founder of the conspiracy site Gateway Pundit, claims that there are “scores of political prisoners wrongfully imprisoned as a result of the protest on January 6th”. Meanwhile, Trump ally and political operative Roger Stone has arrived on Capitol Hill for his deposition before the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Stone declined to comment as he entered the Capitol, per Politico: Stone is expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in an attempt to avoid complying with the committee’s subpoena, which was issued last month. According to CNN, Stone’s lawyer, Grant Smith, wrote in a letter to the committee last week that “pursuant to the rights afforded him by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, he declines to be deposed or to produce documents”. Joe Biden is now en route to South Carolina, where he will be delivering remarks today at South Carolina State University’s 2021 fall commencement ceremony. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, gaggled with reporters aboard Air Force One during the flight, and she gave an update on the Build Back Better negotiations. “The president’s going to get this done and we’re going to get it across the finish line,” Psaki said. “And yes, it’s going to take more time than we anticipated.” The press secretary argued Biden was the right leader to navigate his party through these complicated negotiations, pointing to his experience in helping major legislation like the Affordable Care Act advance through Congress. On the issue of families not receiving checks from the expanded child tax credit program next month, Psaki suggested families may receive double payments in February if Democrats can pass their bill in time. However, the president and Joe Manchin remain far apart in the talks, so it’s unclear whether the party can pass the bill next month either. In his statement yesterday, Joe Biden also provided an update on the state of Senate Democrats’ negotiations over amending the filibuster to advance a voting rights bill. “We must also press forward on voting rights legislation, and make progress on this as quickly as possible,” Biden said. “I had a productive conversation today with several Senators about how we can get this vital legislation passed. Our democracy is at stake.” A group of moderate Democratic senators has been trying to determine what filibuster changes could win the support of Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema and thus allow a voting rights bill to move forward. Senate Republicans have successfully used the filibuster to block multiple voting rights bills because the rule requires a 60-vote majority to advance legislation, and that is an extremely high bar in a 50-50 chamber. However, Sinema has signaled she is still staunchly opposed to amending the filibuster, stifling Democrat’s hopes of getting a voting rights bill to the president’s desk anytime soon. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Joe Biden has acknowledged what many in Washington have known for at least several days at this point: the Build Back Better Act will not pass Congress this year. In a lengthy statement released yesterday evening, Biden said he has updated congressional leaders about his recent talks with centrist Senator Joe Manchin, the key swing vote in the negotiations. “In these discussions, Senator Manchin has reiterated his support for Build Back Better funding at the level of the framework plan I announced in September,” Biden said. The president pledged that Democrats will “advance this work together over the days and weeks ahead” and bring a final bill to the Senate floor “as early as possible”. “My team and I are having ongoing discussions with Senator Manchin; that work will continue next week,” Biden said. “It takes time to finalize these agreements, prepare the legislative changes, and finish all the parliamentary and procedural steps needed to enable a Senate vote.” For millions of American families, the slow pace of the negotiations means they will not be receiving a check next month from the expanded child tax credit program, which has become a lifeline for many working parents. (The bill was supposed to extend the expanded program for another year.) And the longer the talks stretch on, the more unlikely it seems that Democrats will ever be able to pass any version of the bill at all. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned."

          "bodyText": "Half of adults in the UK have now had a Covid-19 booster dose, Boris Johnson has said, after the programme was accelerated this week in the face of Omicron.A total of 26.3 million people aged 18 and over have received a vaccine top-up. The government said the milestone makes the UK’s booster rollout one of the fastest in the world. Health experts have advised the Dutch government to adopt a “strict” lockdown to stem the spread of the Omicron variant, RTL Nieuws reported on Friday. Germany has designated France and Denmark as high-risk zones for the transmission of coronavirus and will impose quarantine on unvaccinated travellers from the two countries, a public health agency said.The requirement will be imposed from Sunday and will also apply to travellers from Norway, Lebanon and Andorra, with those unvaccinated or who have not recovered from the virus subject to quarantine with the possibility of testing on day five, AFP reports. Ireland has announced an 8pm curfew for hospitality venues and a 50% limit on capacity for events in a bid to slow the spread of Omicron. The new measures will come into force on Sunday (19 December) and remain in place until 30 January. England had 65 patients in hospital with Omicron today, the UK Health Security Agency said. The total number of deaths from the new variant in England remains unchanged at one. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said there needs to be “swift engagement with the treasury” on Covid-19 support funds during a phone call with Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. The risk of reinfection from Omicron is more than five times higher than Delta and shows no sign of being milder than the previous coronavirus variant, according to a study by Imperial College London. The results, based on data from the UK Health Security Agency and Britain’s National Health Service, analysed people who tested positive for Covid-19 in a PCR test in England between 29 November and 11 December. The UK reported 93,045 new Covid cases today, breaking the daily record for the third consecutive day. There were also 111 new Covid deaths reported and 7,611 patients in hospital, 875 of whom were on beds with ventilators. There were an additional 3,201 confirmed Omicron cases in the UK today, reports the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), nearly twice the number of infections announced yesterday (yesterday it was 1,691). Thousands of British tourists rushed to travel to France today in an attempt to beat the country’s ban on UK travellers, due to start at 11pm tonight. There were long queues at the port of Dover, reports PA Media, as people brought their Christmas travel plans forward in a bid to avoid the new restrictions. Switzerland has announced plans to tighten Covid measures - including working from home and entry restrictions for venues. From Monday, the government said it will expand proof of vaccination or recovery to many indoor venues, including restaurants, reports Reuters. For venues such as discos and bars, where masks are less likely to be worn, visitors will have to show a negative test result. Omicron could account for 80% of all new Covid cases in Portugal by the end of the month, the country’s health minister said today. England’s R value has risen to 1.0-1.2, the UK government said. An R value of between 1.0 and 1.2 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 10 and 12 people. The Danish prime minister today said her government would introduce new Covid restrictions, including closing theatres and cinemas, to try to control its spread. Mette Frederiksen said Omicron now accounts for a fifth of all coronavirus cases in Denmark. Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that Omicron is now the dominant Covid variant in Scotland, making up 51.4% of cases. She said that Omicron has “now replaced Delta” as the dominant Covid strain circulating in Scotland. Mexico’s health ministry reported 2,650 new cases of coronavirus infection and 211 additional deaths on Friday, Reuters reports. It brings the total number of confirmed cases to 3,930,015 and the death toll from the pandemic to 297,567. Officials have said the ministry’s figures likely represent a significant undercount of both Covid-19 cases and deaths. UK officials are drawing up plans for a two-week circuit breaker lockdown after Christmas, reports have suggested, including a ban on indoor mixing. The Times reported that draft regulations were being prepared which would ban meeting others indoors except for work purposes, and that pubs and restaurants would be limited to outdoor service only. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported that Boris Johnson was presented with a number of options on Friday under a so-called Plan C, ranging from “mild guidance to nudge people, right through to lockdown”. Boeing Co has suspended its coronavirus vaccination requirement for US-based employees, the plane manufacturer said. In an internal announcement, Boeing said its decision came after a review of a US District Court ruling earlier this month that halted the enforcement of President Joe Biden’s vaccine requirement for federal contractors, Reuters reports. Some big healthcare chains and companies such as General Electric, Spirit AeroSystems and Amtrak have also suspended vaccine mandates for workers. The US administered 491,892,649 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country as of Friday morning and distributed 606,975,165 doses, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Those figures are up from the 490,030,849 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Thursday out of 602,523,315 doses delivered. The agency said 240,775,382 people had received at least one dose while 203,479,206 people were fully vaccinated as of 6am ET on Friday, Reuters reports. People are waiting in long queues at the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras in London to beat new French restrictions set to come into force at midnight. The ban will mean only those with “compelling reasons” will be able to travel between the UK and France after 11pm and tourist or business trips will not be permitted. Egypt reported its first three cases of the Omicron variant, the health ministry said. “Two cases are not showing any symptoms, while the third suffers mild symptoms,” the ministry said. France president Emmanuel Macron has cancelled a December 20-21st trip to Mali to visit French troops due to France’s deteriorating health situation over the spread of the Omicron variant, his office said. “This decision was taken in order for there to be coherence between national measures and the president’s international agenda, and in order not to expose troops,” Macron’s office said. With France in the grip of its fifth wave, prime minister Jean Castex announced a new push on Friday to get people vaccinated and said people would have to show proof of vaccination to enter some venues, Reuters reports. Castex also cancelled a trip planned to visit French troops stationed in Jordan from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1. Half of adults in the UK have now had a Covid-19 booster dose, Boris Johnson has said, after the programme was accelerated this week in the face of Omicron. A total of 26.3 million people aged 18 and over have received a vaccine top-up. The government said the milestone makes the UK’s booster rollout one of the fastest in the world. On Twitter, the prime minister said: “A record day for vaccinations yesterday with an incredible 936,480 people coming forward. “That means 50% of adults have now received a booster dose.” Health experts have advised the Dutch government to adopt a “strict” lockdown to stem the spread of the Omicron variant, RTL Nieuws reported on Friday. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau said a spike in cases of the Omicron variant was “scary”, while the country’s top medical official made clear the healthcare system could soon be swamped. Case numbers are rapidly increasing in Canada, with several of the 10 provinces reporting big jumps as Omicron replaces Delta as the dominant variant, Reuters reports. “I know the record numbers we’re seeing in parts of the country are scary – but I also know we can get through this,” Trudeau tweeted, urging Canadians to get vaccinated and keep their distance from other people. Health minister Jean-Yves Duclos earlier urged provinces to impose more public health measures, and said Canada would once again require people returning home after foreign trips of less than 72 hours to produce a negative test. The UK’s cabinet secretary Simon Case has “recused himself” from leading an investigation into lockdown-breaking parties across Whitehall following allegations of gatherings in his own department. He had been tasked by the prime minister to investigate parties reported to have been held in Downing Street and the Department for Education in November and December 2020. And it was confirmed the scope could be widened to other alleged parties if Case thought it necessary. But following reports there were two parties held in the Cabinet Office in December 2020, a No 10 spokesperson said: “To ensure the ongoing investigation retains public confidence the Cabinet Secretary has recused himself for the remainder of the process.” “The work will be concluded by Sue Gray, second permanent secretary at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. “She will ascertain the facts and present her findings to the prime minister.” Germany has designated France and Denmark as high-risk zones for the transmission of coronavirus and will impose quarantine on unvaccinated travellers from the two countries, a public health agency said. The requirement will be imposed from Sunday and will also apply to travellers from Norway, Lebanon and Andorra, with those unvaccinated or who have not recovered from the virus subject to quarantine with the possibility of testing on day five, AFP reports. France’s prime minister Jean Castex likened the spread of the Omicron variant in Europe to “lightning”, adding that it would be the dominant strain in France from the start of 2022. Nearly 3,000 people are in intensive care with Covid-19 in France according to the latest figures. Meanwhile, eligibility for booster jabs will be reduced from five months from the date of the second vaccination to four, Castex added. He said the government would announce new measures to tackle non-vaccination from next year, AFP reports. Spain’s coronavirus infection rate rose above 500 cases per 100,000 people on Friday, crossing the threshold considered “very high risk” by the country’s health ministry. The rate has more than doubled since the start of December, Reuters reports. On Friday the infection rate, or incidence, as measured over the preceding 14 days, was 511 cases per 100,000, up 38 points on Thursday’s 473. There were 33,359 new infections and 41 deaths according to Health Ministry data. Roughly 80% of Spain’s population of 47 million has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and about 10m have received booster shots. Omicron is having a significant impact on staff at a large hospital trust in England with hundreds off work due to illness, leading to the cancellation of non-essential services to tackle a surge in admissions driven by the variant. Guy’s and St Thomas’ trust (GSTT) in London is preparing to redeploy staff to work in its A&amp;E and intensive care units to cover for the growing number of staff who are off sick. It has seen the number of hospitalised patients with Covid it is treating jump by a third over the last week and is bracing itself for worse to come in the days ahead. Ireland has announced an 8pm curfew for hospitality venues and a 50% limit on capacity for events in a bid to slow the spread of Omicron. The new measures will come into force on Sunday (19 December) and remain in place until 30 January. England had 65 patients in hospital with Omicron today, the UK Health Security Agency said. The total number of deaths from the new variant in England remains unchanged at one. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said there needs to be “swift engagement with the treasury” on Covid-19 support funds during a phone call with Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. A spokesperson for Sturgeon told PA Media the call was constructive “though at this stage inconclusive” and that they “shared respective views on the current Omicron situation and agreed that it represents a significant threat to health and the economy”. The risk of reinfection from Omicron is more than five times higher than Delta and shows no sign of being milder than the previous coronavirus variant, according to a study by Imperial College London. The results, based on data from the UK Health Security Agency and Britain’s National Health Service, analysed people who tested positive for Covid-19 in a PCR test in England between 29 November and 11 December. The UK reported 93,045 new Covid cases today, breaking the daily record for the third consecutive day. There were also 111 new Covid deaths reported and 7,611 patients in hospital, 875 of whom were on beds with ventilators. There were an additional 3,201 confirmed Omicron cases in the UK today, reports the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), nearly twice the number of infections announced yesterday (yesterday it was 1,691). Thousands of British tourists rushed to travel to France today in an attempt to beat the country’s ban on UK travellers, due to start at 11pm tonight. There were long queues at the port of Dover, reports PA Media, as people brought their Christmas travel plans forward in a bid to avoid the new restrictions. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, played down claims of disagreement with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, over public advice on Covid as he warned of a “big wave of Omicron”. He said that Omicron is “a very serious threat to us now” and urged people to get booster jabs. Switzerland has announced plans to tighten Covid measures - including working from home and entry restrictions for venues. From Monday, the government said it will expand proof of vaccination or recovery to many indoor venues, including restaurants, reports Reuters. For venues such as discos and bars, where masks are less likely to be worn, visitors will have to show a negative test result. Omicron could account for 80% of all new Covid cases in Portugal by the end of the month, the country’s health minister said today. England’s R value has risen to 1.0-1.2, the UK government said. An R value of between 1.0 and 1.2 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 10 and 12 people. The Danish prime minister today said her government would introduce new Covid restrictions, including closing theatres and cinemas, to try to control its spread. Mette Frederiksen said Omicron now accounts for a fifth of all coronavirus cases in Denmark. The German health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said he expects the Omicron variant to lead to a “massive fifth wave” of the pandemic. Lauterbach, a former epidemiology professor, said during a visit to the Lower Saxony region that Germany must prepare for a challenge “that we have never seen in this form before”, reports Reuters. Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that Omicron is now the dominant Covid variant in Scotland, making up 51.4% of cases. She said that Omicron has “now replaced Delta” as the dominant Covid strain circulating in Scotland. The German government is looking into whether the UK should be classified as a “virus variant area”, reports Reuters, following the rapid rise of Omicron in the country. Classification as a virus variant area would mean that travellers arriving in Germany from the UK would be required to quarantine for two weeks, even if they are vaccinated. That’s it from me for today. Handing over now to my colleague Nadeem Badshah. Thanks for reading. The UK chancellor has met with business groups to talk about possible support amid the rising threat posed by Omicron. Rishi Sunak met virtually with the Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the British Chambers of Commerce on Friday afternoon, after he returned early from a trip to California, reports PA Media. A Treasury spokesperson said: The chancellor spoke to business and industry leaders this afternoon. We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected. The groups raised concerns about the impact of cancellations and the importance of clear messaging from the government. Earlier today a spokesperson for the German health ministry said the government was considering classifying the UK as a “virus variant area” following the rapid rise of Omicron in the country (see also 11:19) and said the government was expected to make a decision later today. No news on that as yet, but the latest update to the designation of international risk areas by the Robert Koch Institut this evening did not feature any new countries in the virus variant areas list. For now, the UK remains on the “high risk areas” list. Ireland has announced an 8pm curfew for hospitality venues and a 50% limit on capacity for events in a bid to slow the spread of Omicron. The new measures will come into force on Sunday (19 December) and remain in place until 30 January. Announcing the measures, the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said Covid is “exploding throughout Europe”. He said they are still “in the early days” but already it is “very clear” that they are dealing with a much more transmissible variant. “It is here, it is in our country and we’re going to see a massive rise in infections. Already, in just a few days, more than a third of all new cases in the country are as a result of Omicron,” he said. He added: “It spreads so aggressively throughout all age groups that we are likely to see infections at a rate that is far in excess of anything we have seen to date. It is that serious.” Across the UK, 64% local authority areas have seen an increase in Covid rates week-on-week, while Lambeth in London has the highest rate. According to an analysis by PA Media, Lambeth had 4,021 new cases in the seven days to Monday (13 December) - the equivalent of 1,249.5 per 100,000 people. Wandsworth and Southwark had the second and third highest rates, at 1,178.8 and 1,160.3 per 100,000 respectively. The give UK areas with the biggest rises were all in London: Lambeth, Hackney and City of London, Southwark, Wandsworth and Islington. Newry, Mourne and Down had the highest rate per 100,000 in Northern Ireland (758.0) and West Lothian had the highest in Scotland at 410.7. Isle of Anglesey had the highest rate in Wales at 665.8 per 100,000 people. Pfizer today said that it expects the Covid-19 pandemic to continue until 2024. The pharmaceutical company also said that it is testing a lower-dose version of its vaccine for two to four-year-olds but that it generated a weaker immune response than it had hoped, potentially delaying its authorisation, reports Reuters. “The data are illustrating the impact of a booster and that our vaccine works best as a primary regimen of three doses,” the company’s chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, said on a conference call. Pfizer said it expects its vaccine, which it developed with BioNTech, to generate a revenue of $31bn next year. England had 65 patients in hospital with Omicron today, the UK Health Security Agency said. The total number of deaths from the new variant in England remains unchanged at one, reports Reuters. Care homes in England have been warned not to impose blanket visiting restrictions over Christmas. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), the independent regulator of health and social care, said it is important for residents to be able to spend time with friends and family during the festive period. It said it had received reports of some care homes have issued “general policy” on visiting and that it had taken action on 54 concerns about potential blanket bans, reports PA Media. The Relatives and Residents Association, which supports people in care and their families, said it is “astonishing and simply unacceptable that the regulator has not taken a proactive role”. Kate Terroni, CQC chief inspector of adult social care, said: The pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on many people and we know it has been particularly difficult for those who are living in care homes and their families and loved ones. It is important that people are able to spend time with their loved ones over the festive season, including Christmas day and new year. Recently updated government guidance limits visitor numbers who can visit regularly to three plus one essential caregiver. It said it expects and encourages providers to “facilitate visits wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way”. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said there needs to be “swift engagement with the treasury” on Covid-19 support funds during a phone call with Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon. A spokesperson for Sturgeon told PA Media the call was constructive “though at this stage inconclusive” and that they “shared respective views on the current Omicron situation and agreed that it represents a significant threat to health and the economy”. The spokesperson added: The first minister emphasised the extreme urgency of the crisis for businesses in the hospitality, events, culture and related sectors which are already suffering a severe financial impact, and stressed that they needed immediate assurances of support from the treasury. The prime minister agreed that there needed to be swift engagement with the treasury on the immediate action needed, and committed to further talks over the weekend. The first minister also made clear that the devolved administrations require clarity that additional funding support would be available, and also on how it can be triggered by any or all of the UK administrations, in the event of further protective measures being necessary to tackle the virus in the period ahead. Peter Beaumont reports on the latest from South Africa: Vaccines and high levels of prior exposure to coronavirus in South Africa appear to be protecting against the more severe symptoms seen in the previous three waves of the pandemic, according to the country’s health minister. The suggestion that previous exposure to another variant of coronavirus – or vaccination – might provide protection from the Omicron variant echoes analysis by South African experts earlier this week that suggested prior exposure or vaccination gave a degree of protection from serious disease. That has been backed by several reports, including by public and private health providers, that suggest a lower level of hospital admissions during the current wave. The World Health Organization (WHO) has given emergency approval to a coronavirus vaccine made by US-based Novavax and the Serum Institute of India. It is hoped that the approval of the new vaccine, CovavaxTM, could pave the way for its inclusion in the UN-backed Covax programme to enable access to vaccines to poorer countries, reports Reuters. Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant-director general for access to medicines and health products, said: This listing aims to increase access particularly in lower-income countries, 41 of which have still not been able to vaccinate 10% of their populations, while 98 countries have not reached 40%. Pubs and restaurants in Ireland are set to close at 8pm under new proposals (see also 16:02) going to cabinet this evening in response to Omicron, reports the Irish Independent. The newspaper reports that the cabinet sub-committee has rejected a recommendation by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) to close hospitality venues at 5pm, instead opting for 8pm. It also reports that the curfew would also apply to hotel bars and restaurants as well as other indoor events. Swiss ski resorts are open for foreign visitors as long as they respect the rules that the government has introduced to try and break the momentum of the coronavirus pandemic, said health minister Alain Berset. Reuters reported Berset’s comments: “The government’s goal is to keep as much as possible functioning, of course under different conditions as if there were no pandemic.” Canada will lift the travel ban on people who have visited 10 African countries from 19 December while all passengers returning from short foreign trips will be required to submit negative pre-arrival Covid-19 tests from 21 December, Reuters reports. Tour operators say the testing measure is onerous and deters travel, but Covid-19 case numbers are rapidly increasing in Canada and the federal government has implored residents to avoid international trips. Unvaccinated children in the US will be allowed to stay in school even if they have been exposed to Covid-19 provided they test negative daily, according to a new strategy published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Reuters reported that the institute’s director Rochelle Walensky said: “If exposed children meet a certain criteria and continue to test negative , they can stay at school instead of quarantining at home.” Ireland has announced that 35% of Covid cases are now of the Omicron variant, up from 27% on Thursday, Reuters reports. The risk of reinfection from Omicron is more than five times higher than Delta and shows no sign of being milder than the previous coronavirus variant, according to a study by Imperial College London. The results, based on data from the UK Health Security Agency and Britain’s National Health Service, analysed people who tested positive for Covid-19 in a PCR test in England between 29 November and 11 December, reports Reuters. “We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta,” the study said, although it noted that data on hospitalisations remains very limited. “Controlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region and specimen date, Omicron was associated with a 5.4-fold higher risk of reinfection compared with Delta,” the study, which was dated Dec. 16, added. Imperial College said in a statement: “This implies that the protection against reinfection by Omicron afforded by past infection may be as low as 19%.” The institution also noted that the study had not yet been peer reviewed. Following the prime minister’s earlier announcement (see also 13:53) of a partial shutdown, the Danish parliament has approved new Covid restrictions on public spaces, with most coming into force at 8am on Sunday. The measures, announced by Mette Frederiksen earlier today, include the closure of theatres, cinemas, concert halls, amusement parks, museums and galleries and limitations on shops and restaurants, reports Reuters. Shops and restaurants smaller than 2,000 square metres will have to impose limits on customer numbers and restaurants must stop serving food and alcoholic drinks at 10pm and close at 11pm. The government is also advising people to limit social contacts over Christmas and urged people to work from home where possible. “We are not talking about shutting down the whole country as we did last year,” Frederiksen said. “Our goal is still to keep as large sections of society open as possible. We need to curb activity. We all need to limit our social contacts.” The country reported 9,999 new cases on Thursday, and the number was above 11,000 on Friday, the prime minister said. The UK reported 93,045 new Covid cases today, breaking the daily record for the third consecutive day. There were also 111 new Covid deaths reported and 7,611 patients in hospital, 875 of whom were on beds with ventilators. It comes after yesterday there were 88,376 new cases reported and 78,610 new cases the day before, both breaking all previous pandemic records. Tensions between the Irish government and its public health advisers are rising after it was suggested that all pubs should close at 5pm to combat the spread of the Omicron Covid variant. Government ministers are meeting members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (PHET) but are facing a backlash from the hospitality sector, which only saw the last of 20 months of restrictions eased in October with some reintroduced this month. The deputy taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, tweeted “Omicron beginning to show in the figures, unfortunately” with the finance minister Paschal Donohoe saying some further restrictions are likely. Around one in 20 Omicron cases identified in England has been linked with a previous infection of Covid, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). A new analysis found that of 5,153 individuals identified with an Omicron infection between 1 November and 11 December, 305 (5.9%) were connected to a previous confirmed infection and were at least 90 days from previously testing positive, reports PA Media. The age range of these cases ranged from six to 68 years, while there were four people for whom Omicron was their third coronavirus infection. Meanwhile, Dr Jenny Harries, the UKHSA’s chief executive, said that lateral flow tests are just as likely to detect Omicron as they are other Covid variants. She said: Our data shows that LFD [lateal flow] tests are similarly able to detect Covid-19 in individuals who have been exposed to Omicron as in those exposed to previous variants. This is very encouraging. As we all work to limit the high levels of transmission of this variant over the Christmas period, we are urging people to test regularly, particularly before attending social gatherings. As always, the booster vaccine remains the best protection against infection. Please come forward to receive your booster as soon as possible. The far right is using Covid misinformation to expand their reach, report David Klepper and Lori Hinnant for the Associated Press after a study found that nine out of 10 of the most viewed posts in a sample contained misleading claims about the safety of vaccines or pharmaceutical companies. “Covid-19 has served as a catalyst for radicalisation,” said Ciaran O’Connor, the author of a new study and an analyst at the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “It allows conspiracy theorists or extremists to create simple narratives, framing it as us versus them, good versus evil.” If the spread of Omicron continues at this rate, a small proportion of Covid hospitalisations is a serious matter, reports science correspondent Nicola Davis: This is not about individuals. This is about the population. In most regions of the UK, Omicron infections are doubling more quickly than every two days, with Dr Susan Hopkins, thechief medical adviser for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), noting infections could reach 1m a day by the end of the month. While it is not yet clear what the ratio of hospitalisations to cases will be with Omicron, no vaccine offers 100% protection, meaning a proportion of those infected will still end up in hospital, while many have yet to receive all of their doses of the jabs. And, as many experts have pointed out, even a small proportion of a very large number is still a large number. Visitors from the UK will face the same pandemic rules entering Switzerland as any other travellers, the country’s health minister said today. Speaking at a press conference, Alain Berset made the comments in response to a question about France’s entry restrictions for visitors from Britain, reports Reuters. It comes as Switzerland today announced plans to tighten Covid restrictions (see also 14:43). Pfizer has said that it plans to start a small clinical trial testing its updated vaccine targeting Omicron next month, reports Reuters. The comments were reportedly made in an investor call. The UK’s latest Omicron figures have been published. There were an additional 3,201 confirmed cases today, reports the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), nearly twice the number of infections announced yesterday (yesterday it was 1,691). The latest figures bring the total number of UK confirmed Omicron cases to 14,909. Thousands of British tourists rushed to travel to France today in an attempt to beat the country’s ban on UK travellers, due to start at 11pm tonight. There were long queues at the port of Dover, reports PA Media, as people brought their Christmas travel plans forward in a bid to avoid the new restrictions. After the deadline, UK citizens will need a “compelling reason” to enter France, with trips for tourism or business banned. P&amp;O Ferries warned there were “large queues” at border control in Dover, with an estimated wait time of two-and-a-half hours, and Eurostar told people to avoid London St Pancras station unless they had a pre-booked tickets, as many trains were sold out. Several flights from the UK to France were also fully booked. The office of French prime minister, Jean Castex, said the decision was made “in the face of the extremely rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the United Kingdom”. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, played down claims of disagreement with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, over public advice on Covid as he warned of a “big wave of Omicron”. Asked about conflicting messages from the government and its advisers on socialising over Christmas, he said during a visit to a vaccination centre in Hillingdon, west London: What both Chris Whitty and I are saying is that there is a big wave of Omicron coming through. People need to be prudent. You need to think about your budget of risk. He said that Omicron is “a very serious threat to us now” and urged people to get booster jabs. He said: We are seeing a considerable wave coming through and people have got to be prepared and they have got to understand what it entails. It comes after some Conservative MPs claimed that experts are “running the show”. Fire crews in London are facing “unprecedented” staff shortages due to Omicron, leaving almost a third of fire engines out of action, according to the UK’s Fire Brigades Union (FBU). The union reports that staff shortages caused by Covid have left many fire engines out of action on several days in the last week. Citing London fire brigade statistics, the union said that 40 of London’s 142 fire engines were unavailable on both the day and night shift yesterday and that the same situation applied for the 10, 11 and 15 December. Throughout the rest of the week, engine unavailability was generally above 30, the union said. The union said that Covid has been “skyrocketing” among firefighters, with nearly 10% of operational firefighters having either tested positive or self-isolating. They said that yesterday 141 firefighters had tested positive and 283 were self-isolating. The FBU fears that staffing levels could worsen amid a potential “mass exodus” of hundreds of staff ahead of pension changes in the new year. Jon Lambe, the FBU London regional secretary, said: The new Omicron variant is having a devastating impact on the London fire brigade. But let’s be very clear – this should not be affecting London fire brigade the way it is, with almost a third of our fire engines unavailable. The reason that’s happening is firefighter numbers being too low, due to the devastating cuts imposed on the London fire brigade since 2010. London has lost one in five of its firefighters, 10 fire stations and 27 fire appliances since 2010, and seen huge cuts as a result of austerity such as almost 10% of its budget since 2016. Lambe added: Firefighters have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic assisting other agencies. Now, firefighters themselves need assistance and to be given the safety they require – they need to be appropriately resourced and ‘backed up’ at all times. London Fire Brigade deputy commissioner, Richard Mills, said: Throughout the pandemic we have consistently met our attendance targets. These are to get the first fire engine to an incident within a London-wide average of six minutes and a second fire engine within a London-wide average of eight minutes. Like all other emergency services we have faced staffing challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We continue to face these challenges as new variants are found and restrictions are updated and changed. We follow the relevant government guidance closely to keep our staff safe. Our fire cover is planned on a London-wide basis. If staff or fire engines at a particular station are unavailable for any reason, we move them from elsewhere to provide cover. This happens daily as crews deal with emergencies, carry out community safety work or train away from their station. Switzerland has announced plans to tighten Covid measures - including working from home and entry restrictions for venues. From Monday, the government said it will expand proof of vaccination or recovery to many indoor venues, including restaurants, reports Reuters. For venues such as discos and bars, where masks are less likely to be worn, visitors will have to show a negative test result. The measures, which will be in effect until 24 January, will also require people to work from home and limit private gatherings to 10 people if any adults in attendance have not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid. The Swiss government also said it is ordering 7m doses each from Moderna and Pfizer and BioNTech for the second half of next year to increase its stockpile to 34m doses. Andrew Lloyd Webber, the British theatre impresario, has said the theatre industry is being “decimated” by Omicron cancellations and criticised the government for not listening. He said it was “simply heartbreaking” to see how theatres are being impacted by Covid after he was forced to cancel last night’s performance of Cinderella with three hours notice due to “Covid-related absences”. Other West End shows impacted include Hamilton and The Lion King. Writing in the Daily Mail, Lloyd-Webber said: It has been a terrible few days and it is getting worse. It is simply heartbreaking for me to see our industry decimated by a situation beyond all of our control. We had to cancel yesterday evening’s performance of Cinderella with three hours’ notice. Five more members of the company have tested positive, on top of three on Thursday. We’re a very large production and every cancelled show is devastating, but we simply can’t rehearse around the gaps in the cast and cover the performance. He added: I have come to the conclusion that no-one in the Government listens. Certainly not the new Culture Secretary, Nadine Dorries, who has made it abundantly clear that she doesn’t think commercial theatre needs any support. It’s a difficult message for all the industries, jobs and people who are now lurching from day to day to hear from someone who is supposed to be a Tory minister representing the arts. A department for digital, culture, media and sport spokesperson said: Our unprecedented £2 billion Culture Recovery Fund has given out £1.5 billion in grants and loans, and almost £200 million to the devolved administrations. The £300 million third round of the Culture Recovery Fund is still open for applications, providing vital ongoing support for the cultural, heritage and creative sectors. We will keep the delivery of the programme under active review and consider how best to adapt it in line with the needs of the sector. For more on how the UK’s theatre industry is struggling with Covid, here’s the latest episode of Today in Focus: The French ban on British tourists, announced yesterday, will bring “economic disaster” to ski resorts, reports Reuters: In the French ski resort of Val d’Isere, staff had been hired, shelves fully stocked and everyone was looking forward to a good season until, that is, France banned British tourists due to fears over the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The ban was announced on Thursday, just two days before the start of the holiday season. “It’s an economic disaster,” said resort director Christophe Lavaut, pointing out that in Val d’Isere, the bulk of the clients come from Britain. “No business in any sector can make it, losing 42% of its clients in two days.” While he does not contest the need to take measures to fight the spread of the highly transmissible variant - and infections are soaring in Britain - he said his resort would need help from the government. The government has so far not announced any specific help. France’s statistics office forecast this week that the country’s economic recovery from the pandemic had proved stronger than expected this year, with growth on course for a 52-year high as Covid restrictions had been eased and the vaccination campaign gained momentum from mid-year. But for the ski sector, hoping for better times after the 2020/2021 season was all but wiped out, with ski lifts ordered shut, that is of little comfort. Jean-Marc Silva, of the France Montagne association, said Britons made up the single biggest foreign group of visitors to French mountain resorts, and accounted for 9% of clients - and an even bigger share of business as they enjoyed the apres-ski hospitality. “Brits love the mountains and don’t really have that many in their country, so they’ve made the French mountains their own,” Silva said. “It’s not the same clientele as the French,” Silva said. “The French visitor is here to ski. The British visitor will ski but he will also be the first at the after-ski activities ... They have this pub culture. They spend more than others. They really make the most of being there.” The White House has no plans for new Covid recommendations as yet, despite rising Omicron cases in the US, press secretary Jen Psaki said today. But Psaki said that the administration is continuing to assess possible new steps, reports Reuters. “We are constantly assessing what the impact of Covid is on the economy, whether it’s a new variant or rising cases in different parts of the country,” she said. It comes after president Joe Biden yesterday warned of a “winter of severe illness and death” for the unvaccinated as Delta and Omicron cases start to surge. Omicron could account for 80% of all new Covid cases in Portugal by the end of the month, the country’s health minister said today. Marta Temido said that at the moment Omicron represented around 20% of cases, but said: “It may be of 50% in the Christmas week and 80% in the last week of the year.” The country, which has one of the world’s highest Covid vaccination rates, reported 5,800 new infections on Wednesday in the highest daily jump since early February, but deaths and hospitalisations remained considerably lower than then, reports Reuters. Temido did not announce new Covid restrictions, but said that “more mask-wearing, more testing, more vaccination, more border control” were needed. Portugal currently requires all new arrivals to present a negative test. Remote working will be compulsory and schools will be closed in the first week of January. Yesterday, the prime minister, Antonio Costa, said those restrictions could be extended. Here’s more from the Associated Press on Denmark’s new Covid measures and the latest case numbers, which exceeded 11,000 today: Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday that theatres, cinemas, concert halls, amusement parks, museums and art galleries must shut down to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Frederiksen said stores smaller than 2,000 sq metres (21,528 sq ft) and restaurants in Denmark also must limit their number of customers. The government is advising residents to limit social contacts over the Christmas holidays. “We are not talking about shutting down the whole country as we did last year,” Frederiksen said. The shutdown order requires parliamentary approval. Lawmakers on the epidemic committee meet on Friday afternoon. Like many other European countries, Denmark is seeing an rise in Covid-19 cases, with health authorities saying the number of infections and hospitalisations has risen faster than expected. The country reported 9,999 new cases on Thursday, and the number was above 11,000 on Friday, the prime minister said. Last year, Denmark was one of the first European countries to close schools because of the pandemic. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said there were about 100 confirmed cases of Omicron in Wales in every health board area. But he made it clear that the modelling he has seen suggests that half of people in the UK could become infected with the strain. “It is the most serious development in the pandemic to date,” he told his press conference in Cardiff. “We see the storm gathering. The sky has darkened.” Drakeford said he believed the “epicentre” of the Omicron storm in Wales would be January and hoped the country would be past the peak in February. He said there were no plans to try to stop people travelling into Wales as Omicron was so fast-moving it would not be an effective measure. Asked about the disproportionate effect the decision to close nightclubs would have on young people, Drakeford said he wanted to keep them safe. He said the Welsh Covid pass system had kept clubs open – and could be used to get them re-opened in due course. England’s R value has risen to 1.0-1.2, the UK government said. An R value of between 1.0 and 1.2 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 10 and 12 people. The latest growth rate range for England is 0% to 2% per day, which means that the number of new infections are growing by up to 2% every day. The estimates represent the transmission rate of two to three weeks ago. The government warned that “these estimates will not fully reflect the recent rapid growth of Omicron.” Last Friday, the R range for England was 0.9 to 1.1 and the growth rate range for England was -1% to +2% per day. According to the latest figures, the R value was highest for London, which was at 1.1 to 1.3 and had a growth rate of 2 to 4% per day. The Danish prime minister today said her government would propose new Covid restrictions, including closing theatres and cinemas, to try to control its spread. Mette Frederiksen said Omicron now accounts for a fifth of all coronavirus cases in Denmark. Hundreds of inmates started fires in a prison in southern Thailand in a protest to demand better medical care for those suffering from Covid, reports the Associated Press. About 400 people at Krabi’s main provincial prison became violent last night when a group demanded that those infected with coronavirus be removed from the facility for treatment, justice minister Somsak Thepsuthin said. Inmates reportedly started destroying property in a sleeping area and starting fires. Around 300 police and security workers were sent to the prison in response. After overnight negotiations, 14 inmates with severe Covid symptoms were sent for treatment. To date, the corrections department has reported a total of 86,432 Covid cases and 185 deaths among Thailand’s prison population. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has called for the UK treasury to commit to a new furlough scheme if Wales needs to shut more parts of the economy down. Drakeford said: “Our ability to provide and sustain longer-term economic support during this new wave of this ongoing public health emergency is severely constrained by the current position of the UK treasury and its refusal to open vital support schemes, such as furlough. “These schemes should be available for all nations when they are needed and not just at the point at when restrictions are introduced in England.” Drakeford has ordered that all nightclubs should shut from 27 December and has made £60m from its own funds available to cover the cost of this and other restrictions it is bringing in through January. But Drakeford said it needed the “firepower” of the UK treasury if further restrictions were needed or if they had to last longer. He said it was “unfair” the treasury held the power over the funds. Nightclubs have threatened legal action against the move but Drakeford said that it was important to close them because of the danger club nights could be “super-spreader” events when one person passed on Omicron to many others. The German health minister, Karl Lauterbach, said he expects the Omicron variant to lead to a “massive fifth wave” of the pandemic. Lauterbach, a former epidemiology professor, said during a visit to the Lower Saxony region that Germany must prepare for a challenge “that we have never seen in this form before”, reports Reuters. In Scotland, Sturgeon said she has no choice but to act on Covid rise or it would overwhelm the health service and “cripple the economy”. She said the UK government “has to get its finger out” and provide the support that’s needed. She said people in England are changing their behaviour responsibly, impacting the hospitality industry there too, and that chancellor Rishi Sunak should get together a financial response to support industries that are suffering. Omicron has replaced Delta as the dominant Covid strain in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed at a lunchtime briefing. Last Friday, the highly transmissible new variant represented 15.5% of cases, whereas today it was 51.4%. “The tsunami I warned about last week is starting to hit us”, she said. Sturgeon underlined that the Omicron surge is not only an issue for the health service, but is putting a significant strain on the economy and other critical services as more and more people become infected and have to self-isolate. Responding to business leaders, who have pointed out the catastrophic impact of advice to stay at home and limit indoor social interaction over the festive period, she said she appreciated that this advice is a “cruel blow”. The Scottish government is putting £100m into helping the food and drink supply chain, wholesalers, culture and wedding sectors, but Sturgeon reiterated that the situation “now needs the type and scale of financial support available earlier in the pandemic that can only come from the UK government because it has borrowing powers that the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments simply do not have”. Sturgeon added that “I think many of us are finding it even harder this Christmas than last year”, and that it was understandable that people were feeling “sad upset , frustrated, even angry” but urged the public to “hold on to hope”. More on today’s ONS figures (see also 12:16), the percentage of people testing positive for Covid in eastern England and London in the last week is estimated to have increased last week. In London, south-east England and south-west England, around one in 50 people were likely to have tested positive – the highest proportion for any region. The lowest proportion was in north-east England and Yorkshire and the Humber at around one in 80. Sturgeon said that the financial mechanisms need to be put in place across the UK to properly compensate people for the impact of Covid on businesses. “Think very carefully about every interaction you’re having,” she said, warning if you get Covid now, you’ll be isolating on Christmas day. In the immediate term, boosters won’t be fast enough alone to “outrun” Omicron in Scotland, said Sturgeon. Potentially we have 7 more doubling cycles between now and the end of the year which could “pose the most severe challenges yet” for the NHS and the economy, she said. Businesses must now implement social distancing, enable home working and people must “reduce as much as possible” social contacts, with no more than three households, and test themselves beforehand. “In the run up to Christmas stay at home much more than you normally would and stay at home as much as you can,” she said. “Don’t risk” going out before Christmas and catching Covid, she said, adding that mixing with others comes with a strong risk of catching Covid. After Christmas if everybody continues limiting contacts, can hopefully minimise cases. Emergence of Omicron has been “the cruellest of blows,” she said, but urged people to “hold on to hope”. “We face a really difficult period again, ahead,” she said. But added: “We will get through it.” “Look out for each other and be kind,” she urges the country, adding that this is a time to pull together and support each other in every possible way. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, also confirmed a £100 million fund to help with the impact of Covid - £66 million of which is for the hospitality industry, £8 million for the food and drink supply chain and £20 million for the culture sector. Yesterday saw the highest number of vaccines they have ever delivered in a single day, she said. Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that Omicron is now the dominant Covid variant in Scotland, making up 51.4% of cases. She said that Omicron has “now replaced Delta” as the dominant Covid strain circulating in Scotland. She said: “The tsunami I warned about a week ago is now starting to hit us.” But she warned people should not be “fatalistic” about this and that there are actions that can be taken to slow the spread. She said there are 522 people in hospital with Covid, 10 fewer than yesterday, and a further 7 deaths were reported in last 24 hours. As of 5pm yesterday she said there were 696 confirmed Omicron cases in Scotland, however warned that it “very significantly underestimates the true volume of Omicron cases”. “Omicron cases have been rising exponentially, indeed faster than anything previously experienced in the pandemic,” she said, with cases doubling every 2-3 days. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports that the number of Omicron cases rose last week in England, Scotland and Wales, but that Delta was still the most common variant. It found that one in 60 people in England had Covid in the week ending 11 December. In Wales the figure was 1 in 55, in Northern Ireland it was 1 in 50 and in Scotland it was 1 in 80. One in 60 is the equivalent of about 936,000 people, reports PA Media. The proportion of people who were estimated to have coronavirus at the peak of the second wave in early January was one in 50. President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine is effective against the Omicron variant, reports Reuters. Sputnik V is one of Russia’s four domestically approved Covid vaccines. The German government is looking into whether the UK should be classified as a “virus variant area”, reports Reuters, following the rapid rise of Omicron in the country. Classification as a virus variant area would mean that travellers arriving in Germany from the UK would be required to quarantine for two weeks, even if they are vaccinated. A spokesperson for the health ministry said the government is expected to make a decision later today. It comes after France yesterday announced that it was banning all non-essential travel from the UK, starting from tonight. Hi, I’m looking after the blog for the next few hours covering UK and global Covid news. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk South African president Cyril Ramaphosa is making good progress with his recovery from Covid-19 while continuing to receive treatment for mild symptoms, the presidency said on Friday. Ramaphosa, who was given Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine in February, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. The Welsh government has said it is prioritising pregnant women for booster jabs after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised they should be considered an at risk group and given priority for Covid vaccinations. A statement said: For any mother-to-be, getting their first, second and booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is one of the most important things they can do to protect themselves and their unborn baby against coronavirus and, particularly against the new Omicron variant. New advice from Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) reinforces this message. The number of pregnant women coming forward for vaccination has been lower than we would want it to be, and this places mothers and their babies at risk. Based on the data about safety, together with the increased risk from Covid-19 the JCVI has advised that pregnant women should be considered as a clinical risk group and prioritised for Covid-19 vaccination. Those who have not yet had their first and second dose of the vaccine are being asked to contact their health boards for an appointment, while those waiting for a booster will be contacted like other priority groups. European Union governments have agreed to order over 180m doses of an adapted Covid-19 vaccine version against Omicron developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, the head of the European Commission said. Pfizer said it was not aware of the order, Reuters reports. The EU drugs regulator has so far said that there is no evidence that adapted vaccines are needed against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. “The member states have agreed to trigger a first tranche of over 180 million extra doses of adapted vaccines, in our third contract with BioNTech-Pfizer,” Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference last night at the end of a regular summit with EU leaders. The European Medicines Agency (EMA), the bloc’s drug regulator, meanwhile will not decide whether to approve Merck &amp; Co’s Covid-19 pill until after Christmas, a source with knowledge of the matter said. But the EMA will rule before Christmas on whether to give Gilead’s intravenous antiviral drug Remdesivir full marketing approval, the source said. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew RT Davies, has said he is thankful for the clarity the government’s announcement (see 08:36) has given families for Christmas but said the closure of venues such as nightclubs proves that the Covid pass scheme has failed. Davies said: The first minister’s decision to tighten in some areas after the festive period, and close venues such as nightclubs, is an admission that restrictions such as vaccine passports have failed and were never going to work in Wales. This is having a wide-ranging impact on Welsh firms in various sectors and the Labour government must now use the hundreds of millions of pounds left over in Covid support funding to help businesses and protect jobs. The leader of Westminster city council has said people’s decision to cancel plans in the Christmas period is having a “devastating” impact on hospitality and entertainment businesses in London’s West End, PA Media reports. Rachael Robathan said: The situation is deteriorating daily for our theatres, restaurants and bars – widespread cancellations are having a devastating effect and I fear for many hospitality and creative jobs. In Westminster we have 3,700 restaurants, clubs and bars – the largest number of any local authority – and it’s a sector that supports 80,000 jobs. The curtain is coming down on production after production in the West End, and it is heart-breaking after theatreland had only just got going again. I have already written to Rishi Sunak asking for help, but we don’t have time to deliberate – the government needs to step in and act now to avoid permanent damage to the economy of central London. South Africa’s health minister said on Friday that the government believes that vaccines and high levels of prior Covid-19 infection are helping to keep disease milder in a wave driven by the Omicron variant. Anecdotal reports suggests that the Omicron variant driving the fourth wave, which saw the country report a record number of daily infections earlier this week, is causing less severe illness than previous variants in South Africa – but scientists say it is too early to draw firm conclusions, Reuters reports. “We believe that it might not necessarily just be that Omicron is less virulent, but … coverage of vaccination (and) … natural immunity of people who have already had contact with the virus is also adding to the protection,” health minister Joe Phaahla told a news conference. “That’s why we are seeing mild illness.” South Africa has given 44% of its adult population at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, more than many African countries but well short of the government’s year-end target. But among the over-50s vaccination coverage levels are over 60%. Addressing the same news conference, Michelle Groome from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases said there had been an uptick in Covid-19 hospital admissions and deaths. “Starting to see a slight increase in deaths nationally, but once again this level is very much lower even than the baseline period we were seeing between the second and third waves,” Groome said. Phaahla said early indications were that infections might have peaked in the most populated Gauteng province, where cases initially surged. He added that in the coming week the health department would report back to the National Coronavirus Command Council on whether Covid-19 restrictions should be adjusted. Wales first minister Mark Drakeford hinted at the prospect of further restrictions in hospitality settings after Christmas, such as the return of the “rule of six”. He told BBC Breakfast: We’re seeing this week across the United Kingdom, people are voting with their feet because of anxiety about Omicron. We’ll be talking with the sector about whether we need to reopen with additional protections so that people feel confident that, if they do go out to a pub or restaurant, everything is being done to keep them safe. We would go back to the repertoire of things we needed to use earlier in the pandemic - some restrictions on the number of people who can meet wearing masks when you’re moving around inside pubs and restaurants, those sort of things that people are used to and have successfully used in the past. He said he will make an announcement on Monday about whether changes will be needed to allow large sporting events to go ahead. Thousands of travellers are trying to make it to France before a travel ban on UK tourists comes into effect on Saturday. PA Media reports: Cross-Channel rail operator Eurostar is urging people to avoid London St Pancras station unless they have a pre-booked ticket. Most of the firm’s train services on Friday were sold out as many people brought their Christmas travel plans forward after the new coronavirus restrictions were announced on Thursday. Ferry operators and airlines have also experienced a surge in demand. The French prime minister, Jean Castex, said tough restrictions will be enforced from Saturday, including a requirement for “compelling reasons” to travel to or from the UK. Trips for tourism or business will not be permitted. Castex’s office said this is “in the face of the extremely rapid spread of the Omicron variant in the United Kingdom”. All arrivals in France will need to provide evidence of a negative coronavirus test taken less than 24 hours in advance, and must isolate for at least two days. Hauliers are exempt from the new rules. Travel firms described the tourism ban as a “hammer blow”. Mark Drakeford, first minister of Wales, has announced new measures for businesses to come into effect after Christmas to help curb the spread of infections. From 27 December, nightclubs will have to close and a 2m rule on social distancing in offices will be introduced, alongside extra measures to protect customers and staff, such as one-way systems and physical barriers. Drakeford made the announcement late on Thursday evening ahead of the formal lockdown review on Friday. While no restrictions limiting gatherings over Christmas or travel were announced and Drakeford said the country would remain at Covid alert level zero, he stressed that the spread of Omicron was “a serious concern”. In a series of tweets, Drakeford urged people in Wales to get their booster jabs, to reduce socialising and to take “extra precautions”. such as taking a lateral flow test before meeting people, and meeting outdoors and working from home where possible. He said: Delta will continue to be the main cause of coronavirus infections in Wales up to Christmas. But we are seeing cases of omicron increasing rapidly every day in Wales – and across the UK. We need a plan to keep us safe this Christmas and we need stronger measures to protect us afterwards, as we prepare for a large wave of Omicron infections. Omicron poses a new threat to our health and safety. It is the most serious development in the pandemic to date. It is one we must take seriously. We will continue to put in place proportionate measures to protect people’s lives and livelihoods. The French ethics body CCNE has approved vaccination against Covid-19 for all children aged 5-11, BFM television reports on Friday. The ethics committee said it should be up to parents whether their children should be vaccinated or not, adding that a Covid health pass for children showing a person’a vaccination status should not be imposed. The government has pledged to follow this advice, Le Figaro reports. “It is important to vaccinate children and that take up of this vaccination is high”, said obstetrician Alexandra Benachi, a member of CCNE, during a press conference. Several European nations started vaccinating children aged five to 11 against the virus on 15 December, with Germany, Spain, Greece and Hungary among those opening up their inoculation drives to this age group. Medics reported strong initial demand from parents amid concerns about the fast-spreading Omicron variant. The chairman of UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative party said on Friday the country had appropriate support in place for those businesses being hit by a wave of infections from the Omicron coronavirus variant, and that no new money had been assigned. Oliver Dowden told Sky News: If you look at the kind of support that’s available – take the business rate relief, through to spring that will mean that businesses are paying a quarter of the business rates they would normally pay for. That’s why we’ve cut VAT and kept VAT cut at 12.5%. There’s also over a quarter of a billion pounds still with local authorities that could go to support businesses, and I know that the chancellor is working with them to get that money out. So we have proven that we’ll put the resources in and we will support those businesses and I know the Chancellor is committed to doing that. He added: We have already put support in place, of course we watch this hour by hour, day by day, and I know the chancellor is very closely engaged but at the moment we have appropriate support in place. Businesses in various sectors, especially hospitality, have been urging the government to provide more financial support after customers cancelled bookings in the crucial Christmas period due to record daily Covid-19 infections. New Covid guidance for businesses in Scotland has come into force to help prevent further spread of Covid-19. As of Friday, the Scottish government said businesses across the country are legally required to take “reasonable measures” to minimise transmission of the virus as Omicron infections continue to rise. PA Media reports: Its advice includes a return to one-way systems in premises, app-based ordering and the use of screens at service points. The hospitality sector has been encouraged to return to table service where practical and to consider measures to reduce crowding. Businesses have also been asked to consider a ticketing system during peak festive opening hours where appropriate, according to the latest advice. By law in Scotland, everyone over the age of 12 must wear face coverings indoors, unless exempt, and the new guidance stressed masks should be worn inside all businesses. Economy secretary Kate Forbes said it is “crucial” that everyone follows the latest advice to support businesses to keep their premises safe and prevent further transmission of Omicron. “All of these layers of protection will help to limit the spread of Omicron, especially as we approach the festive period,” she said. “I am also making a plea to be considerate to staff who are doing their best during this challenging period.” With the new guidance likely to have a financial impact on industry, the Scottish government said a £100m financial package for eligible businesses is being established to support them through this period. A sum of £100m for self-isolation support grants – grants for low-income workers who are required to self-isolate – is also being made available to those who need it. Forbes said the Scottish government is calling on the UK treasury to “step up and provide urgent funding” to businesses as the new Covid guidance comes into force. She added: “We are working to get funding out to businesses as soon as we can but the Treasury must also step up and provide urgent funding beyond what we are able to provide. “I wrote to the chancellor last night and the first minister has requested talks with the prime minister – this situation is serious and we need the UK government to engage with us on further support.” Hello, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be taking over for the next few hours. Don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have something to flag you think is relevant for our coverage, I’m on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. Hospitals in England are drawing up contingency plans for “significant staff absences” to ensure they can still provide “essential” care for the most seriously ill patients, as health leaders warn the Omicron variant is already triggering staff shortages in the NHS. Staff absences have tripled at one NHS trust in London in just a week, the Guardian has been told. Doctors say they are concerned about their ability to provide care if a significant proportion of colleagues are off sick. Amid mounting concern that soaring numbers of infections could take out large parts of the health workforce, the chief executives of all hospitals in England have been urged to review staff numbers for the next three months and draft workforce plans “to ensure essential services can be maintained”. Hospital bosses have also been told to begin training staff for potential redeployment immediately, according to a memo from Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England, and Prof Stephen Powis, its medical director. Read the full story here. Hello and thanks for joining us for today’s live blog. I’m Samantha Lock and I can certainly say that it feels as though a long week is finally drawing to a close. And what a week it has been with the Omicron variant continuing to cause chaos and uncertainty across the globe as we all hope to enjoy the holiday season with as much normalcy as possible. Finally some good news to share from the UK as the NHS reports a record 745,183 booster shots of the Covid-19 delivered on Wednesday. The previous record was 656,711 doses on Tuesday. Of the total number of boosters recorded yesterday 626,846 were delivered in England – the highest daily number on record. Bookings for boosters also continued to surge with a record number of appointments for top-ups made, the NHS said. The news follows data published by the UK Health Security Agency that showed two doses of a vaccine are not enough to stop people becoming unwell from Omicron. A third booster prevents around 75% of people getting any Covid symptoms, the NHS said. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has also continued to resist a lockdown. “We’re not saying that we want to cancel stuff, we’re not locking stuff down, and the fastest route back to normality is to get boosted,” he said. However, the good news does not come without caution after the G7 called the Omicron variant the “biggest current threat to global public health”, warning it is now “more important than ever” for countries to “closely cooperate”. “Deeply concerned by the rise in cases, ministers agreed that these developments should be seen as the biggest current threat to global public health,” Britain, which is currently chair of the group, said in a statement. To lighten an otherwise sombre mood in light of Covid concerns, First Dog on the Moon has published a new cartoon, looking back at the long year we’ve all just had. As the weekend approaches, some of us could take heed of this advice. If you’ve just joined us here is a quick snapshot of the latest Covid developments over the past few hours: The European Union’s drugs regulator has said that member states can use Pfizer’s antiviral Covid pill Paxlovid early after diagnosis of an infection even though its full review for regulatory approval has not been completed yet. France’s president Emmanuel Macron has said he will look at hospital capacity to make decisions about any future possible tightenings of restrictions in France and not just case numbers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it had received reports of eight cases of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation, in children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine, Reuters reports. A panel of outside advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday voted to recommend shots by Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna in the US in preference to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines, because of the risk of rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting. US president Joe Biden on Thursday warned of “a winter of severe illness and death” for those not vaccinated against Covid-19, amid a wave of Delta infections and as new Omicron cases are beginning to surge in America The G7 has called the Omicron variant the “biggest current threat to global public health”, warning it is now “more important than ever” for countries to “closely cooperate”. The demand for Covid boosters in surging in Australia where the shortening of booster intervals and spread of Omicron has created a huge demand for third jabs. Covid case numbers have also risen significantly in New South Wales and Victoria, with people across Australia are being urged to get a vaccine booster dose as soon as they are eligible. Health professionals have warned of problems caused by an increased demand for booster shots, after the emergence of the Omicron variant and a shortening of the interval between vaccine doses. Both GPs and pharmacist have spoken of issues with the booster rollout, from running out of vaccine to staff shortages. Read the full story here: South Korea has also just released its daily Covid numbers. Another 7,435 cases were confirmed in the past 24 hours alongside 73 deaths. The updates comes as the country is one day away from reinstating social distancing rules and a 9pm curfew for restaurants and cafes to combat spiralling numbers of new infections and hospitalisations. Curbs will return from 18 December to 2 January, limiting social gatherings to no more than four people - as long as they are vaccinated. Germany has just released its daily Covid report, confirming a further 50,968 coronavirus cases and 437 deaths in the past 24 hours according to the Robert Koch Institute. The figures are a slight increase in deaths on yesterday’s numbers as the European nation continues to battle a resurgence of the virus. On Wednesday, newly appointed health minister, Karl Lauterbach, warned that the country has insufficient vaccine doses to keep the population’s Covid defences up over the winter, especially with the predicted rise of the Omicron variant. Here is a bizarre story out of the US to add a little light relief to an otherwise sombre news day. A Florida man wearing a red thong as a face mask was forced off a United Airlines flight after failing to comply with the federal mask mandate. Adam Jenne, 38, was asked to leave the aircraft before it took off from Fort Lauderdale airport on Wednesday. He told local news channel NBC2 that he wanted to show the “absurdity” of forcing passengers to wear masks on planes while allowing them to be removed to eat and drink on board. “It’s all nonsense. Covid doesn’t know that we’re at cruising altitude. It’s stupid. The whole thing is theater,” Jenne told NBC2. He added he had worn underwear on his face during previous flights, and told the air crew that “it is a mask, doing its job.” Video of the incident, filmed by another passenger, showed the flight crew informing Jenne that he would not be able to stay on board if he kept the thong on his face. After some discussion, he finally left his seat. Guardian reporters Nick Evershed, Josh Nicholas and Andy Ball have compiled a fantastic interactive map showing how the Covid vaccine rollout has progressed globally. The visual tool provides a snapshot revealing which countries rolled out vaccines faster – and why. There has been a vast and continuing inequality in the global Covid vaccine rollout. In the case of Covid, inequality has been compounded by wealthy nations buying up doses, and the need to ramp up adult vaccination programs in countries that hadn’t had them before. The European Union’s drugs regulator has said that member states can use Pfizer’s antiviral Covid pill Paxlovid early after diagnosis of an infection even though its full review for regulatory approval has not been completed yet. “The Agency’s advice can now be used to support national recommendations on the possible use of the medicine before marketing authorisation,” the European Medicines Agency said in a statement. Earlier this week, the company said the experimental antiviral pill is highly effective in protecting against severe disease from coronavirus and is also effective against the Omicron variant, citing laboratory testing. In clinical trials, Paxlovid showed almost 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalisation and death in high-risk patients, Pfizer stated, replicating the results of a smaller-scale trial announced last month. A curious study just published in the Nature Communications journal has found unique antibody-like proteins found in a shark’s immune system that could possibly prevent the virus that causes Covid-19, its variants, and related coronaviruses from infecting human cells. The proteins, known as VNARs, are one-tenth the size of human antibodies. Aaron LeBeau, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor of pathology who helped lead the study, said: These small antibody-like proteins can get into nooks and crannies that human antibodies cannot access. They can form these very unique geometries. This allows them to recognise structures in proteins that our human antibodies cannot.” LeBeau and his team identified three candidate VNARs from a pool of billions that effectively stopped the virus from infecting human cells. The new VNARs will not be immediately available as a treatment in people, but they may help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks. The shark VNARs were able to neutralise WIV1-CoV, a coronavirus that is capable of infecting human cells but currently circulates only in bats, where SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, likely originated. LeBeau added: The big issue is there are a number of coronaviruses that are poised for emergence in humans. What we’re doing is preparing an arsenal of shark VNAR therapeutics that could be used down the road for future SARS outbreaks. It’s a kind of insurance against the future.” Our data also suggest that the three VNARs we identified would be effective at neutralising the existing Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants as well as variants yet to emerge. Should vaccination fail due to the emergence of a viral variant, alternative therapies like our VNARS, alone or in combination, are essential to maintaining control over the spread of the virus.” LeBeau and his lab in the School of Medicine and Public Health collaborated with researchers at the University of Minnesota and Elasmogen, a biomedical company in Scotland that is developing therapeutic VNARs. A quick snap from Reuters here that France’s president Emmanuel Macron has said he will look at hospital capacity to make decisions about any future possible tightenings of restrictions in France and not just case numbers. On Wednesday, Macron said it was possible the Covid vaccine would eventually be made compulsory in France, but added it was not the priority for now. We will have more on this story as it develops. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had received reports of eight cases of myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation, in children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine, Reuters reports. The CDC had previously said that reporting rates of myocarditis for boys aged 16 to 17 could be more than 69 cases per million second doses administered and around 40 cases per million second doses in boys aged 12-15 years old. The CDC did not say whether it believes there is a link between the myocarditis cases and the vaccine, or disclose the rate of myocarditis in the age group without vaccination. The agency said there had been over 7m vaccine doses in the 5-11 age group at the time it examined the data, with 5.1m first doses and 2 million second doses. The cases had a mild clinical course, the CDC said. The cases were reported in the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and presented by the CDC to a panel of its expert advisers. A panel of outside advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday voted to recommend directing Americans towards the mRNA vaccines for protection against Covid-19 – meaning the shots by Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna in the US – in preference to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines, because of the risk of rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting. The CDC’s advisory committee on immunisation voted unanimously to make the recommendation. The regulator still needs to sign off on the guidance. Cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots accompanied by a low level of platelets, have previously been reported in recipients of the J&amp;J vaccine. The highest reporting rates are in women under 50. The CDC said that the rate of such incidents is higher than previously estimated, both in women and men, with at least nine dead following such blood clotting incidents in the US, the CDC has noted. Members of the panel also said J&amp;J’s vaccine is less effective in preventing coronavirus than the other two vaccines authorised for use in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Read the full story here. US president Joe Biden on Thursday warned of “a winter of severe illness and death” for those not vaccinated against Covid-19, amid a wave of Delta infections and as new Omicron cases are beginning to surge in America. The US president spoke as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned the Omicron variant could peak as early as January and states are scrambling to prepare for overloaded hospitals. The US has passed 800,000 coronavirus deaths, including one in 100 Americans over the age of 65. After a briefing on the pandemic from advisers on Thursday afternoon, Biden said Omicron is “now spreading and it’s going to increase”. “For the unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death,” he said, urging Americans to get vaccinated and get their boosters as soon as possible. Read the full story here. The G7 has called the Omicron variant the “biggest current threat to global public health”, warning it is now “more important than ever” for countries to “closely cooperate”. Britain, which is currently chair of the group, said in a statement on Thursday: Deeply concerned by the rise in cases, ministers agreed that these developments should be seen as the biggest current threat to global public health. It is more important than ever to closely cooperate, and monitor as well as share data.” The G7 health ministers earlier held their final meeting hosted by Britain, which has seen a surge in cases over recent days, registering record numbers and a record day of booster jabs on Thursday. The ministers focussed on global access to diagnostics, genome sequencing, vaccines and therapeutics in a bid to combat its spread. “They also agreed on the increasing importance of booster campaigns and regular testing alongside continued non-pharmaceutical measures,” the statement said. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we go through all the latest coronavirus developments. Let’s start with the news that the G7 has called the Omicron variant the “biggest current threat to global public health”, warning it is now “more important than ever” for countries to “closely cooperate”. “Deeply concerned by the rise in cases, ministers agreed that these developments should be seen as the biggest current threat to global public health,” Britain said in a statement on Thursday. US president Joe Biden has also warned that the Omicron variant is “now spreading and it’s going to increase” as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested the variant could peak as early as January. “For the unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death,” he said, urging Americans to get vaccinated and get their boosters as soon as possible. There’s been a flurry of new developments over the past 24 hours so here is a snapshot of the key stories. CDC advisers recommend Pfizer and Moderna vaccines over Johnson &amp; Johnson. The panel cited the risk of rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting as well as a lower level of effectiveness against Covid in the J&amp;J shot. The European Commission says it has struck a deal with US pharmaceutical company Moderna to speed up delivery of its Covid vaccine, particularly with a view to supplying Germany with 10 million doses in December. Denmark broke its daily Covid record for the fourth day running, warning new restrictions were on the horizon. The UK recorded its highest tally of lab-confirmed Covid cases since the pandemic began – for the second day running – with almost 90,000 new infections. Independent SAGE said it’s urging a circuit-breaker lockdown until 24 December. England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty told MPs hospital admissions could peak above levels seen last winter, before the vaccine roll-out, given Omicron’s infectiousness. Italy reported its highest Covid case rate since 12 March, with 26,109 cases, jumping 90% on three weeks ago. Germany’s health minister Karl Lauterbac warned the country is lacking millions of Covid vaccine doses, imperilling the country’s defence against the highly-mutated Omicron strain. Poland reported its first case of the Omicron variant. In the UK Queen Elizabeth II has cancelled plans for a pre-Christmas family lunch. The R number for Omicron in the UK is estimated to be between 3 and 5, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UK Health and Security Agency, said. Indonesia is urging people not to travel abroad after the country detected its first Omicron case. Sweden is to end vaccine pass exemption for its Nordic neighbours. France is banning British tourists from Saturday amid concern over Omicron cases in the UK. Travel to and from the UK without “compelling reasons” – which does not include travel or business – will be banned. Israel says it is donating 1m Covid vaccines to the UN-backed COVAX program to reach African countries. New Zealand detected its first case of Omicron in an isolation facility. The Welsh government will bring in new restrictions including closing nightclubs and imposing a 2-metre social distancing rule in offices from 27 December UK prime minister Boris Johnson attended a pizza party in No 10 Downing Street during the May 2020 lockdown, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Independent reported."

          "headline": "Tiger Woods warns his return to competitive golf remains ‘a long way off’",
          "bodyText": "Tiger Woods has warned onlookers, excited by his reappearance on the golf scene, that a competitive return remains “a long way off”. The likelihood of Woods featuring at the Masters in April, for now, feels remote. Woods, whose lower right leg was shattered to the point of near-amputation in a car crash in February, will be seen again on a golf course at this weekend’s PNC Championship in Orlando. Woods, with the assistance of a cart, will play alongside his 12-year-old son, Charlie, in the family challenge. Woods, who has spoken tentatively about playing in majors and on the PGA Tour again, has cautioned that such a scenario is far from imminent. “It’s going to be a while,” said the 15-times major winner. “I couldn’t walk this golf course even right now and it’s flat. I don’t have the endurance. My leg is not quite right yet and it’s going to take time. I’m a long way from playing tournament golf. “This is hit, hop in a cart and move about my business. Being able to play tournament golf and being able to recover, practice and train and hit balls after a round and do all of the things that I need to be at a high level? I’m a long way away from that.” Woods, 46 later this month, has accepted that he cannot hit the ball as far as before the accident in California. “I’m just starting to get back into trying to play again,” he said. “So I don’t quite have the endurance that I would like to have. I’ve still got the hands, I’ve still the feel. Unfortunately sometimes the feel doesn’t really match up with the speed or the shot that I’m seeing, so that’s one of the things that Joe [LaCava, Woods’s caddie] and I were talking about. “The ball is not quite flying as far as I’d like or I’m used to and so we have to talk about some of the numbers and some of the shots and making some of those small adjustments.” Woods dismissed the suggestion he could use a buggy to feature in mainstream competition, which would be possible via medical exemption. “Absolutely not,” he said. “Not for a PGA Tour event, no. That’s just not who I am. That’s not how I’ve always been, and if I can’t play at that level, I can’t play at that level. But this is a different event. This is a fun event.”"

          "headline": "‘It’s a fraught moment’: Omicron puts brakes on US return-to-office plans",
          "bodyText": "Large US companies are now pulling back on plans to return to in-person work in light of the Omicron variant’s rapid spread across America. Employers planning to call remote workers back into the office in the new year are now pausing those efforts, and they are wary of setting new return dates only to push them back once again in the face of continued uncertainty and risks from the pandemic. The pandemic is also driving changes in how in-person employees work, with a renewed push for strikes and unionization across several industries where workers have frequently faced long hours and unsafe conditions. Alphabet’s Google, Meta, Apple, Uber, Lyft, Ford, DoorDash, DocuSign and Fidelity are among the companies that have delayed returns to the office. “It’s warranted, given the uptick that we’ve seen in cases,” Bradford Bell, director of the Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies at Cornell University’s ILR School, said. The delays also depend on where the offices are located, he said. “They’re very much looking at this on a location-by-location basis.” Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees in a memo on Wednesday that the partial return to offices, planned for 1 February, was now pushed to a “date yet to be determined”, after several other delays over the past two years. Cook offered employees a $1,000 bonus to help improve their home offices. Apple’s offices remain open and employees are still going in to work in countries with lower Covid rates, he said. But he specifically pointed to the global rise in cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant as a cause for concern. Google and Uber were among the first to announce the indefinite delays in early December after planning for early January returns. Google planned to reopen offices fully no later than 10 January, but has now delayed that deadline indefinitely, though offices in several places have already reopened. Meta was planning to open early in 2022 but is now allowing workers to come back as late as June. Janelle Gale, the company’s vice-president of human resources, said “some aren’t quite ready to come back”. In contrast, Twitter went fully remote forever in October. Lyft’s offices will open in February, but workers can stay remote for the entirety of next year – one of the longest delayed returns, partly due to worries over Omicron and other variants that may emerge. Fidelity Investments said on Monday it was pausing its return-to-work plans. DocuSign has delayed its fourth attempt to return. DoorDash’s corporate employees were going back to the office in 2022 in a hybrid approach, but now the company is waiting to see what the new plan should be. Ford planned to return with a hybrid work model for employees working at the headquarters in January, but that is now planned for March. Notably, hourly employees at Ford returned to in-person work in May 2020. And gig workers at Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and elsewhere have continued working through the pandemic, despite frequently feeling unsafe on the job. About half of full-time workers surveyed in the US said their jobs could be done remotely, according to a Gallup poll. And nearly one-third of the workers said they never wanted to work in the office; the majority wanted a hybrid model. In September, 45% of full-time employees were working remotely some or all of the time, with nine out of 10 remote workers wanting to continue that way, according to a Gallup poll. One-third of employees who could work remotely are doing so, according to a survey from Willis Towers Watson, a global advisory firm. That number was expected to decline in 2022, before the advent of Omicron. One of the challenges for companies is “trying to build momentum in terms of getting people back into the office”, Bell said. Companies are worried that if they open their offices before employees are ready, the momentum will stall – and they’re wary of forcing anyone back with office mandates. “So they’re waiting for the right time to really make that happen,” Bell said. The pandemic could bring lasting changes to the ways we work – for those who have jobs that can be done remotely. “It’s certainly a real issue” for those who can’t work remotely, Bell said. “I think that’s why we’ve seen an uptick in strikes and other things over the last several months where people are wanting – not necessarily a level playing field, but want their sacrifices recognized by their employers.” In-person employees should continue to have support for working safely, including masking, distancing and vaccination mandates. “All those things matter,” Bell said. The US is experiencing record-low unemployment even as cases surge. “It’s a fraught moment, and it’s a time where I think the power dynamic has really shifted, with the Great Resignation and the labor shortages,” Bell said. “It’s put labor in the driver’s seat,” with moves like the first Starbuck union, in Buffalo, New York, he said. “Employees realize that they, to a certain degree, have the upper hand and so can really start bringing these issues to the forefront.”"

          "bodyText": "The year’s best film is a western, based on a novel from the 1960s when the western was a more accepted and popular genre than it is now. But it modifies that genre, creating something more elusive and unmanageable: western psychodrama? Western gothic? And it tackles issues around sexual politics, toxic masculinity and family dysfunction in a very contemporary way. The Power of the Dog is Jane Campion’s first feature film in more than a decade, the last 10 years having been mostly taken up with her hit streaming-TV series, Top of the Lake, with Elisabeth Moss. Maybe that project influenced the element of murder mystery in this latest film, whose title is taken from Psalms 22:20: “Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog!” Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons play two brothers, Phil and George, who run a cattle ranch in 1920s Montana. Phil is a sweaty roughneck: an instinctive and vicious bully who calls his brother “fatso”, encourages the ranch-hands to mock him and jeers at George’s pretensions to fancy clothes and hats. In his self-important and self-congratulatory way, Phil is obsessed with the fact he is the one with the hands-on, practical know-how to make the ranch work, unlike his milksop brother, because he learned these skills from a veteran rancher, now dead, called Bronco Henry. But Phil is also repressed and utterly reliant on George emotionally: the two men share a bedroom in their large house like little kids. But which of these two is putting on airs? Who is putting on the act? The two brothers come from money: their rich, sophisticated and politically well-connected parents staked them in the business. There is an excruciating scene when the elderly couple come for dinner: George insists on dressing up in a tux. But Phil embarrasses everyone by showing up sweaty and dirty. The existing tensions between the brothers explode into the open when George reveals to Phil that he has got married, to Rose (Kirsten Dunst), the widow who runs the cafe in town and whose sensitive teenage son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is now to be George’s stepson and heir. Rose is going to move in as the mistress of the house and Phil, sensing the imminent diminishing in his own status, subjects Rose to a hateful campaign of harassment and makes Peter the subject of homophobic bullying. But then a strange turnaround takes place: he makes friends with young Peter and declares he will take him riding in the remote hills where he will school him in the ways of ranching and being a man – the way Bronco Henry schooled him. Cumberbatch makes Phil a vivid and horrible monster, all the more disquieting for his flashes of intelligence and cunning. When Rose brings her piano into the big house (an irresistible echo of the earlier Campion classic) and attempts to play Strauss’s Radetzky March on it, Phil mischievously joins in on his five-string banjo, putting poor Rose off her stroke and revealing that he is, in fact, rather more musically talented than she is. But Smit-McPhee’s performance as Peter matches him in presence and potency, and the story doesn’t at all go where you think. It is a movie with lethal bite."

          "bodyText": "Ali Martin’s report from Adelaide Here’s Ben Stokes, fronting up as ever. “It’s always going to be a tired end to the day after being in the field for that long,” he says. “But it looked a pretty easy wicket to bat on once you get yourself in, so hopefully our batters can do that.” Glenn McGrath asks him about being the enforcer and how his body is. “It’s something I’ve done before. Body’s been worse, body’s been better.” He thinks the pitch is going to be one of those that get slower and slower. “We’ve seen a lot of nicks fall short, especially with the older ball.” Yes, but will England stay in long enough for the ball to get old? Mel Farrell asks Stokes if he has a message for England fans back home, staying up all night. “On social media we’ve seen a lot of support that we’re getting back home, especially on the Barmy Army Twitter and Instagram feeds. The guys who are out in Australia too, they’re outnumbered but we always hear them and we appreciate every bit of support that we get, especially the people staying up to watch us.” He doesn’t quite manage to mention those following the OBO, but that’s a good effort. As it was in the middle, where Stokes was England’s most successful bowler, with three for 113. If only they’d had Mark Wood, to make those nicks carry and get the tailenders jumping around. That’s it from us, with England in an all too familiar position: staring disaster in the face. Thanks for your company, and I hope your day goes better than theirs. “I see both openers have failed again,” says El Nombre on Twitter. “I reckon we should drop all the bowling unit ...” Ha, very good. But the two things are related. The openers were (even) more likely to fail once the new bowling strategy had gone wrong. Whether batting, bowling or fielding, England are a mess at the moment. The umps have now called it a day/night. So England are spared what could have been a horrific last hour. They will resume in the morning, a mere 456 runs behind. “Would it save time in future,” asks Hexenkessel, “if England’s 3 and 4 went out with the openers and stood next to the square-leg umpire?” The umpires confer again and this time they take the players off, so Root gets a well-earned breather. Mitchell Starc, as he goes down the tunnel, gives high fives to several small boys, which delights them but may send panic through the ranks at the South Australia Health Authority. 8th over: England 16-2 (Malan 1, Root 4) It was raining just now, but the umpires kept the players on after conferring. The Aussies won’t mind that: they’re so confident that they have two rookies bowling at the same time, and they’re still walking all over England. Root drives for a single, which ruins Richardson’s figures. He now has 4-3-1-0. And here’s Harry Lang. “Assuming the Burns dismissal is the start of yet another abject capitulation by England,” he muses, “will this be the bottom of the bell curve in this cycle of English Test cricket? I’m just trying to work out whether I’ll see some sort of competition when I finally get to see an Ashes match live in retirement (circa twenty years from now – although likely longer). If the cycle is five or even ten years (so on the way up for five, then rollercoastering down in a progressive agony of self-doubt and nervy prodding for the next five) then I should be in luck. But if it’s a twenty-year sequence, I fear I may miss the boat. Thanks for keeping spirits up while the ship sinks!” Thank you for putting my job in a nutshell. When it comes to the cycle, who knows – but England could well regain the Ashes in 2023, with Jofra Archer, Ollie Robinson and Saqib Mahmood reducing the Aussies to rubble. 7th over: England 15-2 (Malan 1, Root 3) So both openers have gone and Joe Root, after being at the helm for 150 overs, is back out there half an hour later. He immediately edges Neser, which is understandable, but his hands are soft enough to make sure the ball drops short of the cordon. Then he plays a more purposeful shot in the same direction, a glide for three. His ability to be himself when up against it is quite something. Hasss!! Noooooo! Hameed chips to mid-on and gives Michael Neser a great big Christmas present in his first over as a Test bowler. 6th over: England 12-1 (Hameed 6, Malan 1) A third maiden from Richardson, but that won’t bother Malan, who gets through the over without being beaten outside off. 5th over: England 12-1 (Hameed 6, Malan 1) Starc hasn’t got it right yet to Hameed, who has some comfy leaves before being lured into another drive, which he mistimes. “So many of us so negative on this,” mutters AB Parker. “Easy draw with a Root double coming up. I’ll tattoo whoever takes the most wickets on my face if we don’t. Seriously, easy enough pitch and England showed they can put up 350 easily last game.” Great stuff, but, at the risk of taking things too literally, I thought they made 147 and 297? 4th over: England 12-1 (Hameed 6, Malan 1) After beating Hameed for fun in his first over, Richardson now faces a left-hander for the first time today – and beats him too, though Malan gets some credit too, for staying on the line of off stump. Richardson, who scored three runs per ball in his short innings, hasn’t conceded one yet. 3rd over: England 12-1 (Hameed 6, Malan 1) Here comes Dawid Malan, who could be jelly on the inside, but he puts on a brave face and pushes his first ball for a quick single to cover. Hameed follows up with another stylish square drive that doesn’t quite reach the rope. He’s getting ’em in threes. Starc gets Burns again! With a good ball – lifting, leaving him, drawing the edge and presenting Smith at second slip with a simple catch, which, not being English, he doesn’t drop. This could be the start of a procession. 2nd over: England 7-0 (Hameed 3, Burns 4) The new ball is shared by Jhye Richardson, as the more senior of the two stand-in seamers – he’s a vetreran of two Tests. Fortified by his three-ball innings of 9, he finds some swing and beats Hameed, not once, not twice, but three times. “That last half hour was like something out of the mid-90s,” says Guy Hornsby on Twitter. “Not only have we let Australia take the game away from us, but we’ve given their two new pace bowlers a shot of adrenaline. I hope our batters have put abject defeat out of their minds. I haven’t.” 1st over: England 7-0 (Hameed 3, Burns 4) Mitch Starc lays down his bat and picks up the new ball, which is so pink it should really be served as a drink at a children’s party. Haseeb Hameed leaves one that’s a little too close to the off bail, but then plays a lovely calm drive, through the covers for three. So... can Rory Burns survive one ball? He can! It’s straight and swinging away, but on middle rather than leg, and he gets some bat on it, rather uncertainly. Next ball, much the same but pitched up, he clips for four. That’s more like it. An intriguing email comes in from an associate professor in international strategy. “England’s dodgy fielding is historic,” says Jon Fanning of York university, “and caused by an excessively competitive schools culture which values winning above all even when the win is brought about by size and strength not skill. The result is that good batters bat, good bowlers bowl, and only the fat lads do much fielding, for which there in no training. At least the bowlers do field occasionally. It looks like the schools have changed now, but it won’t show for a few years. I use it in my teaching as a comparative study in proper planning. Indian fielding vs English.” Discuss! England ripped up their strategy, the bowlers did a lot right, and still Australia made 473. Just like in Brisbane, most of the runs were made by only three batters – Warner and Labuschagne again, with Smith replacing Head as the third man. But this time the Aussie tail wagged, merrily, to make sure that England go in to bat feeling embarrassed as well as exhausted. Their chance of winning, at CricViz, is rated at 2pc. That high? Jhye Richardson doesn’t hang about: he goes three, six, out – caught behind off Woakes. And Steve Smith calls them in, so Starc is left high and dry. 150th over: Australia 461-8 (Starc 38, Richardson 0) The wicket doesn’t stop Starc in his tracks, rather the opposite. He cuts for four, plays a forehand drive for four more (almost killing the umpire), and top-edges just out of Buttler’s reach for yet another four. So he has that quick 30, and the last four overs have gone for 46. Neser’s luck runs out as his lofted drive goes straight to Broad at deep mid-off. But what an impressive debut: 35 off just 24 balls, which will put some extra wind in his sails when he comes on to bowl. 149th over: Australia 448-7 (Starc 24, Neser 35) Woakes is slapped for four by Starc, through the covers. He responds with a loopy slower ball, so far outside off that it’s a wide. The crowd make the unmistakable sound that figures in so many English nightmares: the sheer derision of thousands of gloating Aussies. Woakes recovers to beat Starc twice outside off. And then Starc is dropped in the deep by Ollie Pope – a good effort, to be fair – running in and just getting his fingers to a slog-sweep. 148th over: Australia 440-7 (Starc 18, Neser 34) Neser tries to give Stokes the treatment and succeeds in a way, with a thick inside edge for four. A better shot, a jab to deep square, brings a single and the fifty partnership. Salt in England’s wounds. And the last two batters are padded up, so Smith is not about to declare. 147th over: Australia 433-7 (Starc 17, Neser 28) Root makes yet another bowling change, replacing Anderson with Woakes – talk about like for like. Neser top-edges for four over the slips. Woakes, looking rattled for once in his life, asks for a review, for caught behind, when Buttler isn’t interested. No evidence of a nick, so England are out of reviews. Neser celebrates by slogging for four and cutting for six! Rabble time again. “I don’t know why we’re being so gloomy about England’s current predicament,” says Grumpy Expat Dad on Twitter. “Didn’t Adelaide once host an Ashes Test where a team lost after making 550 in the first innings?” Ha. 146th over: Australia 417-7 (Starc 16, Neser 13) Root brings back Stokes, who pitches the ball up, thankfully, and concedes only three singles. Up on the roof, a bunch of tourists are enjoying the view – or perhaps not enjoying it, as there are forks of lightning behind them. In the words of the great Gilbert O’Sullivan, get down! 145th over: Australia 414-7 (Starc 14, Neser 12) Starc sees those two short mid-ons and simply chips over them for two runs. This partnership is 24 already. “Thanks to you and the rest of the OBO team,” says Stephen Schoofs, “for making our gradual descent back into Covid misery just a tad more bearable.” Our pleasure. “Having said that, what’s the best that the England team can hope for, considering a very likely first session under lights, a less than confident batting line up, a world class spinner on a pitch that offers turn, and a comfortable drop in temperature for Australia’s bowlers to look forward to? Batting for a draw or an honourable defeat at best?” There’s always hope, even for England. In this case the best they can hope for is to make 550, roll over Australia for 150, knock off the 50 required for victory and say to the world “You see, five seamers can work!” 144th over: Australia 411-7 (Starc 11, Neser 12) Starc fancies a quick 30 here. He edges a pull but gets away with it as it plops into space at backward point. Neser shows him how it’s done with a proper pull, smacked to the midwicket boundary. 143rd over: Australia 403-7 (Starc 8, Neser 7) Neser, facing Anderson, picks up two more with another controlled nick. Is it too soon to call this his trademark? 142nd over: Australia 395-7 (Starc 7, Neser 4) After only two overs, Robinson is taken off and replaced by Broad, perhaps because Starc is a left-hander. And Starc is missed! By Anderson at midwicket, just too slow to get his hands on a well-timed chip. Broad pulls that face again. Neser adds insult to insult by edging for four. 141st over: Australia 390-7 (Starc 3, Neser 0) Here’s Michael Neser walking out for the first time in a Test match, after a 20-minute tea interval to stew in, but if he’s nervous, he’s not going to show it. He sees out the last two balls of Anderson’s over and plays a nice wristy clip to square leg. “Morning Tim (from where I’m writing),” says David Hindle. “Surely the fact that Ben Stokes gets people out when finally bowling straight and pitching it up, and the fact that the Australian bowlers are a) all very good, b) will bowl at the stumps and pitch it up the whole time, means this is done and dusted? This will be a monster walloping by an innings, because the Australians have brains and use them, whilst England – oh dear. And quite a few England batsmen seem to have a terrible technical weakness. They play every line possible except that of a straight ball aimed at their stumps? Okay, the worst offender, Bairstow is gone, but Pope and Buttler (at least) are well capable of the same. It will not be pretty.” You may well be right! But there are two glimmers of hope for England: half of Australia’s bowlers in this match are beginners, albeit talented ones. And the slow scoring so far has opened the door to the draw. On WinViz, it’s a 33pc chance. England, true to form, are on 4pc. “Becoming a rabble?” snorts Nicholas Butt (137th over). “Ingerlund has always been a rabble!” I take it you’re too young to remember 2010-11. And off they go for tea. That was a shame for Carey, who had just reached a fine first Test fifty and bathed in the acclaim of his home crowd, but, like Smith’s downfall, it may not do Australia any harm. Out of nowhere, Anderson has his favourite thing: tidy figures – two for 51 off 26.4 overs of dogged rust removal. The session still belongs to the Aussies, and so do the Ashes. “It’s almost irrelevant,” says Alastair Cook, “what Australia get now.” He knows whereof he speaks. One brings two for Anderson! This may be a slower ball, as Carey plays too early and chips to cover, where Haseeb Hameed dives to his right and takes the catch as if he was playing for a team that had no trouble with their fielding. 139th over: Australia 385-6 (Carey 49) Smith stomps off looking furious and chucks his helmet down on the grass beyond the Toblerone. When he cools down, he may reflect that a clatter of wickets now could help him win the match, by making England bat under lights. The partnership, like Smith, just missed out on a hundred (91). A modest round of applause please for poor old Root, who made a double change, yielding a welcome maiden at one end and a much-needed wicket at the other. Jimmy Jimmy! The oldest swinger in town gets one to move in and keep low. Up goes the finger, Smith reviews but it’s plumb. And that’s another 90 for Australia’s collection. 138th over: Australia 383-5 (Smith 92, Carey 48) Broad is replaced by Ollie Robinson, his natural heir. He keeps Carey quiet by jagging the ball back into him and completes a maiden, which is a tiny win in the circumstances. “Never seen so many balls hit the back elbow in a Test,” says one of the commentators. That doesn’t fill you with confidence for England’s innings, when the bowling will be a lot faster. 137th over: Australia 383-5 (Smith 92, Carey 48) Smith finds the right riposte to Stokes’s bouncers: an upper-cut for four. England, after rallying this morning, are becoming a rabble again. 136th over: Australia 376-5 (Smith 87, Carey 46) Thanks Mike. This is Tim, clocking on after a slight mix-up – well, what else do you expect from an Englishman? On the field, Stuart Broad’s over begins with a FIVE as Smith takes a single and Rory Burns’s wayward shy at the stumps goes for four overthrows. Alex Carey follows up with a lordly four, whipped over square leg. Broad’s face, in his 150th Test, is less than celebratory. 135th over: Australia 366-5 (Smith 82, Carey 41) Just a single of Stokes’s next over as Smith’s off his legs again, to move onto 82. Carey remains on 41 as an off-drive and then a late cut are both straight to England men. And with that, my cameo is over, and the great Tim de Lisle will take over from here. Fun while it lasted. 134th over: Australia 365-5 (Smith 81, Carey 41) “Oh my word,” says Steve Smith as Broad’s opening ball jags away from him. Not a hint of understatement from the Australian captain’s lips there. Nothing much else to report until the final ball of the over, when Smith tickles one off his legs, and it’s nearly snaffled at leg slip. This partnership is now worth 71. 133rd over: Australia 364-5 (Smith 80, Carey 41) Evening/morning all. Thanks Geoff, stellar work as always. There’s a change to the advertised plan, and I - not Tim de Lisle - will see you through the next few overs at least. There’s a half-hearted shout with a possible sound off the glove as Carey looks to pull a Stokes bouncer, but nothing really. Carey then picks up two thanks to an overthrow and then finds the boundary to move onto 41. A good over for Australia. This time I’m out for real. Mike Hytner will be with you in the first instance. Thanks for the company. “I’m enjoying checking in on the score from a couch in Hawai’i. How’s the press box? Does it feel like it did back in the pre-covid times, or are there fewer, more distanced journos? I briefly went into the press box at the Basin Reserve once, as a journalism student. It was wonderful. Amazing view.” Hello to Tane Aikman. It’s pretty much as usual, except that everyone is wearing masks when moving around. But that’s the norm most places in Adelaide at the moment. And yes, the view from most press boxes is special. 132nd over: Australia 358-5 (Smith 80, Carey 35) Stuart Broad comes on for Woakes, with the River Torrens at his back. Carey guides a single, thanks to another misfield from Burns. Smith gets one off his legs. William Vignoles writes in. “You’re completely right about England but it’s not a new thing - you can’t always have great bowlers or batters but pretty much any team can be turned into a good fielding unit (look at India), but for the last few years England seem to drop at least a couple of chances per game and can’t get a run out for anything. Less of an issue at home but when you’re flogging yourself in 35 degrees on an Australian road you need all the help you can get, and it doesn’t seem like the Test outfit are getting something right in their prep. Cheers as ever for the OBO and TFW!” 131st over: Australia 356-5 (Smith 79, Carey 34) Root is back on, in time to nearly take another slip catch. This one from Carey off Stokes, bounces just in front again. Seem to have been a lot of those, can they creep closer? Carey responds with a nice drive for two through cover. 130th over: Australia 352-5 (Smith 79, Carey 30) Four for Carey! Gets that bit of Woakes width, increases it by shuffling back, and slashes away through deep third. Woakes to Smith... who picks him up off a length for six! A cross-bat swat, not even short enough to be called a pull shot really, but somehow Smith times it so well that it clears deep backward square into the seats. This has been a strange old innings from Smith. A lot of defence, a lot of control, and then the odd yahoo. Drinks break. 129th over: Australia 341-5 (Smith 73, Carey 25) Robinson to Smith, who keeps stepping across and trying to work the ball to leg, but doesn’t make any good contact this time around. The crowd burbling away here at Adelaide. 128th over: Australia 340-5 (Smith 73, Carey 24) Woakes in at the body of Smith who defends. Perhaps Australia have no interest in declaring for the last session. Perhaps they’ll just bat for as long as they can ahead of Boxing Day. Certainly no hurry when the bowling is tight. At last, an edge! But wouldn’t you believe it, when you have a stagged slip cordon with someone at about 1.5 and someone at about 3, it goes through about 2.5 for four. And it’s a no-ball. Woakes with the front foot this time. Smith shakes his head and scolds himself for the shot, then improves his mood as he laces a cover drive for four. 127th over: Australia 331-5 (Smith 65, Carey 24) Root is off the field for a moment, probably visiting a prayer room. Robinson gets a thick edge from Carey, near the shoulder of the bat, that rolls into the gully. No damage either way. Eventually Robinson comes around the wicket. Another scoreless over. 126th over: Australia 331-5 (Smith 65, Carey 24) Woakes is on, who has occasionally got Steve Smith out lbw, though usually after a big score. Bowls right-arm over, outside Smith’s off stump, and the stand-in captain is happy to step across and watch the ball sail by. Eventually reaches with soft hands and squirts one off the edge along the ground to Pope at around a third slip. Smith calls for new gloves. England are one wicket away from Neser on debut, but can’t find it. 125th over: Australia 331-5 (Smith 65, Carey 24) Root off, Robinson on. He bowls a very good line on the left-hander’s off stump from over the wicket. The cloud is thickening overhead. The day is still very hot, a tick under 35 degrees in Adelaide. 124th over: Australia 331-5 (Smith 65, Carey 24) Anderson tries to burrow in at Carey’s pad, but is dug out. Then gets clipped square for two. Carey tries to whip his hands through a square drive, but it’s too close to the body. Straighter again and he has to defend. This is a good battle. Carey ends up very side-on when playing Anderson off his legs. Works a single away from there to end the over. 123rd over: Australia 328-5 (Smith 65, Carey 21) The accelerator work has fallen to Carey! Plays another lofted off-drive to Root, this time hitting it well enough to get four down the ground, though the ball plugs a little on landing. Cuts a single next ball, then Smith takes his cue and lashes a wide ball through cover for four. That might be Root’s last over for a while. 122nd over: Australia 318-5 (Smith 60, Carey 16) More busy play from Carey, throwing has hands through a drive off Anderson, two runs through cover point. Anderson around the wicket, trying to settle on a line that will discomfort Carey. 121st over: Australia 316-5 (Smith 60, Carey 14) The milking continues, Smith pushing Root into the covers, Carey going aerial down the ground for a run. England drifting, drifting. 120th over: Australia 312-5 (Smith 58, Carey 12) Anderson can’t get a look at Smith. Carey soaks up the over, pushing a couple of runs through the covers. Everything moving along slowly out there at the moment. So what’s the plan? Add 100 in this session and declare some time after the next break with 400 or so on the board? The Australians are only at 2.6 per over so far in this innings, so they will need to pick it up a bit at some stage. 119th over: Australia 310-5 (Smith 58, Carey 10) Root to carry on, another couple of single from the over. Smith looks comfortable against this stuff. Root has got him out twice in Test matches, but both times Smith had made double-hundreds first. News just in: the Australian captain has had permission from South Australian health authorities to go home to Sydney rather than sit in isolation for another five days in Adelaide. He’ll drive himself to the airport and take a charter flight arranged by Cricket Australia, so that he won’t cross over with anyone else. Then he’ll complete his isolation period at home. Seems vaguely sensible. 118th over: Australia 308-5 (Smith 57, Carey 9) Anderson to partner Root from the Riverbank End. Carey takes him on at one stage too, but can’t beat point. 117th over: Australia 308-5 (Smith 57, Carey 9) Joe Root to commence after the break, and Carey pulls out the reverse sweep in quick time! Picks up three runs. They farm a few singles either side, like a one-day innings. Ellie Oldroyd on the BBC is going for “nursery tea” for that long break. Like minds. “Winning the last toss and losing this one already looks like defining England’s series (give or take some dropped catches, flakey batting and front foot no-balls),” writes Brian Withington. “Any thoughts on how England can be given some sort of handicapping advantage to even things up more? (Assuming Australia losing their captain and another front line bowler doesn’t prove sufficient…)” I’m just going to call it lunch, having lunch at 4:30 in the afternoon is perfectly civilised. A better session for England! It started with great frustration as Marnus Labuschagne was given yet more lives and raised his century, but after finally prising him out the session tally was 80 for 3. Relatively even, with the score already past 300, but at least there was some evenness in the contest. The cheering aspect for Australia will be that SPD Smith is still there, immovable, implacable, coming for the world’s tired bowlers. 116th over: Australia 302-5 (Smith 55, Carey 5) Stokes with the last over before the long break. Around the wicket, bouncing the left-hander, too short to make him do anything but duck. Gets a bit fuller and has Carey fencing, past the inside edge into Buttler’s gloves. Short again, pulled hard on the bounce to leg slip, well stopped. That’s lunch, or dinner time for babies, or whatever it is. 115th over: Australia 302-5 (Smith 55, Carey 5) Root bowling around the wicket to Carey, off-breaks to a left-hander. Conventional field, three either side of the wicket on the single, one slip, boundary riders at point and square leg. Carey drops the ball to point with soft hands and bolts a single. For Smith, the deep point comes up and a second outfielder is added behind square leg. 114th over: Australia 301-5 (Smith 55, Carey 4) Off the mark with confidence is Carey, hooking Stokes between the two deep fielders behind square, past a tumbling Malan on the rope for four. A leg bye follows. Stokes looks very weary after he bowls the last ball of the over to Smith. 113th over: Australia 296-5 (Smith 55, Carey 0) Root burns through another over, with a leg slip in place for Smith, who nudges a ball past that man for two. 112th over: Australia 294-5 (Smith 53, Carey 0) As Ali Martin has just noted next to me, some unconvincing middle-order performances from Australia both here and Brisbane have only underlined the cost of England giving so many chances to Warner and Labuschagne in those matches. It’s Alex Carey’s turn for a hometown welcome. He didn’t leave it, but he does make another low score! Bowled again! A beauty from Stokes. He finally pitches a ball up. It’s on line for middle stump but just shapes away a touch. Enough to beat the edge of a misplaced defensive stroke, and not so much that it beats the outside of off stump. Lovely piece of bowling. 111th over: Australia 291-4 (Smith 52, Green 0) It was evident immediately that Head wanted a piece of the part-time spinner. That desire brings him undone. Cameron Green comes to the middle and manages to not leave a ball that hits his stumps first ball. Talk about self-inflicted! Head charges at Joe Root and basically yorks himself. He reaches the ball as a full toss, realises it’s too full, then has a panicked slog across the line at it. Misses, I think it clips his thigh, and goes back onto the stumps. 110th over: Australia 287-3 (Smith 52, Head 14) The bouncer field is: deep third, backward point, extra cover, midwicket, square leg, short leg, deep square leg, deep backward square, long leg. That’s six-three in favour of the leg side. Truly bizarre stuff. Stokes goes short, and Smith top-edges over the keeper for four to raise his fifty. 109th over: Australia 280-3 (Smith 47, Head 12) Steve Smith is getting into his stride! A touch short from Root, and Smith lashes a cut shot behind point. A bit top-edgy, but there was enough space out there to make it low risk. The greediest run-scorer in contemporary Test cricket hasn’t had much time at the table in the last couple of years, but now he’s eyeing another milestone. 108th over: Australia 274-3 (Smith 42, Head 11) Stokes is the other bowling change, and he’s going to try the bombardment tactic like yesterday. Doesn’t work, as Smith lashes a wide short one over backward point, then an even higher bouncer gets called wide. Smith pulls a single to follow. 107th over: Australia 268-3 (Smith 37, Head 11) A couple of stutters from Head, as Root comes on for an over of spin. The batter wants to attack but isn’t in the right spot to do so. Interesting. How many runs can Root make if he has to bowl all day? 106th over: Australia 268-3 (Smith 37, Head 11) Score revision on the previous post, hit refresh if you can’t see it. Robinson bowling from the Riverbank End to Smith, who is happy to keep blocking. He gets a thick outside edge from one such shot, past gully along the ground for a couple of runs, then picks off a straighter ball through midwicket for two more. Make that three! Smith really has the foot down, going to the danger end as Broad throws back, and he demands that Head come through as well. Almost got to the non-striker’s end before Head had left. Robinson strays down leg with the final ball, off Head’s thigh pad for three leg byes. 105th over: Australia 260-3 (Smith 32, Head 11) Almost a slip catch! Head edges Chris Woakes into the cordon, in front of Burns on the bounce. Only by a few inches as Burns lunges forward. Head escapes strike from the next ball, then Smith immediately rotates it back. Head plays a big shot off the back foot but hits it too straight to mid-off. Score revision! That last ball is an overstep. From the seventh ball, Head does get his flay away, between point and gully for four! 104th over: Australia 253-3 (Smith 31, Head 6) Smith is happy to bat out Robinson, leaving him alone and forcing the bowler to go straighter. Nothing from the over, and in this heat, each over is a serious effort. In the commentary boxes, with the windows open, the heat is blasting through like it’s an open fan-forced oven door. 103rd over: Australia 253-3 (Smith 31, Head 6) Woakes after drinks, bowling around the wicket to Head and largely short of a length. Head punches away a couple of runs through the covers. 102nd over: Australia 251-3 (Smith 31, Head 4) There’s the first false shot from Smith, edging to second slip on the bounce. Rory Burns dives across to stop it, but unsurprisingly fumbles the take. Manages not to give away a run. Robinson has been the most threatening bowler, even with his front foot. Then England go up for an appeal as Smith leaves a ball that clips his thigh pad. Not sure if they wanted lbw or an edge. Anything. No dice. Good one to follow! Finally pitched up, and Robinson gets a bit of movement past the outside edge. Genuine defensive shot from Smith beaten. Only two slips awaiting a catch. Nothing coming though. Drinks. 101st over: Australia 251-3 (Smith 31, Head 4) Woakes on to bowl, and as he did to Warner yesterday, he offers short width early to the left-hander. Head crashes it away through point. 100th over: Australia 247-3 (Smith 31, Head 0) While Labuschagne frustrated England by his reprieves, at least he looked fallible. Smith has been faultless. Robinson’s in-ducker? He gets bat behind it. The away-goer? Steps across and watches it. Anything loose he has dispatched. A big score in the offing. Another extra in that over as Robinson bowls another no-ball. “Good morning Geoff from icy Piedmont,” writes Finbar Anslow. “Confidently expect Australia to get rolled for just over 300 before England’s openers knock up half of that for the first wicket. Might just go back to sleep at this point, looking forwards to dreams coming true.” 99th over: Australia 246-3 (Smith 31, Head 0) A couple of bouncers from Broad to Smith, and Smith takes him on, hooking between the two leg-side boundary riders for four. Broad has a leg slip in now, and while bowling at Smith’s hip, gets a deflection that bounces in front of Hameed in that position. Who fumbles it for a leg bye. 98th over: Australia 241-3 (Smith 27, Head 0) Huge hometown ovation for Travis Head as he comes to the middle. The torture ends for England. Bad misjudgement from Labuschagne, he leaves a Robinson delivery expecting it to go past his off stump, but instead it cuts back to hit him just about in line. The line of impact doesn’t matter because he hasn’t offered a shot. Of course he reviews immediately, because he’s Marnus. Hoping it might be going over the stumps. It’s hitting flush at the top of middle. Given out lbw, sent upstairs. 97th over: Australia 241-2 (Labuschagne 103, Smith 27) Labuschagne’s charmed life continues! Pulls a short ball from Broad through square leg, airborne. The fielder throws out a hand at the ball, which is travelling, and maybe just gets a fingertip to it as it flies by. The fielder, inevitably, is Robinson. 96th over: Australia 240-2 (Labuschagne 102, Smith 27) I know I wrote last night about luck, and I know it’s easy to get stuck into the losing team, but... these England players don’t deserve to win a Test match. They can’t do the most fundamental things right. Self-inflicted. A leg bye follows, meaning two extras are the only scoreboard adjustment resulting from the over. I had just written out the post for the wicket. At last, in anticlimactic fashion. Ollie Robinson on to bowl, decent line, Marnus pokes, low edge that Buttler takes falling to his right. At last, something going for England. Labuschagne walks off. All the way to the boundary. Then gets turned around. NO BALL. Only by a whisker. It takes a zoomed in replay. But there is no part of Robinson’s shoe behind the line. England. What even are you. 95th over: Australia 238-2 (Labuschagne 102, Smith 27) Broad to Smith, no run from the over... “Not really sure what todays play will bring,” writes Stephen Holliday. “Then again, I’m in Toronto, watching over my washing machine that refuses to drain but I still expect my clothes to be dry before England get to bat. So maybe it’s all in the suds.” 94th over: Australia 238-2 (Labuschagne 102, Smith 27) Oof! When is the last time James Anderson knocked a bat out of someone’s hand? And with a delivery at 127 kph, too. Labuschagne may - outlandish I know - have added some spice to that. A slightly shorter ball that hits up near the gloves and his bat goes flying. Two balls later though, he opens the face and steers Anderson away, between slip and gully, for four! There it is. A highly patient innings, in between two huge slices of luck. He follows it up with a brace through midwicket. 93rd over: Australia 232-2 (Labuschagne 96, Smith 27) Broad carries on with his tight line, but as soon as there’s an error, Smith leaps on it again. A length floated full, and Smith sends it flowing through the covers for four. Broad gestures to himself in annoyance about where the delivery went wrong. 92nd over: Australia 228-2 (Labuschagne 96, Smith 23) Anderson tries a couple of short ones early. Smith pulls a single, Labuschagne pulls the bat inside the line. Two slips, a fairly deep gully, cover, mid-off, mid-on, midwicket, square leg, long leg. 91st over: Australia 227-2 (Labuschagne 96, Smith 22) Stuart Broad from the Cathedral End, with the grass hill and the giant fig trees behind him. (The figs... no wonder Kevin Pietersen liked batting here so much.) He’s over the wicket to the right-handed Labuschagne, after spending so much of yesterday around the wicket. And already it doesn’t look difficult for Labuschagne to block a couple, glance a single. This was a brutal toss to lose. 90th over: Australia 225-2 (Labuschagne 95, Smith 22) A couple of leaves from Smith to begin, one pulling the bat inside the line in a way that draws a vocal response from some of the crowd. Anderson strays wide with one ball, and Smith stands up tall to force off the back foot behind point for four! Decisive shot. We’re off. Jimmy Anderson with the newish ball. Smith on strike. Tell you what, the specialist spinner will have a lot to do in these conditions... Sorry? The last bits of warm-up equipment get ferried off the ground. A couple of kids holding flags wait at the end of the players’ races. A few uninterested security guards dot the boundary. The big remote-control camera buggy prowls the outfield like a dystopian sentinel. Black Mirror cricket is about to begin. The walk down through Adelaide’s central city to the ground was slightly more intense today than yesterday. Wouldn’t fancy bowling 30 overs of pace in it. Weather update: as already mentioned, it’s hot - the mercury has now tipped 37C. But there’s also some cloud cover today, and it’s blustery out there in the middle. Think it’s fair to say there will be a degree of scrutiny on Jos Buttler today, not least from the Adelaide crowd, who were on his back towards the end of play yesterday after he spilled that late chance to send Labuschagne packing. And excitingly, here is our Guardian Ashes Daily podcast again: a collaboration between Emma, me, and Adam Collins. I wrote about Australia largely getting away with losing a captain to Covid restrictions on the first morning. Emma John naturally harked back to Bodyline, in 1932-1933. Starring Hugo Weaving as Douglas Jardine. Here’s Simon Burnton, with the day one post-play quotes. Right, what have we got for you from day one at Adelaide? Here’s the match wrap from Ali Martin, who was tapping away next to me in the press box. Good Adelaide afternoon to every other timezone around the world. The very early hours of the morning in the UK, well done if you’re awake for this. It was a long slow grind of a day yesterday, with no pink-ball dynamite moments, some very careful Australian batting, and two more dropped catches that drove stakes into the hearts of England. The only thing is to hope that today might be different, but today is currently 36.3C and it’s only early afternoon. England’s bowlers have some very tough work ahead of them, and will have to pray that some early exchanges go their way. They have a ball only nine overs old, so that may offer something. The score is Australia 221-2, with Labuschagne to resume, thanks to dual fortune, on 95, and Smith on 18."

          "headline": "UK house price boom ‘to end in 2022 amid cost of living squeeze’",
          "bodyText": "The boom in UK house prices is likely to end next year as household finances become increasingly stretched, according to Halifax. The mortgage lender said it expected the red-hot increases in average house prices over the last two years – 8% so far this year and 6% in 2020 – to end, with growth forecast to be “broadly flat” in 2022. The Bank of England raised interest rates on Thursday for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, from 0.1% to 0.25%, and signalled further increases in the months ahead, potentially dampening appetite for spending as budgets come under strain. The Bank made its move after the Office for National Statistics said that UK inflation jumped to a 10-year high of 5.1% in November, as the price of petrol reached a record high and the global chip shortage pushed up car prices. “With the prospect that interest rates may rise further in 2022 to subdue rising inflation, and with government support measures phasing out, greater pressure on household budgets suggests house price growth will slow considerably,” said Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax. Halifax expects strong housing price levels to be maintained – the average UK house price is £272,992, almost £34,000 higher than at the start of the pandemic – but that growth in 2022 would be between flat and 2%. “There is still a large degree of uncertainty around this forecast,” Galley said. “Particularly around the extent to which savings accrued during the pandemic continue to boost housing transactions and prices, and how lasting the recent shifts in housing preferences prove to be.” With the pandemic-fuelled shift to flexible, remote and home working, homebuyers have rushed to buy larger properties in picturesque and rural locations outside urban centres. Other factors increasing homebuying were the government’s stamp duty holiday, which came to an end in England and Northern Ireland in September after finishing earlier in Scotland and Wales, and historically low interest rates. “We normally see a seasonal market slowdown towards the end of the year, but we are witnessing a comparably active market instead,” said Guy Gittins, the chief executive at the real estate agent chain Chestertons. “As a result of demand outstripping supply, the market has seen a 30% drop in sellers willing to lower their asking price. Looking ahead, we are still seeing plenty of unsatisfied buyer demand.” However, with soaring inflation and further rate rises expected in 2022, the cheap mortgage deals that have boosted the housing market in 2021 are likely to be more difficult to find. “Nevertheless, interest rates will remain low by historic standards and property prices will continue to be supported by the limited supply of available properties,” Galley said. “However, it is prudent to highlight the potential for house prices to rise or fall by much greater margins next year, depending on how Covid-19 and its variants continue to impact the economic environment and the potential for any further policy interventions.” Despite the potential cooling of two years of house price growth, there are fears first-time buyers will continue to be priced out of the UK market. “The news that house prices [could] continue to rise is particularly concerning for first-time buyers, a group who have struggled with rising house prices for decades,” said Sophia Guy-White, a co-founder of Generation Home, which specialises in mortgages for first-time buyers. “And although this demand seems to be cooling, there remain too few homes to buy and too many buyers locked out of homeownership.”"

          "bodyText": "With that, we’ll end our live coverage for today. Here’s a recap of today’s major news developments: A child who was in hospital after yesterday’s tragedy in Davenport was released today, with three others in a critical condition. Police also released the names of the five children who died in the incident. NSW registered a record 2,213 new locally acquired Covid cases today, and one death. Victoria recorded 1,510 new cases and seven deaths. Queensland recorded 20 new cases. The ACT also recorded 20 new cases today. South Australia recorded 64 new cases, with one person in hospital. The NT town of Tennant Creek has been placed under lockdown after four new cases were recorded. Former Wallabies star David Pocock said he will run as an independent candidate for the Senate at next year’s federal election The NSW government made the decision to restrict visitors to health facilities, as Covid cases grow. NSW and Victoria also decided to scrap the 72-hour isolation for international arrivals Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that mask mandates will be returned to retail settings over Christmas and New Year. South Australia relaxed number of restrictions, including allowing standing while drinking, dancing and the removal of caps on visitors at home. 90% of Australia’s over 16 population are now double vaccinated. Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the Omicron variant adds ‘complexity’ but vaccines remain effective New Zealand has recorded 76 new locally acquired cases, 47 of which were in Auckland. The ministry of health added that there were 51 cases in hospital, with five of those in intensive care. The second Ashes test continues in Adelaide, and you can keep up at our liveblog here: Santa Claus, unlike many other, more real people, appears to have been granted an exemption to enter Western Australia. Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network (Aftinet) says a clause in the free trade agreement with the UK raises doubts about the Australian government’s commitment to waiving intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines. The intellectual property chapter says both the UK and Australia “recognise the importance of contributing to the international efforts to implement Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement”. Dr Patricia Ranald, the convener of Aftinet, said this is part of the intellectual property agreement Trips that allows for “compulsory licensing” agreements to be struck – an argument some countries have used to reject calls for a specific waiver to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. “As we’ve seen over the last 18 months, these provisions are not working,” she said. “It is too difficult for each low-income government to negotiate with each company about each particular medicine. “Australia says that is supports the TRIPS waiver but the debate in the WTO has been between those who support the TRIPS waiver and those who have opposed it, including the UK and the EU, who have [cited] this specific clause in the TRIPS agreement to say we don’t need a waiver. “It is a confusing signal. It casts some doubt on Australia’s commitment. Why would they agree to put this specific clause in the agreement? It’s not in the CPTPP, for example, or intellectual property provisions in other similar agreements.” The Australian and UK governments have also agreed on a side letter on medicines that says that Australia and the UK “will strengthen their cooperation on regulation of medicines”. Qantas will not have to rehire 2,000 ground-handling workers whose roles the airline unlawfully outsourced during the pandemic, with the federal court dismissing an application for reinstatement. Instead, the airline will have to pay compensation to the workers, Justice Michael Lee ruled on Friday afternoon, following months of remediation hearings between Qantas and the Transport Workers Union. In July, the federal court ruled that Qantas’ decision to sack about 2,000 ground-handling staff and was in part driven by the fact that many of the axed workers were union members with stronger bargaining capabilities. Qantas previously maintained the outsourcing measure was a necessary financial measure that could save $100m annually, and chief executive Alan Joyce has previously said the airline plans to appeal the July decision. Qantas had previously asked for remedy hearings to be delayed until after the appeal is heard, however Lee determined the affected workers needed clarity about their jobs before the end of the year. Case management hearings to determine an appropriate remedy for the outsourcing will continue, however Lee granted the TWU leave to appeal Friday’s ruling. A TWU spokeswoman told the Guardian the union will appeal Friday’s decision. Lee noted the commercial reality of rehiring the workers given Qantas had restructured its ground handling operations to rely on contractors. During remedy hearings this week, the court heard Richard Dalton QC, the barrister representing Qantas, said the process of rehiring the outsourced workers “would require an unscrambling of the egg”. And we have confirmation now, with both NSW and Victoria jointly announcing they will scrap the three-day isolation for international arrivals. Instead, arrivals will need to get a PCR test within 24 hours of arrival and isolate until they get a negative result. In a joint statement, NSW premier Dominic Perrottet and acting Victorian premier James Merlino said it was a move made to allow people to celebrate Christmas with their relatives: We know it has been a challenging time for international travel with new rules and the emergence of the Omicron variant, but this announcement is about simplifying the process and making sure Australia’s two biggest cities have a consistent approach. This decision has been made with safety remaining the top priority, which is why all arrivals must return a negative PCR test before they can exit isolation and have an additional test following that. Under the new rules, arrivals will still need to provide a negative pre-departure test, as well as another test on day six in NSW and between days five and seven in Victoria. Hotel quarantine will remain a requirement for travellers who are not vaccinated. We are hearing reports that NSW and Victoria are looking to lift the 72-hour isolation rule for international arrivals: We will bring more details as they come. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this evening, taking you through the afternoon’s news. Just a quick thanks to Tory Shepherd and Matilda Boseley for their stellar work earlier. This must seem strange to people in NSW and Melbourne, but many South Australians are anxious about the 64 cases of Covid recorded overnight – that’s the highest daily number, ever. And now this: Former Wallaby David Pocock is hoping to play a much rougher game – politics. Pocock will run for an ACT Senate seat at next year’s election. He’ll join a swag of independents hoping to disrupt the two-party system. Pocock nominates climate change, an Indigenous voice to parliament, and a federal integrity commission as issues he’ll focus on. He says: Politics has never been more important. In the face of big challenges like climate change, we need governments making decisions in the best interests of Australians and future generations who will call this amazing continent home. I want to play my part in building a better future. ACT has two Senate spots. If Pocock picks one up, he’ll be the territory’s first independent senator. It’s Friday, which means it’s time for Amanda Meade’s Weekly Beast. Huzzah! It’s got job snobs, Gerard Henderson’s obsessions, Antony Green’s Twitter weirdness and more: Now for something... different. I posted a Twitter thread below about this “treason” court case a man brought against Victorian premier Daniel Andrews. There was CHAOS. (The case was struck out). The story’s up now: Hey, all – again, sorry if this is painful for you. Here are the pictures of the five children who died in the Devonport tragedy. And please see below post for all the helplines if you’re struggling. Everyone, please feel free to skip this post if you need to. The Devonport tragedy is really hard to deal with – I’ve certainly had to have a few breaks from the news today. The Tasmanian police, with permission from the families, have released the names of the five children who were killed. They’ve also released images, which I’ll add in a bit. Those children were: Addison Stewart, 11 years old. Zane Mellor, 12. Jye Sheehan, 12. Jalailah Jayne-Maree Jones, 12. Peter Dodt, 12. “Our thoughts continue to be with the families, loved ones and all those affected by this tragedy,” the police said, and anyone who needs help can contact: Kids Helpline – 1800 551 800 Beyond Blue – 1300 224 636 Lifeline – 13 11 14 Attention Ken Behrens! (And all ACT residents). A potential thunderstorm asthma event is looming this weekend. Elevated pollen levels and possible gusty thunderstorms could cause severe asthma symptoms. The health directorate says be vigilant, prepare for a possible event, carry a puffer, and avoid the outdoors if possible. If you have an asthma action plan, follow it. And if you don’t, think about making one! Also, they recommend this nifty air quality app. Further to Lt Gen John Frewen’s reassurances (below) that we have plenty of booster shots, Hugh Riminton writes that may not be quite the case. He’s cast a steely eye over prime minister Scott Morrison’s statements on the matter and the figures: The NSW government has announced the purchase of 194 hectares of koala habitat near Port Macquarie on the state’s north coast. The purchase has been jointly funded through a $3.5m donation from Koala Conservation Australia and with money from the state’s $193m koala conservation fund. The state’s environment minister, Matt Kean, described the land, which is adjacent to the Lake Innes Nature Reserve, as core koala habitat that “will help us reach our target of doubling the koala population by 2050”. He said there had been sustained community advocacy for the site to be purchased and protected and he said the land would leave “an enduring legacy for the community”. Community members had launched a petition for the government to protect the site that was supported by the local member Leslie Williams. The government plans to add the land to the Lake Innes Nature Reserve and declare it an asset of intergenerational significance, which triggers stronger legal protections. Kean said: Our iconic koalas are increasingly threatened by the loss and fragmentation of habitat, this purchase will protect critical habitat from development and ensure the koala population in this area is safeguarded forever. On your toes, NSW, if you’re in a danger zone: Asked about state restrictions and other pandemic-related decisions, chief medical officer Paul Kelly says that this is a time for “national leadership and national consistency”. The head of the vaccine rollout, Lt Gen John Frewen, says 1.1 million people have had boosters, and that there are “absolutely no concerns” with supply. The big demand will hit in February and March, when 11 million will be eligible – but we’ll have enough. Also Australia has also passed the 90% milestone of over-16s double-dosed – well done you! Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly is giving a Covid update: We are are now seeing we have cases throughout the country. Other than Western Australia, we have had local transmission in recent days. He says we knew this would happen, and that there is “added complexity” from the Omicron variant. It’s more transmissible, but: The vaccine remains effective against severe disease, perhaps a little less than is the case against with Delta, for example, but it does remain effective. And I think that’s one of the reasons why we are seeing increases in cases but not so much of an increase in hospitalisations or other forms of severe disease, so that is important. And get a booster! Kelly also says there’s no move to bring the interval forward, so it stays at five months after the second dose. But he urges people to be flexible over the Christmas period, you can get it a little bit earlier if you’re worried about clinics closing for the holidays. An Atagi (Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation) statement will be out later today, so we’ll keep you posted on that. WA premier Mark McGowan is announcing a “significant” cabinet reshuffle. The top point is that health minister Roger Cook has been replaced by Amber-Jade Sanderson, who had been the environment minister. McGowan said the health portfolio was “gruelling” and that he was giving Cook the opportunity to “broaden”. The ABC reports Cook had “come under increasing pressure over the past two years, as WA’s health system continued to struggle despite the lack of any Covid-19 in the community”. NT chief minister Michael Gunner said the Tennant Creek lockdown will be in place until 5pm on Monday. There is a mask mandate for outdoors, and people can only leave home for: Medical treatment, including Covid testing or vaccination For essential goods and services, like groceries and medications. Only one household member should visit the store, once per day. For work that is considered essential. For one hour of outdoor exercise a day within 5km of your home with one other person or people from your house. To provide care and support to a family member or person who cannot support themselves. In case of an emergency. Acting chief minister Nicole Manison said there were eight new cases in the NT recorded overnight. Vaccination rates were “frustratingly low” in Tennant Creek, she said, with 70% of residents double-dosed. Tennant Creek has gone into an immediate lockdown after four new cases were found in the remote Northern Territory town. More to come. The deal is done. Australia has officially inked a free trade agreement with the UK. Trade minister Dan Tehan said it will make exports cheaper, and would “create new opportunities and further strengthen the special relationship between our two countries”. You can read the preview we put up this morning here: The reaction to a Daily Telegraph piece that awarded prime minister Scott Morrison an “A” grade for the year, because he had “neutralised or turned into net positives” the vaccine rollout and ... Brittany Higgins... Yes, Brittany Higgins... has not gone down well. She will not be “neutralised”. I’m sharing this tweet from the ABC’s Stephen Dziedzic because a) it’s important and b) I love the word “brouhaha”. In nerdy news ... UNSW engineers have created self-healing 3D printed plastic. Simply add a “special powder” to the liquid resin used, print it, and if it breaks, you can then repair it just by shining a standard LED light on it. Cool, huh? Dr Nathaniel Corrigan says: There is an obvious environmental benefit because you’re not having to re-synthesise a brand new material every time it gets broken. We are increasing the lifespan of these materials, which is going to reduce plastic waste. Ash Barty. What a champion. Literally. Again. Fantastic is a rather large stretch today, Matilda Boseley, but thank you! With that, I shall hand you over to the fantastic Tory Shepherd to take you through the next few hours of news. Just in case you were wondering what the NSW daily case number graph looked like nowadays... Not ideal. In comparison, here are the hospitalisation numbers in blue. However, it’s worth remembering that hospitalisations tend to be delayed by a week or two. A big thank-you to data wizard Nick Evershed for the graphs. Huzzah! Tasmania’s premier, Peter Gutwein, says the Devonport tragedy “is beyond comprehension” as police begin piecing together the cause of Thursday’s tragic jumping castle accident that killed five children. Speaking to reporters in Devonport on Friday, he said there had been a huge outpouring of grief and support in the small coastal city on Thursday night. “The tragedy which occurred yesterday is beyond comprehension,” Gutwein said. “It is devastating, heartbreaking. It’s just simply incomprehensible.” Five children – three boys and two girls – died from injuries sustained when the bouncy castle was lifted into the air by a sudden wind gust. Several zorb balls, with children inside, also flew into the air. They were 11 and 12 years old. You can read the full report below: Speaking of the Coalition’s newly unveiled Indigenous voice, here is a little run down on the situation from AAP to get you up to speed: Local and regional advisory bodies would be established as part of a path to an Indigenous voice to advise federal parliament. Up to 35 bodies designed and led by Indigenous communities would be up and running from July 2022 under the proposal accepted by the federal government. It would also be obliged to consult a 24-member national voice on proposed laws overwhelmingly affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The final report on the Indigenous voice process says: We heard in chorus - from our own people, along with non-Indigenous Australians - how much it would mean for Aboriginal and Torres Strait peoples to have our voices heard ... The importance of what we propose cannot be understated. The report was authored by prominent figures including Indigenous academic Marcia Langton and delivered to the federal government for consideration in July before its release on Friday. It’s the product of a two-year consultation process to establish an Indigenous voice. The Coalition opted against enshrining a voice in the constitution as called for by the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart. Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt said it was important to get the process right. For the Indigenous voice to work, it must have a strong foundation from the ground up. Morrison: I don’t believe it will derail the process if we move ahead and listen to the voices of local Indigenous communities and organising it as best as possible. I’m committed to doing that for one simple reason: It helps us deliver better services to Indigenous people across the country, to improve their lives, to increase their life span, to improve the health of their kids. That’s what this should be about. It’s not about politics. It’s about the health of young boys and girls, indigenous to this country, growing up in their communities. That’s what I’m interested in. I’m not interested in the political gesturing. Reporter: Prime minister, your government repeatedly insisted an Indigenous voice will be legislated to parliament. Can you keep that promise that that will happen? Morrison: What we said is we would follow [the] codesign process. That was our commitment. That was set up and I want to thank Marcia and Tom for the job they’ve done in pulling it together. We’re proceeding with that. We’re keeping that commitment. We said we would work through the codesign process. What I’m trying to do here is ensure that we can hear the voices of Indigenous people on the ground because I want to close the gap. This is not some political exercise. In other words for us to close the gap on infant mortality, in Indigenous communities, to reduce substance dependence, to reduce child abuse, to get kiddies in school, to ensure that we can improve maternal health in Indigenous communities, to get young people and their parents into jobs, to do that you have to work in partnership with local Indigenous communities. That’s why I’m interested in this. This is about listening to local Indigenous communities and that’s where the voice must start. It doesn’t start with grandiose gestures, with big political speeches, it starts on the ground pulling together local Indigenous communities and listening carefully to them so we can get service delivery right. That’s what our voice is about. It’s not about other things, it’s about hearing and it builds on the local voices that are already there and where that has been successful. So, that’s what we’re committed to doing. It’s about closing the gap. That’s what I’m about. I’m about closing the gap, not setting up political edifices, I’m interested in hearing what’s happening on the ground and that’s where Ken Wyatt and I have had our focus. That’s where it must start. That’s where we’re starting. That’s what the codesign process has delivered and that is us keeping that commitment. Morrison: It was the Labor party who said that the real test of the government and of the economic recovery was jobs - well, the Labor party have just told you, by their own benchmark, that the way to secure the economic recovery is to vote Liberal because we have delivered on those jobs. That being said, Morrison is very much not in Tasmania today, and very much is in Syndey for an unofficial election campaign media event, discussing the Coalition’s job training program. 217,000 Australians are in trade training right now which is the highest level on record since they were kept in 1963. When you invest in skills like we have, when you invest in increased university places, 30,000 more this year, then our manufacturing industry has that future. The Modern Manufacturing Initiative is a key part of our economic recovery plan as we go into the future, supporting businesses just like these ones here and so many around the country. OK, jumping back to Morrison, and here is what he said about the Devonport tragedy: Before I make some remarks about why we’re here, I want to extend on behalf of the government and Jenny and I, our deepest sympathies to all the families and all the community in Devonport for this horrific tragedy that’s occurred with the loss of five young precious lives, and more that hang in the balance. I want to thank all the first responders. You know, our first responders each and every day are trained to deal with some of the most unimaginable things, but on this occasion it goes beyond what they could have imagined and the scene on the ground. I spoke to the police commissioner this morning, thanked him and through him all the first responders. I’ve spoken to the premier again today. We’re working on programs of support for the entire Devonport community. We’re working on programs of support for the entire Devonport community. You can imagine. This is a tight-knit community. There would be few people, if any, in Devonport, that wouldn’t have a connection to one of those families, to that school, to the first responders, those impacted by this terrible, terrible tragedy. I know people will be in shock, be in grief, in disbelief. I will assure them we can do everything we can to support you through this time, not just today, but into the weeks and months ahead as you somehow seek to process this terrible tragic event. We will continue to work closely with the Tasmanian state government. Five of those 20 new Queensland Covid-19 cases are the Omicron variant. Four are overseas required, 16 detected in the community. Queensland has seen a significant jump in Covid-19 cases today, with 20 cases reported. Prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking now from Sydney and has started by once again offering his condolences to victims and family in Devonport. Former premier Gladys Berejiklian will have to wait a little longer to find out what counsel assisting Scott Robertson SC has submitted to the state’s anti-corruption body (Icac) investigation into her alleged conduct following further hearings in Operation Keppel. Submissions of counsel assisting will now be provided by 15 February 2022 instead of by today. The submissions will not be made public, but will provide Berejiklian and her legal advisers with some idea about what she might be facing in terms of possible findings. Submissions in response to the submissions of counsel assisting are to be provided to the commission by 28 March 2022, which means there is almost zero chance of a resolution before the federal election due in May. There had been speculation that Berejiklian might run for the federal seat of Warringah, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison had talked up the idea, despite the cloud cast by Icac. Berejiklian was less enamoured and ruled out the idea earlier this month, which is fortuitous given the more extended timetable revealed today. Berejiklian resigned in September after Icac announced new hearings in the investigation into her alleged role in awarding grants to her former boyfriend Daryl Maguire’s electorate of Wagga Wagga. At issue is whether Berejiklian has engaged in corrupt conduct by failing to declare the relationship to colleagues and whether she failed to report reasonable suspicions about Maguire’s behaviour to Icac as required under the Icac act. At the hearing in November, Berejiklian insisted Maguire was treated like all other MPs, that she didn’t need to disclose the relationship and vigorously rejected any wrongdoing. Out of today’s 2,213 NSW Covid-19 cases, 308 are from the Newcastle LGA. Here is Marshall on the planned removal of in-home gathering caps for fully vaccinated South Australians. The cap has been completely removed from the 28th. I know that will be a huge relief for people who have really had to do some fairly extensive workarounds. It was important in the early days of the disease, especially when we were in the elimination phase of the disease when we did not want to have a single case of community transmission otherwise it could potentially close down our entire state. The reality is that we are now in a suppression stage and we are putting speed bumps in the way of Omicron but, because of the great work that the people of South Australia are doing, it means that we can start to relax restrictions but we continue to do it in a prudent and careful way, keeping restrictions in place that will stop the spread going through South Australia to quickly. I swear, I still chuckle every time I hear “verticle consumption”. Marshall has confirmed 64 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in SA in the latest reporting period, but says policies will primarily be based around hospitalisation numbers instead of the daily total. A the moment we see an increase in numbers in South Australia. Sixty-four cases overnight in South Australia and we will see those numbers climb. Don’t forget, much of the work done previously was done on Delta and we know that the Omicron variant is far more transmissible and we are clearly going to watch this very closely but the reality is that at this point in time we are seeing far less severe symptoms from those people contracting Omicron. Our major statistic here on the issue we are focused on at the moment is hospital admissions. Today we have had our borders open for over three weeks, Omicron cases in South Australia but only three admissions to hospital. No admission to ICU and no admission to a unit that has ventilators so the reality is that we are pleased with that. We only had one person in hospital at the moment and they are in a stable condition. We are absolutely pleased that we have not seen an increased level of hospitalisation in South Australia. This is the key metric that we will watch going forward. Marshall says a number of restrictions will be relaxed (mostly for fully vaccinated people) from 28 December. These will include standing while drinking, dancing, the removal of any caps on how many vaccinated people you can have in your home, and the reduction of international travel quarantine to three days. Marshall: Relaxations are planned for December 28 and we are only doing this because of the great work of the people of South Australia. We will also be implementing a new regime in regards to nightclubs in South Australia. The good news there is that we will allow fully vaccinated nightclubs to operate at 50% capacity from December 28. That is our plan and we want to keep making sure that we get vaccination numbers. It will be a big relief for a sector that has done it disproportionately hard for a long period of time. The key issue is to go and get vaccinated. Thank you to everybody, there is a relaxation of restrictions that will take place from December 28, that is our intention. OK, going now to South Australia, and premier Steven Marshall is announcing the state’s reopening roadmap. Here is a slightly hard to read photo of it for you, I’ll try and get another version soon. Former NSW MP Eddie Obeid and his two convicted co-conspirators will remain in jail over Christmas after being refused bail, reports AAP. Lawyers for the ex-Labor powerbroker, his son Moses Obeid and his former ministerial colleague Ian Macdonald on Tuesday applied in the NSW supreme court for bail pending the hearing of their conviction appeals. The Obeids, in Cooma Correctional Centre, and Macdonald, in Lithgow prison, appeared by video link before Justice Helen Wilson who told them bail was refused during a brief hearing on Friday. She said her published reasons would be emailed to the men. Justice Elizabeth Fullerton in October jailed Obeid for at least three years and 10 months, his son for at least three years, and Macdonald for at least five years and three months. After a lengthy and complex judge-alone trial, she had found them guilty of conspiring for Macdonald to engage in misconduct as a minister between 2007 and 2009. The then resources minister was found to have breached his duties by providing confidential information to the Obeids over a coal exploration licence which delivered a $30m windfall to their family. The Crown opposed bail for Obeid, 78, his son, 52, and Macdonald, 72. Their lawyers contended the men weren’t a flight risk, citing compliance with their bail conditions for many years before they were convicted. They argued the case involved “special or exceptional” circumstances. And they submitted they had “an arguable case” on appeal which will include a claim that Justice Fullerton’s verdict was unreasonable. The court was told if their appeals were filed by March, they would be able to be heard by September, but the judgment may not be delivered until 2023. If they were successful, this would mean a significant portion of their sentence would have been served if they weren’t granted bail. There is a lot of background to this. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, was listed for a court appearance. Apparently if you pay $85.70 you can bring a private prosecution against someone in the magistrates court (how egalitarian!). So someone did. And now it’s unfolding in a very Covid-era way. On top of everything else today ... AAP says a March election is still a possibility after the Myefo (which is a pleasure to say, and stands for the slightly less pleasurable midyear economic fiscal outlook). If you tuned out a bit yesterday (I did), everyone has been reading the Myefo entrails to see if there’s a clue to when the election will fall. Maybe March. But treasurer Josh Frydenberg also referred to an early budget (which would push the election timeline out till May). So, we still don’t know. Do we care, right now? AAP says it could still happen in March because there’s a whole lotta moula that can be spent in January and February. Here’s some more on the startlingly large war chest: In the very first blog post today I mentioned that a GoFundMe page for the families of those affected by the Hillcrest primary school jumping castle tragedy in Devonport, was close to reaching $250,000. Well, in just three-and-a-half hours that has nearly doubled, and is now pushing towards half a million. Queensland’s mask mandate just announced by Annastacia Palaszczuk will kick in at 1am on Saturday. It will be revised when the state hits a vaccination rate of 90% double-dosed. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk closed out her press conference discussing the Devonport primary school tragedy. Now, finally, can I just say to the people of Tasmania, we are also deeply saddened to hear about the loss of such young lives in what should have been a happy day in such tragic circumstances and on behalf of the people of Queensland we express our deep sadness for the families that will be grieving over the Christmas period. Hospitality venues will not be included in the reinstated mask mandate as those inside must already be fully vaccinated. OK! I for sure thought there could be an unfortunate border announcement from Queensland today, but no! The borders are still open. This will come as a blessed relief for those blog readers who are very invested in my upcoming holiday to Noosa (and by that I mean my friends Josh and Sophie who are also coming). Annastacia Palaszczuk has announced masks will be back in Queensland for certain settings over the Christmas and New Year period. Masks will be mandatory in shops, retail, Woolworths, Coles. We are asking this to slow the spread of the virus. We know Christmas is one of the busiest times of the year for families, doing Christmas shopping and getting ready. In hospitals and aged care, masks are mandatory. On public transport, they’ll be mandatory. In rideshare. And of course in airports and planes, that’s already the case. We are not mandating it in workplaces at the moment. More details are expected from Queensland Health at 10am, local time. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has just stepped up for an “important announcement”. She starts the press conference with an update on the Brisbane Cross River Rail. The second tunnel of our Cross River Rail, the Brisbane underground, is through. It’s completed, it’s come right through, the breakthrough. This is a fantastic Christmas present to all who have been involved. I’ll bring you more on this soon, however it seems one of the big announcements from Queensland today was that masks will once again become mandatory in shopping centres as Omicron case numbers south of the border grow rapidly. As if there wasn’t enough going on already, St John Ambulance NSW is warning about a potential surge in venomous snakes and spiders due to the warmer weather and the wet and humid conditions from La Niña. Sarah Lance, CEO of St John Ambulance NSW, said: Australia has some of the most venomous snakes and spiders in the world. Time is critical when it comes to venomous bites, and they should be treated as a medical emergency. That is why we are asking people to brush up on the signs, symptoms and – most importantly – the treatment of snake and spider bites. Over half of the deaths from snake bites in Australia happen at home, with the most dangerous snake posing a threat in Australia is the eastern brown snake. Funnel-web spider bites can be fatal in 15 minutes, with symptoms including breathing difficulty, excess saliva, muscular twitching, numbness around the mouth, disorientation and confusion leading to unconsciousness. St John Ambulance says the best thing to do is immediately call 000 in the event of a bite, and stop the venom from travelling by keeping the patient still, laying them flat, and wrapping a bandage at the site of the bite, followed by a pressure bandage from the fingers or toes upwards. Gutwein has been asked if the Tasmanian state government has the power to ban “or at least impose a moratorium” on the type of jumping castle and inflatable balls involved in the incident and if he plans to do so. My understanding is that yesterday [the department of] education checked to see immediately whether any form of castles were being used to cross the state with a view to stopping them. Obviously we need to understand from the coroner, as the broader investigation takes place, what the recommendations are out of that, and I understand obviously that [the department of] education will be conducting its own review as well. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein says the prime minister has offered to fly in counselling and other support services from interstate to ensure the Devonport community have the care they require in the coming weeks and months. Gutwein: I spoke with the prime minister both yesterday and again this morning and he has offered any support that we need. Obviously at a time like this, we have counselling services that are available. If we need more people on the ground, he has said to me very clearly that he is happy to reach out to other states and if we need people here, then we will bring people here. Reporter: What have witnesses told you about how strong the wind was and how sudden? Hine: I think I’ve already said in the media that there are various accounts of how strong the wind ... It is fair to say that the wind was quite strong. Again, this will all form part of the investigation to try to get an estimation of the wind strength, to see whether it was a freak event. All of those questions, we’ve all got them. The coroner has required that we work together to make sure that a full picture is put together. Reporter: What was the connection with the Zorb balls, were they inside the castle or outside? Tasmania police commissioner Darren Hine: That will form part of the investigation, but my understanding is that the Zorb balls were outside. But it will form part of the investigation. Reporter: Were all the kids who were injured, were they inside the jumping castle? Hine: Again, that forms part of the investigation. It is fair to say that those injured were inside the castle. We need to piece the movements of the individuals together so we can present a full picture to the coroner. The police commissioner says they will not go into details about if and how the jumping castle was tethered to the ground as this will form part of the WorkSafe and coroner’s investigations. The secretary of the department of education, Tim Bullard, has laid out the supports in place for the school community: At Hillcrest school today, we have a team of our own professional support staff, including school psychologists, social workers and chaplains, supporting children and their families, and the Department of Health is also assisting with access to child and adolescent mental health services. Together we are working together to ensure that those impacted are receiving the care and assistance that they need at this time. And for our Hillcrest families, I urge you, please make contact with the school so that you can access appropriate support. We will continue to be in contact with families through the weekend and over the course of the holidays. For others affected by this incident, as the premier said, there are a range of local support services that will be part of a coordinated response. And the Department of Education website has a list of those services that are available. These events will take some time to come to terms with, and I know that continued support and care is essential, as we know there will be lasting impacts to our students, our families and our staff, as well as to the wider community. In closing, this event may impact your own children and young people right across the state. So it is so important that we take particular care of them and surround them with our love at this time. I will now hand back to the commissioner. Gutwein has confirmed a full investigation will be launched into the incident. As the commissioner said yesterday, a full investigation is underway and the coroner has visited the scene. I make a commitment to all of the families impacted by this tragedy that we will stand with you and we will support you. I spoke just a short time ago with the prime minister and he has offered any support that we need and I have been working closely with the mayor and where support, where services, where counselling is [needed], then we will provide those services. My heart goes out to everyone that is impacted by this tragic event, for the four children especially who remain in hospital. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families during this difficult time. Can I just say once again to the parents of the five children that tragically died yesterday that our thoughts are with you. As I community, as a state, we are thinking of you. I want to just once again remind people of the numbers that they can call if they do need assistance: Lifeline, 13 11 14. The helpline, 1800 551 800. The mental health helpline, 1800 333 288. Beyond Blue 1300 224 636. Gutwein: We are very grateful for this support at this very sad time. Overnight and again this morning I have had the opportunity to speak with people in this community, to come to understand just how connected this community is, the number of people I’ve spoken to that knew people who were there yesterday, or had connections to the school, and I know that this is going to be a very challenging time for this entire community. I know that I speak for all Tasmanians when I extend my deepest sympathies to the family, friends and loved ones of everyone affected by this tragedy. As a parent, I cannot understand how the parents of those who have lost children must be feeling. But as a parent, I hope that they can understand that we are all feeling for you as well. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, has urged Tasmanians to reach out to family, friends and professional help if they are struggling with the Hillcrest primary school tragedy. Today the Tasmanian community continues to grieve for the five children who sadly lost their lives yesterday. We also continue to hope and pray for the four children who remain in hospital, that they will be able to recover. The tragedy which occurred yesterday is beyond comprehension. It is devastating, heartbreaking. It’s just simply incomprehensible. What should have been a celebration for the end of the school year turned into an unfortunate tragedy for our young children at Hillcrest primary. Overnight there has been an enormous outpouring of grief as well as support for those involved here in Devonport, across Tasmania, across the country and indeed across the world. Tasmanian police commissioner Darren Hine: Tasmanians are already coming together to support each other at this very difficult time. The whole community and particularly the Devonport region is feeling this loss deeply. Support those around you and ask for help if you are struggling. That is so important. I have already spoken to some of the officers and emergency responders who attended and I would like to thank them again for their incredible response to such a confronting and distressing incident. Again, my heart goes out to all those affected and my thoughts are with them. For privacy reasons at this stage we won’t be providing any further details on the victims. Again, I urge media to allow the families and school community some space to process this devastating event. The Tasmanian press conference is starting now, and we are hearing from the police. As you are aware, yesterday evening another child lost their life in hospital. This takes the death toll of this tragedy to five. The investigation is ongoing and police are preparing a report for the coroner with the support of WorkSafe Tasmania. I know this means you will have some questions that we are not able to answer as many details will be a matter for the coroner. I can say that police understand there were close to 40 year 5 and 6 students taking part in the end-of-term activities when this incident occurred. Several adults were also in attendance when the inflatable equipment lifted into the air and they rendered first aid until emergency services arrived. Nine children were seriously injured. Tragically five of those children have died, three boys and two girls. One was 11 years old, four were 12 years old. Three remain in a critical condition at the Royal Hobart Hospital. One is now recovering from home. A spokesperson for the home affairs department has given further detail on the safeguards in the deal between Australia and the US to speed up information sharing about criminal suspects between law enforcement agencies and tech companies. The department said: The CLOUD Act Agreement includes specific prohibitions on the targeting of each other’s citizens and people located in the other’s jurisdiction. For example, Australian citizens, permanent residents and persons located in Australia cannot be the subject of US orders under the new framework. Neither can Australian law enforcement nor national security agencies use the agreement to gather evidence on US citizens or anyone located in the US. A key part of the IPO framework is the independent authorisation by judges, magistrates and Administrative Appeals Tribunal members of orders for electronic data from US communications service providers. Oversight and transparency arrangements are similar to those that apply under the domestic framework. For example, as with Australian agencies’ access to domestic data, there will be robust and extensive oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and public reporting on use of international production orders. The deal is expected to be operational by the end of 2022 as it first needs to be considered by the joint standing committee on treaties. AHHHH! Why is Annastacia Palaszczuk tweeting in the third person all of a sudden? In any case, an important announcement coming up at 8.45am Queensland time, 9.45am Sydney and Melbourne time. ACTU secretary Sally McManus has once again called for the urgent rollout of booster shots to all disability and aged care residents and staff. By the way, we should be hearing from the Tasmanian premier reasonably soon, to discuss the primary school jumping castle tragedy. Just a note, this is the highest ever daily Covid-19 tally for NSW. Victoria has once again recorded fewer new Covid-19 infections with 1,510 new cases. Seven people infected with Covid-19 have also died. NSW has recorded another large jump in Covid-19 case numbers, with 2,213 new infections. Sadly one person with Covid-19 has died. OK, let’s break up the heavy news a little bit with the millipede that ACTUALLY has 1,000 legs for once. Donna Lu has this very fun report: The federal government has released its final report on the Indigenous voice to parliament co-design this morning. Ken Wyatt, the minister for Indigenous Australians, says this will “enable broader community discussion and consultation with jurisdictions”. The Morrison government committed at the 2019 federal election to undertake a process of co-design to develop models and options for an Indigenous voice and to enhance local and regional decision-making. Today we have delivered on that commitment, following an extensive co-design process involving more than 9,400 people, communities and organisations. The Local &amp; Regional Voice will contribute to achieving the Closing the Gap outcomes by providing avenues for Indigenous voices to be heard, including to provide feedback to government on Closing the Gap. Independent senator Rex Patrick has condemned the prime minister’s department for claiming it cannot find a key letter from Christian Porter to Scott Morrison about the sports rorts affair, a position seemingly at odds with the attorney general’s office, which has fought to keep the document secret. Patrick has been fighting an almost two-year freedom of information battle with the attorney general’s office, seeking access to a letter from the then attorney general to the prime minister about the administration of the community sport infrastructure program. The attorney general’s letter is thought to provide legal advice to the prime minister on a particular aspect of the damning auditor general’s report that found the government handed out $100m in sport grants in order to favour “targeted” Coalition seats at the May 2019 election. You can read the full report below: The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has just appeared on the Today show, defending the somewhat optimistic assumptions in today’s budget update, by once again stating the Omicron appears to be a less severe form of the virus. (Even though it’s only been around for two months and it’s really quite early to know anything for sure about it yet). Treasury’s forecasts yesterday were based on the best medical advice that has been provided to the government and the chief health officer has said very publicly that while this Omicron variant looks to be highly transmissible, it’s perhaps less severe than other variants and that our vaccine is a defence against the virus and so too our our – are our treatments. There is no need to panic. Premiers need to keep their heads and to stay calm and obviously proceed with the national plan. That means reopening in a Covid-safe way. The deputy opposition leader, Richard Marles, who was on a panel with Dutton, says he was deeply affected by the photos of police officers weeping and comforting each other at the scene: The first responders and their need to look after each other given what they witnessed and what they had to deal with speaks to how desperately sad this tragedy is. I think for the likes of Peter and I, we spent this time of year going to primary schools, particularly at the end of their school year. We join in with their celebrations. It is a really emotional time, the end of the primary school year. Grade 6s graduating. It is a joyous moment that these kids were going to that yesterday with a sense of celebration. And that it turns out this way. It is just desperately sad ... But for all of us ... well everyone. I was going to say for all of us who are parents, this is just an unspeakable tragedy. And our thoughts and prayers are very much with those families and with those kids who are fighting for their lives right now. The federal defence minister, Peter Dutton, told Nine News that the tragedy of the fatal jumping castle accident in Tasmania is “indescribable”. The only comfort you can take at the moment ... [is] that there is community support and people are rallying around each other, which is important. Because it is obviously at the worst possible time of the year, just to compound the shocking tragedy in any case. I just think those families will need every support not just in the coming hours and days but for years to come. I mean, as a parent, you could just never ever recover from this and the whole community will be shattered. So, as you say, thank God for people like Fiona and others in a small-knit community and they are pulling together and they must. The interview with Birmingham moves on to the latest budget update released by the federal government. While it paints a slightly better picture of Australia’s financial situation, as ABC host Micheal Rowland points out, the update assumes the federal government will continue to control the pandemic, with most restrictions coming off from the start of next year. With Omnicron surging is NSW and little still known about this new variant, it’s unclear if this is actually a realistic outlook. Here is what the finance minister had to say about it: I don’t think [it’s too optimistic]. We have been cautious along the way and we’ve continued in many instances to be able to exceed expectations, that the economic outcome, the employment outcome, the jobs outcome, are all better than we had previously forecast. Debt will be lower than we previously forecast. On previous occasions, we’ve shown that we take a careful, cautious and conservative approach to these things and in terms of this budget update, we are continuing that. In terms of Omicron and Covid, Australians should still have confidence because we have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world – more than 90% double-dosed across Australia, higher than New Zealand, or the United Kingdom or Finland or Norway. We have now more than 1 million Australians who have had their booster and we’ve just recorded a record day in terms of delivery of booster shots, and we encourage people to get those done as soon as they fall due to make sure that we can maintain that maximum protection that can enable us to continue to safely and effectively reopen. Appearing on ABC News Breakfast, finance minister Simon Birmingham has been asked about his reaction to the tragedy unfolding in Tasmania: Look, I’ve got to say in all honesty that more than once tears have come to my eye when I’ve listened to news reports about it. It is incredible to think about the trauma, the lows, the difficulty for those kids, their playmates and friends, their parents, the teachers, the police and ambos. It is just something, for many of us, who have particularly spent many hours standing beside bouncy castles, an unspeakable trauma and tragedy and a loss that many will never recover from. Our hearts go out to them. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who went to school in Devonport, said people in the community were still in shock after a freak jumping castle accident has resulted in the deaths of five primary school students, with four more in a critical condition and one with serious injuries. She told Nine Network this morning: I’m a bit scared to get on the phone and make calls actually. I don’t know whose children they are. I don’t know whose grandchildren they are. So, I think for us today, I think we’re still in shock. Like, you know, I’m sitting there doing a Zoom and I could see one child had gone, and then another. The numbers kept going up. It is the most awful thing before Christmas time. Honestly! It is just ... I just ... I think we’re all in shock. You don’t even want to know about it. It is just awful. The former Wallabies star David Pocock says he will run as an independent candidate for the Senate at next year’s federal election, declaring climate change as “the greatest threat we face”. In a statement issued this morning, Pocock indicated he would also target voters who were “fed up with ‘politics as usual”. They don’t want another politician who’ll deliver a line that’s been workshopped and run through a focus group, but someone who really believes in what they’re saying. Pocock will run as a candidate for the upper house in the ACT – meaning he faces an uphill battle, given the territory has only two Senate seats. Currently, Labor and the Liberal party each have one ACT Senate seat. You may remember that last night it was confirmed that the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has been forced into isolation, awaiting a negative Covid-19 test, after attending a birthday party on the Elwood foreshore last weekend, that has since become a Covid-19 hot spot. Well, good news for the premier, he is negative and free to once again go out and about. A sharp rise in Covid-19 transmissions in NSW has prompted the state’s health department to restrict visits to health facilities. Patients will be allowed visitors for compassionate reasons only and to provide essential needs including palliative care and supporting women in childbirth. All visitors must be fully vaccinated and follow mask-wearing rules. Last night NSW tweeted out: We have temporarily restricted visitors to healthcare facilities due to increasing transmission rates with the emergence of the Omicron variant. We have not made this decision lightly. We must always prioritise our vulnerable patients and staff who are arguably the most vital workers needed in a pandemic. The latest significant cluster emerged from a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the Sydney CBD on Friday, AAP reports. At least 97 people have tested positive so far, NSW Health said on Thursday evening, with at least some of the cases likely to be the Omicron variant. All 600 people who arrived at the Metro Theatre after 9pm were designated close contacts and forced to isolate for a week. A series of super-spreader events in Newcastle have caused a wave of infections in the Hunter area, which was responsible for 633 of the new cases. The majority are the Omicron variant. Two 20-year-old men have been fined for attending one of the events – a Wednesday evening party at a nightclub – in defiance of self-isolation orders after they were designated as close contacts. They both later tested positive. More than 200 people contracted the virus at the party. Good morning everyone, it’s Matilda Boseley here on the blog with you today. Tributes have been pouring in for the five children who died in a freak jumping castle accident at a primary school in north-west Tasmania. A wind gust lifted the jumping castle into the air and a number of children fell from a height of about 10 metres during end-of-year celebrations at Hillcrest primary school in Devonport on Thursday. The dead include two boys and two girls. The gender of the fifth child, whose death was confirmed by police last night, has not yet been revealed. A GoFundMe page set up by a Devonport resident has already raised more than $250,000 for the families of those affected. In a separate fundraiser, the aunt of one of the girls who has died described her as “precious”. I don’t even know what to write at this stage. Everyone is devastated, she was always such a sweet kind, old soul. A close family friend of one of the boys who died described him as “such a beautiful caring, gentle soul”. [He] had challenges growing up with his autism and ADHD but that never set him back he kept achieving. At least four more children are in hospital, with three in a critical condition and one in a serious condition, Tasmania’s premier, Peter Gutwein, said. Tasmania’s education department will provide support to children, families and staff in the coming days and into the school holidays, and counselling has also been offered to first responders. Department secretary Tim Bullard said: Our approach is being guided by our senior psychologists, who are trained in trauma-informed practice. What has occurred is a tragedy and there are no words that I can give that would take away the grief that those impacted families are feeling right now. I will bring you further updates throughout the morning here on the blog."

          "headline": "The 50 best films of 2021 in the UK, No 1: The Power of the Dog",
          "bodyText": "The year’s best film is a western, based on a novel from the 1960s (by Thomas Savage) when the western was a more accepted popular genre in both movies and books than it is now. But it modifies that genre, creating something more elusive and unmanageable: western psychodrama? Western gothic? And it tackles issues around sexual politics, toxic masculinity and family dysfunction in a very contemporary way. The Power of the Dog is Jane Campion’s first feature film in over a decade, the last 10 years having been mostly taken up with her hit streaming-TV series, Top of the Lake, with Elisabeth Moss. Maybe that project influenced the element of murder mystery in this latest film, whose title is taken from Psalms 22:20: “Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog!” Benedict Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons play two brothers, Phil and George, who run a cattle ranch in 1920s Montana. Phil is a sweaty roughneck: an instinctive and vicious bully who calls his brother “fatso”, encourages the ranch-hands to mock him and jeers at George’s pretensions to fancy clothes and hats. In his self-important and self-congratulatory way, Phil is obsessed with the fact he is the one with the hands-on practical know-how to make the ranch work, unlike his milksop brother, because he learned these skills from a veteran rancher, now dead, called Bronco Henry. But Phil is also repressed and utterly reliant on George emotionally: these two grown men share a bedroom in their large house like little kids. But which of these two is putting on airs? Who is putting on the act? The two brothers come from money: their rich, sophisticated and politically well-connected parents staked them in the business. There is an excruciating scene when the elderly couple come for dinner: George insists on dressing up in a tux. But Phil embarrasses everyone by showing up sweaty and dirty. The existing tensions between the brothers explode into the open when George reveals to Phil that he has got married, to Rose (Kirsten Dunst) the widow who runs the cafe in town and has a sensitive teenage son Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee), now to be George’s stepson and heir. Rose is going to move in as the mistress of the house and Phil senses the immediate loss in his own status: he subjects Rose to a hateful campaign of harassment and makes Peter the subject of homophobic bullying. But then, a strange turnaround takes place: he makes friends with young Peter and declares he will take him riding in the remote hills where he will school him in the ways of ranching and being a man – the way Bronco Henry schooled him. Cumberbatch makes Phil a vivid and horrible monster, all the more disquieting for his flashes of intelligence and cunning. When Rose brings her piano into the big house (an irresistible echo of the earlier Campion classic) and attempts to play Strauss’s Radetzky March on it, Phil mischievously joins in on his five-string banjo, putting poor Rose off her stroke and revealing that he is, in fact, rather more musically talented than she is. But Kodi Smit-McPhee’s performance as Peter matches him in presence and potency, and the story doesn’t at all go where you think. It is a movie with lethal bite."

Check in every weekday to see our next picks, and please share your own favourite albums of 2021 in the comments below. 50 Agnes – Magic Still Exists The Swedish pop star’s long-delayed fifth album embodies the platonic ideal of pop disco, steeped in Gaga (invigoratingly stern vocals about freeing one’s mind and body), Abba (piano stomps and trills), Donna Summer (the thumping 24 Hours) and Queen (melodramatic balladry). It transcends pastiche on the strength of her songwriting (you could swap almost anything here on to Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia) and the going-for-broke intensity of it all. LS 49 MØL – Diorama Blending the blast beats and acid-gargling glottal mayhem of black metal with the uplifting, even sentimental guitar dynamics of shoegaze, “blackgaze” has become a vibrant corner of heavy music – and Danish quintet MØL became one of its best exponents with their second album. The moody breakdowns allow the explosive choruses to land all the more righteously, with vocalist Kim Song Sternkopf – a survivor of faith cults as a child – venting majestically into the mic. Tracks such as Serf bring in a groove metal sensibility to help it all swing. BBT 48 Lucy Dacus – Home Video Some of the year’s best musical storytelling lived in the Virginia songwriter’s third record, her writing newly amplified by subtle hints of pop propulsion and grit that evoked how Elliott Smith expanded his sound. Dacus reflects on her teenage years – of church and bible camp, of budding queer desire amid a culture of shame and damnation, of the fantasies that let her escape these limitations – with such tender curiosity that these vignettes feel less like fixed memories than forensic crime scene reconstructions. Read the full review. LS 47 Chai – WINK The truly self-assured rarely make a noise about it, and so it is with the third album by Japanese girl group Chai. To blissed-out, dreamy synth-pop that buoys you along like a lazy river – occasionally spiked by classic rap throwbacks and arcade-game electro – the four-piece dreamily hymn the joys of food, self-acceptance and protest, nurturing their own laid-back take on pleasure activism. LS 46 Stephen Fretwell – Busy Guy A songwriters’ songwriter beloved of Elbow and Arctic Monkeys, Stephen Fretwell was washing pots in a Wetherspoon’s pub, his music career having flatlined amid fatherhood. He hauled himself up and gave music another shot, apparently at the cost of his marriage. So these songs are the work of a truly inveterate musician, and it shows – Fretwell has such a natural facility for an affecting turn of melody, his simple fingerpicked guitar made eerie by the subtle ambient tones that sit behind it. BBT 45 For Those I Love – For Those I Love Poignant memories seem to lengthen and soften as we age, but this album is a reminder of how much jagged heft they have when you’re looking back after just a few years or months. David Balfe, 30, reflects on a dead best friend, poverty, trauma and the intense vibrancy of young friendships and creativity, in long recitations set to music that reaches towards techno and house. “You’re told you need to grow cold to grow old,” Balfe says, but he remains charged up with human warmth on these songs. Read the full review. BBT 44 Black Country, New Road – For the First Time You don’t tend to get many Top 5 charting albums from bands who blend klezmer, post-punk, jazz and prog with lyrics about failed romance at a science fair, but Black Country, New Road managed it. That success is testament to how particular and fresh their sound is amid the ordinary boys of British indie, further helped by a really arresting frontman, Isaac Wood. Whether it’s really him or a persona, he is haughty, easily hurt, lustful, clumsy and incurably romantic – a wonderful, flawed character. Read the full review. BBT 43 Chris Corsano and Bill Orcutt – Made Out of Sound For this album, made remotely last year, guitarist Orcutt improvised to Corsano’s drum tracks, observing the waveforms as he recorded “so I could see when a crescendo was coming or when to bring it down”, he said. It’s reminiscent of a surfer’s mentality, and Made Out of Sound feels thrillingly like the trusty unpredictability of broaching the sea: absurdist guitar begets quieter contemplation; burnished riffs harden and soften, then collapse. Throughout, the open-ended sense of beauty is undimmed. LS 42 Gojira – Fortitude Metal’s potential for thunderous anger makes it the most naturally expressive music to vent the fear, confusion and even shame of the climate crisis. “The greatest miracle is burning to the ground,” laments Joe Duplantier with bafflement and urgency, singing about the Amazon but perhaps also the entire planet. Other songs are direct rallying cries to save Earth (Into the Storm, Sphinx); Another World turns jaded and escapist, but is offset by The Chant, whose hearty chorus is the kind of thing a post-apocalyptic band of survivors would sing while rowing across a flooded city. Fortitude is an album that surveys humanity’s idiocy, but also its tenacity. BBT 41 Eris Drew – Quivering in Time The joyous ecclesiastical energy of house enriches your soul on listening to this full-length from the US producer, which also chimes with the desire for optimism and gregariousness amid the waning pandemic. Like a lot of the best underground dance artists in recent years (Skee Mask, Anz etc), she firmly embraces the breakbeat-driven sound of the early 90s – Ride Free even has the same Peter Fonda sample as Primal Scream’s Loaded – and further enriches those busy, cymbal-heavy rhythms with zesty detailing: rave melodies, declarative vocal samples, penetrating bass notes. Read the full review. BBT 40 Lana Del Rey – Chemtrails Over the Country Club Who is Lana Del Rey really? The question that has animated her decade-long career has sometimes riled her, but the first of two albums she released this year turns introspective to consider the matter. Was she happiest as a 19-year-old waitress listening to Kings of Leon, as she sings in stunning falsetto on White Dress? Is she most herself as a sister, a lover, a star, an adopted Californian – or embracing her wanderlust and escaping all that? The myth and melodrama, at least, remain unchanged on a Lana album made with an unusually light touch. Read the full review. LS 39 Hayley Williams – Flowers for Vases/Descansos With pop-punk surging this year, Paramore’s influence may never have been stronger – but the band’s flag bearer continued to burrow away from incandescent rock into stranger, subtler sounds. Williams’ second solo album in two years observed the dying days of her marriage, and how the reliability of sadness became its own sort of safe harbour. That strange sense of comforting desolation hums through in acoustic guitar and ghostly piano, although Williams’ innate way with a vocal hook provides the defiant life force. LS 38 Goat Girl – On All Fours The south London quartet’s debut was garage rock with a touch of psych; this sophomore album grandly scaled that second element up, using synths to crack open a portal out of the drab, repressive everyday. The bigger ambition was partly predicated by one member surviving cancer, and the band don’t shy from big questions about life and death: the climate crisis, capitalism and the struggle to be allowed one’s truth and identity are among the topics broached. BBT 37 Erika de Casier – Sensational Any crush has a delicate alchemy, and liable to lurch towards obsession or revulsion as the fantasy of someone duels with the reality. On the second album by the Portuguese-born Danish songwriter, her would-be lover may be a braggart who is rude to waiters, but that smile is irresistible: what are you gonna do? Her minimalist take on turn-of-the-millennium R&amp;B shivers with sensitivity, essaying every heart flutter and gut punch in plush bass, glassy percussion and elegant strings, while De Casier’s coy delivery brims with a beguiling sense of mystery. Read the full review. LS 36 Aya – Im Hole This is the kind of slippery, funny, explosively creative record that perhaps could only be made in the UK. Yorkshirewoman Aya Sinclair mulches various bits of club culture in to a fetid, sweating mass – grime, breakbeat, drill, the off-kilter electronics of Autechre, the hyper-contemporary bass shudder of the late Sophie – and threads vocals through it, her surreal non sequiturs and body horror hovering on the edge of rap. BBT 35 Aly &amp; AJ – A Touch of the Beat Gets You Up on Your Feet Gets You Out and Then Into the Sun It’s one of pop’s sweetest narratives: former child stars escape the machine to make a great, offbeat record. Fourteen years after their last album, one-time Disney performers Aly and AJ softened their synth-pop pedigree in this dreamy collection of west coast pop-rock, a vision of Robyn-gone-Laurel Canyon that also might sate anyone left hoping for a bit more brooding from this year’s Kacey Musgraves album. LS 34 The War on Drugs – I Don’t Live Here Anymore The psychedelic, shoegaze-y haze has gradually lifted from Adam Granduciel’s band, burned off under a rising sun as their success has grown. He now stands in the midday of his career, with this fifth album fully embracing bright, mainstream classic rock. Powered by those distinctive WoD backbeats, which match the tirelessness of Granduciel’s search for love, perspective and contentment, these songs are huge in scale: both the arrangements and the strength of feeling. Read the full review. BBT 33 PinkPantheress – To Hell With It In the TikTok phenomenon PinkPantheress’s micro-pop gems (only two songs on her debut project exceeded two minutes), classic drum’n’bass samples double as nagging memories and overwhelming rushes of adrenaline, swirling around lyrics about obsession and disappointment made more sinister by her innocent, breathless voice. Fourteen years ago, Burial’s transient, lonely, sodium-lit sound became associated with the experience of sitting on the night bus. PinkPantheress makes music befitting another after-hours rite of passage: that bleary-eyed, rueful stumble through bright lights and swarming crowds as you try to hold it together. LS 32 Cassandra Jenkins – An Overview on Phenomenal Nature The New Yorker’s second album is almost confrontationally still: brass like wisps of smoke, guitar a gentle thrum, softly puddling cymbals. Once the aftershocks of a loss have settled, Jenkins takes stock of what’s gone for good – Ambiguous Norway orbits her memories of David Berman, whose band Purple Mountains she was set to tour with prior to his death – and how learning how to trust again might yet retrieve her stolen sense of peace. LS 31 Low – Hey What Low’s last album, 2018’s Double Negative, was a total reinvention 25 years into a virtually undented career – a staggering achievement for any band. Yet somehow Alan and Mimi Sparhawk transcended it with this follow-up, bridling its predecessor’s swashbuckling noise until it splintered, and contrasting it with electronic reimaginings of the forlorn atmospherics that made their name. The sheer invention contrasted devastating lyrics about hitting a wall – drawn from the couple’s experiences dealing with Alan’s depression – imbuing these static hymns to limits and perseverance with a superhuman sense of determination. Read the full review. LS 30 Greentea Peng – Man Made There’s a wonderful sense of liveness to this record, evoking a dive bar with a fug of weed smoke sitting at shoulder height. On stage is London-born Aria Wells, whose delivery is natural and improvisatory: vowels that bend drowsily downwards, or rap flow that sits on top of the beat without being too fussily precise. Behind her a band shuffle through a selection of grooves – reggae, neo-soul, hip-hop – that add up to a sensual, instinctive album that you could imagine Amy Winehouse making on a different timeline. Read the full review. BBT 29 Clairo – Sling A strong self-preservationist streak ran through several highly anticipated albums by pop’s young women this year, with the likes of Billie Eilish, Lorde and Kacey Musgraves opting for lower-key sounds that poured cool water on heightened expectations. Among them was Clairo, whose second album left behind bedroom electro-pop for perfectly turned miniatures of Carole King’s warm classicism. Irrepressibly, sweetly funky, it sounded like music for pushing the furniture back and dancing on the living room rug – and Clairo’s lyrics, about breaking with relationships that no longer served her, underscored that joyful intimacy. Read the full review. LS 28 Kacey Musgraves – Star-Crossed Every stage of a breakup is sung in chronological order here: marital worries, hope for the relationship being good enough, worsening arguments, split, poignant staring at old photos, perspective gained, exciting/depressing ventures on to dating apps, eventual feeling of true freedom. Swerve a couple of tepid chillout-compilation moments and along the journey you alight at some of Musgraves’ prettiest songwriting, nicely leavened with her straight-talking, wearily dismayed tone of voice. Read the full review. BBT 27 St Vincent – Daddy’s Home It was perhaps slightly overshadowed by its backstory: Annie Clark’s father’s release from prison, which, for some listeners, cast the entire record in an unsympathetic light. But its lyricism was much richer than one man, and its 70s-inspired music richer still: psychedelic soul, cabaret songcraft, prog ballads, cosmic funk. Clark remains a highly literate and shapeshifting songwriter, where half the fun is working out how much is ironised and how much is real. Read the full review. BBT 26 Mogwai – As the Love Continues In a feat of lockdown recording, Dave Fridmann produced Mogwai’s 10th studio album over Zoom and Atticus Ross directed an orchestra in Budapest via remote connection from Los Angeles. The classic Mogwai physicality remained undimmed by these virtual limitations, however, swerving between twinkling beauty (Dry Fantasy) and pleasingly barbed dirges (Ceiling Granny), and chucking in a new bag of glitter (Supposedly, We Were Nightmares) for good measure. Happily for all involved, it became their first UK No 1 album. Read the full review. LS 25 Madlib – Sound Ancestors A relatively austere and serious release from the collagist hip-hop beatmaker, letting his fabled samples really stretch out and inhabit the songs instead of chopping between them – a result of Kieren “Four Tet” Hebden arranging the album. There’s still room for Madlib’s trickster energy though, as found in a chaotic blurt of mayhem-inducing rap duo MOP. The title track is spiritual jazz, but that genre’s mood pervades the entire album, as Madlib communes with more than half a century of sound. Read the full review. BBT 24 Billie Eilish – Happier Than Ever On her second album, Billie Eilish not only defied the tacit assumption that there’s nothing less appealing than complaining about the ravages wrought by fame but reinvigorated the cliche by toying deliciously with concealment and exposure. She sings about sexual fantasies and clandestine assignations and the power she can wield to keep her partners quiet, flexing her ability to carry on in secret – despite manifold violations of her privacy – as if it were a coveted jewel. She and her collaborator brother Finneas brought the same thrill to intimacy as they did to adolescent fears on her debut, tracing the scope of Eilish’s newfound commitment to her own pleasure in dreamy golden-age classicism and hormone-spiking techno. She let her listeners share in sensation even if the details were off-limits. Read the full review. LS 23 Floating Points, London Symphony Orchestra and Pharoah Sanders – Promises Promises is an album that rewards patience. Not only was it Pharoah Sanders’ first major recording in a decade – and a record five years in the making itself – but its nine movements unfolded with a rare subtlety. A chiming refrain written by Sam Shepherd (AKA Floating Points) and played by the LSO sparkled like dawn’s first light, its sense of potential undimmed over 45 minutes of repetition. Sanders’ saxophone playing, lightyears softer than the blazing attack that made his name, activated that magic. The harmony between them generated its own sense of orbit, with cello and violin solos and the moving spectacle of Sanders’ singing voice balanced in a kind of celestial harmony. Read the full review. LS 22 Laura Mvula – Pink Noise After enduring the humiliation of her old label dropping her with a seven-line email, Mvula donned the musical equivalent of shoulder pads – namely the 1980s’ gated drums, pugilistic bass and immaculately buffed synths – for this supreme display of confidence against the odds. The stylisation never comes at the expense of heart, either: Mvula delves deep as she searches for freedom in desire, art and within her own body, stretching her voice into majestic, wild anthems of liberation. Read the full review. LS 21 The Coral – Coral Island Few of their peers from the 00s indie boom are so hale and hearty; 20 years into their career, the Merseyside band made their most ambitious album, and one of their best. It’s a double concept album about a seaside resort, and captures those towns’ blend of buckets-and-spades buoyancy and out-of-season malaise; gorgeous harmonies flow through jangling psych-pop and touches of northern soul, though there’s also creepy rockabilly emanating from the ghost train and ballads for lonely fishermen at the end of the pier. Read the full review. BBT 20 Arooj Aftab – Vulture Prince The year’s biggest musical revelation came from Pakistani composer Arooj Aftab, who set traditional Urdu ghazals (and an adaptation of a poem by Rumi) amid harp and strings that rippled and ran as clear as a fresh stream. In her rich, meditative vocals, Aftab weighed the beauty of a single phrase and tenaciously addressed existential disappointments; her small ensemble shapeshifted between intricate filigrees and paring back to make a virtue of space. Made in response to the death of her younger brother, and released into an unprecedented global experience of grief, Vulture Prince was a refuge for solace and contemplation. LS 19 Dave – We’re All Alone in This Together “It’s like flying first class on a crashing plane,” Dave says of his fame and wealth at the outset of his second album. Few rappers have sounded so ill at ease with critical and commercial success as him – even when firing off bars about gorgeous women, there’s a wary, jaded tone to his voice. And in many ways, nothing has changed: he remains angry at the government over immigration and social mobility, and relationships certainly haven’t got easier. “Love’s a film and I’m just flicking through the parts I’m in.” That sense of a man looking down at his own life is Dave’s tragedy, and what makes his tracks such, well, psychodramas. Read the full review. BBT 18 Turnstile – Glow On The compressed, febrile sound of 80s punk rock is resurrected for this terrifically entertaining record, where the jams are not just kicked out but also sent off the nearest cliff. The monstrous chug of cock-rock rhythm guitar underpins lead lines made for whipping a mane of hair around to, and Brendan Yates’s vocals have something of Perry Farrell’s yelled pronouncements to them. But there’s a dream-pop softness, too – not least in two songs with Blood Orange guesting – that adds emotional range. BBT 17 Tirzah – Colourgrade The intimacy of new parenthood, where the world shrinks to a few rooms, is expressed in a new singular language by the south London musician (she also evokes the strangeness of those circumscribed Covid lockdowns). Breath, touch, kisses and sleep fill her songs, which conjure dub, hip-hop, post-punk and folk as if trying to remember them from a previous life. This album has the kind of utterly natural beauty that other artists strive towards, but will never reach because of that very striving. Read the full review. BBT 16 Deafheaven – Infinite Granite For their most mainstream album yet, the band’s screams abated, the drums slowed their gallop, and the guitars took on a prettiness that recalled Coldplay at times. For certain metalheads, these are unforgivable sins and Deafheaven remain a divisive band – but for the rest of us, this is a stirring blend of arena rock and shoegaze that seems to fill the sky. Read the full review. BBT 15 Nick Cave and Warren Ellis – Carnage The spirit of Scott Walker fills this idiosyncratic and brilliant album, which pumps with blood as bright and oxygenated as its red cover text. Freed from the occasionally sentimental and over-sumptuous backings of recent Bad Seeds albums, Cave and Ellis stalk off into a wilderness fringed with cyberpunk detritus: strange bits of production prowl at the edges of these violent songs. In its second half, the sky turns gentler as Cave ponders ageing across four ambient ballads: “I’m 200 pounds of packed ice / Sitting on a chair and in the morning sun” is as good an image for the inevitability of death as you’ll find. Read the full review. BBT 14 Lil Nas X – Montero One of the most proudly queer pop records ever released, where sex isn’t veiled in metaphor but detailed right down to where the ejaculate lands. Lil Nas X writes wittily about lust and witheringly about his rivals, but there are also frank admissions of loneliness and doubt as he navigates his way into the lasting fame that is assured by his stunningly good top line melodies. Read the full review. BBT 13 Japanese Breakfast – Jubilee Michelle Zauner (pictured above) weaves beguilingly strange fantasies of how fulfilment might look throughout her third album as Japanese Breakfast. The rapturous Paprika considers how it would feel to “stand at the height of your powers” as an artist, but other songs about desire – for other people, and for life – explore agency and submission in striking shades of grey. The musical roles on Jubilee are just as mutable, shapeshifting convincingly from New Order-era pop to the brassy filigrees of early 2010s indie, and the arrangements give Zauner space to wonder. LS 12 Jazmine Sullivan – Heaux Tales The power struggle between reason and desire fuels the Philadelphia songwriter’s fourth release, which intersperses soulful swagger and forlorn blues with interludes by women describing what they mean by owning their sexuality. Sullivan’s compassion resonates in how freely her interviewees express what some might see as contradictions (threatened with a sex tape leak, the subject of Ari’s Tale shrugs, “That dick spoke life into me”). And her own songs could be righteous – Pick Up Your Feelings snaps impatiently, and she makes no bones about her own pleasure on the languid On It – but they’re also transparent about the ways that freedom and dignity don’t always look how you might expect. “I just want to be taken care of / ’Cause I’ve worked enough,” she sings on The Other Side. LS 11 Sam Fender – Seventeen Going Under The North Shields songwriter’s second album starts with a grim image of teenage desensitisation: a chronically ill parent, snuff videos, fist fights and arrests; rinse and repeat. The forecast hardly improves across Seventeen Going Under, on which hope is elusive amid Fender’s bitter depictions of feeling trapped by political alienation and inherited bad habits. And yet the sheer force of feeling in this record – tenaciously euphoric sax a la Springsteen, tempos that bob like a featherweight boxer hungry for their shot, a reckless taste for the epic – indicates a life force that won’t be stamped out so easily, one that, going by the rabid response to the album, has mass revivifying potential. Read the full review. LS 10 Mdou Moctar – Afrique Victime In Mdou Moctar’s world, riff and rhythm count but the solo is king. His grounding in the nomadic Tuareg style of assouf (desert blues) made him a popular option on Niger’s wedding circuit, but the guitarist breaks from convention by always doggedly following his fingertips to some place new. A decade’s worth of refinement has led to Afrique Victime, which streamlines the hooky onslaught of Moctar’s 2019 breakout LP, Ilana: The Creator, into something more well-rounded. Bassist and producer Mikey Coltun’s sequencing affords breathers between levee-breakers, giving necessary hush to introspective ballads Bismilahi Atagah and Tala Tannam, while allowing the molten psychedelia of Taliat and Asdikte Akal to sprawl. True to the music’s Saharan origins, there’s ample space here. Sometimes Mdou’s voice is barely above a whisper before the band join him in skyward invocations. Read more. Gabriel Szatan 9 Arlo Parks – Collapsed in Sunbeams As the beginning of 2021 marked almost a full year of the pandemic, many of us were experiencing some sort of impact on our mental health. So when Arlo Parks released her debut album in January, she found herself chiming with universal concerns. Addressing issues that had been triggered or exacerbated by lives stuck inside four walls – unrequited desire, sexuality, poor body image, prejudice, betrayal and depression – Parks emerged as an empathic, comforting voice. What makes Collapsed in Sunbeams so effective is that the music is the striking inverse of her themes – light, airy, her conversational voice vulnerable and childlike. Her songs are delicately but cleverly constructed, with ear-worm choruses and generous hooks; soulful, folky tones, gentle R&amp;B and jazzy drumming; a shimmering sea of balm-like sound beneath which lurk those lyrical depth charges. Read more. Dave Simpson 8 Olivia Rodrigo – Sour Not since Britney Spears shimmied her way down a hallway dressed in school uniform has a debut single had such an immediate cultural impact: within four days of Olivia Rodrigo releasing Drivers License, the song had broken Spotify’s record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song; it would spend nine consecutive weeks at No 1 on the UK charts. Like Spears, Rodrigo also got her start with Disney, however, Rodrigo’s pathway to pop dominance wasn’t built on dance routines and Max Martin-penned bangers. Sour is an intimate, barbed, anxious and brilliantly crafted debut album about the butchery of heartbreak and the emotional hurricane that is being a teenager. Picture Rodrigo swooping in wearing a cheerleader outfit and Doc Martens while brandishing a baseball bat, her face still wet with tears. Read more. Alim Kheraj 7 Dry Cleaning – New Long Leg Dry Cleaning frontperson Florence Shaw captures a generation’s internal monologue like never before: those bitchy, distracted, utterly unmindful thoughts that a consciousness poisoned by city life and digital media is powerless to stop. Shaw doom-scrolls through her own life, yet the London band’s debut album is often breezy and full of little situation comedies; her humour given ample space by the sturdy guitar-bass-drums trio who cleave to varied strains of stoner-garage rock. Ultimately there’s a profound poetry in how her observations hang together, a reminder that something can be built from the dumb flotsam of ordinary life. Read more. BBT 6 Sault – Nine On Sault’s fifth album in two years, spoken-word interludes baldly state the reality of racism in the UK while lyrics tell impressionistic stories that teem with loss and hurt, knives and guns. Yet the music offers transcendence: tightly melodic, luxuriously layered, instantly memorable without being cheaply infectious. London Gangs nods to the Chemical Brothers, grainily retro R&amp;B, X-Ray Spex, hushed nu-folk and Auld Lang Syne. Bitter Streets is soulful 60s lounge music with a tricksy beat. The exquisite title track is pared-back psychedelic soul, proggy folk, cosmic Beatles and also none of those things. If you like the sound of Nine, apologies. Sault only made it available to stream and download for 99 days after its initial June release. Back then, the group said some of them hailed from “the heart of London’s council estates”, where the majority “get trapped in a systematic loop where a lot of resources and options are limited”. The unexplained erasure of Nine feels like a way to defy that lack of agency – proof that if Sault want to tightly control the distribution of their work, that’s their prerogative. Read more. Rachel Aroesti 5 Tyler, the Creator – Call Me If You Get Lost Call Me If You Get Lost is a decadent and luxurious showcase of Tyler’s reverence and nostalgia for music’s past – Gangsta Grillz mixtapes, lovers rock, Houston R&amp;B – channelled into his own present and future. Also central to this album’s beauty is the fact that Tyler can rap, crafting engaging tales out of deft, intentional flow. He has always been a romantic, but here he bears a softer side than ever, forced to recognise that love, so often, is about timing. “Come get lost with me,” Tyler offers on Blessed, late into an album that has already guided the listener through a bright, expansive and occasionally sentimental world, with the tracks melding into one another in true mixtape fashion. So often, we focus on beginnings and endings. Here, Tyler masterfully reminds us that life is all about the journey, growth, confusion, pain and magic in between. Read more. Tara Joshi 4 The Weather Station – Ignorance Tamara Lindeman’s fifth album as the Weather Station had a lightning-in-a-bottle quality that nothing she had released previously could quite prepare you for. At the end of 2018, she said, she was driven “insane” by reading a New Yorker article by environmentalist Bill McKibben, written as California burned during the most destructive wildfire season in history. She subsequently poured her anger and grief into the 10 songs on Ignorance. The lyrics occasionally slipped into something approaching straightforward protest songs but, for the most part, they entwine “climate grief” with what sound like words about a failing relationship to startling effect. She also shifted her musical focus, bringing in a new expansiveness and gloss – synths, disco beats, strings, sax and flute that carry a distinct hint of jazz about them. In purely melodic terms, these are Lindeman’s strongest songs to date, filled with nagging hooks and gracefully unforced-sounding tunes; the sound is smoothly, warmly appealing: you could imagine singing along to them if the lyrics didn’t keep belting you in the gut. Read more. Alexis Petridis 3 Little Simz – Sometimes I Might Be Introvert Introversion is considered synonymous with shyness, but on Sometimes I Might Be Introvert (an acronym of her nickname), Simbiatu Ajikawo demonstrates that she has no shortage of bold, cinematic vision. She makes up for a lack of travel during the pandemic by stamping her musical passport with the influences of a wide diasporic sound. Her Nigerian heritage is in fine hip-winding display on Point and Kill (featuring Obongjayar), while Protect My Energy layers motivational mantras over 80s Miami drums, balancing out the record’s heavier moments with a keen sense of play. And she is newly generous here with her vignettes of family life, driven by the desire to recalibrate her post-pandemic priorities as an aunt and sibling. On Little Q, she reconnects with a cousin on the other side of the Thames to learn more about his near-death brush with knife crime, while I Love You, I Hate You sees her attempting to find peace with a father who has disappointed her and to ensure she does not carry that fear of rejection into a new relationship. It seems to be working: I See You’s old-school R&amp;B is blissful with sleepy Sunday morning vulnerability, while How Did You Get Here is a tearjerking stocktake of the artist’s journey so far. A gospel choir frames her determination and gratitude: “I’m the version of me I always imagined when I was younger.” Read more. Jenessa Williams 2 Wolf Alice – Blue Weekend Wolf Alice singer Ellie Rowsell has called Blue Weekend her least autobiographical album: whatever the inspiration, it tells a convincingly lived-in story of embracing nihilism following the rupture of friendships and romantic relationships. “I take you back / Yeah, I know it seems surprising,” she thunders on Lipstick on the Glass. It’s here that Wolf Alice come into their own as adept musical shapeshifters, using their broad influences to explore the extremes of alienation: there are woozy fantasies, self-destructive ragers; stunning anthems of anxiety. Big, confident pop-rock albums are rare these days – and their demise hardly bemoaned – but there’s an undeniable pleasure in finding one adventurous, ambitious and human enough to remind you why they used to be so essential. Read more. LS 1 Self Esteem – Prioritise Pleasure In a pop landscape that often seems to be bottling it all up inside, Rebecca Taylor’s second solo album marked a hugely relatable uncorking of a lifetime’s worth of festering emotions, as well as her evolution into an out-and-proud pop star who dissects her emotions in pin-sharp, often darkly funny and always physically rousing testaments. The sheer heft and physicality of the album, all Yeezus beats and elastic melodies, is balanced by her ability to zoom in on the minutiae of life, paired with her economical wit. Often, Taylor is joined by a small choir of friends who reiterate and cosign her emotions: their presence anchors lead single I Do This All the Time, with its swelling coda of “I’ll take care, I’ll read again, I’ll sing again, I will” transformed into the ultimate act of defiance against those who once compelled her to diminish her desires and shrink her personality. After nearly two years of cooping up big emotions in restricted spaces, the bold, brash and beautiful Prioritise Pleasure hit like sweet relief. Read more. Michael Cragg"

          "bodyText": "The Welsh government will bring in new restrictions including closing nightclubs and imposing a 2-metre social distancing rule in offices from 27 December to try to combat the Omicron variant and has issued “strong guidance” over how to stay safe over Christmas. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the new legally enforceable regulations were needed to counter what he called the most serious development in the pandemic to date. Drakeford is strongly advising people to celebrate the festive season only with their nearest and dearest, saying a “smaller Christmas” will be a safer one. From the day after Boxing Day, Wales will introduce fresh legal restrictions, including a 2-metre social distancing rule in offices and putting extra measures in place to protect customers and staff, such as one-way systems and physical barriers. Nightclubs will also close and the government is to make up to £60m available to support businesses affected by the new restrictions. Drakeford said: “Delta will continue to be the main cause of coronavirus infections in Wales up to Christmas. But we are seeing cases of Omicron increasing rapidly every day in Wales – and across the UK. “We need a plan to keep us safe this Christmas and we need stronger measures to protect us afterwards, as we prepare for a large wave of Omicron infections. Omicron poses a new threat to our health and safety.” On Friday the first minister will use a press conference in Cardiff to spell out five steps that he wants all Welsh citizens to follow now. Get vaccinated – and if you’ve had your booster appointment, make attending your priority. If you’re going out, going Christmas shopping or visiting people, take a lateral flow test. If it’s positive – don’t go out. Meeting outdoors is better than indoors. If you’re meeting indoors make sure it’s well ventilated. Space out your socialising – if you’ve got events arranged, leave at least a day between them. Don’t forget about social distancing, wearing a face covering and washing your hands. Drakeford added: “This year a smaller Christmas is a safer Christmas. The fewer people we see, the less chance we have of catching or passing on the virus. Enjoy Christmas with your nearest and dearest – and think about meeting up with wider circles of friends when the threat posed by the Omicron variant has passed over.” The return to school for pupils in Wales will be delayed by at least two days to give teachers time to plan for a possible return to remote learning. Schools will be asked to use the time to look at whether they will need to bring in further Covid mitigation measures to deal with the Omicron surge and draw up contingency plans to make sure pupils taking exams are prioritised. Headteachers will also be allowed to operate staggered start and finish times."

          "headline": "NFL’s ‘significant changes’ to Covid-19 protocols will allow faster player return",
          "bodyText": "In moves reminiscent of the environment for the 2020 season, the NFL has updated its protocols and advocated for booster shots in reaction to an increase in Covid-19 cases around the league. As part of its protocol changes, it is requiring masks regardless of vaccination status, and remote or outdoor meetings. It also is stopping in-person meals, adding restrictions on activities outside the facility, prohibiting outside visitors during team travel, and limiting the amount of people in team weight rooms. “Finally, and based on expert advice, we will adjust the return-to-participation requirements for those who have recovered from Covid-19,” the league said in a statement. “All of these changes are grounded in our data and science-backed approach, with safety our No 1 goal for the entire NFL community.” The updated protocols will be enforced through Week 15 games, but are likely to continue or even be strengthened after that point. Dr Allen Sills, the league’s chief medical officer, said the omicron variant of the coronavirus is “in many ways (like) addressing a new disease.” Omicron is responsible for the significant uptick in positive Coviid-19 cases, according to Sills, which are emanating from within team facilities. That is the opposite of where previous positives had come from right after Thanksgiving. The league and the players’ union, advised by independent infectious disease officers, have developed a mechanism in the protocols that might lead to shorter stints on the sidelines for people testing positive. Previously, a vaccinated person – players, coaches, executives and staffers – who tests positive must then have two negative tests 24 hours apart and be asymptomatic before being cleared to return. Beginning immediately, the new protocols relax that requirement a bit, allowing for two PCR tests or two Mesa tests – or one of each – being negative. The logistics for that could speed up the return of sidelined players. “We have to think differently about this phase of the pandemic,” Sills said. “We are facing a different set of challenges and in some ways almost a different disease ... and it is going to require a different (strategy) from us.” The 32 teams also were told Thursday that they may continue current media policies that include media wearing masks at all times in a club facility. But the teams can also shift to virtual interviews for the rest of this week, something a few of them already have done. Also Thursday: • The Chicago Bears were missing all three of their coordinators because of Covid-19 protocols as they prepared for Monday night’s home game against the Minnesota Vikings. And they had seven players out because of illnesses. Bears coach Matt Nagy said offensive coordinator Bill Lazor, defensive coordinator Sean Desai and special teams coordinator Chris Tabor were participating remotely in meetings this week. Their status for the game is uncertain. Covid-19 has hit the Bears hard this week, one of many teams experiencing positive tests. Approximately 100 players across the 32 teams have tested positive. Nagy said non-Covid illness is running through the team and kept running back David Montgomery, guard James Daniels, tackle Teven Jenkins, return man Jakeem Grant, tight end Cole Kmet, tight end Jesper Horsted and running back Khalil Herbert sidelined on Thursday. Chicago put five players on the Covid-19 reserve list since Monday, and a practice squad member: tackle Larry Borom, tackle Elijah Wilkinson, nose tackle Eddie Goldman, cornerback Artie Burns, defensive tackle Mario Edwards Jr., and practice squad linebacker Sam Kamara. Nagy missed a game earlier this year against San Francisco, a 33-22 loss, because of Covid-19 issues, and Tabor coached the Bears. • Washington placed three more players on the Covid-19 list Thursday, following eight Wednesday. The team total is 21, including two players on injured reserve and two on the practice squad. Safety Sam Curl was the only starter added to the list, and was joined by centers Keith Ismael and Tyler Larsen. Curl joins fellow defensive starters in lineman Jon Allen and cornerback Kendall Fuller on the list. Washington could be down to ther fifth option at center because of coronavirus and injury problems. • Seattle might be without one of its stars, receiver Tyler Lockett, who was put on the COVID-19 list Thursday along with running back Alex Collins. The Seahawks had no players test positive in the 2020 season, but have had three this year: Tight end Gerald Everett was the other in September. Lockett has a team-high 62 receptions for 1,023 yards and six touchdowns. Last week Lockett became the second player in franchise history with three straight seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving, joining Hall of Famer Steve Largent. Lockett had five catches for 142 yards and a touchdown last week against Houston and is 35 yards short of setting a career high for a season. Collins has served as a starter for most of this season after Chris Carson was lost to a season-ending neck injury in Week 4. But Collins has played through several ailments. • Cleveland might be down to third-string quarterback Nick Mullens after Case Keenum joined Baker Mayfield in the protocols, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke anonymously because the move was not announced. Tight end David Njoku was activated from the Coviid-19 list, adding a playmaker heading into Saturday’s game against Las Vegas. On Wednesday, the virus shelved coach Kevin Stefanski and Mayfield, whose status for this week remains in question. The Browns previously had 17 players, including 10 starters, on the Covid-19 list and are placing safety Ronnie Harrison there. Starting safety James Johnson III and nickel back Troy Hill both tested positive on Wednesday and rookie cornerback Greg Newsome II has been ruled out with a concussion. • Saints coach Sean Payton returned to practice on Thursday after staying home on Wednesday, when the team said the coach was “under the weather,” but had tested negative for Covid-19. Payton had participated in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday morning without mentioning he’d be missing practice later that day. The Saints said Payton worked from home and participated in meetings via videoconference on Wednesday before returning to team headquarters on Thursday. • Miami rookie receiver Jaylen Waddle’s sensational season could be on hold. Waddle has been placed in the coronavirus protocol. The sixth overall draft pick already set a franchise record for receptions by a rookie with 86. He has 849 yards receiving and four touchdowns. The Dolphins host the Jets on Sunday."

          "headline": "Persistent Covid-related absence leaves pupils lagging – Ofsted",
          "bodyText": "Persistent absence from school caused by Covid and mental illness is hampering efforts by pupils to catch up on lost learning, according to a report by Ofsted. The schools inspectorate said its visits to 98 primary and secondary schools in England had found many were “still working on getting back to pre-pandemic attendance”. It said most of the absences were related to Covid, including cases of infections and mental health issues, and what it called “Covid-19-related anxiety” among parents and pupils. Many school leaders said mental health concerns continued to cause difficulties for some of their pupils, with some reporting increased numbers of pupils suffering from anxiety and self-harm. Inspectors were told that other Covid-related absences were the result of “low resilience to setbacks or illness”, as well as families taking rescheduled or rearranged holidays during term-time. Covid-related absences were said to be higher among disadvantaged pupils and pupils with special educational needs or disabilities, as well as older students. The report found gaps in literacy and maths were commonplace, although how big they were varied. “How much pupils had learned, and how secure they were in this knowledge, depended on whether they were in school during lockdowns, how much they had engaged with remote learning and how independently they could work at home,” the report said. Ofsted also found that teacher absences related to Covid were having a profound effect on how schools function, with improvement plans and staff training being slowed down or postponed. Headteachers said they had to operate with “multiple members of staff” off at the same time. Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s chief inspector, said: “The pandemic is still with us, and children’s education is still being disrupted. But it’s clear that many school leaders and staff have responded to these challenges with tenacity, and demonstrated creativity in how they have supported children and learners’ education and personal development. “Children have missed out so much already. And some pupils remain persistently absent from school for a variety of reasons. So, as we face further turbulence, we must do all we can to make sure children are able to continue learning in their classrooms.” Pupils starting at both primary and secondary schools appear to have been the most disrupted, with inspectors hearing that children had arrived “with lower starting points” than in previous years and were taking longer to settle in. In reception year, children who had missed out on nursery were struggling more with peer interactions, behaviour and attitudes to learning. “Some teachers said that the impact of the pandemic on reception pupils was bigger than they had expected,” the inspectors noted. The report did have at least two bright spots. Headteachers said some pupils who had previously withdrawn from their school in favour of home schooling had changed their minds and returned. And some staff said pupil behaviour had improved compared with before the pandemic. Pupils were happy to be back in school and showing a positive attitude to learning, they said."

          "headline": "Omicron leads many UK schools to close early for Christmas",
          "bodyText": "Scores of schools and colleges are closing early for Christmas, in defiance of No 10, while others are preparing for further disruption and possible closures next year as the Omicron variant sweeps the UK. The Welsh government has announced that its schools will delay the start of the new term by two days “to ensure they have robust plans in place to move to remote learning if required”, while school leaders in England are preparing for an extended switch to online learning in January, with many ensuring that pupils take laptops and textbooks home for the holidays. The Guardian has learned of primary and secondary schools in England and Wales that have decided to end term early because of staff shortages caused by illness and Covid-related isolation. While some schools have already closed on schedule, for most pupils the official end of term is on Friday, with schools in a few local authorities continuing until next Tuesday. Parents at Mersey Drive community primary school in Bury were told by the school: “We have reached the point where we are unable to maintain safe staffing levels. After consultation with the local authority we have reluctantly had to make the decision to close early for Christmas in order to keep everyone safe.” Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary for England, told headteachers he was planning to encourage former teachers to help fill the gaps left by staff shortages. In a letter to heads, Zahawi said: “We will work with sector leaders and supply agencies over the coming days to offer advice to ex-teachers who want to provide support to schools and colleges.” Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said Zahawi’s move was “very unlikely to be enough to solve a problem at such a scale as this”. In other cases, schools and colleges have been advised by local health officials to close or switch to online learning, including Rochdale’s sixth-form college and Falinge Park high school. Parents of students at the Rochdale college were told it needed to close because the “A-level timetable and the high population density” made it impossible to identify close contacts of a confirmed Omicron case. The BBC reported that schools in at least 30 local authorities in England had moved teaching online during the last week of term. That has come despite a clear message from No 10 that schools should remain open. Asked on Monday whether schools might close early for Christmas, a spokesperson for No 10 said: “Certainly we do not think anyone should be closing schools early, unless they have received advice from the local director of public health that it’s necessary on public health grounds.” Stephen Morgan, the shadow schools minister, said: “Children have been in and out of school facing ongoing disruption to education and wellbeing again this term. This cannot continue. The government has continuously failed to plan ahead, but must act now and use the Christmas holidays to prevent the chaos seen last January.” Local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland are making preparations in case of school closures next month, or delaying reopening to allow for testing. A spokesperson for Southampton city council said some schools there were “postponing their return date by one to two days to ensure a thorough testing programme is in place to enable them to welcome students back safely … The situation is under constant review, and we are on standby to support schools in implementing any new guidance.” Other areas are preparing to take further measures such as reintroducing “bubbles” of students to minimise the spread of infection, and reintroducing social distancing measures such as staggered starts and restricted use of school facilities. Jeremy Miles, Wales’s minister for education, said all schools should plan for measures based on the Welsh government’s “very high risk level” of infection control, and was giving authority for schools to operate staggered start and finish times. “I am providing all schools with two planning days at the start of the spring term. This will allow time for schools to assess staffing capacity and put the necessary measures in place to support the return of all learners,” Miles said. Schools in Guernsey are closing early, the island’s government has announced, before the scheduled end of term on Wednesday."

          "bodyText": "This live blog is now closing. For further updates on the coronavirus situation in the UK and around the world, please follow the global coronavirus live blog. This is an interesting point to bear in mind, given the record-breaking numbers of infections the UK has seen in the last two days. Prof Susan Michie, of Sage and Independent Sage, points out that the true number of cases is likely considerably higher as many people are taking lateral flow tests as opposed to PCRs. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will be returning early from his trip to California to hold more talks with business chiefs in response to the Omicron crisis on Friday. Sunak and his team held talks with a range of hospitality and business organisations on Thursday. Sunak said: We understand that this is a concerning time for businesses. Myself and my wider team met with business representatives earlier today, listened to their concerns and will continue to work with industry leaders over the coming days. To keep safeguarding our economic recovery and the lives and livelihoods of the British people our priority is now to make sure everyone has the opportunity to get boosted now. Here is a quick recap of some of the main developments from today so far: Boris Johnson joined No 10 staff for a party in Downing Street during the first lockdown in May last year, sources have alleged, raising questions about whether there was a culture of flouting the rules over a number of months. The prime minister spent about 15 minutes with staff at the alleged social gathering on 15 May 2020, telling one aide inside No 10 that they deserved a drink for “beating back” coronavirus, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Independent was told. Sources claimed about 20 staff drank wine and spirits and ate pizza following a press conference on that day, some in offices inside No 10 and others going into the garden. Some staff stayed drinking until late into the evening, they alleged. Rules at the time allowed only two people from different households to meet outside, at a distance of 2 metres. Story here. The UK registered a record-breaking number of daily Covid cases for the second day in a row. Another 88,376 infections and 146 deaths were reported. The R value for Omicron is between 3 and 5 in the UK, and the variant is spreading rapidly - doubling in size every two days - according to the UKHSA. Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to “stay at home” as she warned that the new Omicron variant is “currently running faster than even the fastest rollout of vaccines”, and likely to be the dominant variant across Scotland by Friday. In a strongly worded statement ahead of first minister’s questions on Thursday, Scotland’s first minister told MSPs: “If we don’t act now, what we have feared all along but so far avoided, the overwhelming of the NHS, could happen.” Appealing directly to the public, she went on: “Please reduce your contact with people from households other than your own as much as you possibly can. Please stay at home much more than you normally would and as much as is feasible.” Story here. The rising wave of Omicron infections could lead to daily hospitalisations from Covid exceeding the peak of last winter when more than 4,500 people in the UK were admitted on a single day, England’s chief medical officer said. The staggering speed at which Omicron is spreading means large numbers of vulnerable people may need hospital care over a very short space of time, Prof Chris Whitty told MPs on Thursday, with daily admissions potentially peaking above that seen last winter at the start of the vaccine programme. Story here. The JCVI made pregnant women a priority group for vaccination following research showing that they are vulnerable to more serious illness and pregnancy complications if they are infected with Covid-19. Pregnant women would be moved into priority group 6, alongside adults under the age of 65 years who have long-term health conditions and urged pregnant women to get booster and primary doses as soon as possible. The decision was underpinned by research from the University of Oxford, showing that pregnant women and their babies were at particular risk if they became infected. The research found that 17 pregnant women died during the Delta wave of the pandemic – a 50% increase in maternal mortality compared with usual. It also found that of 1,436 pregnant women admitted to hospital during the Delta wave, 33% required respiratory support, around 2% had a stillbirth, 2% had pregnancy loss and around one in five had a pre-term birth. Story here. The Queen cancelled her traditional pre-Christmas family party for the second year running, agreeing that it would be irresponsible to go ahead, with a source suggesting the party could put too many people’s Christmas arrangements at risk. Story here. Scores of schools and colleges across the UK are closing early for Christmas, in defiance of No 10, while others are preparing for further disruption and possible closures next year due to Omicron. Story here. Boris Johnson denied imposing ‘lockdown by stealth’ and resisted calls for extra business support. After medical advisers told people on Wednesday to deprioritise unnecessary social contact ahead of Christmas, Johnson tried to play down any suggestion rules were being imposed, and instead said it was up to people to decide how much risk they wanted to take they may end up catching Covid and forced to isolate over Christmas. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has held several meetings with business and hospitality chiefs today amid concerns over the impact of Covid messaging. Polyvalent vaccines to cope with a wide range of Covid variants could be ready within 18 months as well as new antiviral drugs which should do the “heavy lifting” for the NHS, Prof Chris Whitty said. But in the meantime, each six months will be better than the last, he added. Boris Johnson joined No 10 staff for a party in Downing Street during the first lockdown in May last year, sources have alleged, raising questions about whether there was a culture of flouting the rules over a number of months. The prime minister spent about 15 minutes with staff at the alleged social gathering on 15 May 2020, telling one aide inside No 10 that they deserved a drink for “beating back” coronavirus, a joint investigation by the Guardian and Independent was told. Sources claimed about 20 staff drank wine and spirits and ate pizza following a press conference on that day, some in offices inside No 10 and others going into the garden. Some staff stayed drinking until late into the evening, they alleged. Rules at the time allowed only two people from different households to meet outside, at a distance of 2 metres. Earlier that evening, Matt Hancock, then health secretary, had urged people to “stay at home as much as is possible” and asked them to “please stick with the rules, keep an eye on your family and don’t take risks” during the period of good weather. The claims follow a string of reports about similar alleged events in Downing Street and elsewhere during the subsequent lockdown last Christmas, and suggests rules might have been broken over a series of months. Read the full story from Peter Walker and Rowena Mason here: Boris Johnson joined No 10 party during May 2020 lockdown, say sources The UK has registered another 88,376 Covid cases and 146 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the government’s coronavirus dashboard. That compares to a previous record high of 78,610 infections reported, as well as 165 fatalities, in the 24 hours prior. A total of 315,001 people tested positive for Covid in England at least once in the week to 8 December, up 8.7% on the previous week, according to the latest Test and Trace figures. This is the highest number to test positive since the week to 13 January. Here is Heather Stewart’s story about Downing Street slapping down a Conservative MP who warned against the UK becoming a “public health socialist state”, after Prof Chris Whitty suggested people cut down on pre-Christmas socialising. Covid case rates for London and eastern England have risen to their highest level since early January, new figures show. A total of 702.8 new cases per 100,000 people were recorded in London in the week to 12 December. This is up sharply from 475.8 the previous week and is the highest rate for the capital since the week to 10 January. The rise has been driven by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, with some boroughs in London currently experiencing the steepest increase in rates of any local authorities in the UK. Omicron has already become the dominant variant of the virus in the capital, but is now having an impact in other parts of the country. Eastern England’s rate stands at 616.5 cases per 100,000, up week-on-week from 563.2 and the highest since the week to 10 January. North-west England has recorded a small week-on-week rise, up from 412.2 to 430.0. All other regions have recorded a slight fall, however. The figures, from the UK Health Security Agency, show rates are currently highest among five to nine-year-olds, at 1,021.4 cases per 100,000 - down slightly week-on-week from 1,086.3. Rates have also dropped among 10 to 19-year-olds, from 922.6 to 846.7. But they have risen sharply for 20 to 29-year-olds, up from 390.2 to 625.9, and for 30 to 39-year-olds, from 595.3 to 734.5. For people aged 80 and over the rate continues to be low, at 69.5, broadly unchanged from 69.3. The rate of Covid-19 hospital admissions in England stood at 7.1 per 100,000 people in the week to 12 December, up from 6.7 the previous week. Admission rates continue to be highest among people aged 85 and over, at 33.9 per 100,000 - down slightly from 35.5. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary for England, has responded to calls to tackle the school staffing crisis by asking former teachers to sign up with supply agencies. In recent weeks school leaders have complained of difficulties finding cover for absent or sick teachers, with supply teachers hard to find because many themselves have been hit by Covid or are working for the government’s national tutoring programme. In an end-of-term letter to head teachers, Zahawi confirmed that the Department for Education was “looking at what steps and measures we can put in place to boost supply capacity”. He continued: We will work with sector leaders and supply agencies over the coming days to offer advice to ex-teachers who want to provide support to schools and colleges. We will help them to register with supply agencies as the best way to boost the temporary workforce available to the sector. Senior DfE officials have already begun to discuss this with key stakeholders. From now, you can support this effort by using your own professional and personal networks to encourage others to sign up to offer temporary help. Labour was quick to deride Zahawi’s downbeat announcement as “a sticking plaster” over a much larger problem. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he welcomed anything that might help overcome the staff shortages, but added: This is all coming very late in the day for a situation which is already critical and has been so for some time, and the initiative will need to be well publicised, promoted and supported in order to have any degree of success. It is also important to emphasise that even then it is very unlikely to be enough to solve a problem at such a scale as this. Unions are calling for immediate support for workers in the hospitality and entertainment industries amid warnings of a jobs “crisis”, PA Media reports. The Omicron variant has caused a growing number of theatres and live events to cancel performances, alongside reports of a downturn in bookings, with pubs and restaurants facing similar problems. Sharon Graham, leader of the Unite union, said: The government must bring forward a package of support for hospitality workers today. The uncertainty the prime minister is causing is devastating - workers don’t know if they will even have a job to go to next week. This is an appalling position to put people in. Hospitality workers did not cause this crisis and they should not be the ones who pay for it. They still have rent to find and bills to pay but are seeing their incomes disappear before their eyes. They need help now. Bectu, the theatre workers union, has written to the chancellor, urging him to provide urgent support for the industry to prevent a “jobs crisis”. Head of Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: We now face a New Year theatre crisis with a lack of leadership from government, a rising wave of Omicron cases and an anxious public. This started as a public health crisis but it could quickly become a jobs crisis as well. With the recent tightening of Covid restrictions, there has been little commentary on the significant impact these will have on self-employed workers working in theatres and live events. Bectu is concerned that self-employed workers again appear to be at the back of the queue when it comes to planning for any further financial disruption to our everyday lives. We need to give business stability and the support for the creative industries to be open and trading safely, but we must also contemplate what happens if the government imposes restrictions that actually or effectively closes them. Transport Salaried Staffs Association general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said: The government must bring back furlough to protect jobs at Eurostar and elsewhere as we suffer the effects of Omicron. Measures to tackle the virus, such as travel restrictions, must come with financial support for businesses, including our travel trade, to prevent thousands of job losses. Eurostar has already suffered from plummeting passenger numbers since the start of the pandemic, but as our only green link to Europe it must be a strategic priority for government to sustain the route. The government has refused to provide anything other than furlough support since the beginning of the pandemic. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: Eurostar has taken an absolute hammering financially since the pandemic hit. We are calling on the government to recognise the importance of Eurostar to the future of UK transport infrastructure and to meet in tripartite talks with ministers, the company and the unions to ensure a safety net is in place to prevent any risk of the operation tipping over. With the loss of revenues over Christmas and into the New Year, the situation at Eurostar is deadly serious and the government cannot be allowed to just wash their hands and walk away. Nicola Sturgeon has urged Scots to “stay at home” as she warned that the new Omicron variant is “currently running faster than even the fastest rollout of vaccines”, and likely to be the dominant variant across Scotland by Friday. In a strongly worded statement ahead of first minister’s questions on Thursday, Scotland’s first minister told MSPs: If we don’t act now, what we have feared all along but so far avoided, the overwhelming of the NHS, could happen. Appealing directly to the public, she went on: Please reduce your contact with people from households other than your own as much as you possibly can. Please stay at home much more than you normally would and as much as is feasible. Here is the full report: Nicola Sturgeon urges Scots to ‘stay at home’ to curb Omicron Thousands of hospitality firms across the UK could go bust by January because of a “fear campaign” and a lack of financial support following the surge in the Omicron variant, the boss of a leading pub chain has warned. Young’s chief executive, Patrick Dardis, said a surge in cancellations for Christmas bookings would be dire for the hospitality sector, which relies heavily on the holiday season for its earnings. He said the mixed messaging from government about risks and restrictions was leaving patrons “terribly confused” about whether to keep their bookings at a time when restaurants and pubs were already “hanging on by their fingernails”. While the prime minister, Boris Johnson, struck an upbeat note about the rollout of the booster programme, England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, sent a clear message on Wednesday that people should cut back on socialising in the runup to Christmas, despite a lack of formal restrictions on group gatherings. “Unfortunately, with the latest fear campaign that’s being run, it’s damaging so many businesses that could have possibly survived, and as a consequence, thousands and thousands of businesses will now collapse in January”, Dardis told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “There are a lot of individual owner-operators who’ve been running their businesses for years and have thrown the kitchen sink – people have lost their marriages, they’re losing their livelihoods, and this is the last straw. This is the bit that they were desperately clinging on to and it’s been taken away from them without any support from government,” he added. More on this story here: Thousands may go bust amid UK Omicron ‘fear campaign’, says pubs boss The Bank of England has unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic despite growing concern over the Omicron variant. Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of eight to one to raise rates from the historic low of 0.1% to 0.25%, judging that pressure from surging inflation outweighed the risks to the economy from the new variant. Official figures showed inflation hit 5.1% in November amid soaring energy prices and global supply-chain bottlenecks, hitting a rate the Bank had not expected to be reached until spring. The MPC has an official inflation target of 2%. However, the rate rise comes amid a severe deterioration in the economic outlook with Omicron triggering a collapse in consumer confidence, leading to a wave of cancellations for hospitality businesses during the key festive trading period. Here is the full story: Bank of England raises interest rates to 0.25% And my colleague Graeme Wearden has live updates over on the business blog: The rising wave of Omicron infections could lead to daily hospitalisations from Covid exceeding the peak of last winter when more than 4,500 people in the UK were admitted on a single day, England’s chief medical officer has said. The staggering speed at which Omicron is spreading means large numbers of vulnerable people may need hospital care over a very short space of time, Prof Chris Whitty told MPs on Thursday, with daily admissions potentially peaking above that seen last winter at the start of the vaccine programme. The highest number of Covid hospitalisations in a day in the UK was 4,583 on 12 January, when the Alpha variant – first spotted in Kent – was dominant. Omicron is now the dominant variant in London and is expected to become the most common in England within days or weeks. “Even if it is milder, because it is concentrated over a short period of time you could end up with a higher number than that going into hospital on a single day. That is entirely possible,” Whitty told the health and social care committee. “The whole point about this is it’s going to be really concentrated in a very short period of time, very possibly.” More on this story here: Omicron could lead to record daily Covid hospitalisations, MPs told Pregnant women have been made a priority group for vaccination following research showing that they are vulnerable to more serious illness and pregnancy complications if they are infected with Covid-19. The vaccines watchdog, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), announced on Thursday that pregnant women would be moved into priority group 6, alongside adults under the age of 65 years who have long term health conditions and urged pregnant women to get booster and primary doses as soon as possible. However, maternal health experts, who have repeatedly called for pregnant women to be prioritised, questioned whether the move would make a material difference to the ability of pregnant women to access vaccines. The JCVI’s decision was underpinned by research from the University of Oxford, showing that pregnant women and their babies were at particular risk if they became infected. The research found that 17 pregnant women died during the Delta wave of the pandemic – a 50% increase in maternal mortality compared with usual. It also found that of 1436 pregnant women admitted to hospital during the Delta wave, 33% required respiratory support, around 2% had a stillbirth, 2% had pregnancy loss and around one in five had a preterm birth. Pregnant women are less likely than the general population to have been vaccinated. In August, when pregnant women had to wait until their age group became eligible, only 22% of women who gave birth in England had received a single dose, and 25% in Scotland and 18% in Wales. The proportion has increased since then, but are still disproportionately less likely to be vaccinated, with the lowest rates seen in those from black and ethnic minority groups. Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of JCVI Covid-19 immunisation, said: There is no evidence to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines used in pregnancy increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirths, congenital abnormalities or birth complications. Having a UK approved Covid-19 vaccine is safer than having Covid-19 itself. Women who are pregnant are strongly encouraged to have a first, second or booster vaccine dose as appropriate in order to better protect yourself and your baby from any serious consequences from Covid-19. Gayatri Amirthalingam, from the UK Health Security Agency, said: We know that the vaccines used in the UK Covid-19 vaccination programme have been highly effective in preventing serious complications and those recommended for pregnant women have a good safety record. I would urge all pregnant women to come forward and get their vaccine without delay. This is the best way to protect you and your baby. Here is my colleague Amelia Hill’s story on what is understood to have been a precautionary decision taken by the Queen to cancel her pre-Christmas family lunch at Windsor. She was expected to host 50 or so members of her extended family, including Prince Charles and Camilla. But on Thursday, the Queen agreed that it would be irresponsible to go ahead, with a source suggesting the party could put too many people’s Christmas arrangements at risk. Here is a summary of some of the main points from this afternoon’s lobby briefing with No 10: Downing Street denied the government was sending out mixed messages on social contacts following the emergence of the Omicron variant. On Wednesday, the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to cut back on social contacts to help curb the spread of the disease whereas Boris Johnson had previously said people did not need to cancel Christmas parties. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: Both the prime minister and the CMO were making the point that given the current infection rate, the prevalence of this variant, people should be cautious and think carefully before mixing with others. The prime minister was clear that this is a personal choice and people should do what is right for them. Family visits over Christmas will be down to “individual circumstances and judgment”, No 10 said. The spokesman said: I think the public recognise that those deemed to be clinically extremely vulnerable are most at risk and they would want to do everything possible, using the guidance we’ve put out available and the mitigation such as testing and vaccinations, to protect their loved ones at a time of high prevalence. But it will be down to individuals to decide what is right for them. No 10 said the government was not seeking to cancel things on the public’s behalf. The spokesman said: Hospitality remains open, businesses remain open to trade. We recognise that the prevalence of this variant and the high transmissibility is leading to further challenges for the hospitality sector in particular, and that’s why we want to hear their concerns and that’s something the chancellor and chief secretary will be doing today. The government is not telling football fans not to go to matches, Downing Street has said. Following comments from the medical director for primary care at NHS England, Dr Nikki Kanani, that if anyone was visiting a football stadium this weekend it should be to get a jab at a pop-up clinic, the spokesman said there was “no guidance or restrictions in place”. He said: Like Professor Whitty and the prime minister, she’s not being prescriptive. We understand it’s a personal choice for the public. And there’s no restrictions on those sorts of events, obviously, apart from the use of the Covid pass which provides a level of reassurance and protection. Asked whether the government was telling fans not to attend matches, the spokesman said: “That is not our advice.” Downing Street said the capacity for posting out lateral flow tests was increasing. The spokesman said 649,000 orders for tests were received on Wednesday. But he said reports that distribution could be restricted to one pharmacy per town was not something he recognised. No 10 insisted there were enough PCR tests available for those who needed them. The spokesman said: There is sufficient PCR capacity for those with symptoms, 150,910 PCR test kits were dispatched yesterday, over half a million processed the day before on Tuesday. I believe our PCR testing capability is among the highest in the world and we are indeed going further, increasing booking slots at physical test sites by more than 100,000 and we’ve secured an increase in PCR testing capacity of a further 200,000 a day and are going beyond that procuring additional lab capacity. He said turnaround times of PCR test results were also improving. Given the massive upsurge in testing, which is to be welcomed, we know that will be a challenge for our laboratories. And I think the public will understand that, but we are further ramping up capacity to help mitigate that and we urge everyone to come and get a PCR test as required, as needed, because we do have sufficient capacity. No 10 was asked why the government was not putting out stronger messaging to protect the NHS, amid fears of staff shortages. The spokesman said: I think we are taking steps to that end through the introduction of plan B and massively increasing our booster programme. As we said when we announced we were bringing forward the target, this is because we know that without this sort of action the pressure on the NHS can become unsustainable. Obviously, the NHS has well-established measures in place to cope with staff sickness and absence, including via the use of staff banks, digital staff passports - which allow them to move between hospitals more easily - and we already have existing prevention and control measures in place and PPE for example. We will continue to make sure our NHS has what it needs in the coming weeks and months. Downing Street signalled there were no plans to ban French travellers from the UK after restrictions were imposed by Paris. The spokesman said the UK had been made aware of the announcement in advance, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, had spoken to his French counterpart. When asked if there were any plans for measures at UK borders, the spokesman said: I mean we think, given the rising Omicron cases around the world, a red list and sort of tighter border measures wouldn’t be effective or proportionate in slowing the import of Omicron from abroad. Downing Street dismissed a claim by Tory MP Joy Morrissey that Prof Chris Whitty is acting as if Britain is a “public health socialist state”. [see 9.57am.]. Asked if Boris Johnson agreed with her comment, the spokesman said: No. Professor Whitty is a hugely respected and trusted public servant who provides independent, evidence-based advice. I think he himself has been clear that he provides advice and it is right for ministers and elected politicians to decide. He has been a hugely trusted and valued part of our pandemic response and continues to be so. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak’s visit to California was a “long-planned trip”. The spokesman was asked why the chancellor’s trip was not on the list of government engagements for the week, and he said: I don’t know, I’d have to refer to [the] Treasury on that for when it was finalised, but I believe my understanding is a long-planned, long-standing trip. A Treasury spokesperson said: “The chancellor is in the US on a long-planned trip conducting government business. He is in constant contact with staff back home and will be speaking to UK hospitality businesses today to hear their concerns.” Downing Street said it was likely the prime minister’s audiences with the Queen would move to being virtual. Asked whether Boris Johnson would continue to meet the Queen in person, the spokesman said: That will be a matter for the royal family. I’m not aware of them not being... I think they will probably be moved virtually but that’ll be a matter for the palace. Scores of schools and colleges across the UK are closing early for Christmas, in defiance of No 10, while others are preparing for further disruption and possible closures next year as the Omicron variant sweeps the UK. The Welsh government has announced that its schools will delay the start of the new term by two days “to ensure they have robust plans in place to move to remote learning if required”, while school leaders in England are preparing for an extended switch to online learning in January, with many ensuring that pupils take laptops and textbooks home for the holidays. The Guardian has learned of primary and secondary schools in England and Wales that have decided to end term early because of staff shortages caused by illness and Covid-related isolation. While some schools have already closed on schedule, for most pupils the official end of term is on Friday, with schools in a few local authorities continuing until next Tuesday. The full story is here: Omicron leads many UK schools to close early for Christmas Away from Covid for a moment, Boris and Carrie Johnson, have named their baby daughter Romy. Speaking at a vaccination centre in Kent, the prime minister revealed the name. And posting on Instagram, Carrie announced the pair’s second child’s full name as Romy Iris Charlotte Johnson. She said Romy was picked after her aunt Rosemary, Iris for the Greek word for rainbow, and Charlotte after the prime minister’s late mother. The couple announced the birth of a healthy baby girl at a London hospital on 9 December. Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Scottish public and the UK government “we do not have time to waste”, as she confirmed it is likely that Omicron will be the dominant variant across Scotland by tomorrow. Sturgeon has said in a statement before first minister’s questions that “Omicron is currently running faster than even the fastest roll out of vaccines,” telling the public that if they don’t take action to slow down the spread the “consequences will be significant”. She told MSPs she wanted to “strongly underline” her advice to reduce contact with other households, and to stay at home where possible in advance of Christmas Day meetings, adding that there was “no evidence” that Omicron was milder than other variants. The first minister also called on the UK government to “act urgently”, saying she had asked to speak to Boris Johnson directly this afternoon about urgent financial support as she said “we must not sleep walk into an emergency for both health and business”. She said: We don’t have time to waste on vaccination, but we don’t have time to waste and putting in place the protective measures that will help slow this down. Lives again are at risk here, livelihoods are at risk and the NHS is at risk. Yes, the government’s got to speed up vaccination but all of us have to come together to do what is required to slow this down. And the UK government has to step up and provide the financial support that businesses need. Sturgeon said that the announcement of advance funding released by the Treasury for devolved administrations earlier this week was “not enough”. The return to school for pupils in Wales will be delayed by at least two days to give teachers time to plan for the possibility of a move back to remote learning. Schools will be asked to use the time to look at whether they will need to bring in further Covid mitigation measures to deal with the Omicron surge and contingency plans to make sure pupils taking exams are prioritised. Heads will also be allowed to operate staggered start and finish times. The health minister, Jeremy Miles, said: I am providing all schools with two planning days at the start of the spring term. This will allow time for schools to assess staffing capacity and put the necessary measures in place to support the return of all learners. Schools will be asked to make use of the planning days to ensure they have robust plans in place to move to remote learning if required – this could be for individual classes/year groups or possibly for the whole school. Schools will be asked also to use this opportunity to revisit contingency plans, ensuring exam years are prioritised for onsite provision should there be a need to restrict in-person learning at any time and consider what arrangements might need to be in place for vulnerable learners and the children of critical workers during any periods of disruption. Greg Clark asks whether we are now in a phase of giving broad advice rather than imposing restrictions, and if this is the right way to be thinking about Covid now. Whitty says it’s where we are now, but if we were in a situation where, for example, it looked as if the boosters were not going to be as effective against the disease and transmission, then ministers would clearly need to consider what else needs to be done. The further you go up the ladder of intervention the more damage you’re going to do in other areas, he says, so it needs to be balanced. Clark also asks what would trigger a scenario where we can de-escalate the advice being given. Whitty says there are multiple exit points and they depend on what happens next. It could be that with vaccinations and boosters and a milder variant, we could de-escalate quite quickly, he says. An alternative scenario could be a very sharp wave that decreases quite quickly. Another exit, albeit a longer one, would be an Omicron-specific vaccine, he says. However, again he says, there are so many unknowns at the moment. Back to the committee, on the link between case numbers and hospitalisations, Whitty says medics don’t yet know how many Omicron hospitalisations there will be. But we can say the new variant is not more dangerous than Delta, he says. In comparison to the last big wave, the hospitalisation rate prior to the vaccination programme was 22% with Delta, he says. After two doses of the Covid vaccine, that dropped to just 6%, he says. There isn’t evidence that Omicron is intrinsically milder, he says, and it is very critical to wait for more data before predicting what will happen. He says medics are taking the new variant extremely seriously as the NHS will be impacted by a shortage of staff as more people isolate with Covid. Whitty is asked how we deal with the 5-10% of the population who are unvaccinated. He says although those who aren’t vaccinated are very noisy the numbers are also small. He says that due to weird conspiracy theories and all sorts there are people who won’t get vaccinated. Unless these people work in places with lots of vulnerable people, the view is fine, he says, and this has to be accepted. However, he says of the percentage of unvaccinated people, some simply haven’t got round to getting their jabs, rather than being anti-vaxx. There are four things people want to know, Whitty says: The disease is a big enough threat The vaccines actually work The side effects are proportionate to the benefits the vaccines are giving them It is convenient to get vaccinated We have to make sure people’s fears are politely and scientifically addressed, and making it as convenient for people as possible, he says. Whitty is asked how the combination of restrictions is decided. He says the first layer in deciding measures is looking at things that have no downsides to the British public, such as wearing face masks, washing hands and opening windows. Do all of them because they protect you from different elements of risk, he says. Then he says ministers decide whether to enforce things that have more impact - socially and economically - such as advising working from home. And then you go up a ladder of intervention, and each step further makes more of an impact, he says. Hopkins says that for Omicron, the R value is between 3 and 5 in the UK, and that the variant is spreading rapidly - doubling in size every two days. The current R value of the Delta epidemic in the UK is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.2. Back at the committee, Whitty says he strongly believes that we should be maximising the number of vaccines in lower to middle-income countries. It’s a humanitarian need and is a matter of self-interest as well, he says, adding there is absolutely nothing to be lost and everything to be gained. He says in Africa and resource-poor parts of Asia, there are good vaccination systems for vaccinating children under five, but there is not a good system in place for vaccinating older adults who need it more. It’s not just a product problem, it’s a system problem, he says. After last night’s astonishing press conference where medical advisers told people to deprioritise unnecessary social contact, Boris Johnson has this morning insisted he is not instituting an “effective lockdown” - as several Tory MPs claim. Backbenchers have been claiming that businesses will be hard hit by the change in message, with Steve Brine, a former health minister, claiming that “at a stroke, the chief medical officer changed government policy. But Johnson tried to play down any suggestion rules were being imposed, and instead said it was up to people to decide how much risk they wanted to take they may end up catching Covid and forced to isolate over Christmas. Speaking on a visit to a vaccine centre in Kent, the prime minister said: If you want to go to an event or a party, then the sensible thing to do, if that’s a priority... is to get a test and to make sure that you’re being cautious. But we’re not saying that we want to cancel stuff, we’re not locking stuff down, and the fastest route back to normality is to get boosted. Following concerns that hospitality firms have already been hit by a wave of cancellations and shops are seeing footfall sink during a crucial trading period, Johnson did not hint at any more support but said the government had “kept business going” through the pandemic. Johnson added he would do “whatever I have to to protect the public” and insisted “we’re in a very different position” from last year, when tough restrictions were imposed just days before Christmas. His message to the public was: There’s a lot of Omicron around, be careful, exercise caution if you want to avoid isolation, getting unwell, over Christmas. Implement Plan B but get boosted now is the fastest route back to normality because the booster does give you an excellent level of protection. The committee hears that in August, only 22.2% of pregnant women were vaccinated and that high numbers of critically ill patients were unvaccinated pregnant women. Whitty is asked if it was a mistake to not include pregnant women in priority groups sooner. Whitty says the uptake of vaccination in pregnant women is depressingly low and that significant numbers of women have come to serious harm. Pregnancy is a period of vulnerability, he says, adding I think we really should have made that point even clearer earlier on. We need to take on the myths around the vaccine and pregnancy and say it is not true that there are increased risks with this vaccine, Whitty says. We need to say that what is true is that Covid and pregnancy is a dangerous combination, he says, encouraging everybody who is pregnant to get vaccinated. Back to the committee. Whitty says data from South Africa and the UK suggest it’s too early to be sure but for now we can stick to the view that Omicron is much milder in children than in older adults. PA reports that the Queen has cancelled her traditional pre-Christmas family lunch next week. It is understood the decision was a precaution with a source suggesting it could put too many people’s Christmas arrangements at risk if it went ahead. And this is from the Sunday Times’s royal editor, Roya Nikkah Whitty says scientists and the government are trying to navigate how to keep people from spending Christmas alone while curbing the spread of Omicron. On staff shortages in social care affecting the Covid crisis, Whitty says there is a serious issue with recruitment in social care, which is longstanding over many years. He says there have been several attempts to look seriously at what can be done to improve the situation, but that he isn’t the right person to answer how it can be done. Whitty is asked about how mistakes made earlier in the pandemic can be avoided this time around. He says there were several mistakes made, including not being fast enough on cutting down on people working between care settings, and not spotting the effects of people not having adequate sick pay quickly enough. Those mistakes haven’t been repeated this time round, he says. The most difficult decision with Omicron is balancing the needs of family being able to see those in care, with reducing the risk of spread over Christmas. We’re trying to navigate a route between those two, he says. Lucy Allan asks if we will have to live with reduced social contact and “deprioritisation” for years to come in the event of more variants of concern. Whitty anticipates that in about 18 months we will have polyvalent vaccines which will cover a much wider range and several antivirals and a variety of other countermeasures that mean the great majority of the heavy lifting with a new variant can be met by medical means, unless it’s extremely different, he says. I don’t see this as we’re going to have to do this repeatedly every few months situation, he says, adding we’re in a transition. The response to this variant is very different to how we would have responded in a pre-vaccine era, he adds, and he thinks the risks will gradually decrease over time. Each six months will be better than the last six months, he says. Hunt asks if Whitty has advised the government to do more to reduce the spread of Omicron, that is another lockdown. Whitty says the only formal advice is what comes from Sage. To make tough social and economic decisions, there is a lot of information we don’t yet have, he says, and there is a wide range of possibilities where this will go. Ministers will take constant reviews of restrictions if vaccines prove less effective than expected, he says. Because of the steepness of this, a lot of people will simultaneously fall ill across the whole economy, which we will need to take quite seriously, he says. Whitty says he is extremely cautious about hospitalisation projections. We don’t yet know the level Omicron will peak at, nor do we know the effects, in terms of hospitalisation, of two doses of vaccine, or prior infection, and of a booster dose, he says. Hunt asks about the previous peak in hospital admissions of 4,583. Whitty says that even if Omicron is milder, because it is concentrated over a short period of time, you could end up with a higher number than that going into hospital on a single day. However, two caveats are how long people stay in hospital and that being vaccinated will provide some protection, he says. The doubling rate will slow down as people continue to take more precautions, including prioritising social interactions that matter most to them and working from home, Whitty says. This will buy us time to get boosting and slow it down, he adds. He estimates that Omicron will peak incredibly fast and it could come down faster than previous peaks, he says. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at the UK Health and Security Agency, says there are 15 patients in hospital with Omicron. Whitty adds there are many more than that - that number is only those who are proven. Updated figures will come out this afternoon. She adds that data on the severity of Omicron won’t be known for another fortnight. At least 250 patients would need to be admitted to hospital before there could be a statistical analysis of the disease, she says. That is likely to be between Christmas and New Year or early January, she adds. Moving onto Omicron, Hunt asks if current data on the extent to which a third dose of vaccine is more effective than two relates to antibody and/or T cell deterioration. Whitty says that on the lab side, they are looking at the antibody data, which suggests the antibody response is much less effective against Omicron than it was against Delta, Alpha and the original strain. That is likely to translate into reduced ability to reduce infection, which is what we’re seeing, he says. Clinical studies are showing lots of people are getting reinfected with Omicron who have been vaccinated or vaccinated and had a previous infection, he says, so it is likely to bypass some of the ability to reduce infection. What we don’t have is very good T cell studies, he adds. We don’t have clinical studies, from South Africa or anywhere else, telling us with confidence what the level of protections of one or two doses, and a booster dose, are on hospitalisations and deaths, he says. On the positive side, he says we think there will be some preserved immunity, particularly on the T cell side, and therefore it will be likely someone with two doses and a booster will have more protection against hospitalisation and death, even though the protection against infection is less good. On boosters, it does look as though they restore quite a lot of the ability to reduce infection, he adds. It will reduce the risk of severity, it will reduce probably the risk of mortality, and it almost certainly will reduce the risk of transmitting and getting symptomatic disease, so boosters are absolutely critical to this, he says. I’m trying to avoid making people’s choices for them, but people should prioritise the things that matter to them and cut down on the things that don’t, Whitty adds. Anybody who has something that really matters to them, concentrate on that one, rather than accepting every invitation, Whitty says. That also applies to work - work from home if you can, he adds. Prioritise the things that really matter to you, he reiterates. But if you wish to not end up self-isolating or unwell at a time you really don’t want to be, you really want to be doing fewer other things, he adds. The committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, asks what prioritising social interactions over Christmas means in practical terms. This is moving very fast, it’s highly transmissible and rates are going up, Whitty says. People have plans that are most important to them at this time of year, and that means it’s sensible to cut down on work or social interactions that are less important to them, so this is a period to prioritise, he says. England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is due to be questioned by the Commons health and social care committee on the Omicron variant from 10.30am, which I will be covering here. Housebound elderly people are having to wait weeks to get their booster vaccine, despite being a key priority group for top-up jabs, raising fears about them being left at risk. Charities have warned that older people are being “overlooked” in the NHS’s rush to deliver the 1m boosters a day that Boris Johnson has ordered to reduce the threat posed by the Omicron variant. However, NHS staff involved in the booster rollout have privately told the Guardian that the longer time involved in jabbing the housebound, difficulty involved in transporting the Pfizer vaccine and million-a-day target has prompted some GPs and practice nurses to instead focus on vaccinating other patients, because they can get more done more quickly that way. Read the full story here: Housebound elderly people waiting weeks for Covid boosters The row between the UK Treasury and the Scottish government over the nature of additional Covid funding is ramping up, with first minister Nicola Sturgeon last night accusing Westminster of leaving her to fight the Omicron surge with “one hand tied”. On Tuesday, the UK Treasury announced £430 million to the devolved governments to support the booster roll-out and other health measures, with £220 million for Scotland. But, following Wednesday’s Cobra meeting, Scotland’s finance secretary Kate Forbes wrote to the Treasury calling for more funding, saying that the money released did not represent extra money but was the early release of money already budgeted for. Overnight, Sturgeon accused the Treasury of reducing funds to Scotland, saying: As feared, this is not ‘additional’ money - it is being brought forward from money we were expecting in January and had already budgeted for. But it’s actually more concerning than than that…the net effect of yesterday’s Treasury announcement appears to be that the Scottish government is £48m worse off than we thought we were before the announcement. The total we were expecting in January was £268m…we have just been told the actual amount is £220m. There is though a more fundamental point. Each of the four UK governments is responsible for protecting public health in their own country. But only when UKG takes decisions for England is funding triggered, leaving the rest of us trying to protect health with one hand tied. A UK government spokesperson said it was “giving the devolved administrations the certainty they need to spend more money in the coming weeks” and would “continue to engage with the Scottish government in the face of this serious health crisis.” Given the row over furlough extension we saw this time last year, as well as the pressure on the Scottish government from the hospitality sector following advice to postpone office Christmas parties, this is likely to escalate in the coming days. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, has called a Tory MP’s comments about Prof Chris Whitty “outrageous”. In a now-deleted tweet, Joy Morrissey, the MP for Beaconsfield, suggested that England’s chief medical officer should not give advice on people’s social plans ahead of elected officials. She wrote: “Perhaps the unelected Covid public health spokesperson should defer to what our ELECTED members of parliament and the prime minister have decided. I know it’s difficult to remember but that’s how democracy works. This is not a public health socialist state.” Streeting responded that the tweet was “extremely poorly judged” and the comments should be withdrawn immediately: It is outrageous to see a government PPS [parliamentary private secretary] attacking the chief medical officer in this way. She should apologise and withdraw this immediately. Chris Whitty has never disputed where policy is made – he makes this point repeatedly. It seems @joymorrissey has now deleted her extremely poorly judged tweet. I hope she will now have the good grace to apologise. The chief medical officer and every health and care worker in the country deserves our full support. Their only motivation is helping us. Labour has written to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, urging him to provide more support for businesses facing “closure by stealth” amid concerns over calls for people to consider limiting their social contacts around Christmas. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said in the letter that they met business leaders and major trade union bodies on Wednesday. They said they “learnt that many of them hadn’t had proper engagement from government on how Plan B and the necessary restrictions resulting from Omicron would affect them”. The letter went on: Since then, the public have been told to ‘de-prioritise social contact’. Following the science is crucial, but this will hit businesses and workers hard, especially in sectors like hospitality and leisure. Businesses face a perfect storm of cancelled bookings, rising costs and staff shortages. Businesses and their employees have put up with so much from this government. It is time the government came forward with their plans to ensure our great British businesses and their workers have the clarity and support they need to weather this storm. The health minister, Gillian Keegan, admitted the situation was “terrible” for hospitality having also suffered last Christmas, but insisted this morning that there were still measures in place to help businesses through the pandemic, including VAT reductions, business rates cuts and recovery loans. The chancellor “keeps everything under review”, she added. But Labour said more support was needed after Prof Chris Whitty told the public on Wednesday to prioritise events that “really matter to them” over the festive period, in an effort to curb the spread of Omicron. Indeed, the news has drawn concern from the hospitality sector as people weigh up whether to risk nights out or cancel to improve the chances of spending Christmas with family. British Chambers of Commerce president Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith said on Wednesday the cautions “will almost certainly have an enormous impact for businesses”. She added: Despite this still we heard no news of any new financial support measures coming from government to help those businesses, and others badly affected by the current restrictions. And the head of a company with 320 pubs and hotels said on Thursday that his business was now in a “zombie world”. Jonathan Neame, chief executive of Shepherd Neame, told Times Radio: Go to pubs. Don’t go to pubs. It was the message last time which is a really confusing and difficult message. And confuses both the operators but also confuses customers, too. Up until this point, I think that people have been mainly concerned not so much for their personal health, but for getting self-isolated and missing their family Christmases. That’s been a sort of key driver behind cancellations. But I fear now the messaging is changing. And therefore, we may see much more acceleration in cancellations. The acute problem is that if you miss Christmas, and we’re in the zombie world where we’ve been desperately trying to hang on to staff and want to hang on to staff, then what could be very profitable could quickly run into a significant loss. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, stressed that hospitality businesses were having a “hard time at the moment” and said the government should be “by their side”. “I do think the chancellor and the business secretary need to get business leaders around the table with trade union leaders to hammer out a deal to help hospitality because, you know, they really need us right now,” he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. He said Sunak should return from his trip to California to agree a deal to help businesses hit by lower footfall due to the rise in Covid. We understand the chancellor is currently out of the country in California. So perhaps he might want to get himself on a flight back and get a grip on the situation because businesses need certainty and confidence now. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said he has spoken to his equivalent in the French government, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, and agreed that hauliers will be exempt from the new restrictions. France is set to tighten restrictions on travel from the UK to slow the spread of the Omicron variant that is causing record numbers of cases on the other side of the Channel, the French government has said. “We will put in place a system of controls drastically tighter than the one we have already,” the government spokesperson Gabriel Attal told BFM television, saying the office of the prime minister, Jean Castex, would issue a statement on the new measures in the coming hours. He said travellers coming to France would need a negative test less than 24 hours old, a blanket quarantine would be enforced on return to France, and trips for tourism limited. “We will reduce the validity of the test to come to France from 48 hours to 24 hours,” said Attal, adding: We will limit the reasons for coming to France from the UK, it will be limited to French nationals and residents and their families. Tourism or business trips for people who do not have French or European nationality or are residents will be limited. People [coming back] will have to register on an app and will have to self-isolate in a place of their choosing for seven days – controlled by the security forces – but this can be shortened to 48 hours if a negative test is carried out in France. Attal said this policy was aimed at “tightening the net” to slow down the arrival of Omicron cases in France and give time for the French vaccination booster campaign to gain more ground. The measures are expected to come into effect at the weekend. More on this story here: France to tighten Covid restrictions on travel from Omicron-hit UK And for more global updates on the pandemic, here is our global live blog: Good morning. People should “use their own judgement” to “make a sensible choice” about socialising over the festive period if their priority is to spend Christmas with their families, the health minister, Gillian Keegan, has told Sky News. She said “everybody is urging caution” due to the fast spread of Omicron. Most of us will know somebody now who’s positive with Covid, and that means if you’ve tested positive, then you’ll be in isolation over Christmas. So that’s bound to make people a bit more cautious. Make a sensible choice for yourself, make a sensible choice. You know, if you’re going to go to a party, take a test. If there’s lots of people there you don’t know, if that’s your priority, fine. If your priority is to make it through to Christmas Day with your family then take a different approach. Everybody’s got different pros and cons, you know, so make a sensible decision but definitely wear a mask and definitely, you know, make sure that you take a test beforehand and also try to go to well-ventilated places as well. Her comments echo those of England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, at the Downing Street press conference on Wednesday. Whitty said it would be “sensible” and it “is going to become increasingly important” for people to “prioritise” social interactions they most value and “deprioritise” others. In a separate interview with Times Radio, Keegan said: What they were saying was prioritise, because obviously the more contacts you have, the more chance you have of testing positive, and that would mean that you’d be isolated on Christmas Day. Obviously if you want to have a family Christmas, then be cautious, otherwise you could end up testing positive and having to isolate over Christmas. That’s the message. Everybody must prioritise, you know, if you’re going to have a family Christmas with your relatives, and you know, you’ve got some maybe elderly relatives, then of course people aren’t going to be going out to nightclubs in the run-up to that event, because the chance of success in testing positive after that is probably much higher. So people are being cautious anyway, people will make their own choices. It’s not for the government to say, for every single situation, you must use your judgment as well and take a test beforehand.

          "headline": "Supermarkets drop Brazilian beef products linked to deforestation",
          "bodyText": "Sainsbury’s and five other European supermarkets have announced they will stop selling some or all beef products originating in Brazil because of concerns over links to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and other ecologically important areas. Sainsbury’s, along with Lidl Netherlands and others, took action after research into “cattle laundering” involving the meat conglomerate JBS. According to the news organisation Repórter Brasil, the company allegedly indirectly sourced cattle from illegally deforested areas. A series of investigations by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) in recent years exposed deforestation linked to the Brazilian beef trade and highlighted the issue of cattle laundering, which occurs when animals raised on an illegally deforested plot of land are moved to a farm clear of deforestation to be fattened ahead of being trucked to an abattoir for slaughter and processing. The true origin of the cattle is often hidden, and critics say the problem is widespread in Brazil and allows livestock from “dirty” farms linked to deforestation to be mixed with cattle from “clean” farms. In the latest research, Repórter Brasil, working with the campaign group Mighty Earth, tracked deforestation-linked beef – including beef jerky, corned beef and fresh meat – from Brazil to European supermarket shelves. In the case of Sainsbury’s, researchers found corned beef on sale that was processed at a JBS slaughterhouse in Lins, São Paulo. The abattoir had reportedly received supplies of cattle from a farm that sources animals for fattening from remote farms that have been officially sanctioned – and embargoed – for illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Embargos are imposed for environmental violations, such as farmers or landowners cutting down trees illegally, and serve both as a punishment and protective measure to allow land to recover. In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for Sainsbury’s said: “The link between cattle farming and the destruction of ecosystems like the Amazon, the Cerrado, and the Pantanal is a complex issue, which we take extremely seriously. We have taken a range of steps together with our suppliers and the wider industry to try to address this, but not enough progress has been made. “We are therefore committed to move our own brand corned beef sourcing away from Brazil to ensure Sainsbury’s corned beef product can be independently verified deforestation and conversion free in origin.” JBS, which sources cattle from the Amazon for its massive global beef market, has annual revenues of $50bn (£37.5bn) and slaughters almost 35,000 cattle a day in Brazil alone. Its beef exports to mainland Europe have increased by a fifth in recent years despite the Amazon emergency. In response to the investigation by Repórter Brasil, JBS told the Guardian it had “no tolerance for illegal deforestation, forced labour, misuse of indigenous lands, conservation units or violations of environmental embargos.” The company pointed out it had blocked more than 14,000 supplier farms “for failure to comply with our policies and standards and we will continue to take additional actions as warranted”. It said it had also invested in a new blockchain-enabled system, which would allow monitoring of indirect suppliers and “achieve a completely illegal deforestation-free supply chain by 2025”. JBS claims to have checked the suppliers mentioned by Repórter Brasil and found them to be in compliance with JBS procurement policies. In 2020, the Guardian, the BIJ and Repórter Brasil – for the first time – uncovered how JBS’s own trucks appeared to have transported cattle from a “dirty” ranch fined for deforestation to a supposedly “clean” ranch that in turn supplied JBS abattoirs. The BIJ also obtained livestock movement records which revealed that thousands of cattle had been trucked on the same route. JBS disputed the findings. But the revelations directly contradicted the company’s claims that it was unable to monitor the more distant parts of its beef supply chain. The company subsequently announced it would launch the “green platform”, which could monitor the whole supplier system, including the problematic “indirect supplier” Amazon farms it had not, up to that point, been able to monitor. The findings followed an earlier investigation that revealed the full extent of the UK’s involvement in deforestation in the Amazon. Nearly £1bn worth of beef supplied by JBS and other meat firms linked to deforestation had been directly imported to the UK in recent years, it was discovered. The Amazon is a crucial buffer in stabilising the regional and global climate. Preserving the world’s rainforests, many experts say, is essential if a climate emergency is to be averted. Yet between 1980 and 2005, deforestation levels reached 20,000 sq km a year. And international demand for beef is directly driving the problem: about 5,800 sq km of forest – an area four times the size of Greater London – is being felled annually in the Amazon and other areas of Brazil to be converted into pasture for cattle farming. “This is a watershed moment because several huge supermarkets across Europe are saying an emphatic ‘No!’ to Brazilian beef over deforestation concerns,” said Mighty Earth’s Europe director, Nico Muzi. “This is not a vague commitment or a nice announcement that looks good in a press release. These are a series of concrete commercial actions taken by some of the biggest supermarkets in Europe to stop buying and selling beef from a company and a country that have made too many promises and have delivered too few results.” “Christmas has come early for the forests in the Amazon, the Brazilian Cerrado savannahs and the Pantanal wetlands,” said Muzi."

          "headline": "Patrick Assoumou Eyi, leading football coach in Gabon, accused of raping boys",
          "bodyText": "A long-serving coach in Gabon is facing claims he raped, groomed and exploited young players, the Guardian can reveal. Alleged victims claim that Patrick Assoumou Eyi – known as “Capello” – abused boys in his previous role as the head coach of Gabon’s under-17 team and in his current role as the technical director for La Ligue de l’Estuaire, the country’s highest league. One former player who was coached by Eyi said that the coach would lure alleged victims to his home, which he called the “Garden of Eden”. Some victims have alleged that Eyi also provided boys for other figures in football to abuse. Eyi left his role with the country’s youth sides in 2017 but continues to work with young players at La Ligue de l’Estuaire. He has not responded directly to the Guardian’s questions about the claims. One former official at Fegafoot, Gabon’s football federation, claimed he tried to raise concerns regarding allegations of sexual abuse in relation to Eyi in a board meeting in 2019 and was dismissed from his post as a result. Fegafoot denies that claim. Alleged victims say they have not contacted the police in Gabon because they do not have confidence in the justice system. A complaint over the allegations of sexual abuse has been registered with Fifa by the international players union, Fifpro, which said it was deeply concerned about the allegations. “Our preliminary inquiries yielded consistent evidence from credible witnesses who all tell of an ongoing and long-embedded practice of forcing young players into sexual relationships as a pre-condition for footballing opportunities. “If these allegations are indeed true, it is yet further evidence that football is being consistently exploited, across leagues and continents, as a forum for abusers to access, groom, extort and assault players. More must be done to prevent this horrific abuse and we call on football’s governing bodies to act as a matter of urgency.” Several alleged victims have spoken to the Guardian. One alleged victim who played for Gabon’s under-17 side between 2015 and 2017 claimed he was abused several times by the coach during his career with the national team. “He forced me to have sexual relations with him,” said the player. “That was the condition to stay in the national team. At the time, I left my village in order to help my family. I was living in the capital [Libreville] and becoming a professional footballer was the only way to get out of misery. So I did what I had to do to help them.” He added: “Capello raped so many boys. He sometimes went to the countryside to find new ones. He took advantage of poverty and also gave some boys to other officials. In our national team, the majority had to give sex. That’s the reality of Gabonese football for decades but no one can shut down the system. Predators are too numerous … we suffered hell.” Two more alleged victims claimed Eyi abused them when they were under the age of 18 and attending an academy called Académie Club de Libreville in Akanda, a suburb of Libreville, between 2017 and 2019. “Sometimes, he took some kids to his house, ‘Le Jardin d’Eden’,” one said. “He was very nice to me but every time I saw him he told me I was beautiful. One day, he told me that some of the players gave masturbation … he left his office with a smile. It was like he was sending me a message.” He added: “I had some sexual experiences with Capello, I was obligated to. I quit football, you know. I tried my best for my family and now I live out of the country. I can’t go back.” The other player added: “Capello bought kids from remote provinces or villages with a poor background in the majority. He brainwashed them and made them believe they had to give sexual favours to him. One other coach told us one day: ‘If you want to play with the under-17 national team, you know what you have to do.’” During his playing days, Eyi was a winger who turned to coaching at an early age and developed a reputation for spotting talented young players. He has coached at several clubs as well as Gabon’s national youth teams, and took his nickname as a tribute to Fabio Capello, the Italian who managed England between 2007 and 2012. Eyi has yet to respond directly to questions from the Guardian. However, after repeated attempts to contact him he posted a series of messages on WhatsApp Status that appeared to make reference to the allegations, including one that read: “Those who use lies as a weapon don’t know the reverse on the spiritual side.” A statement from Fegafoot said it had “never registered any complaints relating to any act of this nature”. “To our knowledge, [Eyi] does not have a team and is not appointed to lead any national team. The players you have met should consider also contacting us in order to diligently investigate, because we confirm that such facts must be denounced in court and to the competent judicial bodies.” Fegafoot’s media officer, Pablo Moussodji Ngoma, made reference to the Guardian’s inquiries in a Facebook post, criticising the allegations for a “weakness of evidence”. “The testimonies of the actor victims, with their names, can dissuade the perpetrators of these abominable acts but we must also allow the judicial bodies and even the courts to punish them,” he wrote. “The rest will be taken as one more communication operation for those who are committed to tarnishing Gabon’s image internationally.” Gabonese football has been beset with issues in recent months, with the former Rennes winger Stéphane N’Guéma and four other former internationals having been arrested last month for protesting over the continued cancellation of the domestic leagues. N’Guéma has since stepped down from his post as the secretary general of the players’ union, whose members say they have not been paid for nearly two years."

The Lebanese artist merges folk instrumentation and field recordings with abyssal drones and tectonic electro-acoustics, forming a foundation upon which his grave, guttural vocals are sung in Arabic. On Qalaq, he inverts the orchestral premise of his prior LP, choosing instead to collaborate with avant garde peers in a remote, individuated and turn-based capacity – one that invites each guest artist to interpret the record’s titular theme of deep worry and anxiety for Lebanon. The result is an album that’s as defiant and visceral as it is vulnerable. It doesn’t open so much as it explodes, with Moumneh’s distorted laments tersely rattled by the shellshock blastbeats of drummer Greg Fox. This destructive, damaged beginning haunts the rest of the album like a spectre: Moumneh’s agitated buzuq shredding spars with intercepted transmissions, relentless electronics and the might of the Turkish davul drum; He shares a phantasmic tape-loop duet with Lucrecia Dalt; Abenaki artist-activist Alanis Obomsawin even sings a lullaby for his children – but the threat of the next explosion courses through each moment, each thought on Moumneh’s mind. This was a record planned long before the pandemic, long before the corruption-induced blast in Beirut last year, its timeliness underlined by the inevitability of horror during escalating crisis. Qalaq stands as an essential expression of this pain, bearing witness to a manufactured apocalypse unleashed upon place and people."

          "headline": "A ‘false solution’? How crypto mining became the oil industry’s new hope",
          "bodyText": "In January of 2019, Chase Lochmiller and Cully Cavness, recently reunited prep school pals from Denver, drove out to the snow-covered plains of Wyoming to bring a piece of tech culture to the American heartland. Trembling in -20F (-29C) temperatures, they wired up a prototype of their brainchild: a machine that harnesses the “waste gas” from oil rigs to power mining for cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the most-popular decentralized digital currency, have a notoriously large carbon footprint (bitcoin mining alone consumes about half as much electricity in a year as all of the UK). So to leverage a cheap source of energy to run their bitcoin mining operations, Lochmiller and Cavness found themselves partnering with oil companies to repurpose a byproduct, primarily methane, that’s typically vented or burnt off in flares. “We flipped the switch and saw all the bitcoin mining servers light up green, and you could see the flare physically shrink a little bit,” said Lochmiller, a self-described “city kid” who had never before set foot in an oilfield. “It was kind of a Frankenstein moment, like ‘Oh my god, it’s alive!’” Their creation is part of a niche wave of tech startups that are now eyeing the oil and gas industry to help power the cryptocurrency boom. Lochmiller and Cavness, who started a bitcoin mining company called Crusoe Energy, see their fix as a marriage between two problems capable of “solving” one another: the wasting of gas flaring that contributes to the climate crisis, and the need for cheaper energy as crypto increases in popularity. Climate experts, however, warn it’s a “false solution” so long as oil and gas production is allowed to continue. The world’s leading authority on climate science concludes that only a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will help avert a climate calamity; merely finding alternate uses for “waste gas” doesn’t confront the dire need to curb fossil fuel consumption. If anything, researchers warn, oil companies may feel incentivized to drill even more. “At the end of the day, they’re still burning natural gas,” said Arvind Ravikumar, a methane researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, who deemed flare mitigation and companies proposing similar technologies a “scam”. Lochmiller and Cavness, however, say their work helps the industry produce oil in as clean a way as possible, buying time, or “extending the runway” for the energy transition. Their company has attracted high-profile investors, including Bain and Winklevoss Capital, raking in $125m for their second round of fundraising in April. They plan to roll out 100 bitcoin mining data centers by early 2022, up from the 65 units already in place. Crusoe has trademarked its solution as “digital flare mitigation”. They install fleets of data centers that hum in shipping container-like structures next to remote oil rigs. Oil producers are then paid for the waste gas they otherwise wouldn’t use because it’s cheaper to burn than to pay to transport to market. In return, Crusoe can use the byproduct to power energy-intensive computing operations on-site. The data centers burn through enormous amounts of energy because there’s no centralized “bank” that holds cryptocurrency. Instead, new coins are created by solving complex equations that require heavy computing power to authenticate. The currency is then tracked on a decentralized ledger, known as the blockchain, which is also resource-intensive to maintain. The new technology comes amid a “great mining migration” that’s currently underway in the United States after China banned crypto mining in September. And with renewed global focus on cutting the highly-potent greenhouse gas, methane, which is the primary “waste gas” in flaring, the model is particularly in vogue. Oil-friendly regulators, elected officials, industry groups and financial services giants have been taking note. Commissioner Jim Wright of the Texas Railroad Commission, the state agency charged with regulating oil and gas, told the Guardian that modular mitigation setups like Crusoe’s are “most appealing”. Texas senator Ted Cruz is also a fan. Meanwhile, North Dakota lawmakers on both sides of the aisle passed a law this year making oil producers eligible for a tax credit if they employ onsite flare mitigation. Crusoe, which is based in Williston, North Dakota – the heart of the Bakken shale – worked closely with legislators to pass the bill. According to Paasha Mahdavi, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who co-authored a 2020 paper on methane mitigation measures, new technologies that stop flaring at the source do seem like they would reduce emissions. But in practice, he said, projects designed to capture otherwise flared or vented gas have resulted in an overall increase in gas production. After all, they create a new source of demand. “It’s like if you had a leaky gasoline pipeline and, instead of fixing the problem, you plugged in a Humvee next to the leak and left the engine on in perpetuity with the A/C on full blast,” Mahdavi said. *** Cavness, the chief executive of Crusoe Energy who goes by “Electron Cowboy” on Twitter, grew up envisioning himself jumping on the family bandwagon. He would get an internship with Shell, and follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather to carve out a career in the oil and gas industry. But then Cavness landed at Middlebury College, a prestigious liberal arts school in Vermont with a reputation as the alma mater of global climate campaign, 350.org founders, and home of the university fossil fuel divestment movement. “Climate was the whole conversation,” Cavness said, noting that he felt pressure to downplay his oil and gas roots. After going down the climate rabbit hole at Middlebury, and spending a year after graduation studying the “morality of energy”, Cavness’ job was troubling his conscience. He’d been losing sleep thinking about the unfathomable amount of gas the industry was wasting. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2020, 142bn cubic metres of gas was flared – the energy equivalent of providing electricity to 49m homes. When Cavness reunited with Lochmiller in 2018 during an 18-hour hiking trip in the Rocky Mountains, they hatched a plan: Lochmiller, an MIT graduate based in San Francisco, had recently left a position as a partner at a cryptocurrency investment firm, while Cavness was with a separate firm that invested in oil and gas. Together, they would combine their worlds of bitcoin and big oil. Unsurprisingly, the bitcoin flaring option is enormously appealing to the industry. Crusoe’s data centers are set up without cost to producers, who earn money on gas they otherwise wouldn’t. “It’s essentially a free offering to the oil company,” Cavness explained earlier this year at Hart Energy’s Developing Unconventional Gas virtual conference for the Bakken and Rockies regions. Cavness and Lochmiller say they’re on the cusp of the latest climate research. But critics warn their company sits squarely within the techno-optimistic ecosystem of Silicon Valley, where the hunt for innovative solutions may blind even the most climate-literate entrepreneurs. Climate experts warn Crusoe’s outlook, and it’s proposed “fix”, reflects a selective understanding of the science. Even the most conservative forecasts say oil and gas exploration must stop immediately to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis, including unnecessary loss of human lives. But despite Crusoe’s climate-focused branding, Lochmiller confirmed the company supports ongoing exploration and drilling. As Cavness sees it, even after his now-infant daughter grows old or reaches the end of her life, fossil fuels will still be around. If the oil industry will be “required to sustain life on the planet” anyway, Cavness asks, why not drill in the cleanest way possible? *** While the Crusoe chiefs say their digital flare migration technology is buying time for new clean energy sources, some fear their strategy is more like placing a Band-Aid over a gaping wound. Nine out of ten climate experts who responded to requests for comment, including top methane researchers, political scientists, and climate analysts, said that oil and gas exploration and new drilling – even if equipped with methane mitigation technologies – is not in line with a future in which warming is curbed in accordance with global climate pledges. Of this group, the one dissenting voice, an academic and co-founder of a greenhouse gas monitoring company, said continued exploration and drilling can “probably” happen in a clean way. Climate experts are more split over the degree to which cryptocurrency operations should be allowed to consume renewable energy. Three out of ten climate experts the Guardian spoke with were intrigued by one element of Crusoe’s model. Similar to waste gas operations, the company has a set of data centers slated to run on wind farms designed to tap energy available when gigawatts generated exceed those demanded. Crusoe’s ability to pay for that energy, according to the company, will enable renewable developers to underwrite new fleets. But not all are optimistic. Heather Price, an atmospheric chemist and professor at North Seattle College, worries that flare mitigation technology is little more than a greenwashing tactic meant to spin fossil fuels in a positive light. “I have no faith that this use of flares for crypto would be a temporary situation,” she said. “The fossil fuel industry and crypto companies should not get a ‘cookie’ for this move.” This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story"

          "headline": "Distraction disaster! Notifications are ruining our concentration – here’s how to escape them",
          "bodyText": "Joanie (not her real name), a clinical psychologist who lives in London, has three work laptops. This is not uncommon when you’re spread across different NHS services. Sometimes, she feels like the 1980s synth supremo Paul Hardcastle, who used to dart between keyboards when performing on Top of the Pops. Except that he wasn’t always rudely interrupted by random notifications. “When I log on to one laptop,” she says, “this automatic thing comes on called Netpresenter player. It’s a ticker tape, like one of those bus-stop ads that keeps moving.” She quits it, because she needs to concentrate on writing up notes before her next meeting. But it keeps coming back with annoying notifications. “I’ve been in the middle of a session and it’s started playing music and a video – usually things like, ‘Don’t forget to wash your hands properly’, or, ‘Hey, we’re all meeting for a webinar in half an hour about staff wellbeing.’” Joanie says her wellbeing would improve if it was easier to get her work done. With increasing chunks of life handled online – from banking to entertainment to health – we have spiralled into notifications hell. On a bad day, life can feel like one long stressy game of Space Invaders. You open a device to check the weather, only to be greeted with a barrage of invasive alerts – some interesting (you got paid!) and some irritating (a pointless post on your neighbourhood WhatsApp group, a software update …) and before you know it, you’ve forgotten all about the weather. Scrolling down YouTube’s endless list of video explainers for opting out of notifications provides a window into this distracting reality: “Turn off annoying Outlook alerts,” “How to disable notifications in Google Chrome browser,” “How to TURN OFF ALL notifications on ANY iPhone.” PlayStation, Microsoft Teams, Facebook, Garmin smartwatch, the list goes on and on, because this is a constantly evolving situation and we can’t keep up. Joanie is a serial notifications disabler, but could do with watching the Teams and Outlook ones. The computer she uses most has recently started running Microsoft Teams to connect workers who either hotdesk or, since Covid, work from home. As she opens it, I hear a sophisticated chime that reminds me of airports, with their frequent announcements about gate closures for flights that aren’t yours. She says that’s the “activity” bell, heralding announcements that may or may not be relevant. Then there’s the general chat function, which notifies her about more meetings than anyone could possibly attend. “But even when I decline the invite, sometimes I still get all these pings of messages from the meeting saying: ‘I can’t see the slides.’ So then you have to actively mute yourself each time.” Email notifications needlessly pop up on Microsoft Outlook, and with young children, her personal phone is never far away, with its steady flow of reminders from school, and other pings and alerts she either needs or hasn’t managed to eliminate. On her third laptop, there’s only a shared drive for files, and an email account. “I feel when I’m on that laptop, I can get my job done so much more easily, because you’re choosing what you do.” Sophie Leroy, associate professor at University of Washington Bothell School of Business, is an expert in work interruptions, although many of her findings also apply to personal life. She puts notifications into two categories: “Notifications like work emails, where you are expected to provide an answer immediately, because of corporate norms, versus things that may not require a switch of your attention, like the Wall Street Journal, or your favourite store, and then you have to decide whether to switch or not.” Both are challenging. Being notified of a text from a friend, which you don’t need to read straight away, can be surprisingly draining. “You’re like: ‘OK, what does my friend want?’ There’s uncertainty, and we don’t deal with uncertainty very well.” Ignoring it, says Leroy, is “cognitively difficult”. Self-control is required, and when it’s needed several times an hour, your brain will become exhausted. If your current task feels taxing, you’ll soon take a break to scratch some of your notifications itches. But even if you’re really keen to continue working, says Leroy, “when we use the resource of self-control, it depletes over time, and it’s going to be harder to ignore those notifications.” Checking a notification quickly, so that it can be batted away and we can return to our work, might therefore seem the best option, but the mental cost is significant. “As the brain transitions between context,” says Leroy, “our train of thought has been broken. And when we go back to what we’re doing, the brain has a hard time remembering exactly where we were. Getting that momentum back, reaching the same level of concentration – that takes time. Even after a few seconds’ attention switch, coming back can be very costly.” This may not be the end of the world in many jobs – but what if you work in something like healthcare? “If a nurse is interrupted during the administration of a drug to a patient,” says Leroy, “even if it’s a few seconds, there is a risk that they might either administer the wrong dose, or forget whether they had done it or not.” People understand this example, she says, yet don’t think it applies to them, but her research says otherwise. Leroy gives people tricky tasks to focus on – such as reviewing CVs to find the most appropriate candidate for a given job description. People who are interrupted, she says, “are 17% less likely to choose the optimal candidate because of the cognitive costs associated with having to switch attention”. In notifications hell, productivity declines, as does the quality of your work. All this means we are more likely to reach clocking off time without having finished our tasks, which then start eating up personal time – “recovery time”, says Leroy. “And that has a direct impact on wellbeing and mental health, because then there’s no time to disconnect.” Even after we have clocked off, the notifications keep coming and we still check them, “because we have normalised it, not realising that if you’re having a good time with your kid, or with a friend, and you suddenly see a notification, you’re switching between different worlds and never being fully in the moment, or fully enjoying it. And that’s really critical for wellbeing.” One study has shown that anxiety and depression are higher among people who pay more attention to their devices than to their friends when socialising. Another finds that life satisfaction is lower. *** And yet for those of younger generations, this state of constant interruption can define their early teens. Beth Walker is a psychology teacher in Yorkshire with four stepchildren, the youngest of whom are 13-year-old twin girls. “I worry about the amount of notifications they get in such a short space of time,” says Walker. “They have notifications from Snapchat, WhatsApp and text messages.” She fears that the sheer weight of notifications puts pressure on them. “They feel the need to respond immediately. They can’t think: ‘I can just leave that until I’ve got a minute.’” And Walker suspects that they perceive social consequences if they don’t. “I think they believe their friends expect them to respond straight away, otherwise maybe they’re not as good friends as they should be.” Anna Cox, professor of human-computer interaction at University College London, offers some reassurance. “We don’t have any good evidence that young people are more harmed, if you like, than anybody else.” But she concedes that one of the worst things about all our tech is that it’s designed to grab our attention, and comes with notifications switched on. “I feel a lot of sympathy for young people, who get their first mobile when they’re 10 or 11 often, and no one sits down to teach them how to turn the notifications off. And so they do get bombarded by these things. I think we need to be doing a much better job of educating people of all ages.” Lane says the twins’ older siblings (20 and 17) now treat their notifications with less urgency. “With the right guidance, as they get older, they are able to moderate. They still get as many notifications, but if they’re in the middle of doing something they will leave the phone for two hours, or whatever.” Cox laments that many phone newbies are unaware of how to use night or do-not-disturb modes. “There were lots of reports of children being woken up through the night by someone texting them. When you see that it can impact people’s sleep, it’s not surprising that they’re stressed out. They’re exhausted.” Lane says the twins are still of an age at which they’ll hand over their phones before they go to bed, but it can be harder to force older teens to do so. Those who have switched to remote working, meanwhile, might have waved goodbye to the distractions of open-plan offices, but, as with Joanie’s least favourite laptop, software is filling that nice, peaceful gap. “Previously, they might have had a phone on their desk, and email,” says Cox, “but now they’ve also got Teams and Slack and Zoom and they feel as if there are all these different things that they might be getting messages from.” Cox says there’s no evidence that notifications hell is affecting our concentration skills in a permanent way. We can still pay attention when we really need to. Surgeons and truck drivers can still focus safely on their tasks for hours on end. “But there is maybe a change in how we view the world,” she says. “What we really like is novelty. Before we had access to all of this technology, it was quite hard to find new things, right? It was exciting if you got a new book, or the next episode of EastEnders was on.” Now, of course, especially if we’ve not turned notifications off, there’s a constant flow of new content vying for our attention. Like obedient puppies, tech has conditioned humans to react to notifications. Most of these digital nags are boring things, but because we occasionally get a high-reward one – a message from a new love, or an update on an exciting delivery, “we get this Pavlovian response,” says Cox, “where we end up thinking: ‘Oh, maybe this is an exciting one,’ and we want to respond to it straight away.” By now, most of us are familiar with the notion of the dopamine hits that make phone-checking addictive. Dopamine is our motivational neurochemical – our wanting and seeking mechanism – and novelty is one of its key triggers. But the wanting part of our brains is mightier than the pleasure part, negatively weighting our desire to pleasure ratio. Which is why often, reading a notification feels like being a small child, unwrapping the biggest but most disappointing Christmas present. Although notifications are bad for our productivity, brain power and mental health, the thought of going without them can be distressing to some, as a team of Spanish and US researchers discovered in 2017 when they asked participants to do so for 24 hours. While the 30 who took up the challenge felt less distracted and more productive, they also felt, says the study, “no longer able to be as responsive as expected, which made some participants anxious. And they felt less connected with [their] social group.” Despite these gripes, after taking part, about two-thirds of them planned to change the way they managed notifications, and two years later, half had adhered to those plans. *** ‘The struggle is real,” says Cox, but there are things we can do to minimise notifications hell. Tech companies, such as Microsoft, say they are trying to make such messages less annoying. “Our research has taught us that notifications and interruptions can be valuable and disruptive,” says Mary Czerwinski, a research manager at Microsoft’s Human Understanding and Empathy group, before flagging up new features the company has introduced. Focus Assist, she says, “attempts to block social media and other app notifications so that users can work distraction-free for long periods of time.” And you can set a Focus Session timer within the Clock app. But notifications will always come from somewhere. Your GP’s surgery, your kids’ school, your own weekly reminder that it’s bin day. Even simple things can help, suggests Cox, “like putting your phone in a drawer, while you get on with the boring work task. She also suggests compartmentalising and, where possible, having separate devices for work and personal life, or even having different user accounts on the one device. Some Android phones, she says, allow there to be two users. One could be work you, the other off-duty you. Turning off notifications for apps, and, she says, “those badges that tell you how many messages you haven’t read yet, will reduce the distractions”. With Facebook, she says, not only will you need to turn off notifications, but also emails. “You probably only want to know if someone else has logged into your Facebook account.” But equally, if you haven’t the brainpower for fiddly notifications admin right now, she says, “we shouldn’t be too scared and worried about it. It’s not cocaine.” Leroy only uses email and texts, and chooses when she checks them. But she has developed a simple strategy for interruptions to reduce the mental burden of context switching, called the “ready-to-resume plan”. Before checking the notification, she says, “take a couple of seconds to write down where you were, and more importantly, what you were going to do next, or where you were struggling. And then you’re disengaged, and you address whatever is coming.” This helps your brain get closure on what you were doing. “So you’re more fully focused on the interrupting request. And then when you resume, you have a trace of where you were and are able to resume much faster.” Similarly, if the notification requires action but isn’t urgent, don’t just let it hang. Make a note of it. “The brain does not do well with anything that is pending when there is no plan on how to deal with it,” says Leroy. “Writing down to go back and address Jerry’s email will help your brain relax about the fact that you have Jerry’s email pending.” “We have to be mindful about protecting our attention,” she says. “We take it for granted. Understand that we have those cognitive limitations, and be humble about it.” Every time Leroy loads a new app, she disables notifications. “That’s my default,” she says. As Cox adds, “These notifications do train us to respond. And they’re very effective. That’s why all the companies use them. And that’s why we need to fight, quietly, by switching them off.”"

Here is a snapshot of the latest key developments: Covid cases in the UK reached record levels, with 78,610 new cases reported on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant continues its rapid spread. England’s chief medical officer warned people not to mix with others unless they have to in the run-up to Christmas after Britain recorded its most daily cases since the start of the pandemic. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was possible the Covid-19 vaccine would eventually be made compulsory in France, but said it was not the priority for now. A US appeals court revived the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for healthcare workers in 26 states. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken cut short his trip to Southeast Asia due to a Covid-19 case among his travelling party. Moderna will start a trial of its Covid-19 vaccine across eight African countries to determine its efficacy in people who are HIV positive, Bloomberg News reported. Early data suggests Omicron is more transmissible than Delta, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Canadians advised against all non-essential international travel. The Omicron variant has been found to multiply about 70 times quicker than the original and Delta versions of coronavirus in tissue samples taken from the bronchus, the main tubes from the windpipe to the lungs, a study found. Covid cases in the UK reached record levels, with 78,610 new cases reported on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant continues its rapid spread. Ukraine will extend Covid restrictions for another three months, to 31 March from the end of December, because of low levels of vaccination, the prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. Italy tightens restrictions for arrivals from the rest of the EU, requiring Covid tests of everyone and a five-day quarantine for those who are not vaccinated. The Crown Princess of Denmark tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday. The Buin Zoo on the outskirts of the Chilean capital Santiago is administering a Covid-19 vaccine to tigers and lions. The experimental formula was donated by global animal health company Zoetis Inc. On Monday, lions, tigers, pumas and even an orangutan received the vaccine. “We are using an experimental vaccine that will yield short-term results that will in turn allow us to develop a vaccine that is not on the market today,” zoo director Ignacio Idalsoaga told Reuters. “These are the first doses being produced worldwide, which will enable scientific accuracy and later allow mass production to protect every animal from this deadly virus in zoos like ours. “We are vaccinating three tigers, three lions, three pumas and our orangutan, because great apes are also susceptible to this,” he said. The Canadian government on Wednesday advised Canadians against all non-essential international travel, and the largest province of Ontario capped capacity at large events like NBA and NHL games at 50% because of the new Omicron variant. Prime minister Justin Trudeau said Canadians shouldn’t travel right now and anyone entering the country is going to face extra barriers like testing. “It’s the last thing families want to be dealing with right now, but Covid in the presence of Omicron is back with a vengeance,” Trudeau said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said all adults in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, can book virus booster shots beginning Monday if three months have passed since their second vaccine dose. Canada trails the US, Britain and other countries in getting citizens booster shots. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as my colleague Tom Ambrose takes a well-deserved break. First up, some Covid numbers out of Australia. The country’s most populous state of NSW has once again seen a significant jump in cases with q record high 1,742 new Covid cases in the latest reporting period. Victoria recorded 1,622 new Covid cases as some restrictions eased. Here’s what we know so far about Omicron’s spread in Australia. In the UK, Professor Chris Whitty has told people “don’t mix with people you don’t have to” at events that are not among the most important to them. “I really think people should be prioritising those things - and only those things - that really matter to them,” he said. Here is the full video. Crown Princess Amalia, the heir to the Dutch throne, invited 21 people to her 18th birthday party last week even as the government has asked people not to have more than four guests in the face of surging Covid cases. Amalia, who had cancelled indoor festivities because of the pandemic, held a last-minute gathering in the palace gardens, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte wrote to parliament on Wednesday. Reuters reported: The eldest daughter of King Willem-Alexander had been expected to quietly celebrate her birthday last Tuesday. Although no rules appear to have been broken, the event came as hospitals struggled to find beds for a surge in Covid patients and concerns about the new Omicron variant. Social-distancing restrictions were in place nationwide, including the early closing of restaurants and non-essential shops. Professional sporting events were closed to the public and households had been asked not to have more than four guests. “Guests were asked to take a test. All were vaccinated. The assumption was that they would keep an acceptable distance,” Rutte’s letter to lawmakers said in reference to the party. But King Willem-Alexander “informed me that in hindsight, it was not such a good idea. I think that’s a sensible reaction,” Rutte wrote. Canada’s government called on its residents not to leave the country as provinces ramp up vaccinations to combat the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant. Case numbers are increasing as Canadian hospitals struggle to clear backlogs from months of postponed procedures. Many burnt-out staff members appear ill-equipped for another surge in infections, Reuters reported. “I say very clearly: now is not the time to travel,” health minister Jean-Yves Duclos said at a news conference, adding that it’s clear there is community transmission of Omicron in Canada. Duclos also said the government is sending millions more Covid vaccine doses and rapid tests to the 10 provinces. Canada already has travel bans on 10 African countries because of concerns about the new variant. Canada advised people in March 2020 not to travel abroad unless necessary but it withdrew the notice in October of this year - before the first Omicron cases were reported - citing the success of vaccination campaigns. Meanwhile in the US and Canada, Apple has temporarily closed three retail stores in Miami, Maryland and Ottawa after a rise in employee Covid cases and exposures, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. The company said that all employees will take tests prior to the stores reopening and that it is staying in touch with the affected workers, according to the report. The iPhone maker said on Tuesday all customers and employees at its stores will be required to wear masks. French president Emmanuel Macron has said it is possible the Covid vaccine would eventually be made compulsory in France, but said it was not the priority for now. Like its European neighbours and countries across the globe, France is scrambling to find ways to contain a fresh surge in the pandemic. France’s seven-day average of new infections is at its highest since November 2020. Asked in an interview with TF1 and LCI television stations if Covid vaccination could become mandatory in France, Macron said: “This hypothesis exists.” But he quickly added that France was “almost there,” in practice. With nearly 90% of eligible people in France already vaccinated, France was not far from the level of take-up that would be achieved by making the jab mandatory, he said. First and foremost, he encouraged those who have not had a jab yet to get it done, Reuters reported. He said: There are a little more than 5 million of our fellow citizens who are not vaccinated and therefore really, I call on them to take responsibility because they are not protected and we see many cases today in hospital ... who have not been vaccinated. Vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate: this is the first pillar. Good evening, I’m Tom Ambrose and will be bringing you all the latest Covid news from the UK and around the world over the next few hours. We start with the news that England’s top medic has warned that early data from South Africa on the Omicron variant should be treated with caution as there is a danger people have over-interpreted it to mean there is no problem. Professor Chris Whitty said what is lacking currently is “clear data on some of the really key questions”. The chief medical officer said even if the new variant is milder, its ability to spread faster means there could still be an issue. He told Wednesday’s Downing Street press conference: The first caution on this is simply a numerical one - if the rate of hospitalisation were to halve but you’re doubling every two days, in two days you’re back to where you were before you actually had the hospitalisation. If the peak of this is twice as great, then halving of the size of the hospitalisation rate, you still end up in the same place. And this peak is going very fast. He said it is also important to note that immunity in South Africa is “far higher” in the face of this wave, due to a prior Delta wave and the country’s vaccination programme, adding that that makes their lower hospitalisation rate so far “unsurprising”. He stated that he remains concerned there will be a problem with Omicron, but the exact nature of it is currently unknown. He said: That doesn’t mean that there isn’t some degree of slightly milder disease, that is possible. But I just think there’s a danger people have over-interpreted this to say, ‘this is not a problem and what are we worrying about?’ I want to be clear, I’m afraid this is going to be a problem. Exact proportions of it, of course, South African scientists and UK scientists and scientists globally are trying to determine at the moment. The Omicron variant has been found to multiply about 70 times quicker than the original and Delta versions of coronavirus in tissue samples taken from the bronchus, the main tubes from the windpipe to the lungs, in laboratory experiments that could help explain its rapid transmission, a study has found. Story here. Christmas get-togethers may need to be downsized as Omicron is now “very likely” to increase the death toll in Europe even if it proves to be less severe, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has said. The new Covid variant’s high transmissibility means that more people are forecast by the EU agency to be admitted to hospital or killed this winter than previously projected. The risk assessment, published on Wednesday, advises governments they urgently need to reintroduce Covid restrictions, with one option being to advise families and friends to avoid mixing over the festive season. Story here. Covid cases in the UK reached record levels, with 78,610 new cases reported on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant continues its rapid spread. The caseload came as Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health and Security Agency, told the Commons transport committee that Omicron was “probably the most significant threat we’ve had since the start of the pandemic” and that the data expected on growth rates over the next few days “will be quite staggering compared to the rate of growth that we’ve seen in cases for previous variants”. “The difficulty is that the growth of this virus, it has a doubling time which is shortening – ie it’s doubling faster, growing faster,” she said, adding that when Omicron first arrived the doubling time was estimated to be four or five days. Story here. Canada is set to advise its population to avoid international travel while provinces ramp up vaccinations to combat the fast-spreading Omicron variant. But efforts to head off a rising Covid wave are complicated by public pandemic fatigue. Justin Trudeau’s government, set to speak on Omicron measures Wednesday afternoon, was expected to advise Canadians to avoid non-essential international travel, a source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukraine’s government will extend Covid restrictions for another three months, to 31 March from the end of December, because of low levels of vaccination, the prime minister Denys Shmyhal said. “Until the level of vaccination in Ukraine reaches 70% of the population, we must adhere to all imposed restrictions,” Shmyhal said at a televised government meeting. Italy will tighten restrictions for arrivals from the rest of the EU from Thursday, requiring coronavirus tests of everyone and a five-day quarantine for those who are not vaccinated. The new measures, valid from 16 December to 31 January, come as Europe battles a fresh wave of coronavirus infections as winter settles in and the Omicron variant takes hold. Poland brought in new restrictions on the numbers of people allowed in restaurants, hotels and theatres on Wednesday, as the daily Covid death toll hit its highest level since April. The new limits of 30% of maximum capacity don’t apply for people who have been vaccinated, putting the onus for checking vaccination status on business owners. Also from Wednesday, people flying into Poland from outside the EU’s free travel Schengen area must have proof of a negative test taken no earlier than 24 hours before crossing the border. Among other measures, schools will switch to remote learning for a few days on either side of the Christmas holidays, meaning that children will be out of school from 20 December to 9 January. Nightclubs will also have to close, except for New Year’s parties. The Crown Princess of Denmark, Mary, tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, the royal court said in a statement. The royal was isolating in a wing of the Amalienborg Palace in the heart of Copenhagen and the virus was not detected among other members of the family, it said. The Omicron variant has been found to multiply about 70 times quicker than the original and Delta versions of coronavirus in tissue samples taken from the bronchus, the main tubes from the windpipe to the lungs, in laboratory experiments that could help explain its rapid transmission. The study, by a team from the University of Hong Kong, also found that the new variant grew 10 times slower in lung tissue, which the authors said could be an indicator of lower disease severity. Michael Chan Chi-wai, who led the work, said the result needed to be interpreted with caution because severe disease is determined not only by how quickly the virus replicates but also by a person’s immune response and, in particular, whether the immune system goes into overdrive, causing a so-called cytokine storm. “It is also noted that by infecting many more people, a very infectious virus may cause more severe disease and death even though the virus itself may be less pathogenic,” he said. “Therefore, taken together with our recent studies showing that the Omicron variant can partially escape immunity from vaccines and past infection, the overall threat from the Omicron variant is likely to be very significant.” Read the full story here: Omicron found to grow 70 times faster than Delta in bronchial tissue Christmas get-togethers may need to be downsized as Omicron is now “very likely” to increase the death toll in Europe even if it proves to be less severe, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has said. The new Covid variant’s high transmissibility means that more people are forecast by the EU agency to be admitted to hospital or killed this winter than previously projected. The risk assessment, published on Wednesday, advises governments they urgently need to reintroduce Covid restrictions, with one option being to advise families and friends to avoid mixing over the festive season. Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the ECDC, based in Stockholm, said: “We assess the probability of further spread of the Omicron variant in the EU/European economic area as very high, and it is considered very likely to cause additional hospitalisations and fatalities, further to those already expected from previous forecasts that consider only the Delta variant. “In the current situation, vaccination alone will not allow us to prevent the impact of the Omicron variant, because there will be no time to address the vaccination gaps that still exist.” Beyond ensuring that masks are worn and public spaces and buses and trains remain uncrowded, Ammon said governments “should also consider advising reduced inter-household mixing”. She added: “Exercising additional caution is recommended when travelling and when there is contact between people of different ages during the holiday season”. Read more here: Omicron likely to accelerate death toll in Europe, says health agency People who have cold-like symptoms in London are more likely to have Covid than a cold, according to the scientist behind the Zoe coronavirus symptom tracker app. Prof Tim Spector told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that most of the symptoms of Omicron were the same as those of a common cold, including headaches, sore throat, runny nose, fatigue and sneezing. Spector urged people with cold symptoms – and not just the classic Covid symptoms – to take a test. “Things like fever, cough and loss of smell are now in the minority of symptoms we are seeing,” he said. “Most people don’t have classic symptoms.” He added: “In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it’s far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold. We’re seeing doubling in the numbers equivalent to what’s being seen elsewhere, every two and a half days.” Read the full story here: Londoners with cold symptoms more likely to have Covid, says expert Covid cases in the UK have reached record levels, with 78,610 new cases reported on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant continues its rapid spread. The figure surpasses the previous peak in UK cases – infections that are picked up through testing – of 68,053 reported on 8 January this year. That compares with 59,610 infections and 150 fatalities reported in the 24 hours prior. The UK also recorded a further 165 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest data from the government’s coronavirus dashboard. The caseload came as Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UK Health and Security Agency, told the Commons transport committee that Omicron was “probably the most significant threat we’ve had since the start of the pandemic” and that the data expected on growth rates over the next few days “will be quite staggering compared to the rate of growth that we’ve seen in cases for previous variants”. “The difficulty is that the growth of this virus, it has a doubling time which is shortening – ie it’s doubling faster, growing faster,” she said, adding that when Omicron first arrived the doubling time was estimated to be four or five days. More to follow here: UK Covid cases at record level with 78,610 new infections A lioness in a Belgian zoo has been diagnosed with Covid-10 and the members of her pride have gone into isolation in individual enclosures away from the public, the Pairi Daiza Park said. Dana, one of four lions at the park, was suffering from fever, a cough and loss of appetite, according to vets. None of her keepers has tested positive. In June, a lioness in a zoo in the Indian city of Chennai died from coronavirus and cases have been reported in other big cats. Travellers to Greece from the UK and Denmark will need a negative PCR test to enter the country, the health ministry said on Wednesday. The measure will be in effect from 19 December as part of efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the ministry said. The tests will need to be no more than 48 hours old. The quickly spreading Omicron variant is expected to become the dominant strain in Denmark this week. In the UK, at least one person has died after contracting Omicron, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on Monday, the first publicly confirmed death globally from the variant. As Omicron continues its rapid spread, the UK Health Security Agency has announced it will double the availability of home delivery of Covid test kits to 900,000 a day by Saturday so that more people can get lateral flow or PCR tests delivered to their door. Test availability will also expand at pharmacies, PCR testing sites and local authorities, the UKHSA said. “Pharmacies are now be able to access 10.5 million lateral flow tests per week, an increase of 5.5m tests per week,” the agency stated, adding booking slots for PCR tests will also increase. However, while the UKHSA said they are working to “secure a further hundreds of millions of lateral flow tests and an increase in PCR laboratory testing capacity of up to 150,000 tests per day” others have warned the system will not hold up against Omicron. Dr Jeffrey Barrett, who is leading the Covid-19 genomics initiative at the Sanger Institute, tweeted that testing capacity will almost certainly fail to keep up with the variant. “Even with best efforts we can scale supply linearly, but demand will grow exponentially. This will happen everywhere at [almost] the same time, so global supply chains of reagents, plastics, etc will struggle,” he wrote. A retired court of appeal judge and crossbench life peer has been announced as the chair of the UK’s public inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic, PA Media reports. Baroness Heather Hallett, who previously acted as coroner at the inquests into the deaths of the victims of the 7/7 bombings, will lead the investigation due to begin next year, Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday. He said she will bring “a wealth of experience to the role and I know shares my determination that the inquiry examines in a forensic and thoroughgoing way the government’s response to the pandemic”. The campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice welcomed Lady Hallett’s appointment, but said it comes “far too late”. Co-founder of the group Matt Fowler said: Whilst this news is very welcome, unfortunately it comes far too late. We’ve been calling for an inquiry since the end of the first wave, and we will never know how many lives could have been saved had the government had a rapid review phase in summer 2020. With the Omicron variant upon us, the inquiry really cannot come soon enough. This is a one-off, historic opportunity to learn lessons to protect lives across the country. We cannot afford to get it wrong and we look forward to working closely with Baroness Hallett to make it a success. Baroness Hallett said: I am honoured to be appointed to chair the Covid-19 inquiry. The pandemic has affected us all, some much worse than others. I am acutely conscious of the suffering it has caused to so many. In the new year I shall be seeking views from those who have lost loved ones and all other affected groups about the inquiry’s terms of reference. I want to assure the British public that once the terms of reference are finalised, I shall do my utmost to ensure the inquiry answers as many questions as possible about the UK’s response to the pandemic so that we can all learn lessons for the future. For more updates from the UK, here is my colleague Andrew Sparrow’s Covid live blog: Canada will advise citizens on Wednesday to avoid non-essential international travel to help reduce the threat from the Omicron variant, a government source has told Reuters. The source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, did not give more details. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke with the premiers of the 10 provinces on Tuesday to discuss ways of countering Omicron, which is spreading rapidly. A statement from Trudeau’s office said those on the call noted “the potential for a rapid and strong resurgence of Covid-19 cases in Canada that could put a strain on our health-care systems”. Canada initially advised people not to travel abroad unless necessary in March 2020 but in late October this year withdrew the notice, citing the success of national vaccination efforts. More than two-thirds of community pharmacies in England that offered to help deliver Covid booster jabs are still waiting for permission or have been refused, ministers have admitted, with some chemists having to wait 11 weeks. The Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, uncovered the low approval rate and long delays through a written parliamentary question answered by the vaccines minister, Maggie Throup. The failure to give the green light to more pharmacies to become vaccination sites has raised questions about the NHS’s ability to deliver the 1m boosters a day that Boris Johnson has pledged. Fewer GPs are involved in the programme now than when first and second doses were given. Throup said that by the end of September, 4,733 pharmacies had between them submitted 5,376 expressions of interest to deliver Covid jabs, but only 1,454 had been accepted – a 30.7% approval rate. Some applications were decided by NHS England rather than the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Cooper said the delays were “shocking” and urged NHS England to speed up its decision-making to help the health service administer as many top-ups shots as possible. The Omicron variant is spreading rapidly and is forecast to be causing 1m infections a day by New Year’s Eve. Here is the full story: 70% of English pharmacies who want to give booster jabs not yet given go-ahead Boris Johnson’s cabinet has been told that rising Covid-19 infections as a result of Omicron are likely to mean staff shortages across industries and sectors in the UK, similar to the “pingdemic” that was set off by millions self-isolating over the summer. Schools and healthcare setting are also likely to face a significant challenge. Here’s a look at each sector from the Guardian’s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot. Ukraine’s government will extend Covid restrictions for another three months, to 31 March from the end of December, because of low levels of vaccination, the prime minister Denys Shmyhal said on Wednesday. “Until the level of vaccination in Ukraine reaches 70% of the population, we must adhere to all imposed restrictions,” Shmyhal said at a televised government meeting. According to Ukrainian health ministry data, 12.6 million people have received two shots of Covid vaccines out of a population of 41 million, while 3.6 million cases of infection and about 92,000 deaths have been registered. Google has told its US staff they must be vaccinated against Covid by the middle of January or face serious repercussions including a pay cut and ultimately the loss of their job. Employees were told they were required to have declared their vaccination status and uploaded proof of it, or to have applied for a medical or religious exemption, by 3 December, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC, which first reported the story. After that date, Google said, it would start to contact workers who were unvaccinated or had not uploaded proof of vaccination, or whose exemption requests had not been approved. According to the memo, employees who missed a deadline of 18 January to comply with the rules would initially be placed on “paid administrative leave” for 30 days, followed by six months of “unpaid personal leave”. In the final step, Google would terminate the person’s employment. Google is one of several large US employers to have adopted a “no jab, no job” policy for their workforce, although it appears to have gone a step further than some other firms. Google declined a request to comment. It had already informed its US workforce that they would need to be vaccinated to return to its corporate buildings. The chief executive, Sundar Pichai, told staff in a memo in July that the policy would initially be implemented in the US before being adopted globally. Vaccination has also been made a requirement by other US tech companies including Uber and Facebook. Read more: Google tells US staff to get vaccinated or face losing job The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has cut short his trip to south-east Asia due to a Covid case among his travelling party, a state department official said on Wednesday. The decision was made to mitigate the Covid risk and prioritise health and safety, and Blinken had expressed by phone his deep regret to the foreign minister of Thailand, where he was due to attend meetings on Thursday, state department spokesperson Ned Price said. The positive case was confirmed on Wednesday while Blinken was in Malaysia. He was in Indonesia the previous two days. [see 9.44am.]. Italy will tighten restrictions for arrivals from the rest of the EU from Thursday, requiring coronavirus tests of everyone and a five-day quarantine for those who are not vaccinated, AFP reports. Previously, EU arrivals had to show proof of vaccination, recent recovery or a negative test. The decree signed by the health minister, Roberto Speranza, late on Tuesday “provides for the obligation of a negative test on departure for all arrivals from European Union countries”, a spokesperson said. “For the unvaccinated, in addition to the negative test, a five-day quarantine is planned.” Unvaccinated people arriving from outside the bloc must already quarantine, and tests are required of those with jabs. The new measures, valid from 16 December to 31 January, come as Europe battles a fresh wave of coronavirus infections as winter settles in and the Omicron variant takes hold. Early data suggests two vaccine doses may not offer as much protection against Omicron and is more transmissible than the Delta variant, which currently accounts for the bulk of the world’s Covid cases. Italy was the first EU country to experience a major outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020. In recent months, it has sought to control infections through the use of health passes showing proof of vaccination, recent recovery from Covid or a negative test for everything from going to work to eating in restaurants. European Commission spokesperson Christian Wigand said they had not yet been notified of Italy’s new temporary restrictions, despite what he said was the obligation of member states to inform the Commission 48 hours in advance. “Additional restrictions on certificate holders are only possible where this may be necessary and proportionate to safeguard public health in response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Wigand said. “It remains crucial to ensure the proportionality of any measures taken”. More than 20,000 new cases were reported in Italy on Tuesday, and another 120 deaths. Kenya has detected its first three cases of the Omicron variant, the country’s health minister said on Wednesday. “We have at least three cases so far, and have a lot of other samples that we are sequencing,” said Mutahi Kagwe. He said Omicron was detected among travellers – two Kenyan and one South African – at airports, but did not specify when and where in Kenya the cases were detected. Kagwe said those hospitalised with Covid in Kenya were still suffering from the Delta variant, but cases of Omicron were expected to quickly rise. “It is just a matter of time before Omicron becomes the dominant variant,” he told reporters in Mombasa. The east African country has seen a surge in Covid infections in recent days after a lull lasting several months. On Tuesday, the health ministry said the number of tests returning positive results stood at 11.5% – a roughly ten-fold rise on a week earlier. Kagwe ruled out taking “knee-jerk reactions” in response to the Omicron detection, saying any measures taken would be based on science. “From where we sit, variants will come and variants will go...the decisions we make as a government in order to protect our people must also be measured and calculated,” he said. The WHO warned Tuesday that the variant was spreading at an unprecedented rate and urged countries to act swiftly to rein in transmission and protect their health systems. Since the variant was first detected last month, it has been reported in 77 countries, according to the WHO. Early data suggests it can be resistant to vaccines and is more transmissible than the Delta variant, which accounts for the bulk of the world’s coronavirus cases. Kenya has fully vaccinated only 3.27 million people, or 12% of the adult population, according to official figures. The government hoped to vaccinate 10 million people by Christmas, and 27 million by the end of 2022. This week, the high court in Nairobi struck down a government order to prevent unvaccinated Kenyans from accessing services and entering public places such as national parks, bars and restaurants. In total, the country has recorded 256,815 infection, of which 5,349 have been fatal. Poland brought in new restrictions on the numbers of people allowed in restaurants, hotels and theatres on Wednesday, as the daily Covid death toll hit its highest level since April [see 10.10am.], AFP reports. The new limits of 30% of maximum capacity don’t apply for people who have been vaccinated, putting the onus for checking vaccination status on business owners. Legislation allowing employers to verify whether employees have been vaccinated or had a recent test showing they do not have Covid is also making its way through parliament. The health ministry on Wednesday reported 660 Covid deaths in Poland in the last 24 hours – the highest daily tally since April. “The overwhelming majority are unvaccinated people,” government spokesman Piotr Muller told private broadcaster Radio Zet. “The only scientific solutions that are known at the moment are to vaccinate and react quickly when you get sick,” he said. The health ministry has said it would also like to introduce mandatory vaccination for health workers, teachers and the military from 1 March but the cabinet is divided on the issue. Also from Wednesday, people flying into Poland from outside the EU’s free travel Schengen area must have proof of a negative test taken no earlier than 24 hours before crossing the border. Among other measures, schools will switch to remote learning for a few days on either side of the Christmas holidays, meaning that children will be out of school from 20 December to 9 January. Nightclubs will also have to close, except for New Year’s parties. Poland’s rightwing populist government has so far been very cautious about following other European countries in embracing vaccine certificates and mandatory vaccinations. Vaccination hesitancy is still very high in Poland, a country of 38 million people where only around 54% of the population is fully vaccinated – one of the lowest levels in the EU. Most of the opposition is calling on the government to impose tougher restrictions and the Left party has presented proposals for obligatory vaccinations for all adults in Poland. Some clinically vulnerable patients say their third Covid vaccine dose has been wrongly recorded as a booster jab, resulting in them being turned away, writes Dr Frances Ryan in her column this week. Here is an extract: Most worryingly, large numbers of clinically vulnerable people are missing out on their booster. Take those whose health or age means they are unable to leave the house to go to a vaccine centre. Nearly two-thirds of housebound people are yet to receive their booster after many already stretched GPs opted out of delivering top-up jabs. That translates as about 300,000 of the most clinically vulnerable people in the country having not yet received their extra protection. In March, I reported how some people who were housebound were missing out on the first and second vaccines, and in an all too predictable tragedy it is happening again. I spoke to the family of an 81-year-old woman this week who missed out on her Covid jabs last year because she was unable to leave her home and her GP “didn’t have her down as housebound on the system”. After developing bedsores, she was admitted to hospital and caught Covid while there. Unvaccinated, she died soon after. “Covid safety measures meant we had to have a funeral with no wake and the whole thing was just horrific,” her granddaughter told me. “My step-grandad sat there and cried and said, ‘I just want to kiss her goodbye.’” Elsewhere, immunocompromised patients report they are now missing out on additional doses of vaccines after confusion over who is eligible for a third dose followed by a booster jab. Some patients say their third dose has been wrongly recorded on their medical records as a booster jab, resulting in them being turned away. One woman with lupus, who has to take multiple medications to suppress her immune system, told me she’s due her booster this week – but her GP can’t give it to her because the system didn’t record her third dose correctly. “My GP is amazing – if she could find a way to give it to me she would – but the system just won’t allow it.” Or consider vulnerable infants, who have not even had their first vaccine dose. Leading scientists this week called for the vaccination of young children in a bid to tackle the new variant and keep schools open, with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said to be currently reviewing data on Covid jabs for children over five as a “matter of urgency”. Remarkably, however, there has been no word on the need to specifically protect children with disabilities. Unlike other nations, such as the US, where vaccines have already been rolled out to children as young as five with no underlying health condition, in the UK a vaccine has still not been approved for under-12s – even if a child is extremely vulnerable. Read the full column here: Booster jabs are vital – why is it so difficult for clinically vulnerable people to access them? Omicron will likely be the dominant Covid variant in Ireland by next week, the deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said, after it rose to accounting for 14% of cases from just 1% a week ago. Varadkar told the Newstalk Radio station that he expected the country’s health chiefs to recommend a tightening of Covid restrictions on Thursday around the managing of close contacts, decreasing social mixing and on international travel. The government also plans to increase the number of booster doses administered to 1.75 million by Christmas and possibly 2 million by year-end, Varadkar said, up from a previous target of 1.5 million. Almost 1.3 million of Ireland’s 5 million population has received a booster jab to date. Japan’s health ministry said its panel of experts had agreed Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 vaccines could be used for booster shots, setting the stage for official government approval. Japan started administering booster shots this month with Pfizer Inc vaccines. The panel agreed on Wednesday that Moderna vaccines could be used on those aged 18 or older for booster shots, the ministry said. The same age restriction is being applied to Pfizer vaccines for booster shots. Good morning from London. I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next eight hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share! Your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has warned that Omicron could become dominant in Europe by mid-January. But she insisted that the 27 nations have sufficient vaccines to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Poland’s daily Covid death toll has hit a fourth wave record as 660 more people died with the virus and 24,000 new cases were reported. It comes as the country tries to battle high infection rates with tighter restrictions. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that preliminary evidence indicates that Covid vaccines may be less effective against infection and transmission of the more infectious Omicron variant. In its weekly epidemiological update, the WHO said more data is needed to better understand the extent to which Omicron may evade immunity from vaccines or previous infection. A journalist accompanying US secretary of state Antony Blinken on a trip to the UK and south-east Asia has tested positive for Covid. A spokesperson for the state department, Ned Price, said one of 12 members of the travelling press corps on Blinken’s trip tested positive on Wednesday in Malaysia. EU countries including Greece, Italy, Spain and Hungary have started vaccinating five- to 11-year-olds. The vaccination campaign expansion comes after the EU regulator last month approved a reduced-dose vaccine by Pfizer-BioNTech. German chancellor Olaf Scholz today promised that the country “we will win the fight against this pandemic” in his first major address to parliament. He urged Germans to get vaccinated, telling them it is the only way out of the Covid crisis. German police have searched several locations in the eastern state of Saxony as part of an investigation into what they said was a plot by anti-vaccination activists to murder the state’s leader, Michael Kretschmer. A UK government adviser, Prof Adam Finn, has warned that the latest Covid wave is moving “faster than ever” amid warnings that Omicron infections could reach 1m a day by the end of December. The UK transport secretary has said that “with some confidence” people in the UK will be able to enjoy Christmas, despite soaring Omicron cases, and claimed the country is in a “much better position” than last year. Grant Shapps told Sky News that ministers “want people to enjoy Christmas this year”, adding: “We want people to be sensible but to enjoy their Christmas.” That’s it from me for today. Handing over now to my colleague Lucy Campbell. Thanks for reading. The UK’s independent NHS Race and Health Observatory has today announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office of Minority Health and Health Equity (CDC) to improve long standing ethnic health inequalities. The organisations, based in London and Atlanta, Georgia, will join efforts from January 2022. Dr Habib Naqvi, Director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, said: As we face the developing emergence of the Omicron variant globally, this is a pivotal time to seal our commitment to address long-standing ethnic health inequalities as well as being responsive to immediate health challenges, working with our US counterpart. We are thrilled to have this landmark exchange framework in place which will allow us to collaborate with CDC in improving the future health prospects and outcomes for our respective Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and patients. It is an important step in cultivating collaborative learning for tackling ethnic health inequalities across the globe. The European Union’s drug regulator has recommended that a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine may be given to adults at least two months after a first dose. A booster dose of the vaccine may also be given after two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna’s vaccines, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded, reports Reuters. How do young children cope with Covid anxiety? Sally Weale reports: European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has warned that Omicron could become dominant in Europe by mid-January. But she insisted that the 27 nations have sufficient vaccines to fight the coronavirus pandemic, reports AFP. “If you look at the time it takes for new cases to double in number, it seems to be doubling every two or three days. And that’s massive. We’re told that by mid-January, we should expect Omicron to be the new dominant variant in Europe,” she told the European Parliament, citing scientific data. “But over the last year, we’ve worked hard and we’ve achieved a great deal and that is why Europe is in a better position now to fight the virus.” She said there were “enough vaccines doses for every European” as EU countries try to speed up booster rollouts to stop the spread of the new variant. “We’re now in a position to produce 300m doses of the vaccine per month here in Europe,” von der Leyen said. To date, 66.6% of the EU population have had two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and 62 million had received a third booster jab, she said, adding that the priority now is to increase vaccination rates, including among children, and overcome scepticism. It comes after the World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday said that Omicron was spreading at an unprecedented rate and was “probably” in most countries. Poland’s daily Covid death toll has hit a fourth wave record as 660 more people died with the virus and 24,000 new cases were reported. It comes as the country tries to battle high infection rates with tighter restrictions, reports Reuters. “This is the effect of these last weeks, when the number of cases has accumulated. They are mainly unvaccinated people,” a government spokesman, Piotr Muller, told private broadcaster Radio Zet. Poland’s highest daily death toll of the pandemic was recorded in April when 954 people died. The country brought in new restrictions today – including on capacity limits for public spaces and closing nightclubs – in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading. “There is no doubt that Omicron is already in Poland … Within the EU, we have free movement of people, so it is obvious that this mutation should be in Poland,” Muller said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that preliminary evidence indicates that Covid vaccines may be less effective against infection and transmission of the more infectious Omicron variant. In its weekly epidemiological update, the WHO said more data is needed to better understand the extent to which Omicron may evade immunity from vaccines or previous infection, reports Reuters. “As a result of this, the overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high,” the WHO said. A journalist accompanying US secretary of state Antony Blinken on a trip to the UK and southeast Asia has testing positive for Covid. A spokesperson for the state department, Ned Price, said one of 12 members of the travelling press corps on Blinken’s trip tested positive on Wednesday in Malaysia, reports the Associated Press. He said that neither Blinken, any of his senior staff or other members of the press corps have tested positive. Blinken arrived in Kuala Lumpur late last night from Jakarta, Indonesia and is due to arrive in Bangkok, Thailand later today. The first stop of his trip was in Liverpool, England, where he took part in a G7 summit over the weekend. EU countries including Greece, Italy, Spain and Hungary have started vaccinating five- to 11-year-olds, reports the Associated Press. The vaccination campaign expansion comes after the EU regulator last month approved a reduced-dose vaccine by Pfizer-BioNTech. A children’s hospital in Athens started administering jabs early on Wednesday – hours after Greece reported 130 Covid deaths, its highest daily death toll since the start of the pandemic. More than 30,000 vaccination appointments for children aged under 12 have been booked. Greek education minister Niki Kerameus said: I won’t hide the fact that on a personal level after having talked with doctors and receiving scientific data, our family decided to vaccinate our son who is five-and-a-half years old. The UK Covid blog with Andrew Sparrow is now up and running: This blog will continue with global Covid news. The Scottish government has appointed a chair and published the terms of reference for the country’s public inquiry into the handling of coronavirus. In a statement to parliament, deputy first minister John Swinney confirmed that the Hon Lady Poole QC, senator of the College of Justice of Scotland, will chair the inquiry. He also published the inquiry’s terms of reference including 12 areas of investigation for the inquiry, which will span 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. Swinney said: From my own and the first minister’s interactions with Lady Poole, I am in no doubt that she has the necessary leadership skills, integrity and deep technical knowledge to undertake this inquiry. Her expertise in administrative and human rights law is exactly in line with our expectations of a human rights-based approach to the inquiry. We are committed to working with the UK government to develop the approach to the UK-wide inquiry and expect the chair of the Scottish public inquiry to coordinate with the chair of the UK-wide inquiry. Poole said: I am honoured to chair this independent public inquiry examining the strategic response to the Covid-19 pandemic in Scotland … The inquiry will work independently to establish the facts in an open and transparent way in order to determine what lessons can be learned for the future. There is a great deal to be done in a short space of time. I will continue to give considerable thought as to how best to conduct the inquiry to ensure it fully achieves its aims, including a careful and thorough examination of the terms of reference. German chancellor Olaf Scholz today promised that the country “we will win the fight against this pandemic” in his first major address to parliament. He urged Germans to get vaccinated, telling them it is the only way out of the Covid crisis. “I tell citizens of our country, ‘yes it will get better, yes we will win the fight against this pandemic with the biggest determination, and yes we will win this fight, we will overcome the crisis.” He said there were “no red lines” for his government in tackling the pandemic’s fourth wave, which experts say is predominantly driven by high numbers of unvaccinated people. Soaring Covid cases could cause major shortages across industry, hospitality and healthcare in the UK, ministers have been told, as rail companies cancelled services and Royal Mail said it was experiencing high staff absences. UK transport secretary Grant Shapps has denied that Boris Johnson’s authority has been undermined by last night’s Conservative rebellion over Covid passes. He told LBC: In terms of his authority, I saw the prime minister on Sunday night asking the country to get the booster jab and yesterday walked past huge queues around the block of people responding to the prime minister’s plea. Having been the person to get this country first of all jabbed ahead of every other major economy and now booster jabbed ahead of every other country, comes down personally to the authority of the prime minister. A UK coronavirus expert has said the virus is so widespread in London that those with cold symptoms are more likely to have Covid than a cold. Prof Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, who runs the Zoe Covid symptom app, told the BBC’s Today programme: In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, it’s far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold. We’re seeing doubling in the numbers equivalent to what’s being seen elsewhere, every two-and-a-half days, and that really means numbers are going up. If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we’ve seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant variant already. We’ll be at 100% very soon, so that’s happened in just a matter of days – that’s is why so many people are going down with infections. The UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said that parliament will be recalled if further Covid restrictions are required during the Christmas recess. “We have got in place now the measures that we believe will see us through to the new year,” he told BBC Breakfast. “If we did need to do anything else, parliament would be recalled too in order to vote on doing that, so it won’t just be an automated thing. We want people to be able enjoy Christmas this year. We are definitely in a better position than we were last year.” German police have searched several locations in the eastern state of Saxony as part of an investigation into what they said was a plot by anti-vaccination activists to murder the state’s leader, Michael Kretschmer. Reuters reports that searches in the city of Dresden targeted individual members of a group on the messaging service Telegram, where plans for the killing were discussed in connection with the state government’s coronavirus curbs, police said. The group Dresden Offlinevernetzung, or Dresden offline networking, came to the attention of authorities after an investigation published last week by the broadcaster ZDF. A UK government adviser has warned that the latest Covid wave is moving “faster than ever” amid warnings that Omicron infections could reach 1m a day by the end of December. Prof Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol and a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), told BBC Breakfast: The wave is coming very fast and in fact alarmingly fast – if anything faster than ever. So it really is a race at the moment. The more immunity that we’ve all got the less of a problem this is going to be but I’m afraid it is going to be a serious problem either way. He said boosters take effect quickly – expected to reach full protection after two weeks and partial protection after a week. It does come through very fast because you’ve got immunological memory, you’ve seen the antigen before from your previous doses, so the level of protection goes up pretty quick. We generally look for the level of protection around two weeks, because that’s probably when you get to pretty much maximum levels, but already at a week your antibody levels will be much higher than they were before you had the booster. So it does get going pretty quick. As people across the UK rush to get their Covid booster doses, Sky News reports that people have been queuing in Ealing from 6.15am today. The UK transport secretary has said that “with some confidence” people in the UK will be able to enjoy Christmas, despite soaring Omicron cases, and claimed the country is in a “much better position” than last year. Grant Shapps told Sky News that ministers “want people to enjoy Christmas this year”, adding: “We want people to be sensible but to enjoy their Christmas.” He said problems with lateral flow tests on the NHS website are a distribution issue, saying: “There’s plenty of supply in the country.” England, he said, would not be following in the footsteps of Scotland, which is advising people to limit socialising to three households before Christmas. He said the number of people hospitalised by Omicron is still 10 and that around 9,000 people have tested positive for the variant. Shapps said Shaun Bailey, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, did the “right thing” to resign after a photograph emerged of him at a “raucous” party during lockdown last year. Hi, I’m looking after the global Covid blog for the next few hours. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@guardian.co.uk Pfizer and BioNtech are set to displace AstraZeneca as the main suppliers of Covid-19 vaccines to the global Covax programme at the start of 2022, Reuters reports. The expected change comes with headaches for receiving countries that lack sufficient cold storage capacity to handle the Pfizer vaccine, and amid risks of a shortage of syringes needed to administer that shot. AstraZeneca is currently the most distributed vaccine by Covax, according to data from Gavi, the vaccine alliance that co-manages the programme with the World Health Organization (WHO). The programme has so far delivered more than 600m shots to nearly 150 countries, of which more than 220m are AstraZeneca’s and about 160m Pfizer’s. But in the first quarter of next year Pfizer is set to take over, according to Gavi and WHO figures on doses assigned by the Covax programme for future supplies. Soaring Covid cases could cause major shortages across industry, hospitality and healthcare, UK ministers have been told, as rail companies cancelled services and Royal Mail said it was experiencing high staff absences. According to cabinet sources, Boris Johnson and England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said at a briefing that rising cases would be likely to affect businesses with mass worker absences. Whitty also told ministers to expect a “significant increase” in hospital admissions. West End shows have been cancelled because of the surge in suspected Omicron cases, while waste collections, deliveries and schools are all under threat from shortages. No 10 emphasised there had not been “any discussion or any warning about hospitals or clinical settings having to close as a result of this variant”. Read the full story here. Hello and thanks for following along. If you’ve just joined here’s a quick snapshot of the main developments so far. All adults in England must now show a Covid pass detailing proof of double-vaccination or a negative PCR or lateral flow test result within the last 48 hours in order to enter nightclubs and other large events. The new measures come into force today and apply to nightclubs, indoor unseated venues with a capacity of more than 500 people, unseated outdoor venues that hold more than 4,000 people, and any venue with more than 10,000 people. A warning from the World Health Organization (WHO) cautioned that the Omicron variant is spreading at an unprecedented rate. “The reality is that Omicron is probably in most countries even if it hasn’t been detected yet,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday. “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,” he added. Heres a rundown of everything you might have missed: Almost 100 Conservative lawmakers voted against new coronavirus restrictions, dealing a major blow to British prime minister Boris Johnson’s authority and raising questions about his leadership. Australia reopened borders to vaccinated skilled migrants and foreign students after a near two-year ban on entry. New Zealand has fully vaccinated 90% of its eligible population, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced. Auckland also reopened its border. Italy extended a Covid-19 state of emergency to March 31 and ruled that all visitors from EU countries must take a test before departure. South Korea reported its highest daily total of cases, as breakthrough infections among those already vaccinated continue to spike. Cambodia detected its first case of the Omicron variant in a local woman who had travelled from Ghana. The Philippines also detected two imported cases of Omicron. Rwanda confirmed six cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the health ministry said. Low vaccination rates in regions including Africa – where Omicron was first detected and which has recorded a massive rise in cases over the past week – would provide breeding grounds for new variants, the World Health Organization warned. Africa is experiencing its fastest surge in cases this year, with the number up 83% in the past week, although deaths remain low, the WHO said. Canada is expected to toughen restrictions on international travel with new measures to be announced on Wednesday, CBC News reported. Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine has been less effective in South Africa at keeping infected people out of hospital since the Omicron variant emerged last month, a study showed. All three US-authorised vaccines appear to be significantly less protective against Omicron in laboratory testing, but a booster dose likely restores most of the protection, a study showed. Pfizer’s antiviral Covid-19 pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against Omicron. The US surpassed 50 million coronavirus cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The Philippines has detected two imported cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant of concern, its first reported cases, the Department of Health said on Wednesday. The two Omicron variant cases, detected from 48 samples sequenced on 14 December were currently isolated in a quarantine facility, the department said in a statement. The news comes as an incoming typhoon has forced the Philippines to delay Covid-19 vaccinations of millions of people living in the path of the storm, as authorities hastened preparations in anticipation of its arrival this week. New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced the country has fully vaccinated 90% of its eligible population. In her final speech to Parliament for the year, Ardern said: “That 90% puts us above the United States, the UK, Israel...we are now finishing with a rate much higher than them.” “And we have not finished. In Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland), we are seeing some [District Health Boards] reach 97%, so let’s keep going.” Ardern concluded her speech by thanking New Zealanders for putting in the hard work to get through the Covid-19 outbreak. “It’s been hard, people have been weary, but Kiwis have done what it takes to put us in the best possible place for us to keep moving...and I for one will never underestimate New Zealanders. So to everyone, I wish you a wonderful break, you bloody deserve it.” California is exempting San Francisco from a rule that takes effect on Wednesday requiring all people to wear masks indoors in a bid to contain a troubling rise in new coronavirus cases, the Associated Press reports. San Francisco will continue to allow fully vaccinated people to remove their masks in gyms and workplaces while its overall masking mandate remains in effect, the city Department of Public Health announced. “It’s a recognition of all of the thought and care that San Francisco residents have been putting into staying as safe as possible,” said Dr Susan Philip, San Francisco’s health officer. About 86% of eligible San Francisco residents have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the public health department. Rwanda has just confirmed six cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the health ministry said, pushing for authorities in the small East African nation to urge people to get vaccinated. “All arriving passengers must quarantine for three days at a designated hotel at their own cost,” the cabinet of ministers said in a resolution on Tuesday, adding that it had suspended night club operations and live band entertainment elsewhere. A member of United States secretary of state Antony Blinken’s travelling press pool has tested positive for Covid-19 on arrival in Kuala Lumpur and is isolating, a state department spokesperson said. Secretary Blinken and his senior staff were also tested upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur and were all tested negative, Reuters reports. The Chinese vaccine Sinovac, which has been administered to millions of people around the world, does not provide enough antibodies to neutralise the Omicron variant, according to researchers in Hong Kong. In a sample of 25 people, initial findings revealed that none of them showed sufficient antibodies in their blood serum to take out the threat of the Omicron variant, researchers at the University of Hong Kong said on Tuesday night, Bloomberg reported. Out of another group of 25 people double-dosed with the Pfizer jab, Inc. and BioNTech SE, five had neutralising ability against the new variant, the scientists said. Do Covid vaccine mandates work? In Australia, where employment-related mandates on the coronavirus vaccine were introduced months ago, the stories of two women demonstrate how such measures can work – and how they can backfire. The Guardian’s science correspondent, Nicola Davis, explains that vaccine mandates are nothing new: governments around the world have long imposed vaccination requirements in different areas of life. Such policies can be effective – but health officials must be prepared to confront misinformation and public mistrust. Listen to the latest Today in Focus podcast here. South Korea will clamp down on social gatherings and cut the hours of some businesses to fight a record-breaking surge of the coronavirus that has led to a spike in hospitalisations and deaths. Prime minster Kim Boo-kyum confirmed the government’s intent to restore stricter social distancing measures during a meeting on Wednesday as the country set another new one-day record in infections with 7,850 cases, the fourth time this month the daily tally exceeded 7,000. The country’s death toll is now 4,456 after 70 virus patients died in the past 24 hours, while a record 964 patients were in critical or serious condition. Officials previously said the country’s medical system could buckle if the number of serious cases topped 1,000 because it would greatly hamper hospitals’ ability to respond not only to Covid-19 but also to other medical conditions. Kim Boo-kyum said: The government sees the current virus situation as serious and plans to enforce stronger social distancing measures. We are considering measures that include further reducing the size of allowable social gatherings and imposing business-hour restrictions, and these steps will be confirmed and announced soon.” A third booster Covid-19 vaccine dose will be essential to get high protection against symptoms from the Omicron variant and it appears likely the variant will become the dominant strain in Australia, virologists from the Kirby Institute say. The new data from the Kirby Institute comes as Covid-19 case numbers in New South Wales jumped again on Wednesday to 1,360, 25 of them are the Omicron variant. There are now 89 Omicron cases in NSW. The researchers also said Covid boosters may be required every six months to protect against the variant. Virologists from the Kirby Institute presented new data on Wednesday after growing the Omicron variant in a laboratory and testing how it responded to various samples, including from the fully vaccinated, from those who had recovered from the virus but were unvaccinated, and those who had recovered from the virus and also received two vaccine doses. Read the full story here. There were tears of joy, long embraces and sighs of relief, as thousands of New Zealanders boarded flights or hit the road on Wednesday, in what was, for many, the first reunion with friends and family in four months. The wider Auckland region was closed off in August as the city tried to contain an outbreak of Covid-19. In November, the government announced it would relax the border from 15 December to allow people to travel, due to the eligible population nearing the 90% double-vaccination rate. At midnight, the road checkpoints at the edge of the city were removed, and the queues of cars, some with boats and trailers attached, were given the green light to move. On Wednesday morning, airport terminals around the country buzzed with Aucklanders eager to leave and reunite with loved ones. About 12,000 people were expected to fly out of Auckland on Wednesday. It will mark the beginning of a 4000% increase in movement through the airport over the summer period, the airport said. Read the full story from our reporter in New Zealand, Eva Corlett, here. Cambodia has just detected the country’s first case of the Omicron variant in a local woman who had travelled from Ghana. The 23-year old woman had returned from Ghana via Dubai and Bangkok, the ministry of health said in a statement issued on Tuesday. The woman, who was 15 weeks pregnant, had been admitted to hospital for treatment, it said. Low vaccination rates in regions including Africa - where Omicron was first detected and which has recorded a massive rise in cases over the past week - would provide breeding grounds for new variants, the World Health Organization has warned. WHO estimated it will take Africa until May 2022 to have 40% vaccination coverage and until August 2024 to reach 70% as countries with plentiful vaccine supplies raced to administer third doses to beat Omicron. Although Africa has recorded a massive rise in cases over the past week, the region is reporting a lower number of deaths compared with previous waves. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the Omicron variant is spreading at an unprecedented rate and had “probably” spread to most nations undetected. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday: The reality is that Omicron is probably in most countries even if it hasn’t been detected yet. Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant.” The WHO urged countries to act swiftly to rein in transmission and protect their health systems and warned against complacency. WHO expert Bruce Aylward strenuously warned against “jumping to a conclusion that this is a mild disease”. “We could be setting ourselves up for a very dangerous situation,” he added. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you as we go through all the latest coronavirus developments. Let’s start with the news that the United States has just surpassed 800,000 coronavirus-related deaths, according to recently updated data from Johns Hopkins University. The grim milestone means the country now has the highest number of reported total Covid-19 deaths in the world, followed by Brazil and India. On Monday, the US reached 50m confirmed cases of Covid-19. Covid deaths this year were mostly in unvaccinated patients and may have been preventable, health experts say. Roughly 60% of the US population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, CDC data shows. A warning from the World Health Organization (WHO) has also cautioned that the Omicron variant is spreading at an unprecedented rate. “The reality is that Omicron is probably in most countries even if it hasn’t been detected yet,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday. “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,” he added. The WHO also noted that low vaccination rates in regions including Africa - where Omicron was first detected and which has recorded a massive rise in cases over the past week - would provide breeding grounds for new variants. Here is a snapshot of all the key Covid developments: The US surpassed 50 million coronavirus cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The UK has recorded another 59,610 Covid cases, the highest figure since early January. A further 633 confirmed Omicron cases were reported, taking the total to 5,346, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). In England, MPs have backed Covid passes being required at nightclubs and large venues as dozens of Tories rebelled against the government’s ‘plan B’ winter Covid measures. Germany will exempt people who have had a booster jab from having to take a Covid test before entering some leisure facilities, federal and regional health ministers agreed on Tuesday. Italy has extended a Covid-19 state of emergency to 31 March. Denmark and Norway announced stricter Covid measures to battle soaring infection numbers. Austria is likely to recommend Covid booster shots for children aged 12 and over once four months have passed since their second vaccine dose, putting the country ahead of most European countries in terms of vaccinating children. Moderna’s chief medical officer, Dr Paul Burton, said Omicron “poses a real threat” and cautioned against claims it causes milder disease, warning that Omicron and Delta are likely to circulate together for some time. The UK will need a mini-furlough in the event that the Omicron variant forces the government into closing parts of the economy, the International Monetary Fund has said. Pfizer says its antiviral Covid-19 pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the Omicron variant. France detected 130 cases of the Omicron variant but so far has no plans to impose new restrictions. South Korea marked its deadliest day since the start of the pandemic. Israel’s prime minister Naftali Bennett is in quarantine after catching a flight with someone who tested positive for Covid. Billie Eilish revealed that she had Covid-19 in August, and said that she felt sure she “would have died” had she not been vaccinated. China’s economically important Zhejiang province is battling a Covid outbreak that has left half a million people quarantined and some districts under business shutdown. The US air force discharged 27 people for refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate. Mainland China detected its second imported case of the Omicron variant, this time in its southern Guangdong province, following reports of the first case in the northern city of Tianjin on Monday. Africa is experiencing its fastest surge in Covid cases this year, with the number up 83% in the past week, although deaths remain low. High levels of previous exposure to three previous waves of Covid infection in South Africa may explain the relatively low levels of hospitalisation and severe disease in the current outbreak of the Omicron variant, rather than the variant itself being less virulent."

          "headline": "The hypocrisy of those ‘freedom-loving’ Tory rebels",
          "bodyText": "The Tory rebels spout about slippery slopes, kneejerk emergency measures and “a permanent change to the understanding of what liberty is” (MPs back Covid passes in England amid large Tory rebellion, 14 December). They should read that great libertarian John Stuart Mill: “The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.” It’s pretty clear that being complicit in the spread of Covid-19 to your fellow citizens is likely to do some of them harm, so restrictions on the behaviour of those who wilfully refuse to minimise the risk are not only justified, but are an essential act by any responsible government. Doug Maughan Dunblane, Stirling • I do think it is wrong to characterise rightwing Conservatives as “freedom loving” (Rebellious mood on Tory backbenches puts Boris Johnson on notice, 14 December). True, they like to promote certain limited sorts of freedom – the freedom for people rather like themselves to do what they want without interference from pesky regulations, the freedom to spend their money and manage the economy as they would like, and so on. But there are a lot of freedoms they have little interest in – freedom from want, from squalor, from hunger, from disease, of assembly, of the courts, of movement and to settle in this country. These are instead to be dealt with through firm and strict regulation. Richard Williams Hove, East Sussex • Martha Spurrier (Who will stop human rights abuses if the government puts itself above the law?, 14 December) is absolutely right about this government’s systematic dismantling of our freedoms. That is why the freedom and liberty claims by Tory MPs as the reason for voting against the new Omicron restrictions ring so hollow and mendacious. If they were honest and sincere in their beliefs, they would not be sitting on their hands as this government trashes the Human Rights Act; disenfranchises citizens without a photo ID; criminalises protests; intends to abolish or at least dilute judicial review; removes protection from whistleblowers; and threatens to castrate the Electoral Commission. I wonder, too, how many of them consulted their constituents before making their decision? Michael Newman Shefford, Bedfordshire • I am relieved Labour supported Covid vaccine passes, and other “plan B” measures, in parliament, though a “plan C” is clearly also needed – imminently. The bill passed but, as you report, nearly 100 Tories voted against: that’s a large proportion of the party’s backbenchers. The government now has to rely on Labour to get totally necessary health legislation through the Commons. That’s a damning indictment of the Tory party, and on Boris Johnson’s leadership. Johnson is not leading anyone – not his country, not even his party. Sebastian Monblat Sutton, London • I get why further restrictions might be needed, and why parliament should get to vote on them. But given that the restrictions are going to be about reducing mixing between people, how on earth can it make sense to drag 650 MPs from all over the country to vote in person? Or is our system so archaic that they’d have to vote in person on a decision to allow remote voting? Mark Walford London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication."

          "headline": "Operator seeks changes to Irish lottery after no jackpot win since June",
          "bodyText": "It has been said that even the dead racehorse Shergar has a better chance of winning Ireland’s national lottery than a member of the public. For six months the jackpot has yet to be won, prompting calls for an investigation, a reduction in the number of balls to increase the chances of a win and on Wednesday, a parliamentary inquiry. Now the operators of the Irish national lottery are seeking regulatory approval to end the marathon winnerless rollover period with a “must-be-won draw” to ensure that such a long wait for a jackpot payout cannot be repeated. In the UK’s national lottery, such a draw takes place if no one matches the six numbers in the previous five draws, then the prize money is shared between all other players who match two or more numbers. The change in the Irish approach was sparked by a mounting controversy over the lack of a winner for the top prize since June and the intervention of a veteran politician, whose calls for an investigation have caught the public’s imagination. The changes “seem so remote that punters must be thinking Shergar would have a better chance at winning Squid Game”, said the Fine Gael TD (Irish MP) Bernard Durkan, referring to the racehorse who was kidnapped in 1983 and to the hit Netflix show. “I’m not saying anything odd has happened, but it’s the longest run in the history of the game so we need a bit of reassurance,” he added. The office of the national lottery has said the rollover each week was “unprecedented” but pointed out that the jackpot had been capped at €19m (£16.2m) since September and the extra ticket sale receipts were trickling down to the next tier in prizes. Andrew Algeo, the chief executive of Premier Lotteries Ireland, which runs the operation, said it was “highly unusual” that this jackpot still had no winner. “Given the tickets purchased since early June, the chances are akin to rolling a die 37 times without the number six arising,” he said. The regulator Carol Boate was questioned at length by the Oireachtas (Irish legislature) joint committee on finance, public expenditure and reform and Taoiseach. Asked whether it was the fault of a machine or whether any other lottery had a must-win draw, she told the committee that the draw was determined by a mechanical machine similar to that used in Britain and elsewhere in the world, and explained the UK jackpot rollover system. “It would be a known risk that this could happen,” Boate said of the six-month rollover of the jackpot in Ireland. She added that he did not know why a must-win draw was never introduced when the game was redesigned in 2015 but the November request was the first she knew of. When the Irish national lottery launched in 1988 there were 36 balls. This was changed to 39 in 1992, then 42 in 1994, 45 in 2006 and 47 in 2015. This still compares well to other lotteries including the UK’s which has 59 balls and the EuroMillions lottery in which players choose five balls from a pool of 50 main numbers and two lucky stars from a separate pool of 12 numbers. Boate’s deputy, Derek Donohoe, said the “unprecedented rollover” of the jackpot was happening while the Irish national lottert was “operating in line with the game rules” and insisted he had identified “no regulatory issues”."

          "bodyText": "Sunrise across the Australian desert. Headlights blazing, a silver Mack truck accelerates towards its destination, kicking up a trail of dust in its wake. In the driver’s seat is Jalingbirri, a “blood hunter” – the only one of his kind left standing. For years, Jalingbirri has defended his people against the monsters the first fleet deliberately unleashed. Now he has a date with a vampire king. The truck, driven by an implacable Kelton Pell, sets the tone in the first few minutes of Firebite, Warwick Thornton and Brendan Fletcher’s hotly anticipated TV series for streaming service AMC+. Named for the bite that converts a mortal person into an immortal monster, the show reinvents the vampire genre for the Australian outback. Starring Rob Collins (Total Control, The Drover’s Wife) and Shantae Barnes-Cowan (Total Control, Wyrmwood: Apocalypse), Firebite was born when Thornton learned how members of the first fleet transported vials of smallpox onboard their ships. His anger at that felt consuming, and it was something he wanted Australians to know – except he didn’t want to share it in the style of the “gut-wrenching, important pieces of storytelling” he had become famous for in films such as Sweet Country and Samson &amp; Delilah. “I was a bit tired of making films like that so I turned the 11 vials of smallpox into 11 vampires that the British brought over to wipe us out,” says Thornton, who wears many hats on Firebite, including executive producer, co-creator, director, co-writer and director of photography. The show, fuelled by a team of First Nations creatives, kicks off when the last surviving vampire from the original 11 arrives in the remote mining town of Opal City, where an abandoned warren of mines lie beneath the surface. The 270-year-old vampire king, played by a cold-eyed Callan Mulvey, is determined to expand the only remaining vampire colony and bring the bloodsuckers out from their underground hiding place. Standing between him and his goal is an unlikely duo – Tyson (Collins), a charming yet reckless failed blood hunter, and his 17-year-old adopted daughter Shanika (Barnes-Cowan), a badass who absorbs all Tyson’s lessons on how to capture and kill the “pests” around them. While sequences were shot on location at Coober Pedy in South Australia, Amy Baker, the show’s head of production design, reconstructed the unique area inside Adelaide Studios, creating an elaborate network of tunnels where that distinctive white soil (trucked in from Coober Pedy) crunches under your feet. Coober Pedy’s lifestyle and landscape seemed to Thornton one that would give any vampire a great cover story – “You portray yourself as miner, so you’re down in the mine all day, and then you come up to the pub and you drink all night, and that’s kind of what vampires do. They sleep all day in the mines and then come up and feed all night in the pub.” Baker also created a wall of skulls (note the fangs) inspired by Europe’s catacombs, as well as cave paintings depicting the history of vampires in Australia and a lair with a throne of bones. One room offers unrivalled insight into the world of Firebite. A secret door opens into Jalingbirri’s hidden lair in the Mack truck. Inside, a wall is dominated by the hunter’s collection of weapons, including the chopstick machine gun that spits out lethal little stakes, flashbangs that deliver a blinding dose of “daylight” and an assortment of boomerangs, sharp and perfect for killing vampires. “Boomerangs are an alien concept to many people and I’m really excited that the extended world gets to just see a person who is using one as a warrior in a contemporary context,” Baker says. It’s a reflection of Thornton’s determination to not create another Mad Max or Burning Man-esque production. “We wanted to keep everything grounded in this wacky, fantastic reality,” he says. Opposite the weapons is a wall of missing people – potential “bleeders” being kept alive by vampires to be slowly drained for food. Rather than police posters, Baker chose to use detailed sketches and photographs (cheerfully donated by their sound designer and Thornton’s family) to represent the victims, underscoring that Jalingbirri is working with the communities to find their loved ones. Something, it’s implied, the authorities don’t care enough to do. The whole thing, Baker notes, is “very Warwick”. Unlike Sweet Country, which used no music, on Firebite Thornton opted for a pounding original soundtrack that reunited members of the Australian rock band the Drones along with the Dirty Three drummer, Jim White. “I’ve always loved punk music because it is anger, and anger is energy,” Thornton says. “And there’s a lot of important information coming out of those three-piece bands with long hair. There’s a lot of education about society coming from there as well.” In keeping with the music, “Let’s just wreck it!” became Thornton’s mantra. “The show is about kicking in the door and turning up the edge … It’s just a fun ride.” The emotional heart of the show is the relationship between Tyson and Shanika. The latter is one in a long line of complex female characters created by Thornton, who has a predilection for plotlines that confront and subvert the patriarchy. He thinks it’s the inevitable result of growing up with an “Amazonian” mother and sisters. “It’s subliminal for me, because that’s the way I was taught by powerful women, you know, to respect and love and to disagree and to argue but to be open-minded about all points of view.” Thornton also recognises himself in the character of Tyson. “Dickheads come in every shade and Tyson’s a dickhead, he’s an idiot,” he says, laughing. “There’s a lot of me in Tyson. There’s a lot of my daughters in Shanika … It feels truthful to me – my role is to embarrass my children as much as possible.” Though the series is uniquely Australian, its themes, in particular the impact of colonisation on Indigenous communities, feels universal. Thornton figures someone could do a spin-off in India, Hong Kong or North America and it would work equally well. And though it’s been a crazy year, the film-maker still has more rock’n’roll to give. “I need a couple of weeks to sit in a stall at the pub, and then I’ll be ready to do it again.” Firebite premieres on 16 December on AMC+, the new streaming bundle available via Amazon Prime Video channels and Apple TV channels"

          "bodyText": "SEVEN SHADES OF HELL Last night, soon after Leeds United’s 7-0 evisceration at the hands of Manchester City at the Etihad, an angry caller got in touch with a late-night talkSport show and said it was time for Marcelo Bielsa to leave the club. “He’s got to go, simply, that’s all I’ve got to say on that matter,” said Jack, who had plenty more to say on the matter before nominating his two potential replacements. “There are managers out there,” he said. “I’ll throw a couple of names out there now. I’m a big admirer of Sam Allardyce. Even Steve Bruce, I’d have him in charge.” How quickly they forget, eh? Jack wasn’t alone among a minority of fickle Leeds fans quick to get the radge on over what they saw as the club’s worst performance in living memory … assuming that is they had no recollection of the halcyon days before their return to the Premier League during a 16-year period when they lost 5-0 to Blackpool and 7-3 to Nottingham Forest in front of their own fans. Indeed, nobody seemed more upset by the manner in which they were smithereened at City than their own manager, who looked so utterly crushed at the final whistle it would not have been surprising to see him call up a radio network and demand his own head. While your Allardyces, your Bruces and other potential Bielsa replacements might have blamed the absence of several key players including Kalvin Phillips, Patrick Bamford and Liam Cooper on the emphatic nature of their team’s defeat to an imperious team playing at their very best, Bielsa did not even mention the missing trio as he sought to come to terms with the horrors visited upon his team at the speed of light. A lesser man might also have pointed to the fact that Pep Guardiola’s rampant side were nigh on unplayable as they romped to victory in a truly stunning performance but a sanguine if slightly masochistic Bielsa observed that “it’s not that City played very well, it’s a lot more noticeable how badly we played.” One hopes that, as he torments himself poring over replays on his laptop in his local Wetherby Costa coffee shop, Marcelo might in time concede that for all his team’s shortcomings last night, the reigning champions weren’t actually too bad.

FIVER LETTERS “It’s fitting that Pep Guardiola’s admiration of Marcelo Bielsa was cemented over a BBQ at Bielsa’s house years ago, because Manchester City absolutely roasted Leeds. It turns out that this wasn’t even Bielsa’s worst defeat at the hands of Pep. In La Liga back in 2010, Bielsa’s Almeria were thrashed 8-0 by Guardiola’s Barcelona. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!” – Peter Oh. “Jon Millard is so close (if being incorrect by a factor of 100 times can be called close) on the odds of Brighton being The Talking Point 10 times out of 13 games (yesterday’s Fiver letters). The true probability is 0.035, or 3.5% (not Jon’s 0.035%). Which still seems pretty remote (one in 29 chance). But don’t ignore that there are 20 separate clubs statistical observations going on here. The chances of any one registering a score 10/13 becomes pretty likely then.

          "bodyText": "With that, we’ll end our live coverage for today. Here’s a recap of today’s major news developments: New South Wales announced 1,360 new Covid cases on Wednesday as mask requirements and bans for unvaccinated people were dropped, with the state’s health minister revealing that modelling predicts daily case numbers could reach 25,000 by the end of January. The Australian Medical Association has warned that the Covid vaccine booster program is “already falling behind”, risking more infections and “a repeat of mistakes seen overseas where we are seeing the rapid spread of Omicron”. Western Australia further tightened its already strict border rules for travellers from New South Wales in response to spiralling case numbers in the state. WA also announced it would halve its weekly international arrival cap from 530 to 265 in response to the Omicron variant. Victoria recorded 1.405 new Covid cases, the Northern Territory recorded four, while South Australia recorded 26 new Covid cases – the state’s highest daily total since last April. Tasmania reopened to fully vaccinated travellers from hotspot areas. Have a great evening. We’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. New Zealand’s cities could be reshaped for decades to come, forcing the long-entrenched dream of the quarter-acre block to the margins, after the government joined forces with the opposition to pass sweeping legislation in favour of housing densification. In a rare display of cross-party collaboration, Labour and National passed the Resource Management (Enabling Housing Supply and Other Matters) bill – a policy that aims to counter urban sprawl and boost supply by up to 105,000 new homes in the next eight years by forcing councils to loosen restrictions on building in urban areas. Councils won’t be able to block townhouses or apartments under a sweeping reform aimed at improving affordability – but will it work? And could the idea cross the Tasman? My colleagues Eva Corlett and Caitlin Cassidy have this very interesting read: Allowing Australians to use their superannuation to buy a home would cause another “price explosion”, property economists have warned. The $3.3tn savings pool is an attractive target for politicians wanting to boost home ownership, fund infrastructure or wean people off government pensions in the decades ahead. A McKell Institute report released on Wednesday models the effect on the housing market should Australians be given access to super for a home deposit, as advocated by federal government MPs such as assistant minister Tim Wilson. Housing prices have increased significantly during the pandemic, helped by record low interest rates. Rental costs have also risen. A standard 20% deposit for a house in Sydney – where one-fifth of Australia’s population lives – is now around $300,000, or close to five times the median annual earnings for an individual. Read more: Western Australia will halve its weekly international arrival cap to 265 in response to the Omicron variant. The WA government announced it would cut its hotel quarantine intake on Wednesday, as premier Michael McGowan announced a reclassification of New South Wales as “extreme risk” and a further tightening of the already strict entry rules for travellers from the state. The halving of the arrival cap comes as WA has recorded its first known Omicron cases in hotel quarantine. Two returned overseas travellers are confirmed to have the Omicron strain of the virus and are being monitored in state-run hotels, reports AAP. WA currently receives 530 international arrivals per week but the government will halve the cap from next Thursday. It comes after a number of breaches involving ventilation issues at Perth’s quarantine hotels, two of which prompted short lockdowns earlier this year. “Halving the arrivals cap will ensure capacity in hotel quarantine and safeguard models are maintained given the heightened Omicron risk and addition of NSW approved travellers in hotel quarantine,” a state government spokesman said on Wednesday. The NSW government will forge ahead with plans to license flood plain harvesting before the end of the year but will make amendments to address some of the findings in a NSW upper house committee report which warned knowledge around the practice was inadequate. The committee report, issued Wednesday, calls for further scientific work to establish the extent and impact of flood plain harvesting, which involves capturing floods moving across plains using massive dams, levees and channels. The practice, which has grown dramatically in the past 20 years, has been blamed by the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists for some of the 20% reduction in flows in the Murray-Darling, along with climate change. Environmental scientists have warned over-licensing could have long-term catastrophic impacts on the ability to achieve improvements in the Murray-Darling basin. Read more: Western Australia’s premier Mark McGowan has urged all Western Australians in New South Wales to return to the state immediately ahead of already strict border rules tightening even further from Saturday. In a post on Facebook, McGowan said the situation in NSW – where 1,360 Covid cases were announced on Wednesday – is “very concerning”. McGowan said: I urge all Western Australians currently in New South Wales with an approved G2G Pass to come home immediately, because once the reclassification takes effect on Saturday, they will not be able to do so, except for the most extraordinary circumstances.” Residents returning to WA will have to navigate a complex set of rules and gain specific approval to enter from Saturday. McGowan said exemptions for approved travellers will be restricted to certain government and specialist workers or extraordinary circumstances determined by the state emergency coordinator or the chief health officer. Additionally, to gain approval to enter the state, travellers in those categories must have had at least two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine (if eligible) and return a negative test prior to travel, and will be subject to the following conditions on arrival unless otherwise advised: Undertake mandatory hotel quarantine at a state quarantine facility for 14 days at their expense. Undergo Covid-19 testing on days 1, 5 and 13. McGowan noted that arrivals from NSW were already required to do 14 days of quarantine at home under current border settings, but the move to extreme will mean it must be done in hotel quarantine, and the number of eligible travellers is restricted further. He added: We want Western Australia to remain Covid-free until we safely ease our borders on 5 February. New South Wales will be classified as an “extreme risk” in Western Australia’s Covid border controls, bringing it into the same travel rule category as Victoria. The classification will come into effect from 12:01am on Saturday, and follows a spike in Covid cases in NSW. On Wednesday, 1,360 new cases were announced. Western Australia’s premier Mark McGowan also noted the NSW government’s eased rules for unvaccinated residents when announcing the reclassification on Twitter. McGowan said: Ahead of our safe transition, we need to do everything we can to protect our State, while we continue to get Western Australians vaccinated. Under this category, the exemptions for approved travellers will be restricted to certain Government and specialist workers or extraordinary circumstances determined by the State Emergency Coordinator or the Chief Health Officer.” Rural patients and those living in lower socio-economic areas are struggling to access Covid booster shots, experts are warning, amid concern the vaccine rollout is “falling behind” as the Omicron variant spreads. General practitioners and pharmacies are reporting a sudden increase in demand for vaccines, after federal health advice changed to allow boosters five months after the second primary dose. Representatives of the aged care sector said the rollout for residents and staff was improved from earlier this year, with more than 1,000 booster clinics conducted in aged care facilities already. But rollout problems are emerging in other areas. Some GPs caught off guard by the weekend’s announcement said they were left without enough supply to meet demand. Demand on pharmacies also increased suddenly and significantly. The Australian Medical Association said it was “extremely concerned” at the lack of support for both GPs and pharmacists, and warned the booster rollout was already falling behind. My colleagues Christopher Knaus, Natasha May, and Cait Kelly have more on this: Just when is the right time to signal your exit from a senior position in the government (or elsewhere)? Mike Pratt, the secretary of the NSW Treasury, is clearly not happy that his intention to leave before the next state election in March 2023 made it into the media. So he’s sent an all-staff memo to tell everyone he was “weighing up” whether to return to the private sector. (The Australian described him as “sensationally” sending it to the department staff, but we opted for a more sober take.) Pratt said “only a small number of people were aware of my early thinking. Unfortunately, this information has been prematurely leaked to the media, and I am disappointed with this breach of confidentiality.” That’s usually a cue for more leaking. (Please note: I’m open to Wickr, Telegram, Signal, you name it, even peter.hannam@theguardian.com). Anyway, Pratt will probably face more questions about his future tomorrow when he is due to front a NSW upper house committee looking into the accounting treatment given to $40b of state rail assets. It’s a complex tale but if you want to understand more on what the fuss is all about, there is this handy explainer. Embattled NSW treasury secretary, Mike Pratt, has denied he’s planning an imminent exit from the role, telling staff there is still “so much work left to do” to help the state recover from the pandemic. In a message sent to staff on Wednesday, Pratt denied a media report that his resignation and the appointment of a successor were being planned. He said, though, he may leave the public service prior to the March 2023 state election. “I want to let you know that I have been weighing up whether to return to the private sector before the next state election after almost a decade in public service,” Pratt said in his missive to staff. “The timing would enable a smooth transition to a new secretary before the poll.” Pratt said “only a small number of people were aware of my early thinking. Unfortunately, this information has been prematurely leaked to the media, and I am disappointed with this breach of confidentiality.” The statement to staff comes a day before Pratt is scheduled to front a NSW upper house inquiry over the finances of the Transport Asset Holding Entity, or TAHE. The entity, which holds about $40bn in rail assets, is at the centre of a standoff between treasury and the state’s auditor general, Margaret Crawford. The state’s audit office this week stated it was refusing to sign off on the state’s 2020-21 financial report “due to significant accounting issues”. Read more: Queensland has backtracked on public health advice that threw dozens of airline passengers into hotel quarantine, and has caused further flight cancellations, according to a tourism body. All passengers on two Virgin flights – VA1105 from Newcastle to Brisbane and VA375 from Brisbane to Townsville – were declared close contacts of a male traveller with the virus on Tuesday night, and ordered to isolate for 14 days regardless of a negative test result. Two further exposure sites were listed in Townsville and Brisbane Airport. But the health minister, Yvette D’Ath, backflipped on the decision on Wednesday morning, announcing only passengers in the rows behind, in front of and beside the passenger would be required to complete a fortnight quarantine. The rest of the passengers would be deemed casual contacts and would be released from isolation after receiving a negative test result. The passengers were initially facing Christmas in hotel quarantine. D’Ath said it was the first domestic flight into Queensland where there was a potential Omicron case on board and health authorities acted “just as we did” when the new Delta variant arrived. Read more: Thanks for bringing us the news Mostafa. You have Elias Visontay with you now. I’ll be taking you through rest of the afternoon. If you see anything you think I should be aware of, you contact at me at elias.visontay@theguardian.com or via Twitter @EliasVisontay. And with that, I’ll hand over the blog to the writer of the previous post, Elias Visontay. Thanks for reading. The New South Wales Labor opposition has called on the Perrottet government to release the health advice that it relied on when deciding to ease Covid rules from today. The call from opposition health spokesman Ryan Park followed the NSW Covid update on Wednesday, where the state’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, pleaded with residents to continue wearing masks in indoor settings despite the government dropping the requirement from Wednesday. Chant said “my clear advice is in indoor settings, wear a mask”, and did not directly answer a question about why mask rules were being wound back on a day when NSW announced 1360 new Covid-19 cases – up from 804 on Tuesday. Shortly after the NSW Covid update, Park said “obviously Kerry Chant made recommendations about masks and they are important”. He said: We trust Kerry Chant and her team. All we’re asking the government to do is to release that advice and to ensure that they are making decisions based on that advice We want the health advice made public because we want to make sure that the government is following that advice and the decisions it makes, not for us, but for the community who’s naturally somewhat concerned at the moment. There is a heightened sense of anxiety in the community. I understand that. What we’re saying to the government in the spirit of bipartisanship is please release the advice because that will go a long way in keeping people calm.” Throughout the pandemic, the NSW opposition has largely supported the government’s Covid rules in line with health advice, and Park echoed premier Dominic Perrottet’s comments that hospital system strain, and not daily case numbers, is the more appropriate metric for concern. New Zealand has recorded 74 new cases of Covid, and one death. Health authorities said another 15 new cases were also detected late yesterday, so will be added to tomorrow’s numbers. The NZ Ministry of Health offered their condolences to the family of the deceased: A patient with Covid-19 has passed away at Tauranga hospital. The family has requested that no further details be released and, out of respect for those wishes, we will be making no further comment. Of the 9,963 cases in the current outbreak, 84% (8,353) are not fully immunised. Of the 508 hospitalised cases in the current outbreak, 93% (474) are not fully immunised. The Northern Territory has recorded four new locally acquired cases overnight, all linked to the Katherine cluster. The NT recorded 11 overall cases, with five being international arrivals, and another case in an aircrew member from a flight from London. There was also a case in home quarantine in Darwin. Two of the new locally acquired cases are in the Royal Darwin hospital precinct, including a woman in her 30s and her young son, both from Timber Creek. They had stopped in Katherine before going to Dawrin for surgery for the child. The other cases are a woman in her 20s and a teenager from Katherine East. Earlier today, it was announced that South Australia has recorded 26 new cases, the highest daily total since last April. Two cases are health workers who had attended a number of aged care facilities, with six sites identified as sites of concern. It comes as premier, Steven Marshall, defended the state’s contact tracing resources, after they were delayed in naming exposure sites: A lot of the information does come in late because you’re speaking to people and then they recall where else they may have been or could have been an actual transmission that wasn’t there previously. So look, I’m absolutely 100% convinced we have provided the adequate resources, we’ve been asked for more resources, we’ve provided more resources, I think our contact tracing is the best in the world. But what we do need to understand is it’s a changed environment from where we were even just two months ago. So it is important to list exposure sites so people have got some information, but we are at a different level of stress with regards to this disease from where we were two to three weeks ago and certainly where we were two to three months ago. Marshall also announced changes to restrictions for international arrivals, who will see their quarantine periods cut to seven days. But the premier added that testing requirements pre-departure wouldn’t be changing “anytime soon.” The Australian Medical Association has warned that the booster program is “already falling behind,” risking more infections and “a repeat of mistakes seen overseas where we are seeing the rapid spread of Omicron.” In a statement, the AMA’s president, Dr Omar Khorshid, says there are concerns at the lack of support for the booster program: GPs and pharmacists are not being properly supported to implement this critical booster program. By the end of this month close to four million people will be eligible for the booster, however, in the last week Australia has only been able to administer just over 210,000 booster doses. The commonwealth has cut vaccination funding for GPs delivering boosters. This is making it very difficult for GPs to run clinics at the volume and scale required, including running extra vaccination clinics or extra sessions. GPs, for example, need to hire extra staff and make hundreds of telephone calls to encourage patients to get their boosters. Unless primary care is supported, the booster program will fall further behind, and millions of Australians will be put at greater risk of the significant complications associated with Covid-19. The return of stringent public health restrictions will once again be inevitable. Dr Khorshid also said the new variant “poses a significant risk” and that it was essential that the public are encouraged to take up the booster: The latest strain of Covid-19, Omicron, poses a significant potential risk to the population and appears much more transmissible than previous strains, so we have to pick up the pace to protect the community. We need to urgently reach out to the public to encourage them to come forward for their booster, and GPs are best placed to do this for many in the population. The Australian Capital Territory has updated its restrictions on domestic arrivals, with fully vaccinated close contacts of Omicron cases no longer needing to quarantine for 14 days. They’ll have to isolate for seven days instead, with all other restrictions on domestic arrivals lifted. A statement from minister for health, Rachel Stephen-Smith, outlines the new changes: People will no longer need to fill out a declaration or exemption form to travel to the ACT, and all remaining high risk geographical areas will be removed. The three-day quarantine requirement for fully vaccinated overseas arrivals will be retained, and this is likely to remain over the Christmas and New Year period. The ACT also removed special restrictions on fully vaccinated arrivals from South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini and/or Malawi, who will only need to quarantine for three days. NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant, just earlier told reporters it was still too early to judge the severity of the Omicron variant. Speaking at today’s health update, Chant said authorities believe the reason for NSW’s growing cases was the new variant, and warned people to be vigilant. We still don’t have enough information to inform our assessment about the severity profile, but we believe that that information will be emerging over the next two weeks. We have seen a rapid uptick in cases and what we believe is that Omicron is driving that uptick. A little bit of it is driven by Delta as we are getting out and about ... but, primarily, we believe that Omicron is certainly driving the uptick in cases – particularly in the Newcastle area. No vehicle? No worries – it shouldn’t mean you have to hit the brakes on your getaway plans, writes Caitlin Cassidy. Westpac will stop funding fossil fuel projects but Australia is not ready to rely on renewables immediately, chairman John McFarlane says. McFarlane gave a lengthy defence of continued lending to coal and gas projects in response to environmentally-concerned shareholders at an annual general meeting on Wednesday, AAP reports. Investors calling into the virtual meeting pleaded with executives to stop lending to companies such as Whitehaven Coal and Woodside for new coal and gas projects. McFarlane said the easy decision would be to stop financing all fossil fuels projects. “But given this is Australia, it’s not the right answer,” he said. “This country does need us to finance various sectors, including electricity generation. “We know gas will be with us for some time. We’re not going to be able to deal with renewables immediately.” We’ve got some mixed messaging coming out of NSW - on masks and Covid numbers. Here’s a little more on the Covid situation in Victoria, where 1,405 new cases and three deaths were announced today. There are currently 86 people in the ICU in Victoria and of those 46 are ventilated. The issue is of course Victoria’s case numbers have not dropped since the state hit 90% vaccination, so the concern is Omicron is circulating and may create a surge in cases. Thank you, Matilda. We’re going to go to NSW where premier Dominic Perrottet was just speaking about how there will be a change around who is a close Covid contact – and that some will no longer need to isolate for seven days and will only need to get a PCR test. He said close contacts would now be focused on household contacts, and that even household contacts may not have to isolate for seven days. “A close contact will be a member from your household ... there may be occasions where Health may determine outside of that definition that you would be a close contact. “In those circumstances, rather than isolating for seven days, you’ll just need to get a negative PCR test.” It’s not entirely clear what the new rules mean but we’ll bring you more when we know. With that, I shall hand you over to the amazing Cait Kelly who will bring you all the updates from this NSW press conference. Modelling has predicted that New South Wales could see up to 25,000 new Covid cases a day by the end of January. The University of NSW modelling estimate was revealed by NSW health minister Brad Hazzard on Wednesday, as Covid restrictions eased in the state. From today, unvaccinated residents can enter most settings and mask mandates in shops, hospitality and other settings have been scrapped. Hazzard also urged people to minimise their gatherings in high density settings, and to wear a mask even though it is not a requirement, as thousands of people in the state who become close contacts in coming days face isolation orders over Christmas. NSW recorded 1,360 new Covid cases on Wednesday. The Victorian ombudsman and Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission have asked the state’s political parties how laws can be changed to deter the misuse of public funds. The integrity bodies have written to leaders of Victorian political parties seeking recommendations for legislative changes as they continue to investigate the alleged widespread misuse of ministerial and parliamentary entitlements as part of a branch stacking operation within the Labor party. According to a statement from the agencies, it is hoped the legal reforms will strengthen the frameworks for parliamentary accountability, particularly in relation to breaches of the members of parliament code of conduct. Evidence heard during recent public hearings regarding alleged branch stacking suggested that some Victorian MPs misused public resources by directing electorate officers and ministerial staff to engage in work that furthers their political objectives. The Victorian ombudsman, Deborah Glass, said reforms introduced in the wake of the so-called red shirts scandal appeared not to have done enough to protect against the misuse of public funds. She said: The evidence indicates that despite a package of reforms enacted by Parliament in 2019 in response to my Red Shirts report in 2018, existing laws and rules around the legitimate use of public resources are not robust enough to prevent their misuse. The Ibac commissioner, Robert Redlich QC, who has overseen the public hearings, said: Much of the evidence heard at the public hearings spoke about how taxpayer funds were directed to ministerial and electorate office staff to perform party‐political during work hours, rather than the job they were hired to do in performing ministerial or electorate work. According to the Ibac and Ombudsman statement, Victorian MPs are also being asked to provide clarity about the process they use to appoint staff for electoral or ministerial work, and whether reducing the staffing allocation and electorate office budget should be considered. The public hearings have heard from MPs and staffers that factional tasks were often done by publicly funded workers when there was not enough “legitimate” work to do. The feedback from MPs will help form the recommendations in the final public report, which will be handed down next year. Ummmmmmmmmm... I’ll bring you more on this soon, but the rules in NSW has once again relaxed, with household close contacts of Covid-19 cases (those who live in the same home) no longer need to isolate for seven days, just return a negative PRC test. Morrison has been asked if he thinks the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk’s success in limiting Covid-19 deaths in her state will benefit her federal Labor candidate Anthony Albanese. I tell you what, after the next federal election, Annastacia Palaszczuk will be the premier of Queensland. How you vote will not change that. In Victoria, Dan Andrews will still be the Premier of Victoria. Mark McGowan will still be the Premier of Western Australia. However, you vote at the next federal election. But I can tell you one thing, if you don’t vote for the Liberal-National parties then Anthony Albanese will be the prime minister of Australia and not myself and that’s what this election is about. Ultimately it’s a choice between those alternatives. Others will have their view. But if Anthony Albanese needs to be propped up by premiers, take that as a vote of no confidence in him because they don’t think he knows how to do the job. Here is what Morrison had to say about the allegations of “pork barrelling” that have arisen following this nine newspaper analysis of how much federal grant funding each electorate received. It’s selectively looked at. People can make their own judgements about that. When we make a commitment, we keep it. When we commit to support local community organisations, when we commit to bust congestion in urban areas, whether it’s here in Ryan or any other parts of the country, when we make that commitment, Australians know that we’ll keep it. In addition to that, when Australians are facing tough times - the grants you’re talking about have predominantly gone into rural and regional areas, particularly here in Queensland, because they were dealing with drought-affected communities and grants going into drought-affected communities. S o people in rural and regional Australia understand that when they’re doing it tough, they know the Liberals and Nationals, the LNP in Queensland, will be here to support them. Others might want to criticise us for keeping our commitments. They might want to criticise us for the support we’ve given to drought-affected and flood-affected communities but when I make a commitment to do those things, I carry it through. Morrison says he “welcomes the common sense” decision by the Queensland government to let most passengers on the Virgin hot spot flights to leave isolation after they return a negative test. He urged the state not to go backwards, to keep moving towards living with Covid-19, and it a not so subtle swipe at the Queensland government noted how “shattered” those on the flight must have felt during the period where they believed they would be in isolation over Christmas. Morrison has been asked about the Nine newspaper analysis which appears to show Coalition and marginal electorates were given significantly more in grants from the federal government than their federal counterparts. I’m just working to bring you the full transcript, but the prime minister has suggested that the funding data was “selective” and tried to drive home the point that when the Coalition commits to a project, it delivers on it. Morrison has been asked about him recently being declared a casual Covid contact: I did get that advice. I was there at that event. I’ve been double PCR tested since and both negative. I think I’m one of the most tested-for-Covid prime ministers anywhere in the world and probably the most quarantined as well. And so we always take that health advice seriously and we fully comply. Before we came up here today, we ensured we were fully compliant with the Queensland rules for coming into Queensland and so, of course, we’ve done that. Bruce Saunders, the assistant minister for trade, has laid out what this new proposal would mean more clearly: Perhaps 13- to 24-year-olds that have lived a life with a tablet a mobile phone for most of their young lives. They know the tricks. They know the loopholes, the anxiety, the difficult times that are out there and it’s really important that we listen to the youth of Australia and be guided by their decisions and make an impact on the new youngsters coming through to really make a difference to make sure the predators know we are fair dinkum. Don’t touch our kids. Our kids are well-skilled, well-tooled, well-analysed and, importantly, recognise potential danger, know how to react, and, most importantly, will report any dangers that exist both in the online world and also the real world. So there is no place to hide. And the youth advisory group will provide a structure that provides initial skills and tips to keep our youngsters safe online. OK, so now we have moved on to the main meat of this press conference. The newly proposed online safety act that the Coalition wants to bring in. Morrison: We need to make sure this is continually informed by young people, because they are living with it. They know what is going on. They understand the technology better. They understand the tricks that these monsters will use to try and trick them. And we need their feedback and we need help from them to guide us in this area. And help parents by giving them the right tools. That is why we are setting up reporting with the e-safety commissioner Julie Inman Grant, the first to listen directly to young people about how we can even more successfully and effectively keep their world safe online. This is a great passion of mine and Jenny’s, it is a great passion of parents all around the country. Morrison is really hitting all the talking points in the first minute or two of this press conference: What we can say is a country is no country got everything right, but it is important to get the balance right. And we made the big calls and we have got the balance right. And as a result, Australia has one of the lowest fatalities rates [anywhere] in the world. We have one of the strongest economies is of an advanced economy is in the world. Scott Morrison is back in Queensland today for the first time in a long time after borders reopened this week. It is great to be back in Queensland. It is so great to be back in Queensland. I have been looking forward to this and it is wonderful to be here. It is wonderful to see the country connecting again, it is wonderful to see Tasmania open, it is wonderful to see, as I flew in today, there was a Japan Airlines plane on the tarmac here in Brisbane, as we note that Japan, Korea, students and of course skilled migrants being able to come into Australia. We are living with this virus and the opening up, the national plan which we lead as a federal government*, that set the targets for vaccines to ensure that we could connect again, it has been put in place and that has led to the opening of these borders. * It’s REALLY stretching the outer limits of the truth by suggesting the federal government is in any way in control of the national reopening plan. Oh my good lord! We are going straight from the Victorian press conference to the prime minister. Lord help me! An important update on that PM cricket photo opp: Sutton has laid out some fairly stark statistics on which demographics are still getting seriously ill from Covid-19. Those in hospital yesterday, 73% were not fully vaccinated. And 58% did not even have their first dose. Of those in intensive care, 91% were not fully vaccinated and 88% had not had their first dose. No vaccine at all. We’re talking about the eligible population in ICU, so if vaccines did nothing, you would expect 92% or 93% of people to be fully vaccinated. But we are seeing a tiny proportion who are fully vaccinated. Everyone else is not fully vaccinated or has just one dose. If that is not a story of the protection of vaccines, I do not know what is. Chief health officer Brett Sutton says Victorian now has 10 confirmed cases of the Omicron Covid-19 variant. You would have seen a media release this morning although we have an additional four cases of Omicron variant detected in the community. That brings the total cases to 10. That went out early this morning to advise people who had been attending the Sircuit or Peel Hotel, if they were at those venues on the 10 December. They are all required to be fully vaccinated and checked in via the QR codes. We don’t expect there are unvaccinated individuals though, they have been provided advice on the 14-day requirement for unvaccinated individuals nonetheless, we thank everyone for the assistance. Really, thanks to that QR check-in we have been able to check in with all of those 850 plus patrons who checked in and have been directly messaged through the course of today. Foley has confirmed that no one currently in hospital with Covid-19 in Victoria has received a booster jab. It’s important to know that of those people in hospital with the virus at the moment, none have received a booster, and while sadly they continue to be overrepresented in the non-vaccinated as well. We will continue on with these efforts to make sure that Victorians can get those out over the holiday period. I am WEEPING as I type. Foley: Elective surgery rules will also be updated, with health services and regional services able to step up and resume to 75% of normal elective surgery activity. Foley: Workplaces exposed to a positive coronavirus case will no longer need to undertake the same level of extensive deep cleaning they had historically. Now international evidence into the coronavirus is an evolving the airborne or droplet borne disease, and the likelihood of becoming infected by touching a surface is increasingly seen as a low risk. Having said that, normal cleaning arrangements will continue to apply, among the benefits we have seen it is just the lifting and hygiene as a result of the increased arrangements we have had through the pandemic. Foley: Secondly, the mandatory vaccination requirement when it comes to non-essential retail and retail more broadly. It will be lifted, except for hair and beauty services. The vaccination requirement will also be lifted when it comes to real estate, as long as people are not hanging around for long. As well as places of worship and weddings and funerals. Masks will still be required in retail settings. Having said that, face masks in those religious settings such as weddings and funerals or ceremonial settings will not be required. If an event is held at a place of worship, there will not be any vaccination requirements or limits of participation. If that same ceremony is under way at a hospitality setting, then vaccination requirements will continue to apply as they will continue to apply in all hospitality services. Victoria’s health minister, Martin Foley, says that, as the state’s newly minted pandemic powers come into effect from midnight tonight, several Covid-19 rules in the state will be tweaked. Firstly, people who are under 18 will no longer be required to show proof of vaccination status at hospitality venues, the current arrangement is 12 and above. In terms of these arrangements, particularly for families at Christmas, moving up to 18 make sense. Here are the new Victorian Covid-19 rules: The main change seems to be that those under 18 will no longer need to have proof of vaccination in order to enter venues. Someone who knows more about sport than I do, is this a good or bad throw from the PM? Albanese has been asked how he intends to swing marginal Tasmanian seats back into the red during the upcoming election. By putting a message to Tasmanians that they need to hear and that that they want and that message is very clear – that here in Tasmania, they want jobs. They want secure work. They want to see companies like this backed with high-value manufacturing. They want a government that actually looks after their interests and the whole of ... not just marginal electorates. This government have been in office now for almost a decade. They’re asking for a second decade in office. Do Tasmanians think that this is as good as it gets? Because a fourth-term government, can you imagine the rorting of taxpayer funds that will occur in a fourth term if this government gets its way? Albanese: When I was the minister, we funded projects like Gold Coast light rail in safe Coalition seats, because it was the right thing to do. We put $7.6bn into the Pacific Highway when we were in office, a highway that didn’t cross a Labor electorate from the north shore of Sydney right up to the Queensland border for most of that area. The truth is that this government have been involved, and they’re addicted to it and they just dismiss it and in the last budget, they established a range of funds where they allocated billions of dollars in decisions taken but not announced. It’s not on! Albanese: We need a national anti-corruption commission and we need it now and I put the prime minister on notice that a national anti-corruption commission will be able to look at the sports rorts program and these rorted programs of taxpayer funds. Taxpayer funds are ones that are paid for by the hard workers such as at this company here. They deserve better than to have their funds, their taxpayer funds from their hard work funnelled into marginal electorates on the basis of a political whim. They deserve for funding to be allocated as well for major infrastructure projects. Reporter: Well, what would you do? Albanese: What we did. What we did was to have grants based upon integrity. What we did was to have a grants system [going] through local government where every local government in the country benefited, and where we took advice from departments. We didn’t have is the sort of system that this government has – and we will not have in government – is a few ministers sitting around with colour-coded sheets and the prime minister’s office sitting down with colour-coded seats based upon the marginality of electorates and determining funding that way. Funding should be based upon objective criteria and should be based upon need. Now that the Tasmanian border is open, Anthony Albanese is down there talking about how bad the Liberals are. No surprises there. Let’s have a little listen to what he has to say about this research done by Nine newspapers, showing the distribution of grant funding by the government by the electorate: Well, this is just a disgrace. Today, we have found through the research that has been done by Nine newspapers that $4 has gone to Coalition electorates for every dollar that has gone to a Labor electorate. In my electorate of Grayndler, they’ve received $700,000 of commonwealth grants funding at the same time as the electorate just next door, that has a very similar composition, Reid, has received $15m and Cook $8m. Taxpayers don’t pay different rates of tax according to what electorate they’re in but what we know is that unless you’re in a marginal National or Liberal party seat you won’t receive the same support as those voters do. And the pork-barrelling is just out of control. This government have set up a number of funds – sports rorts, commuter car park rorts, regional grants, a whole range of programs. They’ve even politicised the community safety program. The community safety program should be above partisan political interests. What we see from this government is rort after rort. Queensland’s chief health minister, Dr John Gerrard, says that Omicron spreading throughout Queensland is inevitable and the state will not be changing its approach to reopening. He said the Virgin flights were pretty with extreme caution simply because it was the first time they were confronted with the possibility of an Omicron carrying flight. (We don’t actually know if it was Omicron yet, but it could be.) We took an extremely cautious approach. This is the first domestic flight on which a likely Omicron case has been diagnosed. But moving forward, following these discussions, we believe it will be safe to use our more usual infection control measures whereby we isolate or we quarantine those people two rows in front of and behind the person involved, even if it is Omicron, as we expected. As I’ve said, this virus is going to continue to spread. It is clear now that Omicron is very contagious and most of us now believe that the speed with which we will reach a peak is probably faster than we anticipated. It’s more in the weeks than the months, from what we’re seeing in New South Wales and the United Kingdom. It’s very much faster and much more contagious than we’ve seen previously with Delta. We’ll see that in the coming days and weeks and I think we can reasonably expect that Omicron will spread in Queensland in the coming weeks. It won’t be a surprise. We are not going to change our plans as a result of that. D’Ath has confirmed that – with the exception of the infected person’s travel group, and those sitting in close proximity – all the passengers of those two hotspot Virgin flights will be allowed out of isolation once they return a negative PCR test. The health unit and chief health officer and deputy chief health officers analysed overnight what should be our approach when we have Omicron on these flights. Do we need to take a different approach to quarantine? Or can we apply our normal rules? So there’s been a lot of discussions overnight and I know that there’s been contact with other chief health officers and health officials interstate to see how states are dealing with this based on the national guidelines. I’ve been advised this morning that the chief health officer and the deputies have viewed that we can apply the normal rules in relation to these flights and we don’t need to wait until we get the findings of whether it’s Omicron because, if it is, we still will apply these rules. That means that other than those people who will be directly advised they are close contacts ... the remainder of the passengers will be deemed to be casual contact. What that means for those people will be that they have to get tested, isolate until they get a negative result, and then just watch for symptoms over the next 14 days. D’Ath: Now, in relation to two of these particular positive cases in the community, we can advise that one person was at the Argyle hotel in Newcastle and although, in both of these cases we are waiting on the genomic sequencing to come back, we are certainly treating them as if they are Omicron. We know there has been a large number of cases of patrons who had been at the Argyle hotel in Newcastle. Secondly, there was the gentleman who flew from Newcastle to Brisbane, then Brisbane to Townsville. This person had attended another exposure site in Newcastle. We are, at this stage, treating it as if it was Omicron. It was this gentleman who was on the two flights we put up as exposure sites yesterday afternoon. Queensland’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, is speaking now and confirms that the state has recorded six new Covid-19 cases, all from interstate travellers who tested positive in Queensland. In relation to these cases, they are in a number of places across Queensland and have been infectious for up to six days. So places such as Goondiwindi, Wide Bay, Townsville, Gold Coast and Brisbane South have all reported these cases. In addition, we can report that one of our previously reported overseas positive cases who have arrived from the UK has now been tested positive for Omicron. So that is in hotel quarantine. Here are the details of the Covid-19 positive woman who died in the latest NSW reporting period. She had received three doses of the vaccine but, NSW Health says, had underlying health conditions. This is the third death linked to an outbreak at this facility. So we are just standing by now to hear from the Queensland health authorities when they step up at 11am (AEDT), but looks like we will be hearing from the Victorian crew shortly after that at 11.30am. Then we’ve got NSW at 12! I’m going to need a coffee. News Corp is reporting that most passengers on board the two Queensland flights that have been caught up in a Covid-19 scare will be released from isolation after testing negative. According to News.com.au: News.com.au has confirmed the vast majority will now be deemed casual contacts by the Queensland government. That means they will be tested and released from quarantine. Reportedly those seated in close proximity to the infected passenger will still be required to do the full isolation period. I’ll follow this up and see if we confirm it for you guys. I know this doesn’t start until June but it still feels like a weird vibe to be promoting the new international flight route you’ve helped organise, while many people can’t enter or leave WA to see family for Christmas. This is a great point (although worth remembering that hospitalisations are generally delayed by one or two weeks, so naturally when numbers are declining hospitalisations will be higher than when they are inclining). Scott Morrison will travel to Queensland despite being identified as a casual contact of a person with Covid-19 after his attendance at a Sydney high school graduation. Morrison and a person with Covid-19 were among about 1,000 attendees of the Kincoppal-Rose Bay graduation gala at the International Convention Centre at Darling Harbour on Friday. A spokesperson for the prime minister confirmed he was deemed a casual contact by New South Wales authorities on Tuesday night but he has returned two negative PCR tests since the event. You can read our full coverage of this story below: OK, we will be hearing from the Queensland health authorities at 10am and will hopefully get some clarity on whether a Covid case onboard flights to the state will always mean the entire plane needs to isolate for two weeks. There is an update from the ongoing inquest into the Melbourne aged care home St Basil’s, which had a deadly Covid-19 outbreak last year. AAP is reporting that former chairman Konstantinos Kontis has requested to be excused from giving evidence, believing this could incriminate him legally. Criticism is coming in this morning after the Western Australia’s upper house passed the Labor government’s contentious Aboriginal heritage legislation last night despite protests by Indigenous groups, AAP reports. In a statement on Wednesday, Nyikina Warrwa Traditional Custodian and academic Anne Poelina said Labor had squandered the opportunity to right wrongs and scrap racist laws. Our power to speak for our Country and self-determine how it is protected has been disregarded... McGowan has failed us. The National Native Title Council also condemned the passage of the bills, noting they were not co-designed with the input of traditional owners. NNTC chief executive and Gundjitmara Djabwurrung man Jamie Lowe said: “As we have stated repeatedly, the bill does not make traditional owners the decision-makers in the protection and management of their cultural heritage,” If you want to change a history of heritage destruction to a future of heritage protection, Aboriginal people must have an independent right of review for ministerial decisions, with genuine power to make decisions about heritage sites. Federal Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who chaired a parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the Juukan Gorge, warned while speaking to ABC that the laws don’t give Indigenous people an avenue to stop abuses of ministerial power. The reality is while it certainly goes some way to addressing the deficiencies in the current [law] it falls far short of the reforms that were advocated in our [inquiry] recommendations. Australia’s air force chief ticked off on a $16bn Joint Strike Fighter program clearing a major milestone despite acknowledging “deficiencies” with the aircraft and support systems. The defence department has also revealed that a much-trumpeted upgrade to the Jindalee Operational Radar Network is running “several years” behind schedule, a year after the Morrison government announced plans to expand surveillance of Australia’s eastern approaches. The disclosures follow moves by the defence minister, Peter Dutton, to dump the trouble-plagued MH90 Taipan helicopters early and replace them with Black Hawks from the US in coming years. A detailed new report on Australian’s defence acquisitions outlines problems with other major projects, including the Joint Strike Fighter program. You can read the full report below: The ABC is reporting that the Covid-19 positive man who travelled from Newcastle to Townsville, triggering two flights full of passengers into isolation over Christmas, was an Australian defence force officer. He was alerted that he was a close contact when he landed in Townsville, went to get a test, and subsequently came back positive. Victoria is still slightly ahead of NSW in the daily case number with 1,405 new infections, but that gap is narrowing. Sadly three people infected with Covid-19 have also died in the latest reporting period. NSW has once again seen a significant jump in cases with 1,360 new Covid-19 cases in the latest reporting period. We will have a breakdown of where in the state those cases are later this morning. Sadly one person infected with Covid-19 has died. Labor senator Pat Dodson has blasted the Western Australian government for failing its one opportunity to protect Aboriginal heritage and stop the “tyranny of cultural genocide” after the state’s controversial new heritage bill was passed into law. The new law, introduced after Rio Tinto destroyed a 46,000-year-old cultural site at Juukan Gorge, has drawn anger from Aboriginal traditional owners, shareholder groups and even federal MPs. After months of asking, the bill was finally released to the public on 16 November. Critics had called on the WA government to halt its passage and conduct further consultation with traditional owners. “It’s a discredit to the legislators and particularly those who advise the legislators,” Dodson said. “If you look back at the history of Western Australia, it hasn’t been so advanced in this space for a very long time and this was the one opportunity it had to be a bit advanced, and it has failed.” You can read the full report below: This funniest part of Josh’s chat. We will be hearing from the NSW premier, health minister and chief officer at midday today (AEDT). Speaking of the huge Omicron exposure in Melbourne, the Guardian’s very own reporter Josh Taylor has been caught up in it, which means we will be one team member down at the Christmas party tonight. Here he is chatting with ABC News Breakfast: I got a text message at 11pm, saying I had been identified as a close contact of an Omicron case. That was all the information I had last night. I got up early, went and got tested and saw the press release this morning, identifying the club I was at on Friday night as one of the exposure venues for Omicron. I’m actually not surprised that they have done this ... As you have just reported, what we are seeing in Newcastle with the amount of cases that have spread within that one nightclub, I’m not surprised they are working fast to stop a repeat of that here. Scott Morrison has spoken to 4BC Radio ahead of his trip to Queensland, confirming that he is still coming to the state despite being a casual contact of someone with Covid-19. Morrison said that both the chief medical officer and Queensland authorities have confirmed it is safe to travel, citing his two negative PCR tests since the Friday night event he attended. Morrison said: That’s what living with the virus is. The virus is there, Omicron is in Australia. We’re going to live with this virus not let it drag us back where we’ve been. We’ve got one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. We’re about to tip over 90% double dose around the country. Yesterday we had another bumper day in terms of our booster program ... We’ve got to keep moving forward, we can’t slip back. It’s great Queensland has opened up, but we need better and faster methods to get back in the community. Morrison then hedged on a number of Covid measures: On the Covid contacts having to quarantine for 14 days in Queensland, Morrison said he hoped allowing people to be out by Christmas would be a high priority and there is “nothing magical about 14 days”. He argued governments have to be more “innovative” with solutions like allowing people out earlier if they test every day. On cruises, Morrison said it was “terribly frustrating” P&amp;O had pushed back the start date for cruises, and the federal government is “keen to move”. But “we’re still being patient about it” while state authorities give necessary approvals. Morrison also spruiked two other announcements: A youth advisory committee on online safety; Easier access to the pension loan scheme through a more attractive interest rate for people of pension age to draw down on equity in their homes. Looks like we might get some clarity on what the Queensland flight situation will be when Queensland authorities step up to chat to media later this morning. Stay tuned to the blog for all the updates. Australian schoolchildren’s basic literacy and numeracy skills were relatively unscathed during first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, but gaps are widening between city students and those in regional and remote areas, the latest Naplan study has found. Analysis of long-term data for the annual National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (Naplan) National Report 2021 – found significant and growing gaps between some demographics, including along gender lines, between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, and those in metro and regional areas. The full 360-page report, released on Wednesday, follows high-level data in August which indicated that students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in 2021 continued to perform on par with students in 2019, despite lockdowns and periods of remote learning through 2020. The Naplan tests were not conducted in 2020 due to nationwide lockdowns. You can read the full report below: The New South Wales government has picked Kerry Schott to chair its net zero emissions and clean economy board, hoping for a happier outcome than its first attempt. Earlier this year, the energy and environment minister Matt Kean chose former prime minister and mentor of sorts Malcolm Turnbull to lead that role. Within days, though, right-wing media stirred into action, demanding Turnbull be dumped. The then premier Gladys Berejiklian complied, with the ex-PM decrying the “thuggery” involved. Schott, a seasoned official, was Turnbull’s choice to head the energy security board but her appointment is unlikely to stir such animosity. Kean said: Dr Schott is one of the most outstanding public servants in the country and brings with her a wealth of knowledge and experience which will be invaluable as NSW drives towards halving our emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. The board’s role includes providing advice on the design of net zero programs, opportunities for low-emissions research and industries in NSW, and strategies to support existing industries to adopt low or zero emissions technologies. We had a reminder of the challenges this week, with the NSW government’s own natural resources commission warning that trapping carbon in the soil as a way of reaching emissions goals won’t be easy with warming temperatures likely to result in a rise in soil carbon emissions. Kean, meanwhile, has a busy week with plans to release the state’s mid-year budget update tomorrow morning. Now also the NSW treasurer, Kean has inherited a growing scandal over the accounts of $40bn in assets of what was RailCorp. The NSW auditor general Margaret Crawford is not satisfied with how the government has used the assets to make the overall budget look better than it is, and is refusing to sign off the government’s accounts. Read this explainer for more detail on this odd affair. Unvaccinated people are now free to shop and socialise in New South Wales and travellers arriving from southern African countries no longer have to quarantine, AAP reports. The NSW government is honouring its pledge to significantly ease Covid-19 restrictions despite a sharp rise in Covid case numbers amid super-spreading events in the festive season. For the first time in three months, the same set of rules now applies to the vaccinated and the unvaccinated in NSW. QR code check-ins will be scaled back and masks are only required only in high-risk settings like public transport and planes. There’s no cap on visitors in homes, hospitality venues, or on numbers at outdoor public gatherings. Meanwhile, NSW Health says fully-vaccinated arrivals from eight southern African countries of concern where the Omicron variant emerged will no longer have to enter 14 days of hotel quarantine, bringing all international arrivals under the same requirements. Chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said all fully-vaccinated international arrivals must self-isolate for 72-hours and have a negative result within the first 24 hours of arrival and avoid high-risk settings for a week. The lifting of restrictions - long-planned for December 15 - comes just as case numbers spike to a two-month high. Some 804 people tested positive for Covid-19 in NSW in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday and infection numbers have quadrupled in the past two weeks. They included 224 people in Newcastle, where super-spreading events at a nightclub and a pub have been identified. The big question today seems to be will every flight to Queensland positive person on board lead to all passengers quarantining for two weeks? I ask this partially as a journalist and partially as a person who has a holiday booked in for Noosa in January. According to the Australian, the event Morrison attended on Friday was Kincoppal-Rose Bay’s school graduation gala at the International Convention Centre in Sydney’s Darling Harbour. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been tested for Covid-19 after being deemed a casual contact, but is not required to isolate. It’s understood that the PM’s office sought advice from NSW prior to meeting the Korean president at Kirribilli House on Tuesday night. Here is the statement from his spokesperson: Last night the Prime Minister was deemed a casual contact by NSW Health following attendance at an event last Friday night. Since the event, the Prime Minister has received two negative PCR tests and as such NSW Health and the Chief Medical Officer has advised he is not required to isolate. As per the NSW Health guidelines, the Prime Minister will be tested again on day 6. The PM will still travel to Queensland today after getting advice from Queensland Health and the state’s chief medical officer who agreed that all the normal requirements have been met. On a lighter note, here is Gutwein’s reaction when asked about Tasmania hosting its first ever Ashes test match in January (after WA failed to open its borders in time). I can’t get the smile off my face. When we were discussing this with Cricket Australia, I made the point that this wasn’t just about money, this was about making history. And Tasmania has never had an Ashes test. I expect that Tasmanians will turn up in droves. I hope it’s a decider, if not, it makes no difference. We still have got an Ashes test and I know it’s something that all Tasmanians are very proud of. Speaking of Tasmania, the premier Peter Gutwein has told ABC News Breakfast that Covid-19 cases arriving in the state is inevitable as the borders open to all of Australia this morning. Well, I’m excited. It’s been nearly two years that we’ve had to have border controls in place. I’ve been up-front with Tasmanians. At some stage, Covid will arrive here. We’ve got our business community well prepared, our broader community well prepared and our health system is well prepared. We’re going into this slightly differently. We’ve largely been Covid free. We’ll be one of the few places in the world who are going into a reopening like this, with such a high rate of vaccination, and no Covid in our community currently. That will stand us in good stead. The other breaking news this morning is two possible Omicron superspreader events in the inner Melbourne suburbs of Fitzroy and Collingwood. According to Victorian health authorities, a person who later tested positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19 attended two venues on Friday, 10 December. (Last Friday). Everyone who attended Sircuit Bar on Smith Street in Fitzroy between 9pm and midnight, and the Peel Hotel on Peel Street in Collingwood between 11.30pm and 3am (Saturday), are now considered close contacts. Health authorities predict that 320 people were at the Peel Hotel and more than 410 people were at Sircuit. Those who are fully vaccinated must quarantine for seven days and those not fully vaccinated must isolate for 14 days. I’ll bring you updates on this throughout the morning as well. Good morning everyone – it’s only ten days until Christmas and the news just won’t stop! It’s Matilda Boseley here with you this morning and please know that I am wearing a Father Christmas hat this morning, and will be every day till the 25th. Speaking of Christmas, I have some bad Christmas news to start the day. Two planeloads full of passengers will be forced into quarantine in Queensland for 14 days (including Christmas). It comes after an unknowingly Covid-19 positive person flew on a Virgin Australia flight from Brisbane to Townsville on Monday. The other affected flight, also a Virgin Australia service, was to Brisbane from Newcastle, where there has been a recent superspreader event at a nightclub. The flights are: VA1105 Newcastle to Brisbane; and VA375 Brisbane to Townsville. Queensland Health confirmed the case in a tweet on Tuesday night. All passengers on both of the flights were designated as close contacts, while those who were in the parts of Brisbane airport around the time have been listed as casual contacts. I’ll bring you more updates on that throughout the morning. And further south, Tasmania is throwing open its borders to all fully vaccinated travellers this morning, after closures spanning the best part of two years. Under the reopening plan, people coming from designated high-risk areas must return a negative test in the 72 hours before they arrive and present proof at the border. The state government released border reopening modelling a few months ago, which predicts 87 deaths in the six months from December and 50,000 cases. The health department said the system is prepared although several unions have raised concerns about staff levels."

          "bodyText": "Rural patients and those living in lower socioeconomic areas are struggling to access Covid booster shots, experts are warning, amid concern the vaccine rollout is “falling behind” as the Omicron variant spreads. General practitioners and pharmacies are reporting a sudden increase in demand for vaccines, after federal health advice changed to allow boosters five months after the second primary dose. Representatives of the aged care sector said the rollout for residents and staff was improved from earlier this year, with more than 1,000 booster clinics conducted in aged care facilities already. But rollout problems are emerging in other areas. Some GPs caught off guard by the weekend’s announcement said they were left without enough supply to meet demand. Demand on pharmacies also increased suddenly and significantly. The Australian Medical Association said it was “extremely concerned” at the lack of support for both GPs and pharmacists, and warned the booster rollout was already falling behind. AMA president Dr Omar Khorshid also warned against scaling back state and territory vaccination hubs. “Whilst we recognise that the state and territory vaccination hubs have taken nurses out of hospitals, aged care, and other health settings, it is critical that state and territory governments continue to run these clinics to ensure adequate access to vaccines for Australians needing their booster shot,” he said. Figures from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia show in the week leading up to the announcement, just under 20,000 vaccinations a day were delivered. On Tuesday, that figure rose to 40,000. At the same time, the guild has warned that vastly fewer pharmacies will be participating in the rollout of boosters, down from 3,400 pharmacies in the initial rollout to 1,900, due to the government’s low level of remuneration. Victorian branch president, Anthony Tassone, said the rate of $16 per booster dose was seen as “not sufficient to cover the true costs of delivery of the program”. Access issues are particularly pronounced in rural areas. Megan Belot, the president of Rural Doctors Association of Australia, said the access to booster shots for rural patients has been disappointing. “We are hearing stories that some state vaccination hubs in regional and rural areas are not getting access to the booster shot in a timely manner,” Belot said. She said the issue was especially concerning for rural and remote frontline healthcare professionals, because booster shots are vital to avoid hospitalisation and putting increased strain on an already burdened system. Belot said there was strain on rural and remote hospitals at the best of times even before the Covid-19 pandemic and that many rural and regional hospitals did not have intensive care units to treat severe Covid-19 cases. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rebecca McGowan, a rural GP in Albury, says organising booster shots for her patients has been a “shambles.” She said for GPs to only find out on a Sunday evening, at the same time as the public, that booster shots would be pushed forward meant that by Monday morning she was inundated with calls from patients asking to be booked in. McGowan has had difficulty securing booster shot appointments for her patients, because she has had to prove that she has appointments booked for a full clinic two weeks in advance of being able to secure the supply. “We keep being told GPs are partners, but we’re not being treated as equal partners, but more like an afterthought,” McGowan said. She said there was added pressure for rural GPs because of the difficulty of staffing the clinics, especially as the booster shot program will now be running alongside vaccinating children. GPs like McGowan in the Albury-Wodonga area also face the challenge of having patients who straddle two states. Belot said another problem was programs that attempt to vaccinate remote populations in a two-day period often don’t accommodate those who are occupied with farming activities and can’t fit into the allocated window. In Melbourne, Prof Mark Stoove from the Burnet Institute warned of a slower take-up in lower socioeconomic areas if the booster program was again run through pharmacies and GPs. Until October, when there was a targeted campaign from state and local governments, Melbourne’s vaccine rollout ran along socioeconomic lines, with age, disadvantage and access to GPs mixing to create a perfect Covid cocktail. In August, Delta was rapidly spreading through Melbourne’s northern suburbs as some of the state’s lowest socioeconomic LGAs lagged on vaccination rates. “There will still be issues concerning the availability, according to the distribution of GPs and pharmacies,” Stoove said. “Certain areas have a lower density of GPs and pharmacies, so if the booster rollout primarily occurs through those avenues we will come across those problems.” In August the LGA of Hume had one of the lowest vaccination rates and highest daily case numbers. One of the key reasons was the low number of GP clinics per population. As vaccination rates caught up, the state has peeled back its hubs in the area, but councillor Joseph Haweil, who was mayor during the outbreak, says the community can’t rely on a GP-driven model. “Just how little supply and support there was through the GP system, I’m worried that is replicated again,” Haweil said. “I don’t think we can afford to have that happen again.” Cohealth is a not-for-profit on the frontline of the vaccine rollout in Victoria. It targets communities that have access issues and in the last six months, they’ve set up vaccination pop-up clinics in more than 50 separate locations. Cohealth’s community engagement manager Emit Taylor said it was too early to tell what barriers would have to be addressed with the booster rollout. “We’re still not quite in booster town,” Taylor, who uses they/them pronouns said. “We’re not quite sure what the hesitations will be.” Cohealth is tailoring its approach to each community, making sure language and access barriers are broken down. Taylor said there was a lot of work done to make strong community connections before the service will set up a pop-up – which will be essential when the need for boosters becomes more prominent."

          "bodyText": "That’s it from me, but I’ll leave you with Ed Aarons’ report from Carrow Road. Thanks for your company and emails - goodnight. There’s one other Premier League game tonight, and I’m afraid the score is not pretty. At the final whistle, a beaming Steven Gerrard embraces Chukwuemeka. It’s four wins out of six for Gerrard now, though that doesn’t tell the full story - the two defeats were to Manchester City and Liverpool, games they were always likely to lose. It’s still early, and we’ll all look stupid if he’s out of a job by March, but all the early evidence suggests there is a lot of substance to his work. And that he has inherited a cracking squad. Peep peep! That’s another really good win for Steven Gerrard, whose Villa side played with purpose, intensity and authority. The full-backs were a constant menace, Matty Cash in particular; the admirable Ollie Watkins made one, scored one and stopped running for approximately two seconds of the entire match; and, best of all, two of Villa’s brightest young talents had moments to remember. Jacob Ramsey, 20, ran 70 yards to score the opening goal, and then Carney Chukwuemeka, 18, came off the bench to make the second for Watkins. 90 min Five minutes of added time. 88 min Axel Tuanzebe replaces John McGinn. Matty Cash, who has had a storming game, came across to intercept a pass towards Pukki and then clipped a superb long pass down the left wing to Chukwuemeka. He muscled Gilmour aside, shifted the ball away from Sorensen in the area and slid a precise cross that gave Watkins an open goal at the far post. Watkins deserves that goal for another selfless, indefatigable performance, but really the night belongs to Villa’s youngsters - Ramsey scored the first goal, Chukwuemeka made the second. Ollie Watkins secures three points for Villa after lovely play from the teenager Carney Chukwuemeka! 84 min: Vital tackle from Williams! Cash plays the ball through the inside-right channel for the tireless Watkins. He holds onto it while waiting for Cash to charge into the area and then plays a short return pass. Cash surges thrillingly away from Byram and Williams and is about to shoot when Williams snakes his left leg round to make a goal-saving tackle. 83 min That’s Buendia’s last contribution. He is replaced by Carney Chukwuemeka, and is booed off by the Norwich fans. 82 min There’s a break in play while Cash receives treatment. He was caught in the face by his teammate Buendia, in fact, as they jumped for a cross with a Norwich player. 79 min Nothing much to report. Norwich are huffing and puffing - and this is definitely their best spell - but they still haven’t really worked Martinez. 76 min Another change for Norwich: Kieran Dowell replaces Przemyslaw Placheta. 75 min Buendia almost makes it 2-0! McGinn’s pass to Ings ricochets around the area until Watkins takes control and tees up Buendia. He rifles a first-time shot that is crucially blocked by a combination of Aarons and Williams. 75 min For trhe first time, Villa are spending long periods of the game in their own half. They are keeping Norwich at arm’s length, though, and I doubt Steven Gerrard will be unduly worried. 72 min Gilmour drives the resulting free-kick flat and hard towards the penalty spot, where Idah flicks a header straight at Martinez. That was one of Norwich’s best chances tonight, even if that isn’t necessarily saying much./ 71 min McGinn fouls Placheta and hurts himself in the process. He’s limping but is going to continue. 70 min Plachets wins another corner for Norwich. They’ve played with greater urgency since half-time, though they still haven’t really troubled Martinez. And they’re not about to start, because the corner has been headed away at the near post. 68 min The defender was Aarons, in fact, and he didn’t get the ball. The way their legs collided was slightly hard to read, though, and it certainly wasn’t a clear and obvious error. 67 min Villa appeal for a penalty when Watkins goes over in the Norwich area. Nothing doing. I don’t think it was a foul, though I’d like to see it again to be sure. I’m confident it wasn’t a dive; I think he just slipped as he tried to go past Sorensen (I think). 64 min Brandon Williams is booked for pulling back Cash, who has troubled him all game. 62 min Villa are now playing with Watkins on the left, Buendia on the right and Ings up front. 61 min And a change for Norwich: Adam Idah replaces Todd Cantwell, who walks straight down the tunnel in a huff. 59 min A Villa change: Danny Ings replaces Ashley Young, 36. 58 min Cantwell, who has looked brighter in the second half, wins another corner on the left. But Gilmour’s inswinger is claimed with ease by Martinez. He must be such a calming influence on the defenders in front of him. 57 min “With managers, sometimes you just know,” says Jason in Sydney. “Especially when you’ve been watching your team for ages. In this case, the changes are stark. It’s not just the players getting a short-term bounce, the whole tactics and approach have changed. That’s why Villa fans are excited (and we loved Dean Smith, so that’s saying something).” I suspect you’re right, though I recall Everton fans saying exactly the same thing when Roberto Martinez took over from David Moyes. 56 min Byram overruns the ball and then ploughs through Mings, a clear yellow card. 55 min McGinn, on the right, swings one of his booming crosses beyond the far post. Watkins gets to it and plants a downward header that is saved with his right leg by the well positioned Krul. 54 min The right-back Cash drills a long pass across the field to the left-back Targett, who takes it inside on the run and then drags the bouncing ball wide of goal from 20 yards. It was another example of how important the full-backs are to Villa, though - even in a back four, they are effectively wing-backs. 53 min This is a strange incident. Buendia’s long-range shot hits Aarons on the arm just outside the area. Aarons goes down holding his face, and the referee, thinking it’s ahead injury, stops play. It was only apparent on the replay that it hit his arm rather than his head. I’m not sure what he was playing at because it was outside the area, so there was no danger of a penalty. 51 min: Chance for McLean! This might get the crowd going. Young plays a short backpass that is read well by McLean, but then he gets caught in two minds - possibly put off by the appreciable presence of Martinez bearing down on him - and pokes tamely wide from 15 yards. 50 min Konsa is booked for delaying a Norwich free-kick. 49 min Norwich give away a few free-kicks at the start of the second half, which adds to the crowd’s frustration. 46 min Peep peep! Norwich begin the second half. “I’m on a remote island in Fiji where the mobile service is spotty enough to preclude any streaming, so Rob, your comments are all I have to go on,” says Andrew James. “As a Villa fan, I feel for Dean Smith as he’s obviously a good manager, but Gerrard clearly looks like an upgrade already.” As impressive as he has been, both in interviews and through his team’s performances, I’d be loath to jump to a conclusion like that after only five and a half games – with managers, novelty has a nasty habit of wearing off. Peep peep! There are a few boos at the half-time whistle. That seems a bit harsh, whatever the poverty of Norwich’s performance. Villa have been excellent, hungrier and more purposeful, and deserve the lead given them by Jacob Ramsey’s memorable solo goal. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45+3 min Pukki’s excellent cross on the turn is put behind at the near post by Douglas Luiz. It’s swung beyond the far post, where the backpedalling McLean can only loop a gentle header into the arms of Martinez. 45+1 min Kabak is replaced by Sam Byram. He goes into midfield, with Jacob Sorensen moving to centre-back. 45+1 min Four minutes of added time. 45 min More injury woes for Norwich: Ozan Kabak is down with an ankle problem, and I’m not sure he’ll be able to continue. 42 min There are a few groans from the home fans when Cantwell gives the ball away. They are missing a few key players, we shouldn’t forget that, but Norwich have been poor tonight. 41 min McGinn almost scores from the resulting corner! It was a deep, booming inswinger, possibly deliberate, that almost caught Tim Krul out. Krul backpedalled desperately and leapt to flap it over the bar. 40 min Targett’s sharp cutback finds Ramsey in the D. He mishits a first-time shot, under pressure from Cantwell, and Williams shins it over his own bar. That was an important intervention because Watkins was waiting behind him. 39 min Cantwell wanders over to the right to win a corner, but McLean curls it straight into sizeable hands of Emi Martinez. Ramsey was 20 yards inside his own half when the move started. He played it forward to Watkins on the halfway line, who returned it to Ramsey with a deft touch just before he was taken out. Ramsey had no support at all so he just kept running, all the way into the Norwich area as the last man Gibson backpedalled in an attempt to buy some times. Once he was inside the area Ramsey moved the ball away from Gibson and Aarons, onto his left foot, and rattled it past Krul at the near post. The defending wasn’t the best, in truth, but let’s accentuate the positive: it was a lovely goal from a brilliant young player. Jacob Ramsey gives Villa the lead with a fine individual goal! 31 min Placheta is fouled 35 yards from goal by Douglas Luiz. Gilmour clips the free-kick to the far post, where the under-pressure Sorensen heads straight at Martinez. It wasn’t much of a chance. 30 min When play eventually resumes, Douglas Luiz’s outswinging corner from the right leads to a penalty appeal when Pukki tries a wrestling manouevre on Konsa. VAR aren’t interested. That could easily have been given, even if Konsa made the most of it. 28 min There’s a break in play with Ramsey receives treatment. Not sure what happened but it looks like an impact injury and I think he’s okay. 26 min Watkins has a shot blocked, and then Cash’s cross is taken off Young’s toes in the six-yard box by Kabak. That was superb defending from Kabak, who read the play and came across to the near post in the nick of time. 23 min Gilmour cracks a superb angled pass into the area for Pukki, who can’t control it on the run. He looked offside, in truth, though the flag didn’t go up. It wasn’t the easiest ball to take, because Gilmour had to hit it with pace for it to get to Pukki, but it was still a chance. 20 min Cash’s cross is desperately cleared to the edge of the area, where Douglas Luiz’s shot is blocked. Targett volleys the rebound high and wide. 20 min “There’s just something inherently pleasing about watching 20 players on a football field wearing those two classic kits,” says Kári Tulinius. “Like how, for example, seeing Argentina face Nigeria just oozes worldcupness, Norwich City v Aston Villa is just so very English top-flight.” 19 min Buendia beats McLean to a loose ball in the Norwich area and wins another corner. As Martin Keown says on BT Sport, Villa have looked sharper than Norwich - especially off the ball - in the first 20 minutes. 17 min At the other end McGinn curls a terriific pass over the top for Watkins, who wins a corner off Gibson. 15 min After a difficult start, Norwich are having an even share of the game. A very deep cross from the right is met by McLean, whose sweet volley hits Cash and goes behind for a corner. 14 min “That March 1993 table in the preamble makes for some fascinating reading,” says Matt Burtz. “Norwich were second-highest scorers with 50 goals, but they only had a +1 goal difference because they had let in 49, the same number as 18th placed Crystal Palace. Manchester United ended up winning by 10 points but sat in third with a +24 goal difference and a game in hand. How they weren’t running away with the league at that point is seemingly a mystery.” Their season didn’t really start until they signed Eric Cantona at the end of November, at which point they were eighth and barely averaging a goal a game. Norwich were great that season, though they did take some punishment - 7-1 at Blackburn, 4-1 at Liverpool, 5-1 at Spurs I think. 11 min Williams moves down the left wing and is fouled, at least in the opinion of the referee, by McGinn. Gilmour’s free-kick is headed away to the edge of the area, where Cantwell mishits a volley into the ground and well off target. 8 min: Good save from Krul! McGinn receives the ball 40 yards from goal and pushes it forward. Nobody comes to him, so he has another touch and hits a swirling, dipping shot that is pushed over by the backpedalling Krul. 5 min This has been a terrific start from Villa. After some nice passing on the right, Cash shapes a dangerous cross that just evades Watkins in the middle. 4 min Villa have started with Buendia on the left and Young on the right. Both have licence to move infield, not least because it creates space for Targett and Cash to bomb on from full-back. 3 min Villa have started aggressively, swarming the Norwich players every time they lose possession. 2 min Douglas Luiz’s corner is poor. Villa keep the ball alive, though, and Watkins plants a header straight at Krul from 15 yards. 1 min Villa win a corner after 35 seconds, with Brandon Williams making a good challenge on the raiding Matty Cash. 1 min Peep peep! After the players take a knee, Villa kick off from left to right. Norwich make four changes from the team that lost 1-0 to Manchester United on Saturday: Ben Gibson, Brandon Williams, Jacob Sorensen and Todd Cantwell replace Grant Hanley (injured), Josh Sargent (not sure but he’s not on the bench), Lukas Rupp (likewise) and Dimitris Giannoulis. One change for Villa: the injured Marvelous Nakamba is replaced by Emi Buendia, with Jacob Ramsey moving back into midfield. A number of Villa players who were on the bench at Anfield aren’t in the squad tonight: Jed Steer, Morgan Sanson and Anwar El-Ghazi. Norwich City (4-3-3) Krul; Aarons, Kabak, Gibson, Williams; Gilmour, Sorensen, McLean; Placheta, Pukki, Cantwell. Substitutes: Gunn, Byram, Mumba, Giannoulis, Tomkinson, Dowell, Idah, Dickson-Peters, Rowe. Aston Villa (4-3-3) Martinez; Cash, Konsa, Mings, Targett; McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Ramsey; Buendia, Watkins, Young. Substitutes: Marschall, Tuanzebe, Hause, Trezeguet, Iroegbunam, Philogene-Bidace, Carney Chukwuemeka, Ings, Archer. Referee David Coote. On 24 March 1993, as the business end of the inaugural Premier League season approached, Norwich City met Aston Villa at Carrow Road in a potential title decider. John Polston scored a late winner which, coupled with Manchester United’s nervy 0-0 draw at home to Arsenal, put Norwich top of the table going into the international break. Turned out the match wasn’t a decider for second place, never mind first. Norwich finished third and Aston Villa second, but it’s nice to remember that they were front and centre in the first Premier League title race. Especially as it briefly distracts us from the imminent cancellation of Christmas and probably the first few months of 2022. There are a handful of Covid cases across the Norwich and Villa squads, though not enough for the game to be postponed. There might be a slightly strange atmosphere at Carrow Road - partly because of Omicron (it’ll be interesting to see the attendance) but also because of the reunions. Dean Smith meets his first love six weeks after they dumped him, while Emi Buendia returns to Carrow Road for the first time since joining Villa in the summer. Both teams have had been in decent form since changing their manager. Villa have taken nine points from five matches under Steven Gerrard, and lost by a single goal to Manchester City and Liverpool in the other games. I don’t suppose we can say Norwich have had a new manager bounce, as they are bottom, but they’ve played well under Smith and could have beaten Manchester United at the weekend. A win tonight would lift Norwich to 18th; a victory for Villa would move them from 13th to ninth. It’s on. Kick off 7.45pm."

          "bodyText": "My friend Wendy Rogerson, who has died aged 91 of systemic sclerosis, was a nurse who spent three challenging, dangerous, but hugely rewarding years running a clinic in Borneo. Born Rhoda Grey (but always known as Wendy) in Newcastle to Elsie (nee Gregg) and the Rev Maurice Grey, Wendy grew up in her father’s parishes in Amble and Stannington, Northumberland, attending the Duchess’s school in Alnwick. Her younger brother, Joe, went to boarding school. Wendy trained as a nurse at Charing Cross hospital in London in 1948, did her midwifery back in Newcastle, and enjoyed her job as a health visitor, living in the lively Newcastle suburb of Jesmond. She then read about two men, indigenous Dayaks from Sarawak, Borneo, who had established an Anglican mission amongst the Dusun people in what was then British North Borneo (now part of Malaysia) and needed a teacher and a nurse to complete their team. She spent a year at the College of the Ascension, Selly Oak, founded by the SPG (now the USPG – United Society Partners in the Gospel) before sailing to Borneo in September 1959. It took five days to sail upriver from Sandakan to her new home of Tongod in the remote interior. By now the mission included a school for 60 pupils. Wendy and the teacher Joan Goodricke shared a simple hut – a raised structure with bark walls, a palm-leaf roof and a slatted bamboo floor – and were visited at various times by snakes, rats and scorpions. While medical treatment had been the preserve of the local medicine woman, people were soon flocking to Wendy and, as the only practitioner for hundreds of miles, she worked from dawn to dusk. Dysentery, scabies, ringworm, malaria and a disfiguring disease, yaws, were all rife. On several occasions, Wendy had to become anaesthetist and surgeon to save her patients’ lives. Wendy met Colin Rogerson, a curate, while home on furlough in October 1962. They married the following February and their daughters, Catherine and Jane, were born in 1963 and 1966. Wendy supported her husband in his parishes in the Newcastle and Durham dioceses as well as taking on senior roles in the Mothers’ Union. She was also a prison visitor and a Samaritan. On retiring to Durham, she and Colin attended the city’s lively St Nics church. Wendy returned to Borneo in 1985 and 2003, with each of her daughters, when old friends and patients travelled many miles to see her. In 2018 I helped Wendy to turn her diaries into the book Midwife of Borneo. She is survived by Colin, Catherine and Jane. Joe predeceased her."

Analysis of long-term data for the annual National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (Naplan) National Report 2021 – found significant and growing gaps between some demographics, including along gender lines, between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, and those in metro and regional areas. The full 360-page report, released on Wednesday, follows high-level data in August which indicated that students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in 2021 continued to perform on par with students in 2019, despite lockdowns and periods of remote learning through 2020. The Naplan tests were not conducted in 2020 due to nationwide lockdowns. The 2021 tests were administered in May, before the Delta outbreak in Sydney that resulted in further months-long remote schooling periods in both New South Wales and Victoria. Analysts have said that no statistically significant changes were observed at a national and state or territory level in the data between 2019 and 2021, which encompasses the first major wave of Covid outbreaks across Australia, and Victoria’s extended second lockdown. But they urged caution on interpreting the data based on only two rounds of testing, saying patterns and changes were more likely to become apparent over many years. Guardian Australia previously reported concerns from teachers that the compounded effects of two years of intermittent learning in some areas are only just beginning to become apparent, especially for younger cohorts (up to grade 2) that are not captured by the Naplan dataset. David de Carvalho, chief executive of the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (Acara), which runs Naplan, said it was important to resist the temptation to draw conclusions from only two years of data. “You’ve got to be really careful about drawing distinctions based on simply comparing 2019 with 2021,” de Carvalho said. “It would be very tempting to do so but one has to be very cautious. “The changes that you might see between 2019 and 2021 might actually be quite consistent with previous years, and might actually simply be the continuation of a pattern that’s been in place for some time.” Acara’s long term analysis of the Naplan data showed gaps between male and female students in reading, writing and numeracy were growing, with girls increasingly outperforming boys in reading and writing, and boys increasingly doing better in numeracy. The gender gap is larger in secondary school students than primary for writing, the analysis showed. Gaps between metropolitan schools and those in regional and remote areas were also growing, with city-based students increasingly outperforming regional students. The gaps in numeracy and reading have gradually widened since 2016 for most year levels, with metropolitan students just under six months ahead of their regional counterparts in grades 3 and 5, and almost a full year ahead in grades 7 and 9. The gap is even wider between metropolitan and remote students, with those in remote areas behind by an equivalent of approximately three years of schooling, the analysis showed. The gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students has remained extremely wide since 2016, representing a difference equivalent to two full years of schooling. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Since the tests were first administered in 2008 and 2011 for writing, Australian students nationally have significantly improved in years 3 and 5 reading, year 5 numeracy, and years 3 and 5 spelling, equivalent to a term’s worth of learning, de Carvalho said. But the long-term analysis also suggested that educational disadvantage can be multigenerational, with children whose parents did not complete year 12 comprising the main cohort of those falling behind the national average. Acara reported there were indications in the data that gaps between “high and low socio-educational groups” were widening between 2019 and 2021, but that further analysis was required to determine whether those shifts were related to Covid or not. Approximately 70% of the 5.86m Naplan tests were taken online this year as the program transitions to a completely digital delivery, which will take effect next year. Acara reiterated that Naplan tests are only one aspect of educational assessment and do not replace the extensive, ongoing assessments made by teachers about individual student performance."

          "headline": "Denmark and Norway rush in stricter Covid measures as cases soar",
          "bodyText": "Denmark and Norway have announced stricter Covid measures to battle soaring infection numbers, as authorities said the new Omicron variant was spreading fast and would probably become dominant in several EU countries within weeks or even days. Amid a varied continental picture that includes sharply declining case numbers in many countries, the two Scandinavian governments said they expected daily infections would soon exceed all previous records as the highly transmissible variant combined with and fuelled a wave still largely driven by the previous Delta mutation. Denmark, which like Britain carries out extensive rapid genetic sequencing to detect variants, is second only to the UK in the number of confirmed cases of the mutation, with 3,473 cases identified in a population of 5.8 million of which 80.6% are double jabbed. The Danish government, which last week said schools and colleges would close early, curbed nightlife and promoted remote working, on Tuesday began offering booster shots to all over-40s six weeks earlier than planned in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The national health authority on Monday reported a 50% increase in the number of new weekly cases, the highest since the start of the pandemic, with daily infections hitting 7,799, double the number on the same day last week. While the surge was driven mostly by the Delta variant, it said Omicron was forecast to become dominant in the capital, Copenhagen, from this week, and nationwide soon afterwards. In Norway, authorities said Omicron was “becoming established and will dominate” across the country before Christmas. Norwegian officials have warned Omicron could infect between 90,000 and 300,000 people a day within the next three weeks unless new measures proved effective, compared with a previous peak of about 1,000, while hospital admissions could reach twice their previous level. Norway has registered record numbers of infections and hospital admissions in recent days, among them 958 Omicron cases reported on Monday, including 472 in the capital, Oslo. The prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, warned of a serious situation. A combination of the still-dominant Delta variant and the fast-spreading Omicron would create “a total saturation of the national health system”, Støre said, announcing on Monday evening that booster shots were to be brought forward for health workers and all over-45s. The prime minister also announced that from Wednesday, bars and restaurants would no longer serve alcohol, remote working would be compulsory where possible, mask mandates would be extended and access to pools and gyms restricted. “There is no doubt, the new variant really changes the rules. That’s why we need to act fast and we need to act again,” Støre said. “For many this will feel like a lockdown, if not of society then of their lives and of their livelihoods.” Elsewhere in Europe, infection numbers in countries that endured significant waves last month, before Omicron emerged – including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as central and eastern European nations such as Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Croatia – have fallen sharply. However, officials in France, where there are also signs that the pace of a rapid recent surge may be starting to slow, have warned Omicron will almost certainly fuel a sixth wave, while cases in countries in southern Europe that largely escaped the autumn wave are starting to rise rapidly. Martin Hirsch, the head of Paris’s AP-HP hospitals group, Europe’s largest hospital system, said on Monday France should prepare for an Omicron-driven wave of infections starting in January, while Belgium’s chief epidemiologist said he expected a fresh surge to start “around about new year’s time”. Despite steadily falling case numbers, the Dutch government was expected on Tuesday to announce schools would close a week early for Christmas as infections remained high and hospitals struggled with a wave of patients. Restaurants, bars, non-essential stores and other public places have been closed from 5pm to 5am in the Netherlands since late November in an attempt to slow the virus’s spread. Experts have said Denmark’s advanced sequencing capacity – the country has developed a quick genetic test for Omicron, and is screening every positive test for the variant – provides a uniquely comprehensive picture of how the variant is spreading, and should serve as a warning of what is to come elsewhere in Europe. Researchers at the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen estimated in a report this week that Omicron cases in Denmark were doubling every two days, with about three-quarters of infections reported in people who have received two vaccine doses. They predicted the variant would push daily infections to more than 10,000 by the end of this week, with numbers rising further and hospitals coming under pressure even if, as most scientists believe, Omicron is less virulent than earlier variants – but said their modelling did not account for the impact of booster shots. • This article was amended on 15 December 2021 to clarify that early school closures were announced in Denmark last week; they did not happen then."

          "headline": "Sadiq Khan leads ambitious plans to rewild Hyde Park",
          "bodyText": "Hyde Park could be redesigned and lost species including beavers reintroduced to London under ambitious rewilding plans. The city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, is working with Ben Goldsmith – a member of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the brother of Khan’s former rival for the mayoral election Zac Goldsmith – to boost nature in the capital, including making the royal parks wilder and encouraging people to plant green rooftops. Ben Goldsmith said the plans would involve “more wild spaces, more scrub, river rewiggling and species reintroductions”. Khan has released £600,000 in funding to assist the project, which will help London reach its net zero goal. Further fundraising will take place, with members of the new London rewilding roundtable group tasked with sourcing private donations. Goldsmith said: “I’m so excited to be working with Sadiq on this new rewilding taskforce for London. All people need to experience close connection with nature in their lives, and yet for many Londoners this is a remote possibility today. “From green rooftops to pocket parks, nest boxes for peregrines and swifts, rewiggling streams and reintroducing long lost native species, our plan is to weave wild nature back through the very fabric of our city.” There are 1,600 places designated by local authorities as sites of importance for nature conservation, covering 20% of the capital. These include Richmond Park, Sydenham Hill Wood and the downlands in Bromley and Croydon that inspired Charles Darwin’s discoveries. At the moment, just half of these are deemed appropriately managed to conserve or enhance the wildlife. The project will focus on 20-30 of these sites to protect species including stag beetles, sparrows, peregrine falcons and water voles. Khan has stated an aim for all Londoners to live within a 10-minute walk of green space, with this scheme aiming to connect existing spaces so everyone in the capital can enjoy nature. It is also hoped the work will help tackle problems that plague Londoners including flooding and air pollution. Improving floodplains, rewiggling streams and boosting the health of rivers can alleviate floods, and planting more greenery can ease air pollution. Khan said: “The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. In London, we need to take bold action to ensure we not only halt the decline of biodiversity in our natural environment but pave the way for growth and change. “That’s why I’ve announced my new rewilding fund, which will help restore the capital’s precious wildlife sites, improve biodiversity and ensure all Londoners have a thriving web of nature on their doorstep. And as part of our green new deal, we’re supporting young Londoners to gain the skills required for jobs that help secure a future for London’s natural environment.” Nature campaigners have been trying to add wildlife back to London, with a beaver group comprising Wildlife Trusts, the Beaver Trust and Citizen Zoo working on how to return the species to the capital. The community wilding group Citizen Zoo is also involved with projects to return grasshoppers and water voles to areas in the city in which they have been depleted or lost."

          "headline": "You hate your job – what next? The two writers exploring toxic productivity",
          "bodyText": "Ever wonder why, with every new piece of so-called productivity enhancing technology we adopt, we just end up with more, not less work? Slack was supposed to get rid of email – only now we find time to email and reply to our co-workers on Slack. Email was supposed to free us from reading through lengthy paper documents everyday, but we now email ourselves the pdfs home to read in the quiet hours after work. And smart phones? Don’t even get me started. A lot of us find ourselves replying to our bosses on the bus, while putting our kids to sleep, or even, God forbid, on the toilet. Out of Office, a new book by journalists Charlie Wartzel and Anne Helen Petersen, explores why productivity culture has been so successful at making us working more, not less. And with millions either quitting their jobs or having to work from home, they ask how we can capitalize on this moment for the good of workers, not our bosses. I talked to Warzel and Petersen over – what else? – Zoom the week their book launched. Everybody seems very fed up with their jobs right now. Why do you think that is? Charlie Warzel: For years, people in knowledge work have wanted flexibility in their jobs. And they were told by their bosses that offices are this nucleus of productivity that holds the fabric of our organization together. And then the pandemic comes, we all get forced into this experiment, and productivity doesn’t suffer – workers pull it off. And I think there’s this realization: “Okay, so, if that was bullshit, what else about this arrangement is bullshit?” Anne Helen Petersen: All of these people quitting – what is that if not a general strike? People are coming together to say: We will not work as waitresses for this pay anymore. We will not work as childcare workers for this sort of treatment. There’s something more to life than my ability to reply to emails. If people can harness that energy, then it could change the way that work is moving forward. I loved the bit of the book where you talk about how many hours of work people spend actually doing their core jobs. CW: That was a wild thing. We weren’t like “confess how much you actually work.” And yet somewhere in the survey, 80% of the people were like, “I just got to tell you, I only do real work three hours a week, like when my kids go to bed on Thursday night”, or “Oh, shit, I didn’t do anything this week.” This book came at a very annoying time for me, because I was reading it during an exceptionally busy work week. I was like, “Yes! I’m going to redesign my life!” But then I was like, “Oh, wait, I need money.” AHP: Ideally, we still get money. But how can you figure out how to work less, but still make sure you are doing [what’s required of you]? I think it’s possible. If you can figure out the balance so that when you are working, the work is great and when you’re not working, you’re not thinking about your work all the time. Do you think it’s possible for somebody who is on a minimum wage? AHP: The fetishization of work is a very bourgeois thing. Office workers are very bad at understanding themselves as labour. [Their work] is an expression of self, instead of the work that they do. Whereas other jobs have something that says: “This is how many hours I work a day. And when I’m done, I’m done.” When I was a nanny, there was no way for me to think about being a better nanny, I could have gone to classes but it would have had no influence on how much I was paid when my job was done. Now that I think about it … often when I have tried to work less, I have felt like I don’t have a personality anymore. AHP: We – especially millennials – have poured ourselves into school, work, success – if you take away some of those parts of your identity, what is left? CW: It’s like, really fucking traumatic, that self audit. When I started doing it, I said to myself: I’m one of the luckiest people! I have a job I like, I am succeeding in it, I’m marching up the career ladder. And yet at the core [I’m] pretty miserable. But when I really started doing the inventory of [my work life balance], it was deeply upsetting. I didn’t know what my hobbies were. I realised I was like a ladder-climbing robot to some degree. Well, yes! Even when I try to work less, I spend most of my time thinking about how I’m going to be a better worker. What time I will go to bed to be fresh for work? Should I have a drink the night before work? Should I go for a run to make my mind clearer for work? AHP: That’s a perfect example of work being the primary axis of your life, right? All decisions are made so that you can be better at work. When you de-centre work, you can be like, “Okay, I’m not drinking tonight because I just want to feel good.” You have a section in the book about how corporations give us “wellness activities” instead of time off, and it made me laugh. I’m staying with a friend at the moment, and she has been working non-stop; she has a very demanding job in the banking sector. I came into the kitchen earlier, and she took out her headphones and said she couldn’t talk because she was doing a company wellness exercise – she was meditating on a screen that she’d already been looking at for the last 12 hours. AHP: Totally, that’s the worst example of companies trying to give lip service to balance with these programs: the best way to promote wellness in your organisation is to encourage people not to work – but that’s counter to the capitalist ethos. Are you happy now that you have both de-centered work in your lives? CW: I find it very similar to going to therapy or to exercise: there isn’t one day when someone says, “Congratulations, you’re in shape, you never have to do this again.” I have weeks when I relapse into my old work habits, where work is the only way I can feel self-worth or value; I slip back into the warm security blanket of letting work define me. That deprogramming takes a lot of time. I am happier, but I don’t want to make it sound like a fairy tale. Like anything, you’re gonna have good days and bad days. You say we’re at a crossroads. If we go one way, the pandemic and the shift to working from home for some people will present an opportunity to work 12-hour days under increasing surveillance. Or we have a chance to change our relationship with work. How do you take steps towards choosing the latter? AHP: Institutions are going to be really resistant to changing their way of doing things. If that’s the case – if all of the signals show the way that you succeed in this organization is through burning yourself out and through removing all sorts of boundaries between life and work – leave that organization. Start looking for a different job now, because the relationship is broken. CW: But I also think it’s exciting – I spoke to an HR consultant who tries to diagnose toxic corporate cultures. And they were saying the one constant across industries right now is that they’re freaking out. Superiors are scrambling – they don’t want these mass resignations. I think we’re starting to see glimmers of worker power in ways that we haven’t before. And it doesn’t seem to just be office workers either – the hospitality industry is quitting en masse; teachers are quitting; nurses are quitting. CW: It’s bigger than remote work. It’s this type of reckoning happening everywhere. It’s the conceptualization of what these jobs ought to mean to us, and what we owe [our bosses] and what they owe us. I bet loads of people are saying to you, “You’ve got a Substack newsletter, you wrote a book together, Anne has recently published a seven part series of articles in Vox. You’re always working!” AHP: Now is a bad time, right? Because we’re doing all this press for work. So we’re doing work all the time. CW: The difference for me is that before, I spent so much of my time performatively working. I would often not have anything to do between three o’clock and six when I left the office, and I would just sit around and fire off emails to make people feel like I was working, causing other work for other people. Walking up to people and having meetings about things that weren’t meetings. I don’t do that anymore."

          "bodyText": "Mahershala Ali gives a heartfelt performance in this elegant and rather melancholy sci-fi mystery with which Irish film-maker Benjamin Cleary makes his impressive feature debut. It’s an unsettling picture in the tradition of John Frankenheimer’s Seconds or Alex Garland’s Ex Machina. The time is the not-too-distant future in which Cameron (Ali) is a graphic designer married to Poppy (Naomie Harris), whom he met-cute one morning on a commuter train over a misunderstanding concerning a candy bar (a micro-comedy-of-errors routine which I do have to say has already been used in a number of short films). They now have a small son. But Cameron has a terminal illness and fears revealing it to Poppy will devastate her, as she is only just getting over a family tragedy. So he secretly approaches a new biotech firm headed by the enigmatic Dr Scott (Glenn Close), who specialises in creating perfect healthy carbon copies of people who can then slot right back into the patient’s life, an avatar with all his or her memories – minus the ones about this procedure – while the originals self-sacrificially live out their days on the remote island owned by this corporation. Now, of course, it’s an open question as to how the modestly-off Cameron could possibly afford what must be a terribly expensive business – but no matter. Maybe it’s on his insurance. Anyway, Cameron splitting into two, and then having profound and angry second thoughts about this doppelganger taking over his life, is very commandingly and convincingly portrayed. Some script hints in the early part of the film seem to be pointing to a certain icily ironic twist, but Cleary’s film keeps you guessing and there’s a strange, sad seriousness to it all which this great-looking movie brings off with some style. • Swan Song is released on 17 December in cinemas and on Apple TV+ • This article was amended on 16 December 2021 to change the rating from three to four stars."

          "bodyText": "Time to Walk Technically, any podcast you listen to while you walk is a walking podcast. But if you want to get specific, you should first address what you want. If you’re after a companion, try Apple’s Time to Walk series, which is available to Apple Fitness+ subscribers with an Apple Watch. In each episode, a star such as Stephen Fry, Naomi Campbell, Dolly Parton, Malcolm Gladwell or Nick Jonas talks about their careers and their attitudes to walking as they stroll around their neighbourhood. Obviously your enjoyment of this series will be directly linked to how much you like each presenter. But it is authentic in one way: just like spending any time with a celebrity, it’s always all about them and you’re never allowed to talk back. National Trust walking podcasts There are two ways to listen to the National Trust’s series of walking podcasts. Each episode takes place in a different part of the country – one in Box Hill, Surrey, another through an East Anglian fen, another on Long Nanny beach in Northumberland – where ranger Kate Martin enthusiastically discusses local history and legends. Ideally, you’d want to be right there with Martin, so that you can take in the surroundings together. But this is a warm and inviting listen, and you’d probably get just as much out of it as you trudge back from the school run. Walking Through Landscape This BBC Radio Scotland series is now more than a decade old, but it remains the high watermark of what this sort of podcast can achieve. In every episode geologist Iain Stewart visits a different part of Scotland, from the forests of Moray to the fishing villages of Fife. The expectation again seems to be that you will track the same walk as Stewart as you listen – episodes begin with reminders that you’ll need a map – but just ignore that. This is an exploration of nature in all its quiet, awe-inspiring glory. Headspace Walking Meditation If you are walking to relax, it’s worth checking out the Headspace app. There are a number of different walking scenarios to choose from – nature, the city, home – but they’re all rooted in basic mindfulness techniques. You head out and a calming voice reminds you to pay attention to all the sights and sensations that would usually go ignored. The list of meditations includes one called Walk It Off which, in just 13 minutes, does a very good job of erasing the grot of your working day, and stops you dragging all your tension home with you. Walking Is Fitness And then there are those of us who still need to be motivated to walk … In this case, try Walking Is Fitness. Hosted by strolling fanatic Dave Paul, each 10-minute episode is accompanied by the brisk tempo of his footsteps as he discusses various aspects of walking for exercise. A podcast like this always runs the risk of overcooking the enthusiasm – you’re just walking, after all, not doing Zumba – but Dave keeps the tone just the right side of unbearable. If you need help getting out of the door, this is where you start."

          "bodyText": "With that, we’ll end our live coverage for today. Here’s a recap of today’s major news developments: The Australian and Victorian governments have announced a deal with Moderna to establish an mRNA vaccine facility in Melbourne by as early as 2024. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the emergent Omicron variant will not “take us back” to more Covid-19 restrictions, and Australia is now prepared to open up and live with the virus. The New South Wales government will push ahead with easing Covid restrictions, including those for unvaccinated people, from Wednesday despite epidemiologists urging caution amid rising case numbers and the Omicron variant. Tasmania is set to reopen to all vaccinated Australians on Wednesday. While businesses will welcome the tourists, some are concerned the health system won’t cope. Gina Cass-Gottlieb, treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s nomination for chair of the competition watchdog, may have to recuse herself from any decisions relating to one of the regulator’s biggest cases if she is approved for the job. A report into the Covidsafe contact-tracing app found it was used just 13 times in the past six months during the Delta outbreaks in NSW and Victoria. Have a great evening. We’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. One of Australia’s largest national disability insurance scheme providers has apologised to the residents of two troubled group homes after allegations of violence, abuse and neglect were aired at an inquiry. The commission also heard on Tuesday that Life Without Barriers charged residents at a Victoria home a substantial proportion of their disability pension for “rent” despite the property being leased on a peppercorn deal of $1 a month. During hearings in the past week, the disability royal commission has heard violence between residents at the Victoria group home run by the provider was so bad it had become “normal”, while there were also allegations of violence, sexual abuse, and neglect at another home in New South Wales. In one case aired at the commission last week, a resident in the NSW home was hospitalised with a bowel condition and “nearly died” after staff allegedly did not follow care protocol. The provider did not report the incident to the NDIS watchdog. In another incident, the commission heard a Life Without Barriers investigation found there was not enough evidence to substantiate claims a support worker pushed a client at the NSW home to the ground, even though the employee admitted doing so.

The 37-year-old’s lawyer, Lisa De Luca, said the man had been sent to hospital after pressure from her and other advocates for authorities to treat his illness as serious. De Luca said the man, an inmate at Junee correctional centre, 450km west of Sydney, was in a lot of pain, could not walk and had only been offered paracetamol for the infection, she said. “He’s in a bad way, he rang me yesterday,” De Luca said. “(The prison) are saying he saw a doctor. The GP said ‘yes you have an infection it’s in your hip replacement’. The client was in distress.” The lawyer contacted the prison multiple times, which she alleges played down the seriousness of the infection. Read more: The Morrison government has announced an $85m financial package to bolster Fiji’s economic recovery. The support follows a similar commitment last year of $83.5m, and will help the Fijian government finance essential services and support economic growth. The recovery package will have “a focus on fiscal management, private sector recovery, gender equality and social inclusion”, according to a joint statement. Fiji’s attorney-general and minister for economy, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, said: As a result of severe travel restrictions, the Covid-19 pandemic’s economic ramifications have been steep across the Pacific. We appreciate Australia’s confidence in Fiji’s financial management through this direct budgetary support that will help alleviate the socioeconomic burden on Fijian society. With more than 90% adults in Fiji now fully vaccinated –– owed in significant part to Australian-donated vaccines –– we look forward to a normalisation of trade and tourism that reconnects our region and allows our recovery to begin in earnest.” Foreign minister Marise Payne said: No country – big or small – has been immune to the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia is pleased to be supporting our close friend and neighbour, Fiji, as the country continues its economic recovery.” Forensic teams searching for evidence in relation to the disappearance of William Tyrrell will finish their operation in coming days. In mid-November, police began a renewed effort to search for evidence at multiple sites in Kendall, the town on the New South Wales mid-north coast where William went missing from the home of his foster grandmother in September 2014. When announcing the renewed search, police were upfront that they were searching for remains. Search sites have included the home where William was last seen, a nearby creek and bushland, with subterranean imaging equipment used to detect inconsistencies in soil. While forensic teams were seen bagging various pieces of cloth throughout the several weeks of searching that was hampered by rain, they are yet to make any announcements in relation the significance of any discoveries made during the dig. In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, NSW Police said: The NSW Police Force advise current inquiries and search operations being undertaken in the Kendall area are expected to be completed in coming days. The forensic search, which is being conducted under a Coronial Order as part of ongoing investigations into the disappearance of William Tyrrell, has been ongoing since Monday 15 November 2021. Once the search operation is complete, a team will facilitate a repatriation of the site. Further, forensic examinations of seized items and a significant quantity of soil remain ongoing. Deputy State Coroner Harriet Grahame has been appraised, and Strike Force Rosann detectives continue to prepare a brief for the information of Her Honour. Investigators would like to thank the NSW Rural Fire Service, Salvation Army, and the local community for their hospitality and assistance. The NSW Police Force remains committed to finding William Tyrrell and investigations by the Homicide Squad’s Strike Force Rosann are ongoing.” Western Australia’s health minister Roger Cook is speaking about potential Covid exposure in his state. Two truck drivers from South Australia who were in WA between 9-11 December have tested positive to Covid. Cook said close contacts will be notified and exposure sites listed later today. “At this stage we haven’t allocated any contacts as close contacts, they are simply contacts,” Cook said. Cook said authorities’ main concerns lie with the movements of one of the drivers. A baby girl is in a critical condition in hospital in Adelaide after contracting invasive meningococcal disease. The seven-month-old has the W strain of the disease, with seven of her close contacts receiving precautionary antibiotics, reports AAP. South Australia has reported 11 cases of meningococcal so far this year compared to five at the same time last year. The Northern Territory has detected four new Covid-19 cases in the community as an outbreak spreads towards the Western Australian border. One of the infections is linked to a cluster in the town of Katherine, 320km south of Darwin, reports AAP. The other three cases are unconfirmed, but Health Minister, Natasha Fyles, said they are very likely to be genuine infections due to the close contacts. Two of those are in remote Timber Creek near the WA border, 225km east of Kununurra, and the other one is in Kalkarindji, 550km south of Darwin. “Today’s case numbers are nowhere near as high as yesterday but we do expect more cases in the coming days,” Fyles said on Tuesday. It brings the current outbreak to 88 cases but that is expected to rise to 91 later in the day once the three infections are confirmed. It started when an infected woman illegally entered the NT in late October. People in Timber Creek have been ordered to wear a face mask in most public places until 2pm on Friday as a rapid response team prepares to travel to the town. A lockout in the Aboriginal community of Beswick, 425km southeast of Darwin, will end at 2pm Tuesday but masks will need to be worn until the same time on Friday. The mask order is also in place in nearby Barunga Aboriginal community, Katherine and the town of Tennant Creek, 990km south of Darwin. Earlier this afternoon, my colleague Josh Taylor wrote about how a report into the Covidsafe contact-tracing app found it was used just 13 times in the past six months during the Delta outbreaks in NSW and Victoria. Nationals senator Matt Canavan, appearing on ABC TV this afternoon, acknowledged the app spearheaded by his government didn’t work, and pointed out he has said this before. He said: That app didn’t work. You have to try different things when you have a global pandemic in front of you...It didn’t work but it was worth trying.” Half of all young people held in detention facilities in Australia are Indigenous and almost two-thirds have yet to be sentenced for a crime, new data shows. It comes after a commitment by Australian governments to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12, a move advocates and lawyers say does not go far enough to protect the most vulnerable children from the trauma of being incarcerated. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), released on Tuesday, found that 72% of the more than 800 children and young people held in detention on an average night in the June quarter this year were unsentenced – meaning they were either remanded in custody while awaiting the outcome of a court case or held in custody by police. It also found 50% of those in youth detention were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, despite Indigenous children making up just 6% of the 10-17 age cohort in the broader population. Indigenous children were jailed at 20 times the rate of non-Indigenous children as of June 2021 and were also more likely to be jailed without being sentenced and more likely to be under the age of 18 when incarcerated, the report showed.

But as Tasmanians prepare for the border with the rest of the nation to open fully on Wednesday, Bradley shares mixed feelings of anxiety and relief with many in the island state. “I’m a little bit apprehensive about opening up. One part of me says bring it on as quickly as possible, the other says, how are we going to go?” Bradley says. “But we need the business and I’m optimistic. “All my staff are vaccinated and most of our family are too. I’ve got all the cleaning and sanitation gear here and I’m also going to buy for all my staff these rapid antigen tests. I’m as prepared as I can be.” Tasmanians have enjoyed a relatively restriction-free lifestyle throughout 2021, with no community cases of Covid. Apart from a three-day lockdown when a traveller fled hotel quarantine, there have been no orders to wear masks except in hospitals, airports and at large events. Read more of Sally Glaetzer’s piece about Tasmania’s preparations ahead of relaxing its border rules from Wednesday: Health authorities in South Australia have announced 12 new Covid-19 cases have been detected in the most recent 24-hour reporting period. Two of the new cases are reported as being aged care health workers. It comes as a Covid case attended a school assembly in Adelaide, which has prompted hundreds of people in the city’s south report for testing. It will come as no surprise but the Covidsafe contact-tracing app has been used just 13 times in the past six months during the Delta outbreaks in NSW and Victoria. The second report on the operation of the app, released this month, reveals between May and November this year, contact tracers downloaded data from the app just 13 times, with only two potential close contacts identified through the app. The 13 users who uploaded their data showed 331 exchanges between phones using the app, with nine encounters (where the phones were within 1.5m of each other for a period of time). With just two potential close contacts identified. It shows a massive decline in not only people using the app, but contact tracers relying on it in the peak of the Delta wave in Australia. Since the launch 2020, there have been 792 people with Covid uploading data from the app, with 2,829 potential close contacts identified. As previously reported, there are less than two dozen close contacts identified who weren’t found through manual contact tracing. The report says by identifying a previously-unknown exposure date at Mounties in Sydney, two people who were at that venue were found to have tested positive for Covid-19. The report also reveals the measurement was changed to account for Delta in October. Instead of needing people to be in contact for 15 minutes or more, public health officers can now view encounters of between one minute and 15 minutes, meaning fleeting contacts where Delta could have been transmitted could have been captured by the app, provided people were using it. The government still refuses to say how many users continue to use the app. The department said in the report that the Sydney outbreak in June led to a doubling of registrations nationally, and numbers increased again after the fourth and fifth lockdowns in Melbourne. I’ve been watching the ongoing case against sitting judge Salvatore Vasta, who is being personally sued for his handling of a routine property settlement case in 2018, during which he jailed a man for contempt. Such proceedings are remarkably rare. Judges like Vasta, who sits on the federal circuit court bench, are generally protected by judicial immunity, shielding them from being sued as a result of errors. In this case, Vasta has conceded he mistakenly assumed that another judge had previously found the man, known by the pseudonym Mr Stradford, to have breached a court order, making him guilty of contempt. Vasta then sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment, to serve six. Stradford says he endured a torrid time in prison. His lawyers are arguing Vasta, as an inferior court judge, exceeded his jurisdiction in jailing Stradford and has therefore lost the protection of judicial immunity. Jeremy Kirk, SC, acting for Vasta, said in his closing submissions on Tuesday that he accepted Vasta could have found out there had been no hearing on Stradford’s alleged previous contempt prior to jailing him. Kirk said: We accept he could have found it out with reasonable inquiries. It was as I said a significant human mistake, but a human mistake nonetheless. It did have serious consequences, we don’t avoid that conclusion or characterisation either. That being said, many exercises of judicial power can have serious consequences. But Kirk maintained that Vasta is protected by judicial immunity and should not even be before the court. The hearing continues before justice Michael Wigney in the federal court. Commuters in Sydney are being urged to wear masks and socially distance on trains as best they can on Tuesday, as rail employees taking industrial action see the city’s network operate at 25% of its weekday capacity. Dale Merrick, chief operating officer of New South Wales TrainLink, warned that travellers on some lines would have limited personal space in carriages. “Customers travelling to the Hunter Valley, into the Blue Mountains and the South Coast, [are] today effectively experiencing a weekend timetable and as I said, [this is] utterly disappointing that we have had to do so today,” Merrick said. All lines on the Sydney network are affected, with workers refusing to staff foreign-made trains as part of failed enterprise agreement negotiations between the the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and NSW Trains. Industrial action was also taken last week, and Merrick said he was “greatly disappointed that again today our employees and the union have taken this action”. Merrick said negotiations with the union are ongoing. Two dogs have been rescued from mine shafts by specialist Victorian firefighters in separate incidents in the same week. The Country Fire Authority’s Bendigo-based Oscar1 Brigade rescued Bruno the bull-Arab on 5 December after he fell down a mine shaft at Castlemaine Diggins National Park, reports AAP. Less than six days later, the brigade was called to rescue Terry the kelpie-cross from a mine shaft at Woodend. “The owner said they were camping and the dog just went for a run, but as it was night and you can’t see these mine shafts at the best of times, he just fell down the hole,” Captain Daniel McMahon said. “It was a 15-metre shaft but we thought it may have been a false floor, meaning there could have been another 10 or 20 metres below if the floor had collapsed. “Terry was in surprisingly good nick though with no injuries, so we hooked him up to the ropes and Woodend brigade helped pull him up.” McMahon said he was pleased both incidents ended with a good result. “Rescuing a dog in a mineshaft is a serious job, but for us, it also doubles as real-world experience in case we are called to a community member in the same unfortunate situation,” he said. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the emergent Omicron variant will not “take us back” to more Covid-19 restrictions, and Australia is now prepared to open up and live with the virus. Announcing a deal with Moderna and the Victorian government that will see a new manufacturing facility built in Melbourne by as early as 2024, Morrison said the country’s high vaccination rate meant Australia could “continue to move forward”. “We’re not letting Omicron take us back,” Morrison said. “We’ve decided as a country to live with this virus and Australians have worked so hard for that. “Australia can now open up. This Christmas we’re about to have is a gift Australians have given to themselves by the way they’ve worked together with the settings that we’ve put in place.” Morrison also conceded the Coalition had made mistakes during the pandemic, including in the early phases of the vaccination rollout, but said these had been overcome. Read more: The New South Wales auditor general has reportedly refused to sign off on the state’s finances, prompting fears public assets could be sold to cover up a $10bn government “accounting sham”, reports AAP. Margaret Crawford has told Treasury she will not approve the budget, Nine Newspapers report, unless a solution is found to what she described as “significant accounting issues” with the government’s Transport Asset Holding Entity. The state-owned corporation was set up in 2015 to own NSW’s transport assets but accountants and public servants have since warned it is being used to inflate the NSW budget. NSW Treasury had miscalculated the benefit of TAHE to the state budget to the tune of $10 billion over the next 10 years, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. Former transport department secretary Rod Staples has also warned the setup blurs the lines of responsibility for maintenance of the assets and public safety. The government is scrambling to find a solution, two days before it is due to hand down its half-yearly budget update. Opposition leader Chris Minns fears Sydney Trains, NSW trains or the entire Transport department could be sold to plug the massive hole in the budget. If you’re still unclear on what TAHE is, here’s an explainer we prepared earlier. Australia’s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has tested a number of imported products labelled as ivermectin and found that they are counterfeit. The products Iversun-12, Covimectin-12, and Ivilife-12 failed laboratory tests. In a statement the TGA said the findings should “serve as a warning against buying ivermectin products from unverified online sellers”. “Counterfeit products may contain undeclared and hazardous ingredients that could cause a serious adverse reaction. They may also be contaminated because of a lack of manufacturing and testing standards.” The TGA is working with the Australian Border Force to target counterfeit and unlawful ivermectin entering Australia. Border force will refer suspected counterfeit products to the TGA for further direction. The TGA has also warned against self-medicating with unproven Covid-19 drugs like ivermectin. “It is very dangerous to take large doses of ivermectin and there is insufficient evidence to validate its safe and effective use for Covid-19,” the TGA said. As Covid cases in New South Wales continue to rise, the state government has committed to its plan to lift restrictions for unvaccinated residents from tomorrow. On Tuesday, as NSW recorded 804 new cases, the government insisted it had considered all the options but was committed to easing restrictions on Wednesday in order to return the state “back to a full life of normality”, AAP reports. From Wednesday, unvaccinated people will be allowed back in pubs, cafes, gyms and shops and mask mandates will be eased. The NSW health minister Brad Hazzard made the comments as health authorities are battling to contain an outbreak of the Omicron variant, with a total of 85 cases now confirmed in the state. “We’re not about to start backflipping on issues we promised,” Hazzard said. Hazzard also warned “once the unvaccinated are mixing with the vaccinated, the numbers will increase even further”. “That’s worrying because that puts pressure on our doctors and nurses and our frontline health system,” he said. He was scathing about people who refused to get vaccinated, saying they were “very vulnerable to what is a rapidly increasing number of Covid cases”. A decade of reforms to save the Murray-Darling basin could be undermined by New South Wales’ plans to license too much flood water harvesting, with insiders warning that NSW’s processes will result in irrigators being licensed to take billions of litres of flows without proper environmental assessment. Two members of the four-person Healthy Floodplains Review committee, which hears appeals from irrigators about their proposed flood plain water entitlements, say the system is “sloppy”, “flawed” and should be reviewed immediately. They say over the last 12 months the committee has been swamped with more than 400 appeals, involving 1,300 separate flood plain harvesting structures; the committee is overwhelmed and applications are often accompanied by poor evidence. Irrigators, they say, are now “consultant shopping” to achieve outcomes many times larger than the initial assessment by the Natural Resources Access Regulator, which conducted an on-the-ground survey of dams and other structures used in flood plain harvesting.

Retail giant Woolworths has endured one of its most challenging trading periods following the emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19, AAP reports. The supermarket operator said its stock flows and operating rhythm were rocked by the scare in the first six months of fiscal 2022. Chief executive Brad Banducci said today in a market update: The first half of F22 has been one of the most challenging halves we have experienced in recent memory due to the far-reaching impact of the Covid Delta strain. He said the costs of trading in a Covid environment would affect first-half earnings. Woolworths, which will release its first-half results in late February, expects to see a direct cost hit of $150 million in its Australian Food division in addition to direct costs of between $60 million to $70 million. Australian Food earnings before interest and tax are forecast to be between $1.19 billion and $1.22 billion, compared with about $1.33 billion in the same period in fiscal 2021. Banducci said during a call with analysts also saw challenges in Christmas trade, namely sourcing goods due to the supply chain difficulties of the pandemic. It’s not going to be an easy ride into Christmas. We’ll have a white knuckle ride – not in demand, but in having the stock there for them to buy. Consumer electronics and some toys were proving difficult to source for Big W stores. The retail giant will also book a bonus payment for staff of between $35m and $40m as a way of saying thank you for their efforts during the pandemic. Shares in Woolworths Group on the ASX were down 8.5% to $37.08 at 11.44 AEDT. I just want to make sure no one has forgotten that THIS was just said at a press conference. Here is the full statement from the PM’s office about the new agreement with Moderna to produce mRNA vaccines in Australia by 2024. Jam Land, the company part-owned by the energy minister Angus Taylor and his brother Richard, illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands and should restore native habitat, a ministerial review of the original investigation has concluded. The decision, published late Friday, follows an 18-month review of the original determination which ordered Jam Land to restore 103 hectares of grasslands on a property in the New South Wales Monaro region. It comes more than five years after the company poisoned the grasslands, known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands, on a property in Corrowong. You can read the full report below: New Zealanders stuck overseas and Kiwi business groups have reacted with despair to Jacinda Ardern’s border rethink, AAP reports. The change-up was the biggest talking point in New Zealand’s Parliament House on Tuesday, where politicians have returned for the last sitting week of the year. On Monday, Ardern announced the planned reopening to Australia-based New Zealanders, set for 17 January, would be subject to a last-minute review in early January. We haven’t changed any decisions at this stage around reconnection ... but I think people understand we need to review the latest details and evidence around Omicron. The review is in contrast to previous statements from Ardern’s ministers they were “very committed” to the date, and Kiwis should make travel plans for then, knowing they could bypass hotel quarantine for self-isolation. Covid-19 minister Chris Hipkins insisted on Tuesday: It’s looking very likely that we’ll proceed. But we can’t discount the possibility that Omicron could prove to be a spanner in the works. The border rethink comes amid surging vaccine rates in New Zealand. As of Tuesday, 89% of Kiwis aged 12 or over are fully vaccinated, and 94% have had one dose. New Zealand’s reticence to reopen contrasts with shifts from hold-out Australian states. After hitting vaccine targets, Queensland has opened up without self-isolation requirements for fully vaccinated travellers, Tasmania is following suit on Wednesday, and Western Australia will do so from February 5. Business NZ chief executive Kirk Hope said the NZ government was “overly cautious”. They’re using an approach that has suited them well. But it’s increasingly frustrating for business, who are going to be at a competitive disadvantage to Australia. The (border rethink) signal has created quite a lot of uncertainty for business, which had been looking forward to the door opening on the border even just a bit. The border review – slated for 7 or 8 January – has drawn scorn from opposition parties. Opposition leader Christopher Luxon – the big winner from polling released on Tuesday that indicated 20% of New Zealanders rated him their preferred prime minister – said the time had come to reopen. The rest of the world is moving on. They are finding a way to move forward ... it is about risk management. We have to find a way through to manage risk intelligently. Separated families are also aghast, given many had put off applying for quarantine places in recent weeks believing the border would be open to them from 17 January. Just on that ACCC news from before, here is the treasurer’s tweet on his top pick: A-League Men’s and Women’s clubs are expected to receive a cash windfall after an US private equity firm bought a minority share in the body which oversees both competitions. Technology investment specialist Silver Lake has struck the deal with the Australian Professional Leagues (APL), which is responsible for the operation and commercialisation of the country’s professional football competitions. It’s understood the deal is for a 30% stake in the body and is worth approximately $130m. The investment will be used to build a digital media platform. You can read more in the article below: Just out of the NSW press conference, chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant has confirmed that the cluster which started at a prom-themed event at Newcastle nightclub has ballooned, with 150 of the 650 attendees now testing positive to Covid-19. Yesterday there were 28 Covid cases in the Hunter New England region, today this jumped to 224. Just back to that question Scott Morrison was asked about Karen Andrews suggesting that Australia would have domestic mRNA manufacturing capacity by October this year: Queensland chief health officer John Gerrard says Queensland won’t be following NSW in removing restrictions for unvaccinated people anytime soon: We are not even looking at removing the mandate, it’s not even something that’s on the agenda, so that that is not a good plan at all. Luckily it seems that this Queensland community case was not infectious while out and about. Queensland’s Covid-19 graphics are extremely confusing nowadays, as they don’t seem to count infected people from other states who test positive while out and about in Queensland as local cases. But the long and short of it is that one new case has been detected in the community. South Australia will find out by the end of the week what restrictions will be eased once the state reaches 90% double vaccination. Vaccination vans which have travelled to Aboriginal communities around Victoria have helped push the vaccine rate of First Nations people in the state up to 83.5%, the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation has said. As of this week, the Australian Immunisation Register states that 87.8% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 and over in Victoria have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 83.5% have received their second dose. The high vaccine rate reflects a steady climb up from low figures in September, when it was revealed that a record-keeping error meant the actual Indigenous vaccination rate in Victoria was less than half what had previously been reported. It follows nine weeks of targeted vaccination campaigns in the form of vaccination vans which have travelled to Mildura, Shepparton, Warrnambool, Seymore, Wodonga, Benalla, Morwell, Drouin and Warragul. VACCHO chief executive Jill Gallagher: I’m so proud of our community in welcoming the vans with open arms – it has been incredible. We have seen some great outcomes achieved by the ACCO vaccine van. This reflects what trust looks like in the community ... I have also been particularly pleased to see so many elders coming to visit the vans to have a yarn and get vaccinated. Aboriginal communities across Australia have been targeted by misinformation campaigns, which have slowed the vaccine rollout. Scott Morrison has been pressed on what he meant when he said no government had got everything right during the pandemic. I mean – and I said this last night at the Sydney Institute – no government has got everything right, but no government can in a pandemic. To think that that was 100% strike rate on every decision, I think Australians understand and I think the honesty of governments in being able to say that clearly – I know the Victorian government feel the same way . But what I can tell us is we did make the big calls and we did get the balance right and the proof of that is the fact that we have saved 40,000 lives based on looking at the average amongst the OECD. Think about that – 40,000 lives saved because of how Australia has responded to this pandemic. One of the strongest advanced economies to come through the pandemic in the world and one of the highest vaccination rates. That is the proof of the combination of decisions and responses that our government and, work being other governments around the country, have made. No country gets it all right but I can tell you we got it right a lot more often than so many other places around the world and Australians are safer today and better prepared today for what’s coming next than almost any other country in the world. For once the prime minister and the Victorian government seem to be on the same page when it comes to Covid-19. Here is what Victorian deputy premier James Merlino has to say in response to that same question: In terms of what the settings will be in this week, the minister for health will make an announcement later in the week. It’s based on the latest health advice but what we have done is in line with the national plan and we can do it because Victorians have been so fantastic in getting vaccinated. But the answer to your question, whether it’s Omicron or Delta or the next variant, it’s vaccines that protects the citizen, protects families and means that we can enjoy the freedoms that we do right now. Reporter: Is lifting the masks going backwards or keeping masks on, say, for a few weeks, in your mind is that going backwards? Or if they said we need to do it that would be OK? Scott Morrison: Well, we had a pause on the opening that starts tomorrow and we did that because we were waiting for the picture to emerge a bit more clearly before taking that next step and now we feel confident to take that next step and states and territories are doing exactly the same thing. You know, over the course of this pandemic, sometimes there has been that need for patience. And I know that can be frustrating. I welcome, on the issue of patience, Western Australia giving a clear timetable about when it’s opening. Tomorrow, Tasmania opens. Tremendous, just in time for the Tassie Test next month, which I’m thrilled to see happening. But all of that, I think, goes to the national plan that [Jodie] McVernon from Doherty helped us construct with the premiers. We’re in phase C now and we look forward to getting to phase D, and that’s all about living with the virus. Scott Morrison says Covid-19 health decisions can no longer be based just on case numbers: We’re now in a different phase. Cases are not the issue and I know over a period of time we may have become conditioned to case numbers being the trigger. That’s not the case ... Now, here in Victoria, as you rightly say, you’ve been having cases of over 1,000 a day for some time and the Victorian public hospital system and health system is coping strongly. They did the work, they did the planning, New South Wales is the same. So that is the way forward. Questions have turned to the NSW situation now, where the state plans to lift a large number of restrictions on unvaccinated people tomorrow despite today being its most infectious day in more than 10 weeks. Scott Morrison is asked what he thinks of this but the prime minister says we can’t start walking backwards: We’re taking Omicron incredibly seriously. We had a very long discussion about this in the meeting with premiers and chief ministers last week. We’re not letting Omicron take us back, though. We’ve decided as a country to live with this virus and Australians have worked so hard for that. When we have vaccination rates about to hit 90%, one of the highest in the world, that means we have choices today that we didn’t have 18 months ago and that means that we can continue to move forward. Tomorrow, we will begin welcoming students to Australia again, skilled migrants, working holiday-makers, under those visa programs. From tomorrow, Korea, as I announced yesterday with the president, and Japan, also join with Singapore and New Zealand. But we have watched this very closely and made careful decisions and taken the best medical advice on this. Reporter: Last year Karen Andrews promised mRNA manufacturing by October of this year. Is that a failed promise? Scott Morrison: No, that’s not what she said. I know that’s been misrepresented, particularly by our opponents in the Labor party who seem to think you can do this by time travel. I’ll ask Angus to comment on that. Angus Taylor: That’s not what Karen said. The point she made was the timeline depends on getting access to the intellectual property. We have that now. Getting access to a site. We’re close to having that ... and we’re committed to getting this done as fast as possible. It’s important to point out there’s been no development of a new mRNA manufacturing facility anywhere else in the world since the pandemic struck and this will be one of the first in the world. We’re in a good situation to get onto this as quickly as possible, and make it as effective as possible, not just for health outcomes but also for jobs, development of a medical technology hub and development of capabilities I talked about. NOOOOOOOOOOOO Scott Morrison just added to this accidentally horrific metaphor with “meet and beat”: Angus and I and Greg like to talk about meeting and beating of targets. It’s like shake and bake. Meet and beat. And that’s what we want to see happen here. We want this on the ground as quickly as possible. Am I going crazy? Is this satire? Does anyone want to tell this Moderna representative what “pitching a tent” actually means? I want to thank you, prime minister, acting Premier, and other ministers and most importantly the Doherty. I’m thrilled and proud to be here today, to announce that Moderna will be pitching tent in Australia, upon the finalisation of our agreement. We have played a critical role during the pandemic, and as we have all learned, pandemics can come at the time we least expect them. Anyone else weirdly shocked that official army regalia comes in a short sleeve option? The Moderna man at the press conference (apologies to you, but you didn’t say your name at the start) says a definite location has not yet been locked in for the new mRNA manufacturing hub. Since all the politicians are speaking from the Doherty Institue, named after Australia Nobel laureate Prof Peter Doherty, I think it’s only fair that I once again share his most iconic tweet. A tweet that I genuinely believe changed Australian culture forever. Josh Frydenberg has put forward lawyer Gina Cass-Gottlieb as a poacher-turned-gamekeeper candidate to chair the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. If approved by the states and territories, Cass-Gottlieb will replace Rod Sims, who has been in the job for a decade, when his term expires in March. It’s a big change for Cass-Gottlieb, a partner at law firm Gilbert &amp; Tobin, who has spent much of her career bashing Sims’ ACCC over mergers and acquisitions on behalf of big companies, as well as representing clients under investigation by it and other regulators. On approval by the states and territories, who haven’t withheld the thumbs-up in living memory, she will become the first woman to chair the ACCC, one of Australia’s most powerful regulators. Frydenberg thanked Sims for his service: Mr Sims has made an outstanding contribution to competition, consumer and infrastructure policy in his time at the ACCC, helping to advance world-leading reforms, including most recently with respect to the digital platforms ... I also acknowledge his wider contribution to public policy during his distinguished public service career which spans more than three decades. I wish him well for the future. James Merlino: This is a huge announcement because this is the first time in the southern hemisphere we’ll have mRNA manufacturing based in this nation. And 25m vaccines, the ability to ramp up to 100m, and it’s not just in regards to vaccine developments, whether it’s variants of coronavirus right now, pandemics of the future, but beyond, beyond that, treatment of cancer, treatment of rare diseases, this is a massive game-changer and to have that manufacturing capacity, the research capacity, right here in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, is a great thing. This will create jobs: 1,000 jobs, 500 in construction, 500 ongoing, but beyond that, it saves lives. Whether it’s dealing with a pandemic, treatment of cancer, treatment of rare diseases, this is a major, major announcement. Victoria’s deputy premier James Merlino is speaking now (the Moderna deal is a collaboration between the state and federal governments), and seems to have a new slogan: Boston, London, Melbourne. Merlino: When you think about medical research and biotechnology, think about Boston, think about London, and you think about Melbourne. This is the place to be. Boston, London and Melbourne, the three great leading cities when it comes to medical research and biotechnology. In Melbourne and Victoria, 30,000 jobs in medical research, biotechnology, across our industry, universities, and institutes such as the Doherty. Forty per cent of the nation’s medical tech and biotech companies are based in Melbourne, and 60% of the nation’s pharmaceutical exports come from Victoria. So this is a great announcement and it’s the logical place to do it. Scott Morrison: We are building our sovereign capability here. Which protects Australia’s national interests. Our sovereign capability to manufacture these vaccines here in Australia. Up to 100m-a-year* capacity to do this in this arrangement is extraordinary. But we’ve got it right. We’ve spent the time to get it right. This is not an arrangement that you just rush into and do a deal on a coffee shop somewhere. This is something you do the meticulous work on. We worked with a number of states and we came to the very, I think, sensible conclusion here in the Victoria, we have the strong foundation to continue to build, not just a great research and collaboration infrastructure, but a powerhouse of medical manufacturing, that plays exactly into our economic goals of securing the economic recovery, 1 million Australians are now employed in manufacturing. *But remember, the first year isn’t until 2024. So, obviously when chatting about doing a deal to set up domestic vaccine manufacturing, the elephant in the room is Scott Morrison’s decision last year to do a deal to produce AstraZeneca domestically, which ended up being, well ... not the best move. The prime minister is going with the “well, everyone got stuff wrong and I promise we are getting it right this time” tactic to explain this: It was in this country that already we have produced here in Victoria, 25m AstraZeneca vaccines. In August of 2020, we did the deal to ensure that could be done right here in Australia and that provided the workhorse, the backbone of the vaccine program that’s seen us get to where we are today. But we also know during this pandemic, as we have learned many lessons, no government has got everything right, I’m sure that James [Merlino] would agree with me, we all sought to work together to make the best calls we possibly can. But the mRNA vaccines have proven to be, I argue, the biggest scientific discovery over the course of this pandemic. OK, jumping down to Victoria now where the prime minister is speaking from the Doherty Institute in Melbourne. This morning he is announcing that Australia has made a deal with the pharmaceutical company Moderna to create an mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Australia. (It won’t be functional until 2024.) Scott Morrison seems to be feeling a little poetic and, dare I say, sentimental this morning. It was in February 2020, I was here with Greg Hunt, and I got to stare in the face of the virus because it was reproduced here for the first time anywhere in the world. Since that day, together, Australians have been staring this virus down. We have made some big calls. We got the balance right, I believe, working together as a country. Working together with states and territories, working together with our health and medical, science and research community, that is enabled us to achieve incredible things in this country. We have the lowest fatality rate of almost every country in the world, saved more than 30,000 lives. A number of flood warnings have just been published for NSW: Brad Hazzard: The numbers of people in the hospital at the moment are fairly low. There’s only 21 in ICU today. I think there’s one on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or Ecmo. The numbers are slight this morning. But once the unvaccinated are mixing with the vaccinated, the numbers will increase even further. That’s worrying because that puts pressure on our doctors and nurses and our frontline health system. I said this once before, I will say it again – to the unvaccinated, it’s not fair to health workers that you can be so selfish to think that being unvaccinated is OK. It’s not. It’s the doctors and nurses in our hospitals who then have to care for you when you come to our hospital. I have no doubt there will be people coming to hospitals because they have been unvaccinated. Brad Hazzard is asked if he is ruling out the possibility that the Newcastle area could go into lockdown after a spike of cases in the area: New South Wales is not planning on any snap lockdowns. What we’re planning on is making sure the community understand the need to have boosters and being vaccinated. Brad Hazzard: The circumstances of what is occurring right now in the Hunter district, where we are seeing substantial increases in numbers of Covid, is a very telling reminder to all of us, particularly as we open up to the unvaccinated. My message to the vaccinated, you might be out and about now but you are very vulnerable to what is a rapidly increasing number of Covid cases here in NSW. Go and get vaccinated. Give up on the current views you have and going get vaccinated.* *Wow! If only there were some legal incentives that would encourage people to go get vaccinated! NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking now after the state recorded its most infectious day in 10 weeks. And yes, there is a brass band playing Feliz Navidad in the background. Though NSW Health is easing a huge number of restrictions for unvaccinated people tomorrow, Hazzard says he worried about the lack of Covid-19 booster shot take-up: I am concerned not enough people are actually understanding the benefit of getting the booster. A third shot of vaccine is going to make all the difference. What we do know, is it does not matter whether you have had AstraZeneca or Pfizer or Moderna, whatever you may have had, it does drop off in terms of the effect on your immunity. Particularly if over 60, immunity drops off after three to four months and we need to go and get a booster. The wild weather that’s been battering the east coast of Australia has led to widespread flooding in multiple states and a surge in insurance claims, reports Jack Gramenz from AAP. NRMA Insurance says the number of weather-related damage claims during the spring season, which included NSW’s wettest November on record, was 35% above average. All up, 10,000 homes claimed weather damage from the insurer in Queensland, NSW and the ACT. NRMA data shows nearly half the claims were for hail damage in the Coffs Harbour region on the NSW north coast in October, and wild weather was responsible for two-thirds of the claims. The insurer’s natural perils executive manager Mark Leplastrier says it’s been “an ominous start to storm season”. Spring featured some of the most unpredictable and extreme weather we have seen in many years, and with a La Niña system now declared, we could be in for more wet weather over summer ... There has been some relief from flooding in NSW at least, with river heights dropping in several areas around the state after persistent wet weather. The Hunter River has receded below minor flood levels, as have the Severn and Hawkesbury rivers. Minor to moderate flooding is still occurring along the Gwydir, Macquarie, Macintyre, Bogan, Murrumbidgee, Warrego, Paroo and Snowy rivers. There is still a risk of major flooding on the Namoi, Lachlan, Barwon, and Weir rivers. The Namoi could send Wee Waa back into isolation with a major flood peak predicted on Tuesday night. The river is expected to peak near 7.1 metres. Lepastrier said climate change impacts could make severe storms more frequent over a wider area, and seven out of 10 people in a survey said they worried natural disasters were increasing in frequency and severity. Disaster assistance is available in local government areas around NSW. The clean-up will come too late for many of the state’s farmers, who have had their hopes of a prosperous harvest crushed by weeks of heavy rain and flooding. A survey of rural confidence by Rabobank released on Tuesday showed confidence was high leading into the harvest season, with 88% of respondents predicting excellent conditions to continue, before flooding devastated crops. Rabobank central NSW regional manager Toby Mendl said: A few weeks ago, it was hard to imagine that cropping conditions in NSW could get any better but we now have a situation where some growers, who had been preparing to harvest record-yielding crops, will actually harvest nothing. Domestic border restrictions in Australia have eased as local cases of the Omicron variant rise. Overseas, the UK has raised its Covid alert level and reintroduced restrictions amid concerns that Omicron poses a “rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services”. Here’s what we know so far about Omicron and how worried Australia should be about the new variant of concern.

Won’t somebody think of the property developers? Alan Jones, having lost his low-rating spot on Sky News and his regular rant in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, is back with a new show called Direct to the People. Jones began at 8pm on Monday night, thundering about being silenced. “You’re not allowed to have an alternative viewpoint,” he bellowed on YouTube, Facebook and his own website, while spruiking his new morning podcast. “They won’t silence you or me,” he continued. Alas, he was silenced. Find out what happened in the article below: Firefighters will be able to more accurately predict whims of deadly bushfires thanks to new modelling it is hoped will save lives and properties, reports AAP’s Tiffanie Turnbull. Australia’s national science agency CSIRO and the NSW Rural Fire Service have developed the country’s most advanced model for predicting the speed and behaviour of eucalypt forest fires. Eucalypt forests make up more than 70% of Australia’s forests, and have featured in some of its fiercest fires. The model is a mathematical description of how a fire responds to environmental conditions, and will be rolled out nationally this summer. CSIRO bushfire behaviour researcher and leader of the project Miguel Cruz said: This model was built using analysis of the most extensive set of data gathered from observations of large, high-intensity experimental fires and wildfires, collated from around the country over the past 40 years. Firefighters input forecast weather and wind information from the Bureau of Meteorology, data on the fuel load within the forest from vegetation databases, and patterns of existing behaviour of a fire from fireground reports. CSIRO bushfire behaviour researcher Andrew Sullivan said the new model would give firefighters an extra advantage in controlling complex and difficult blazes. Firefighters often have to battle steep terrain and challenging conditions just to reach the fire ... Critically, this model can accurately predict the speed that a fire front will advance across a landscape, which is essential to enable authorities to efficiently identify threats, issue bushfire warning messages, signal evacuations and plan fire suppression actions. A real estate agency in Queensland has come under fire after it emailed tenants offering them the chance to buy a Christmas gift for their landlords. Kanik &amp; Co, located near Brisbane, sent out an email to tenants offering to facilitate the purchasing of select gifts, along with any “handwritten notes”, that would be delivered to the owner of the property. Some of the offered gifts include a $50 “white wine grazing box”, a $55 “festive sweets basket”, a $70 “self care hamper”, a $99 “foodies hamper” and a $115 gift called “all things golden”. You can read the full report below: A reminder that this significant jump in Covid-19 cases in NSW comes before a huge range of vaccinated economy restrictions being lifted across the state tomorrow. From 15 December the following rules apply to everyone, regardless of vaccination status: Masks will only be required on public transport and planes, at airports and for indoors front-of-house hospitality staff who are not fully vaccinated QR check-in is only required for hospitals, aged and disability care facilities, gyms, places of worship, funerals or memorial services, personal services, pubs, small bars, registered clubs, nightclubs, strip clubs, sex on premises, and indoor music festivals with more than 1,000 people No person limit in gyms, indoor recreation and sporting facilities Non-critical retail reopens to all No person limit for personal services including hairdressers, spas, beauty and nail salons, tattoo and massage parlours Employers allow staff to work from home at their discretion International travellers who are not fully vaccinated still need to quarantine on arrival for 14 days No limit to number of visitors in your home No limit to number of people for outdoor public gatherings All visitors to residents in aged care facilities and disability homes permitted in line with their policies No person limit in hospitality venues Singing and dancing is permitted indoors and outdoors for all Travel between greater Sydney and regional NSW permitted for all Carpooling permitted for all Caravan parks and camping grounds open for all No person limit for major recreation facilities like stadiums, theme parks and racecourses No person limit for entertainment facilities including cinemas and theatres No person limit for information and education facilities including art galleries, museums and libraries No person limit for outdoor public gatherings and recreation Music festivals reopen with 20,000 person limit Amusement centres and play centres open to all Weddings and funerals permitted with no person limit, eating and drinking allowed while standing and dancing permitted for all Singing and dancing indoors permitted by all Places of worship open to all Rules via AAP. The deaths of two Queensland infant twins with special needs is being investigated by child protection police, reports AAP. Emergency services were called to an apartment block in Bungalow, an inner suburb of Cairns, on Monday morning. They were unable to revive the two infants, who both had special medical needs. On Tuesday morning police said the Cairns child protection investigation unit was investigating their deaths. Australia’s eight planned nuclear submarines will cost $70bn at an “absolute minimum” and it’s “highly likely” to be more than that, defence analysts say. With inflation, the cost could be as high as $171bn, according to a report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The thinktank’s report contains a series of estimates ranging from low to high and concedes that estimating the final cost of the project is necessarily an “extremely assumption-rich activity”. Under the low range, for a smaller submarine with a more efficient build, the “constant” cost (not including inflation) would be about $70bn. Including inflation (the “out-turned” cost), it would be $116bn. You can read the full report below: Here is the full statement from the Victorian government on the Moderna manufacturing facility that’s set to be operational by 2024. Scott Morrison has called on states and territories to ease their last remaining Covid-19 restrictions, as Western Australia announced plans to reopen its hard border to the rest of the nation, reports AAP’s Andrew Brown. Speaking at the Sydney Institute’s annual dinner on Monday night, Morrison urged jurisdictions to “facilitate, rather than dictate”: Australians kept their side of the deal, it is time for governments to now keep theirs; to step back and let Australians step forward ... To put Australians back in charge of their own lives, relying on the connecting points and relationships that exist between the state and the individual. It comes as West Australian premier Mark McGowan announced the state would relax its border restrictions from 5 February. The prime minister congratulated WA for making it to the 80% vaccination level and for announcing plans to scrap its hard border: Australia is going to be connected and together again ... This will be welcome news for thousands of Western Australians looking forward to reuniting with family and friends after so long apart. The prime minister also confirmed that a two-week pause on allowing visa holders to enter the country without an exemption would end as scheduled on Wednesday. This has not yet been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia but Nine News is reporting that NSW is set to record 804 new Covid-19 cases today, a significant bump up from previous days. We will have to wait till 9am to find out for sure. Fresh doubts have emerged over whether Australia can rely on boosting soil carbon to achieve its net zero emissions goals with a NSW government report predicting the land sector will become a significant source of emissions in a warmer climate. The concerns are raised in a report on soil health trends in NSW forests, published without fanfare by the state’s Natural Resources Commission. It examined soil organic carbon levels in eastern NSW forests and how they may be affected by projected rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns. They found major losses could be expected, particularly for southern forests, suggesting “forest managers will have to implement appropriate soil carbon-enhancing strategies even to just maintain current SOC levels”. You can read the full report below: More people in Newcastle have been forced into isolation after others infected with Covid-19 visited a pub last weekend, reports AAP. NSW Health is battling to contain several large transmission events and there are now 64 cases of the new Omicron strain on record. Anyone who was at Newcastle’s Finnegan’s Hotel in Darby Street on Friday between 6.30pm and 2.30am on Saturday, has been advised to get tested and self-isolate for seven days. NSW Health said on Monday night: All household contacts of close contacts must also be tested and self-isolate until a negative result is received by everyone in the household ... It is likely some of these cases have the Omicron variant of concern. NSW Health is appealing for anyone who didn’t check in using the QR code to also get tested and self-isolate. The latest alert comes after cases linked to an outbreak that started at Newcastle’s Argyle House nightclub on Wednesday spiked from 24 to 84 on Monday, with a number of the cases also likely to be the Omicron variant. Nearly 700 people checked into the venue and chief health officer Kerry Chant on Monday said it was “incredibly important” that anyone who was at the venue gets a test, “given the high transmission at this venue”. Here is a little blog treat to get you through the morning! Religious Australians will be given greater freedom of speech than non-religious expressions of conscience under the Coalition’s bill, a leading academic has warned. Prof George Williams raised the issue in a submission to the human rights committee inquiry into the religious discrimination package. The bill faces an uncertain future with two inquiries running over summer and some religious organisations threatening to withdraw their support over the Morrison government’s deal with four Liberal moderates to strengthen protections for gay students at religious schools at the same time. You can read the full report here: Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce says WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should not be extradited to the United States to face charges. Joyce has penned an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald stating that he believes a trial should be held in the UK or Assange should return to Australia, as he wasn’t on American soil at the time the alleged espionage offences occurred: As an individual, whether you like him or despise him, it is beyond him, given his circumstances, to protect his rights by himself. So we must hope for the British courts to do so, and we will judge its society accordingly. I have never met him and, from observation, don’t respect him. I presume I would not like him. And I view these facts as a clarion call to be all the more vigilant that he is treated just as one of my most powerful colleagues or dearest friends would be. Joyce also noted that Assange “was not in breach of any Australian laws at the time of his actions”, urging the UK courts not to cave to pressure from the US to send him over. Good day everyone and welcome to this glorious Tuesday! It’s Matilda Boseley here and I hope your morning is going better than mine as my phone appears to have died. Why don’t we jump into the news to try and distract me from my woes! One of the big headlines today: Australia is getting its own mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility ... but not until 2024. The factory will be built in Victoria in partnership with vaccine manufacturer Moderna and is expected to produce as many as 100m vaccines each year. It’s unlikely this factory will make much of an impact on the Covid-19 pandemic, with at least a two-year lead time until jabs start coming of the production line. Prime minister Scott Morrison, who will make an official announcement later this morning, said it would help the country be prepared should there be another pandemic. In other news, the NSW rail network is once again being put to the test with the union taking industrial action today. The Rail, Tram and Bus Union said it would refuse to drive foreign-made trains as part of ongoing enterprise agreement negotiations with NSW Trains, a move that will impact about 75% of trains on the network. RTBU NSW secretary Alex Claassens said in a statement that he was hopeful the state government would come to the bargaining table. It’s disappointing that another week has passed, and there’s still no indication [of] the NSW government stepping in and doing the right thing ... The NSW government has been refusing to commit to providing workers and commuters with basic guarantees around hygiene, safety and privatisation for many months now ... We’re very aware of the impact this will have on commuters, but we also know that not taking action will leave workers and commuters at risk. As part of the EBA negotiations, the union wants an end to privatisation, safety standards maintained and a commitment to retaining current hygiene levels while not relying on contractors to provide it."

          "headline": "China’s troll king: how a tabloid editor became the voice of Chinese nationalism",
          "bodyText": "On 2 November, the Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted a long message on the social media site Weibo, accusing China’s former vice-premier, Zhang Gaoli, of sexual assault. As soon as the post went live, it became the highest-profile #MeToo case in China, and one of the ruling Chinese Communist party’s largest public relations crises in recent history. Within about 20 minutes, the post had been removed. All mentions of the post were then scrubbed from the Chinese internet. No references to the story appeared in the Chinese media. In the days that followed, Peng made no further statements and did not appear in public. Outside China, however, as other tennis stars publicly expressed concerns for her safety, Peng’s apparent disappearance became one of the biggest news stories in the world. It wasn’t long before Hu Xijin stepped into the story. Hu is the editor of the Global Times, a chest-thumpingly nationalistic tabloid sometimes described as “China’s Fox News”. In recent years, he has become the most influential Chinese propagandist in the west – a constant presence on Twitter and in the international media, always on hand to defend the Communist party line, no matter the topic. On 19 November, he tweeted to his 450,000 followers that he had confirmed through his own sources – he didn’t say who they were – that Peng was alive and well. Over the next two days, he posted videos of Peng at a restaurant and signing autographs in Beijing. To many observers, this seemingly stage-managed footage, disseminated by organs of the Chinese state, was not reassuring. On 21 November, the International Olympic Committee spoke with Peng on a video call and declared that she was “doing fine”. When this intervention still failed to convince many that Peng was safe, Hu took the opportunity to hammer home one of the central themes of his three-decade career in journalism: when it comes to China, the western media sees only what it wants to see. “They only believe the story about China that they imagine,” he tweeted. “I’m surprised that they didn’t say the lady who showed up these two days is a fake Peng Shuai, a double.” Those who continued to question Peng’s safety, Hu wrote, were trying to “demonize China’s system”. Hu’s eagerness to reframe a story about sexual assault and censorship as a story about clashing political ideologies and anti-China prejudice is part of a significant change in the way China presents itself to the world. From the late 1970s onwards, as China was opening up but had yet to assume a major role in international affairs, it struggled to handle criticism from abroad. The official response was usually some form of wounded denial, or a stilted demand that other countries stay out of its business. But over the past decade, as China’s global power has grown, President Xi Jinping has pushed the country into a more confident, aggressive posture, and Hu, more than any other Chinese journalist, has become the voice of this pugnacious nationalism. On China’s most popular social media platform, WeChat, the Global Times is reportedly the most read outlet. “My English is almost all self-taught,” Hu once said in a video on Weibo, “and in English, I’m most skilful at picking a fight.” He has hyped up the prospects of military confrontation between the US and China over Taiwan. He has warned that if Britain infringes Chinese sovereignty in the South China Sea then it will be treated like “a bitch” who is “asking for a beating”. He has compared India to a “bandit” that has “barbarically robbed” Chinese companies. He has referred to Australia as nothing more than “gum stuck to the bottom of China’s shoe”. He recently concluded an article with the question: “In the face of such an irrational Australia, shouldn’t China be prepared with an iron fist and to punch it hard when needed, teaching it a thorough lesson?” When he picks a fight with foreign officials on Twitter, Hu likes to take screenshots of the tweets and post them on Weibo, just to show his 24 million followers – most of whom are blocked from Twitter by the great firewall – that he’s out there, defending China’s honour. “The most important thing about Hu is that he has constructed a whole style of authoritarian, nationalistic rhetoric,” Xiao Qiang, an expert in Chinese media at Berkeley’s School of Information, told me. “His readers go around repeating the same things and spreading the same sentiments.” Hu’s combative approach has been taken up by a number of Chinese diplomats and spokespeople – often called “Wolf Warriors”, in reference to a jingoistic Chinese blockbuster movie – who promote a “China first” philosophy and use social media to trash anyone they see as opposing Chinese interests. But where the Wolf Warrior diplomats are a recent phenomenon, people like Hu “have been propagating this idea for 10 years,” says Xiang Lanxin, a professor of international politics at Geneva’s Graduate Institute. Hu’s endless stream of quotable insults and invective stands out amid a sea of bland official statements, calls to “occupy new platforms for party discourse”, and so on. Once you know his name, you see him quoted everywhere – the BBC, NPR, the Financial Times, the Washington Post, the Times, Reuters. In the past two years, the New York Times has mentioned him 46 times. “He’s willing to be quoted in the Xi Jinping era, when huge numbers of others – especially liberal commentators – have grown too nervous to go on-the-record with foreign journalists,” says Evan Osnos, who has written about China for the New Yorker since 2008. Hu has even become the subject of headlines in his own right. “Editor of Chinese state newspaper which routinely mocks Australia enjoyed LUNCH at our embassy”, reported Daily Mail Australia last year. One reason for Hu’s ubiquity is that he has unparalleled licence to speak bluntly about politics. Hu’s domestic critics have described him as “the only person with freedom of speech” in mainland China, though that freedom is partly a reflection of his adherence to the CCP line. Hu’s insistence on thrusting himself into every passing controversy has earned him the nickname diaopan, or “Frisbee catcher” – like a loyal pet, he tries to bring every argument home for the government he serves. Over the years, Hu has encouraged a kind of mystique around his connection with party leadership. “To be honest, I myself don’t know for sure to what degree I reflect the authority’s voice,” Hu told me when we spoke on the phone late last year. He likes to say that the Global Times’ success is a product of the market. But when I asked him if the paper is financially independent from the government, he eventually told me, after some back and forth, that the English edition receives government funding for providing overseas propaganda. Where Hu once spoke for a hardline fringe of the Communist party, his newspaper’s aggressive China-first ideology is now ascendant. As one American author who stopped writing for the Global Times in 2011 put it: “With all those Wolf Warrior diplomats, it’s like the government has been Global Times-ified.” * * * In 2016, President Xi visited the Beijing headquarters of the People’s Daily, the largest newspaper group in China, which is run by the Communist party and publishes Hu’s Global Times. On his tour of the offices, as he passed through the exhibition hall, Xi pointed approvingly to a display copy of the Global Times and declared himself a reader. Hu, it seemed, was successfully pursuing the propaganda strategy that Xi had laid out early in his presidency. Hu’s rise is hard to grasp without understanding the broader story of free speech in 21st century China. In the 00s, hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens came online and their voices became more audible. Starting in 2008, the People’s Daily set up a dedicated team to monitor public opinion online. Its first few annual reports presented new digital platforms in a positive light, as a way to bring the government and its people closer. Weibo and other online communities were “a good tool for citizens to participate in and discuss politics,” the 2010 report stated. During this period, journalists in China were afforded a little more freedom to do reporting that touched upon politically sensitive issues, though certain topics – such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and the lives and conduct of top leadership – remained off-limits. Starting in the early 2010s, and particularly from 2012, with the rise of Xi, this more liberal approach to public discourse was gradually reversed. “When Xi Jinping became president [in 2013], he was not interested in the voices on the internet,” Xiao, the UC Berkeley professor, told me. “Instead, he perceived such voices as a threat to his power, and recognised that it was time for a complete crackdown.” Posts on social media, such as Weibo, became increasingly monitored and censored. It became more common for web users to receive an “invitation to tea”, a euphemism for a phone call instructing you to visit your local police station to answer questions about your online activities. From 2013, a growing number of citizens were suspended or banned from online platforms, detained or sentenced to prison. Drawing on media reports and court documents, an online database recorded more than 2,000 cases in which people had been punished or prosecuted for their online speech since 2013. The total number is almost certainly much higher. In 2013, at the same time the party was tightening its grip on public discourse, Xi called a conference with propaganda officials from across the country, urging them to “tell the China story well”. That meant covering China in a way that was positive, engaging and harnessed new digital platforms. It meant proudly celebrating China’s achievements, rather than focusing on its imperfections. Hu adapted fluidly to China’s new media environment, which was at once very online, obedient to the party line and international-facing. In his articles, social media interventions and interviews, he played the role of both dutiful defence attorney – there to deliver the party’s side of the story, no matter how implausible it might seem – and aggrieved relative of the accused, yelling out to the court that the prosecution and the judge were prejudiced or corrupt or stupid, or all of the above. It was a style that suited the tenor of Chinese social media, as well as the new self-image of the Communist party. Other party media outlets started to mimic Hu’s style, writing in a more colloquial manner. Even People’s Daily, famously stolid and voiceless throughout most of its history, encourages its commentators to be more “fun” and to grow personal brands. In 2019, Xi visited the People Daily’s office again. He asked the country’s media workers to embrace new technology to “maximise and optimise propaganda impact” and “to promote the voice of the party directly into various apps and occupy new platforms for party discourse”. As Xi cruised through the office, the People’s Daily editorial team lined up and applauded. Among them was Hu in a dark grey jacket, smiling ear to ear. * * * No event seems to distil Hu’s remarkable place in Chinese journalism like the Tiananmen Square massacre. Journalists are always proud to tell their readers that they were there when something significant happened. Hu does the same when it comes to Tiananmen, except that he inserts himself into this history in order to discredit it. References to the Tiananmen massacre are prohibited in China. Perhaps the only exception to this rule is the Global Times. When Hu writes about the subject, he paints it as a dangerous folly. “If the incident 32 years ago has any positive effect,” Hu wrote this June, “it has inoculated the Chinese people with a political vaccine, helping us acquire immunity from being seriously misled.” Hu was 29 when the pro-democracy protests began. He had been born into a poor, Christian, but otherwise traditional family. His father was an accountant at a factory that manufactured rockets, and his mother, who was illiterate, made embroidery with a sewing machine to bring in some extra income. At 18, Hu joined the People’s Liberation Army and enrolled in its foreign-language college in Nanjing, where he majored in Russian. In 1986, still a military officer, he started a masters programme in Russian at Beijing Foreign Studies University. In the spring of 1989, when protests erupted across the country, Hu was months away from graduation. “I went to Tiananmen Square every day, chanting slogans like everybody else,” Hu told a Chinese reporter in 2011. (Xiao, the UC Berkeley professor, who was a student at Notre Dame in 1989 and flew back to Beijing upon seeing the news on TV, laughed at the idea that Hu could have been there as a protester. He noted that the military college Hu attended is sometimes known as “China’s cradle of 007s”. “If he truly participated in the protest, god knows what his role was,” Xiao said.) Shortly after the violent suppression of the Tiananmen protests, Hu joined the People’s Daily newspaper, where he spent two years as a researcher and another two years as an editor on the night shift. At the time, China was more than a decade into Deng Xiaoping’s push to develop a market economy. Hu was part of a group of journalists at the People’s Daily who sought to create new revenue streams by launching a weekly newspaper called Global News Digest. On 3 January 1993, 20,000 copies of the first issue, which included a story on Diana, Princess of Wales’s split from Prince Charles, appeared on newsstands. The front page featured a grandiose message from the editors, which proclaimed that after 500 years of falling behind the west, and 14 years of economic reform, China was “saying goodbye to poverty and backwardness, like a giant dragon about to take off, standing tall in the east of the world, its head held high”. Despite this lofty rhetoric, Hu claims there wasn’t a clear vision at first. “We published whatever ordinary people liked to read,” he told me. The publication was filled with exotic stories about spies, royal romances, historical assassinations and children raised alongside wild animals. Most mainstream publications were so propaganda-heavy, so filled with party lingo and news of top leaders’ endless meetings, that the arrival of the plain-talking, eye-catching Global Times must have felt like an episode of Sex and the City beamed into the middle of a long sermon. Articles from the 90s included The Dark World of the Russian Mafia, From Female Slave to Fashion Model, and The Unexpected Madness of Monks: Korean Buddhists’ Rivalry Doused Monastery with Blood. A few months into his stint at Global News Digest, Hu’s career was transformed when he was dispatched abroad to cover the Bosnian war for the People’s Daily. In his memoir about the experience, published in 1997, he recalled thinking that the fact of a Chinese journalist reporting on a foreign war “was likely more newsworthy than whatever articles he has to file”. To Hu, the conflict in Bosnia became the backdrop for a private battlefield in his mind, as he began measuring himself against the western journalists around him, whom he both admired and resented. “To be a soldier in a modern news war, I couldn’t defeat the western reporters, but I congratulate myself for being able to even join them for a fight,” Hu wrote in his memoir. (Almost a quarter of a century later, his Twitter avatar is a photo of him in Sarajevo, sitting on the curb taking notes.) The book is sprinkled with a mixture of pride and vulnerability, as Hu struggles with his own inferiority complex: “Why can’t I be the one who creates a sensation? Why can’t a Chinese reporter be in the limelight?” he writes at one point. He admits that he spent his time obsessing over how to “look more like a real reporter”, rather than focusing on reporting. “I couldn’t stand being looked down upon, not only on a personal level, but also on the account of being Chinese – a fact that brings with it a kind of unbearable pressure for me.” He carried this chip on his shoulder everywhere he went. On one occasion, he turned up to a news briefing that was in Albanian. He didn’t understand a word, but that didn’t stop him from asking a question in English – not to seek an answer, just to assert his presence. Hu returned to Beijing in 1996 and soon became Global News Digest’s deputy editor. “I was a war and international affairs reporter, and my personal interest was fused into our coverage,” he told me. In 1997, the paper changed its name to the Global Times, and in the next two years, circulation tripled. “China was becoming integrated with the world,” Hu said. “In the past, international news were merely pieces of knowledge or information from remote corners of the world. Gradually, international news became more and more related to China, and the Chinese audience developed a keen interest in what’s happening outside the country.” One international incident from this period symbolised that new reality. On 7 May 1999, a Nato bomb hit the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists. Officials from the US claimed that it was an accident and that the real target had been a Yugoslavian defence agency a few hundred metres down the road. But many people in China believed it was a deliberate attack, and anti-American protests erupted across the country. Two days after the bombing, the Global Times published a special issue, featuring a report by a Global Times journalist who had been speaking with the ambassador in the building just minutes before the explosion. According to Han Rongbin, a professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, events such as the embassy bombing strengthened a collective sense of aggrieved national identity. “That’s why some nationalists like to say that it was America who made them so nationalistic,” he said. As the Global Times grew, China’s most powerful politicians watched with admiration. In 2004, when the paper published a column that criticised Chinese journalists for unthinkingly accepting American media narratives about the “war on terror”, the foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, said that he’d long been waiting to read such an article. “Journalism might be without borders, but journalists do have motherlands,” wrote Li – in the Global Times – shortly after. Later that year, the president of the People’s Daily publishing group, Wang Chen, spoke at a seminar to discuss the “Global Times phenomenon”. Wang said that the minister of foreign affairs and the head of the overseas propaganda office had repeatedly told him how much they loved the paper, and that the Global Times exemplified how to make propaganda readable. In presentations to advertisers during this period, the publication would tout its close ties with top leadership, claiming that its readers included “nearly 200 key leaders of the country at the party central, the state council, the central military commission and the National People’s Congress”. As soon as each issue was published, the presentation claimed, special messengers would deliver the paper to Zhongnanhai, the walled compound where much of the Communist party elite live and work. * * * Since 2005, when he took over the paper as editor-in-chief, Hu has expanded the Global Times to an operation of 800 staff, publishing six days a week in Chinese and in English. “We needed to expand our influence, and we couldn’t do that without using English,” Hu told me, explaining the decision to launch the English edition in 2009. Looking back, the first few years of the English-language Global Times can seem like a strange interlude in the paper’s history. Located in a rented office building outside the People’s Daily compound, the English operation was largely separated from the Chinese one. Rather than rigidly following the nationalistic line, it afforded journalists some space to report on more sensitive topics. Around the time of the English edition’s launch, the Global Times hired a dozen foreign editors. Their job was to ensure that stories in English read smoothly, but they had little say on editorial decisions. The English-language content was written mostly by Chinese journalists. James Palmer, who worked at the Global Times for seven years and is now a deputy editor of the American magazine Foreign Policy, told me that in the early days, the newspaper’s English content was about 60% “banal”, 20% “mad nationalistic stuff” and 20% “genuinely interesting”. Hu differentiated his paper from the other English-language party outlet, China Daily, by running stories on subjects such as dissidents and LGBTQ rights. “The Global Times was trying to make waves,” Jemimah Steinfeld, a British former editor, told me. Staffers from this period remembered that Hu liked to paint himself as a force for progress. All reforms begin with rule-breaking, Hu told a Chinese magazine in 2013. If your type of rule-breaking helps the country, eventually the government will give it approval. This, he said, is how progress in China works. According to Wen Tao, a Chinese reporter who worked for the English edition, Hu told staff to avoid self-censorship and to pursue whatever they considered newsworthy. Wen’s pieces captured the everyday struggles of life in Beijing a decade ago: a poet criticising his local government’s plan to cut down 20,000 trees in order to extend a road; a father trying to advocate for food safety, after his children got ill from adulterated milk formula, only to be put on trial himself. In February 2010, he broke a story about the dissident artist Ai Weiwei and other local artists protesting in downtown Beijing against the demolition of a residential complex. Afterwards, Ai visited the newsroom of the English edition, and was warmly welcomed. The divergence between the English Global Times and the Chinese Global Times was striking. “Their reports depicted two different Chinas,” wrote Wen on his personal blog in 2016. Where the Chinese edition demonised international voices, the English edition reported “some realities” in an attempt to show the outside world that the Chinese, too, enjoyed a free press. “If you didn’t look at the byline or the name of the paper, it could have very well been a story from the Wall Street Journal,” Wen told me. It did not last. Not long after his Ai Weiwei story, Wen was asked to submit his resignation. “The paper was looking to push boundaries, but I probably overdid it a little bit,” Wen told me. Around that time, he ran into Hu in the elevator. Wen recalled the older journalist expressing frustration: sometimes you write your stories, hoping to make room for more reporting like this – only to find yourself being told to take a big step back. (Palmer told me that the Global Times “had a culture of two ‘serious mistakes’ every six months” and that Hu was “very regularly” told off by the propaganda authorities and other ministries.) It is hard to tell to what extent, if any, Hu’s English-language Global Times reflected his own journalistic ideals, or whether, as Wen suggested, the licence given to its reporters was itself a kind of propaganda exercise, intended to give foreigners the impression that the Chinese press enjoyed greater freedom than it really did and that he, too, was a real reporter. At the very least, it seems that during this period, at the English edition, Hu was fairly committed to performing the role of a liberal-leaning editor. Palmer recalled that in their first meeting, Hu told him, unprompted, that he wanted democracy and freedom of speech in China, but that reform had to be gradual. In Wen’s view, Hu is a deeply conflicted figure. “On the one hand, he wanted to do journalism professionally, but on the other hand, he couldn’t change his position as a party man,” he said. By 2011, as the government line on freedom of speech hardened, so did the editorial line of the Global Times. That year, the authorities detained Ai Weiwei for 81 days, and the Global Times denounced him in a series of Chinese and English op-eds, including one headlined “Ai Weiweis will be washed away by history”. “It was a very sudden pivot,” Palmer remembered. “And after that it just became worse and worse.” The American author who no longer contributes to the Global Times told me: “Their business model seems to have switched to being completely provocative and just to piss people off.” Sometimes, one former editor told me, when an article seemed particularly inflammatory or outrageous, “we sent up a red flag, and they would be like, ‘No, that’s exactly what we want to say.’” * * * There are many ways to be an editor in chief, Hu told me as his mobile phones rang in the background. “Some people might use their energy on managing, but I devote more of my energy to content.” On the phone, Hu was polite and warm, in contrast to his aggressive online persona. He took long pauses before answering most questions, as if to compose mini-essays in his mind. Every day, he told me, his team “monitors” the internet in search of popular subjects, and once they land on an idea, they prepare a summary of the issue and brief Hu on it. Then Hu gets to work, turning it into a column. For each piece, his staff typically interview two or three experts, mostly government thinktankers and professors from top universities. According to Hu, this means that his columns “don’t only reflect my own opinion, but absorb the opinions of many people in our society. We represent a somewhat mainstream take in China.” As the space permitted to alternative views has shrunk, it has become increasingly difficult to judge what proportion of China’s 1.4 billion people share the Global Times’ worldview. Scholars, journalists, writers, lawyers and activists have found their social media accounts suspended or erased because of their unspecified violation of the platform’s rules. These cases are so common and seemingly minor that they attract little international attention, but their collective effect is suffocating. In mainland China today, censorship and self-censorship are like the weather – you can complain about it, but you have to adapt to it. To rebel is to submit to the possibility of having your life ruined. Early last year, a 36-year-old woman, Zhang Zhan, decided to report from Wuhan as a citizen journalist. She was soon arrested and sentenced to four years in prison, and now, several months into a hunger strike, she is on her deathbed. Most people in China don’t know about Zhang Zhan, and those who do tend not to think about what she represents – to do so would only lead to trouble. That doesn’t mean that party-approved figures such as Hu are beyond criticism in mainland China. Hu’s critics include former contributors to the Global Times, who feel that since 2010, he has grown into an increasingly absurd, even dangerous, caricature of himself. “You might have noticed that I rarely write for them any more,” Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University, who is on the Global Times’s go-to list of experts, told me in an email. “The reason is their inclination towards extreme nationalism.” Xiang Lanxin, who is based outside China, told me something similar, having been put off by Hu’s increasingly crude politics. He used to be a frequent contributor to the Global Times, but he stopped in the early 2010s when he sensed that Hu was “no longer interested in meaningful debates”. Hu’s critics are particularly alarmed by enthusiasm for military solutions to problems. After a recent border scuffle in the Himalayas with India, Hu argued that the Chinese army should “ready themselves to launch into battle at any moment”. In another column, Hu suggested that China should build up an arsenal of 1,000 nuclear warheads. In September, the Global Times published an op-ed headlined “People’s Liberation Army jets will eventually patrol over Taiwan”. When I asked Hu about critics who accuse him of warmongering, he became agitated and denied suggesting that China should start a war. “What I said is that if Taiwan started to assault us, then we must fight back with overwhelming force,” he told me. (One wonders what kind of action would constitute an “assault” in his view.) To Xiang, Hu’s influence is far more important than that of the headline-grabbing Wolf Warrior diplomats. Where diplomats can be silenced with one word from the top, the feelings of Chinese superiority that the Global Times stokes every day are far harder to control. “This newspaper has been leading popular mood in a nationalist direction for a long time, and the consequences of this are not to be taken lightly,” Xiang told an interviewer last year. Occasionally, it can seem as if Hu is becoming a stranger in a sphere he helped build. In May, the Weibo account of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission posted an image titled China Ignition vs India Ignition, contrasting a recent Chinese rocket launch with Indian cremation – a reference to the country’s surging Covid death toll. When Hu criticised the post and expressed sympathy for India’s plight, he was attacked by nationalists for being too soft on one of China’s principal rivals. A decade ago, on social media, Hu had seemed to be the No 1 flag bearer for Chinese nationalism. Now his status is not so certain. On Weibo, while Hu was being criticised for insufficient national pride, one Global Times journalist asked: “Has Hu Xijin changed? Or, have the times changed?” The answer seemed clear. Hu is 61, and rumours about his imminent retirement surface periodically. Yet he remains as zealous and full of fight as he was three decades ago. “He really is the soul of the paper,” Wen told me. “It’s very hard to imagine a de-Huxijinised Global Times.” The audience he once dreamed of as a young reporter in Bosnia – readers who don’t unquestioningly admire western journalism and instead cheer on their Chinese counterparts – has materialised. Each of his Weibo posts are followed by thousands of comments and tens of thousands of likes. Hu likes to call himself a shubianzhe, an antiquated term for a guard stationed on the nation’s frontiers, keeping it safe. In just the past week, fulfilling this duty has involved insulting Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, comparing Hong Kong activist Nathan Law to a 6 January Capitol rioter, taunting the Australian prime minister, bickering with a Florida senator and posting numerous cartoons highlighting American hypocrisy. It is a ceaseless task. For now, Hu fights on. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

          "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us. We will now be closing this Covid blog. However, you can catch up with all the latest developments on our new blog here. Here is a snapshot of all the key Covid developments: Omicron has killed at least one person in Britain, prime minister Boris Johnson revealed. Boris Johnson issued an appeal to members of the public to step forward to assist the Covid booster jab programme. Norway tightens Covid measures and bans serving of alcohol in bid to halt Omicron outbreak. Protests in Latvia turned violent after a police officer was injured and four demonstrators arrested as several thousand people in the capital Riga protested anti-Covid restrictions. Peru says it is battling a “resurgence” of the pandemic, with infections and deaths rising. The country has the world’s highest coronavirus death rate. China has recorded its first case of the Omicron variant, state media report authorities in the northeastern city of Tianjin as saying. In Denmark, health authorities say a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will be offered sooner to everyone over 40 to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. The US Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots. California will impose a statewide mask mandate in all indoor public spaces. Covid-19 cases in Canada may rapidly rise in the coming days due to community spread of the Omicron variant. Nigeria will destroy around one million expired Covid-19 vaccines, Faisal Shuaib, head of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), said. At least 200,000 Covid-19 vaccines have expired in Senegal without being used in the past two months and another 200,000 are set to expire at the end of December because demand is too slow, the head of its immunisation programme said. Thailand will halve to three months the time between administering a second Covid-19 vaccine shot and a booster, health officials said. The Omicron variant likely accounts for 11% of new Covid-19 cases in Ireland, its Chief Medical Officer said on Monday, while predicting a very rapid increase in the proportion of Omicron infections in the coming days amid probable widespread community transmission. Ireland has so far confirmed 18 cases of the variant through whole-genome sequencing out of an average 4,000 Covid-19 cases it has been reporting each day. A trait distinguishing Omicron from the dominant Delta variant suggests a much higher total, said the National Public Health Emergency Team. Ireland’s Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said in a statement: Using this methodology, we estimate that 11% of cases are now due to the Omicron variant, an increase from less than 1% only one week ago.” Just over 90% of Ireland’s eligible 3.9 million people over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated - one of the highest rates of protection in Europe - and it has administered a further 1.2 million booster doses. Coronavirus passports could lead to increased uptake of vaccines, especially among young people, a study suggests. Research by the University of Oxford found Covid-19 certification led to increased jab uptake 20 days before and 40 days after introduction in countries with lower-than-average vaccination coverage. Increase in vaccine uptake was most pronounced in people under 30. The modelling analysis was published in The Lancet Public Health. Coronavirus passports require people to have proof of either complete vaccination, a negative test or a Covid-19 recovery certificate to access public venues and events, such as restaurants or concerts. As well as helping to prevent the spread of coronavirus in public venues, it has been suggested they may encourage more unvaccinated people to get vaccinated, particularly those who perceive their own risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid-19 as low. Read the full story from our reporter Andrew Gregory here. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as my colleague Jedidajah Otte takes a well-deserved break. First up, some Covid numbers out of Australia. The country’s most populous state of NSW has recorded 804 new Covid-19 cases and one death, a significant jump from previous days. Victoria recorded 1,189 new cases a six deaths. Prime minister Scott Morrison called on states and territories to ease their last remaining Covid-19 restrictions, as Western Australia announced plans to reopen its hard border to the rest of the nation. The US Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots. The Associated Press reports: The Air Force gave its forces until 2 November to get the vaccine, and thousands have either refused or sought an exemption. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Monday that these are the first airmen to be administratively discharged for reasons involving the vaccine. She said all of them were in their first term of enlistment, so they were younger, lower-ranking personnel. And while the Air Force does not disclose what type of discharge a service member gets, legislation working its way through Congress limits the military to giving troops in vaccine refusal cases an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions. The Pentagon earlier this year required the vaccine for all members of the military, including active duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Each of the services set its own deadlines and procedures for the mandate, and the Air Force set the earliest deadline. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the vaccine is critical to maintaining the health of the force and its ability to respond to an national security crisis. None of the 27 airmen sought any type of exemption, medical, administrative or religious, Stefanek said. Several officials from the other services said they believe that so far only the Air Force has gotten this far along in the process and discharged people over the vaccine refusal. As a result, they were formally removed from service for failure to obey an order. Stefanek said it is also possible that some had other infractions on their records, but all had the vaccine refusal as one of the elements of their discharge. It is not unusual for members of the military to be thrown out of the service for disobeying an order — discipline is a key tenet of the armed services. As a comparison, Stefanek said that in the first three quarters of 2021, about 1,800 airmen were discharged for failure to follow orders. According to the latest Air Force data, more than 1,000 airmen have refused the shot and more than 4,700 are seeking a religious exemption. As of last week, a bit more than 97% of the active duty Air Force had gotten at least one shot. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has issued an appeal to members of the public to step forward to assist the Covid booster jab programme in a race to counter the new Omicron variant. Johnson, who announced the new mass booster programme on Sunday, said “tens of thousands” of volunteers were needed in order to ramp up delivery of booster jabs to an unprecedented pace. Roles needing to be filled by volunteers range from stewards to organise and manage the queues to trained vaccinators to administer the jabs. On Sunday, Johnson announced that every eligible adult in England is to be offered a booster shot by the end of December, a month earlier than previously planned, while resources are being made available to the devolved nations to speed up delivery. Johnson has acknowledged that it will require an “extraordinary effort” by the NHS, with hundreds more vaccination sites, mobile units and pop-ups due to open over the coming week. In a direct appeal to the public, Johnson said: As part of our Get Boosted Now vaccination drive we need to increase our jabbing capacity to unprecedented levels. But to achieve something on this scale, we need your help. So today I’m issuing a call for volunteers to join our national mission to get jabs in arms. We need tens of thousands of people to help out, everyone from trained vaccinators to stewards. Many thousands have already given their time but we need you to come forward again, to work alongside our brilliant GPs, doctors, nurses and pharmacists, to deliver jabs and save lives. So please come forward if you can. There are currently almost 3,000 vaccine sites across the country, staffed by over 90,000 volunteers, PA reports. After the NHS last week announced a recruitment drive for 10,000 paid vaccinators, 4,500 people have registered their interest while 13,000 have come forward as volunteer stewards. Brazil logged 2,082 fresh infections and 48 new deaths from Covid-19 on Monday as infections are still decreasing in the country, with 7,133 new infections reported on average each day. That’s 9% of the peak, which was reached on 23 June, according to the Reuters Covid-19 Tracker. Overall, 22,188,179 infections and 616,744 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in the country since the pandemic began. California will impose a statewide mask mandate in all indoor public spaces as Covid-19 case rates soar with the spread of the new Omicron variant, the state secretary of health and human services, Mark Ghaly, said on Monday. As of Saturday, 7.4 million of California’s population of around 40 million had received their booster jab, according to the office of governor Gavin Newsom. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has written up a piece on how the NHS will gear up for the “huge challenge” of delivering prime minister Boris Johnson’s new booster jab target: Doctors, nurses and NHS executives will have to find a way of trebling the rate of booster vaccinations to more than 1.2m a day if they are to offer all eligible adults in the UK a jab by the end of December. The target came as a surprise to the health service, which will now have to find staff to work through the holiday season, alongside the 750 military personnel drafted in to assist them. Full story here: Covid-19 cases in Canada may rapidly rise in the coming days due to community spread of the Omicron variant, mirroring the situation in the country’s most populous province of Ontario, Canada’s top health official said on Monday. Ontario, which accounts for almost 40% of Canada’s population of 39 million people, reported 1,536 cases of Covid-19 on Monday, a more-than 70% increase from a week ago, including 80 cases of the Omicron variant. The surge has prompted the provincial government to suspend easing of restrictions that were planned to be lifted ahead of the holiday season, Reuters reports. The World Health Organization has said that the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a “very high” global risk, having reached over 60 countries, while it remains unclear for the moment how much vaccines can protect against it. Ontario has directed government staff, who started gradually returning to their offices in November, to go back to working from home at least until early-February, CTV news reported Monday. The University of Victoria in the provimce of British Columbia announced on Sunday that it will be moving its in-person exams online from Monday after a rise in Covid-19 cases on Vancouver Island. Schools in England should not be closing early for Christmas unless they have been told it is “necessary” on public health grounds, the British government has said. The prime minister’s official spokesman indicated that schools would be kept open unless there is an “absolute public health emergency”, PA reports. Asked whether schools might close early for Christmas, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: Certainly we do not think anyone should be closing schools early unless they have received advice from the local director of public health that it’s necessary on public health grounds. We wouldn’t want to see that happening routinely, just as a precaution, because as I’ve said, education is vital. And we’ve seen, sadly, because of the public health crisis, children have to miss face-to-face education. And so it’s very important that we maintain schooling as much as possible. The NASUWT teaching union however is calling on education secretary Nadhim Zahawi to urgently announce additional measures for schools and colleges before the Christmas break to avoid a repeat of the “chaos” last year. The Government should advise schools to cancel or postpone non-essential activities and events immediately, as well as move to online staff and parental meetings, the union says. A staggered return of pupils in January should be considered and extra on-site testing facilities should be provided until the February half-term, the union says. Health secretary Sajid Javid said on Monday he could not guarantee schools would not close again due to the pandemic. Zahawi said on Sunday he could not guarantee that all schools would be open everywhere in January. Northern Ireland is set to be overwhelmed by the Covid-19 variant Omicron “very, very soon”, the deputy first minister warned on Monday. Michelle O’Neill said there were 10 confirmed cases of the new Covid-19 variant in Northern Ireland on Monday. PA reports: Earlier first minister Paul Givan urged take-up of the Covid vaccination booster, warning that a “storm coming our way”. However his party [the DUP] has opposed Covid certification for entering some hospitality venues. On Monday evening, MLAs debated the regulations in the Assembly chamber where health minister Robin Swann urged united support for the scheme. “A united front is what we need, with joined up policies and united messaging. That has been sadly lacking at critical stages to date,” he told MLAs. “It is my fervent hope that today marks a turning point, that, given the seriousness of our situation, that this House can debate this measure rationally and respectfully.” However, DUP MLA Pam Cameron said her party will not back the Covid certification scheme. There was a protest at Stormont earlier by those opposed to the scheme. Former DUP economy minister Paul Frew, a vocal critic of mandatory certification, was among a number of party members who met with the protesters outside Parliament Buildings. He suggested the scheme could be halted by way of legal challenge. “There are going to be legal challenges, there is no doubt about that and that’s where it might be stopped,” he told demonstrators. “I hear you 100%, and I’m with you, but this will only be tested legally.” Speaking inside the Assembly chamber, Ms O’Neill called for parties to unite. “If ever there was a time for a united front on the public health message, it’s today because we’re facing into a very, very difficult period in the weeks ahead where we see this new variant now coming on stream, we’re probably about two weeks behind what’s happening in England and Scotland and they are getting into very difficult territory,” she told MLAs during Executive Office questions. “We are going to be overwhelmed with this new variant very, very soon. “My priority is to keep businesses open and safe. I want to keep every door opened but to make sure it’s a safe space for people to enter.” Ms O’Neill also said she had spent the weekend speaking to the Treasury, making the case “very strongly” for financial support for businesses. “That’s where we would want to be if we could have the resource to be able to do that,” she added. The vaccine booster programme in Northern Ireland is being accelerated in response to the threat posed by Omicron and has opened up to all over-30s. [...] On Monday morning there were 309 Covid positive patients in hospital, of whom 32 were in intensive care. The US Supreme Court on Monday rejected a challenge to New York’s refusal to allow religious exemptions to its mandate that certain healthcare workers in the state be vaccinated against Covid-19. Acting in two cases, the justices denied emergency requests for an injunction requiring the state to allow religious exemptions while litigation over the mandate’s legality continues in lower courts. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted the injunction, Reuters reports. Norway will ban the serving of alcohol in bars and restaurants, impose stricter rules in schools and speed up vaccination as part of new efforts to curb the outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the government said on Monday. Remote working will be compulsory where possible, mask mandates will be extended and access to public swimming pools and gyms restricted. The measures will come into force overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday and are expected to last four weeks. “For many this will feel like a lockdown, if not of society then of their lives and of their livelihoods,” prime minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news conference. The move comes after the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) warned on Monday that restrictions must be tightened to avoid up to 300,000 people contracting Covid every day. The institute added that there could be up to 200 hospital admissions daily unless stricter measures were put in place. On Monday, Norway logged 358 hospitalisations with Covid, a new daily record. Night clubs in England will have to ask revellers who prefer using their Covid pass to gain entry instead of doing a lateral flow test to show proof that they have had a booster jab as part of future plans, the British health secretary has said. Sajid Javid told parliament on Monday that it is the government’s intention to include proof of a booster jab, once all adults have had a chance to get theirs. He said: From Wednesday - subject to this House’s approval - you’ll need to show a negative lateral flow test to get into nightclubs and large events, with an exemption for the double vaccinated. Once all adults have had a reasonable chance to get their booster jab, we intend to change this exemption to require a booster dose. MPs are due to vote on Tuesday on the requirement for NHS Covid passes showing a person’s vaccine details or test results in England, which would come into effect from Wednesday. But Javid said it was “misleading” to say MPs are being asked to vote on “vaccine passports”. He said: The government has been absolutely clear about when it talks about access to nightclubs or to very large gatherings [...] that the requirement is to take a free lateral flow test and make sure it’s negative. And if you don’t want to do that then you can prove your vaccine status. It’s up to that individual. That’s not a vaccine passport and the sooner we get rid of this misleading description of what the government is proposing, the better. The NHS in England was put onto a crisis footing on Monday night as hospitals were told to discharge as many patients as possible ahead of a potential Omicron-driven surge in Covid cases. Anyone possible should be discharged to care homes, hospices, their own homes and hotels before Christmas in order to free up beds, amid warnings that January could see hospitals caring for even greater numbers of patients than they did at the worst point of the pandemic back in January. Hospitals and GPs have also been told to scale back the normal services they provide, and limit care to those needing urgent attention, so NHS staff can be freed up to deliver boosters, in a letter from NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Prof Stephen Powis, who said the service is now facing a major threat classes as a Level 4 “national incident”. Hospitals will undertake fewer non-urgent operations but “highest clinical priority patients”, including people with cancer and those who have been waiting a long time, will be given priority. They have also been told to take ambulance-borne patients into A&amp;E quicker so that paramedics can get back on the road to answer more 999 calls, speed up efforts to bring in nurses from overseas to help tackle the NHS’s lack of staff and send as many patients as possible for surgery at private hospitals. It is understood that 386,000 people in England booked booster jabs – almost 50,000 an hour – during the course of Monday, the first day after Boris Johnson’s appeal to the public to get fully vaccinated as a matter of urgency. However, sources concede that health service bosses do not know when they will be able to hit the 1m jabs a day the prime minister has said are needed. Travel restrictions imposed on people coming to the UK should be removed given how widespread the Omicron variant is in the country, the British health secretary suggested on Monday. PA reports: Sajid Javid told MPs the justification for having the rules is “minimised” by the new coronavirus variant “spreading rapidly” throughout the country. He added he has raised the matter with transport ministers and he hopes the government “can act quickly”. His remarks came after Labour former minister Ben Bradshaw repeated his call for the “very draconian, costly and complex” travel rules introduced only recently to try and stop Omicron arriving in the UK to be dropped. The UK’s largest airlines and travel companies have also expressed their concerns about the “haphazard and disproportionate” restrictions imposed by the government. Tougher rules introduced due to Omicron mean everyone entering the UK must have evidence of a negative pre-departure test, and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a post-arrival test. People arriving in the UK from the 11 African countries currently on the red list must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel at a cost of 2,285 for solo travellers. Mr Javid told the House of Commons: “I think [Mr Bradshaw] makes a very good point, given that we already know that the Omicron variant is fast becoming the dominant variant in our capital city, spreading rapidly throughout the country, the justification for having those rules is minimised. “It’s something that I’ve already raised with my colleagues in the Department for Transport and I do hope that we can act quickly.” [...] It comes as ministers are set to consider whether to replace hotel quarantine with self-isolation at home for fully vaccinated travellers. Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK Labour party, has backed the government’s moves to ramp up the Covid booster jab programme as he warned the NHS is in danger of being “overwhelmed” by the emergence of the new Omicron variant. Starmer said that it was essential to put the national interest first as he urged people to “stick to the rules” and get their top-up injections. Prime minister Boris Johnson announced on Sunday that every eligible adult in England was to be offered a third dose of the vaccine by the end of December. In a televised address in response, Starmer said ministers should have acted sooner in the face of the threat from the fast-spreading Omicron strain. He said: We may not be certain how dangerous it is but we do know that lives are at risk and again our NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed. If that happens more people will die. So we must do everything that we can to protect the NHS. Sir Keir said delivering the accelerated booster jab programme would be a “big challenge” but that he was confident the public would rise to meet it. Time and time again the British people have risen to the challenge so let’s pull together now and do the right thing once more,” he said. At times like this, we must all put the national interest first and play by the rules. Of course I understand that sticking to the rules can be inconvenient but stick to the rules we must. It would be easy to let the festivities we’ve all been looking forward to, divert us from our national duty. Getting jabbed, wearing masks and working from home if we can really will help prevent infections and help prevent the NHS being overwhelmed. Hello, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be taking over now. Feel free to get in touch if you would like to flag anything you think is relevant to our coverage, I’m on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. Nigeria will destroy around 1 million expired Covid-19 vaccines, the head of its primary care agency has said. It’s been a quieter day today as Omicron continues its spread around the world, but the blog has still posted about lots of important developments. Cyprus introduced new measures to curb a Covid surge, including vaccinations for 11-15 year olds, isolation for cases and close contacts, and bringing forward boosters. China reported its first Omicron case in the northern city of Tianjin from an overseas returnee. The UK reported its first patient to have died from Omicron, as the government issued a warning to the public not to assume the variant is less dangerous than other strains. Citizens are rushing to get their booster jabs to protect themselves against the new variant, which is poised to replace Delta as the dominant strain in the UK, with queues round the block for vaccination centres and the NHS website crashing under the demand for appointments. Norway announced plans to introduce new restrictions, which will be unveiled at a press conference tonight. Rachel Hall here signing out for the rest of the day. Thanks for following and for sharing your tips and insights with me. The global Covid blog will continue this evening, in Jedidajah Otte’s capable hands. Italy reported 98 coronavirus-related deaths on Monday against 66 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections fell to 12,712 from 19,215. Reuters reports: Italy has registered 134,929 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 5.24 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 6,951 on Monday, up from 6,697 a day earlier. There were 60 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 54 on Sunday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 856 from a previous 829. Some 313,536 tests for COVID-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 501,815, the health ministry said. Reuters have published a handy summary of key developments today in the spread of Omicron. Europe Britain reported at least one death from the Omicron variant, the first publicly confirmed death globally, and urged people to get booster shots. Britain’s health secretary said the Omicron variant will become the dominant variant in the capital in the next 48 hours, while Denmark expects it to become dominant this week. Norway will further tighten restrictions in a bid to limit an expected surge of Omicron, its prime minister said. Middle east and Africa The president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has the world’s lowest vaccination rate at roughly 0.1%, urged people to get inoculated after the Omicron variant was detected there and as cases increase exponentially. Around 400,000 Covid-19 vaccines are set to expire in Senegal by end-December, the head of its immunisation programme said, as the country faces logistical problems, short shelf life and vaccine hesitancy. Ghana’s main international airport operator said it will fine airlines $3,500 for every passenger they bring in that is not vaccinated or that tests positive on arrival. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who tested positive on Sunday, is still showing mild symptoms, his office said. Emma Raducanu, the 19-year-old British champion of the U.S. Open, tested positive and will miss this week’s exhibition event in Abu Dhabi. Asia-Pacific Major Chinese manufacturing province Zhejiang is fighting its first cluster this year, with hundreds of thousands of citizens in quarantine and virus-hit areas suspending business operations, cutting flights and cancelling events. Health authorities in Tianjin have detected mainland China’s first Omicron case, state media reported. Eight Hong Kong pro-democracy activists were sentenced to up to 14 months in prison for a Tiananmen vigil last year, which the police had banned citing coronavirus restrictions. New Caledonia’s pro-independence movement rejected Sunday’s “no” vote, in which over half of voters abstained after France declined to delay the ballot to allow for a mourning period following a surge in infections. Americas The United States crossed 50 million cases on Sunday, according to Reuters tally. Catholic pilgrims estimated at over 1.5 million people gathered in Mexico City on Sunday for the annual Virgin of Guadalupe gathering after festivities were cancelled last year. A Brazilian Supreme Court justice ruled on Saturday the country must demand proof of vaccination for visitors seeking entry, a day after hackers hit the health ministry website targeting vaccination data. Australia may manufacture mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 and other diseases by 2024 under an in-principle agreement struck with pharmaceutical giant Moderna, Sarah Martin reports. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly and will become the dominant variant in the British capital in the next 48 hours. The UK’s Health Secretary Sajid Javid told parliament: “No variant of COVID-19 has spread this fast.” “While Omicron represents over 20 percent of cases in England, we’ve already seen it rise to over 44% in London and we expect it to become the dominant Covid-19 variant in the capital in the next 48 hours.” Denmark has said that Omicron is expected to become the dominant coronavirus variant this week, with new daily cases reaching around 10,000. The country’s Serum Institute has detected 3,437 Omicron cases since it was first detected in Denmark on 22 November. In the UK, 54,661 people tested positive for coronavirus on Monday, while there were 38 deaths within 28 days of a positive death, and 926 people were admitted to hospital, official figures show. The weekly case tally was 9.2% higher than the preceding week, at 363,682. Cyprus will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 to 11 as part of a package of new measures to curb a Covid surge following the first confirmed cases of the omicron variant on the island. Health Minister Michalis Hadjipantela unveiled the additional measures, which included cutting the mandatory six-week waiting period for booster shots by two weeks, and tighter restrictions for infected individuals and close contacts. Associated Press reports: Hadjipantela said anyone diagnosed with the omicron variant or any other new mutation will have to undergo compulsory isolation at their usual residence. Close contacts will be required to undergo a rapid antigen test within 72 hours and a PCR test a week later. Booster shot recipients are exempted. Meanwhile, the country’s SafePass — or proof of vaccination — will be revoked as of Wednesday for anyone not receiving a booster shot within seven months of completing their inoculation. Also as of this week, unvaccinated people will be barred from attending christenings, weddings and hotel receptions on top of an earlier decision to exclude them from stadiums, cinemas, theaters and nightclubs. There are calls in Germany for its vaccine advisory panel to overhaul the way it evaluates Covid-19 shots in a bid to tame soaring infections. Reuters reports: The panel of 18 appointees known as STIKO last week recommended vaccinations for limited numbers of children, including those at risk of developing severe Covid-19, but stopped short of a blanket recommendation for 5-11 year olds. That limited approval, combined with STIKO taking weeks to fall into line with Germany’s regional health ministers widening the eligibility for booster shots from September, has stoked a debate on whether the expert panel needs to be reorganised to speed up decisions to keep up with the of pace of the coronavirus. In recent weeks, Germany has been among the worst-hit countries in western Europe, with infection rates among school-age children twice as high as the all-age rate. At least 200,000 Covid-19 vaccines have expired in Senegal without being used in the past two months and another 200,000 will expire at the end of December due to slow demand. Reuters reports: African governments have been calling for more Covid-19 vaccines to help catch up with richer regions, where vaccine rollouts have been humming along for more than a year. Yet, as the pace of supply has picked up in recent weeks some countries have struggled to keep pace. Logistical problems, the short shelf life of vaccines that arrive from donors, and vaccine hesitancy have all kept doses from reaching arms. Up to 1 million Cpvid-19 vaccines expired in Nigeria last month, Reuters revealed. “The main problem is vaccine hesitation,” said Ousseynou Badiane, who is in charge of Senegal’s vaccine rollout. “The number of cases is decreasing. They ask: ‘why is it important to get vaccinated if the illness is not there now’?” Senegal is currently vaccinating between 1,000 and 2,000 people per day, Badiane told Reuters, down from 15,000 during the summer. At this pace, it cannot use all the vaccines it has. Part of the problem is the short shelf life of vaccines that arrive from donors that include the United States and China. Our science correspondent Linda Geddes has written about whether lateral flow Covid tests can be trusted in the face of the Omicron variant. She writes that the emergence of Omicron has thrown a spanner in the works: According to the latest data, just one month after your second Pfizer or AstraZeneca jab, the ability of antibodies to neutralise Omicron is 30 times lower than if you were infected with the Delta variant – reinforcing the message that double-vaccination is no guarantee against infection. So, if you’re relying on a LFT to guide whether or not it is safe for you to leave the house, the odds of it being wrong just got higher. You can read her full analysis here: An update from the Guardian’s China correspondent, Vincent Ni, on the situation in the country. Mainland China has reported its first Omicron case in the northern city of Tianjin, as the country’s eastern province of Zhejiang has been battling a rise in new infections of Delta variant in recent weeks. The Chinese authorities reported that the Omicron case was detected from an overseas returnee, who showed no symptoms upon arrival on 9 December. The patient is now being quarantined and treated in a designated hospital. The first Omicron case in Tianjin came as its nearby Beijing is gearing up for the Winter Olympics, which is to be held in February. The Guardian understands the patient is not related to the Games. The arrival of Omicron – thought to be a more transmissible variant than Delta - comes as the eastern Zhejiang province – a province with 65 million population – is battling against its first domestic cluster outbreak this year. Among the 80 new locally transmitted cases with symptoms in mainland China on 12 December, 74 were identified in Zhejiang. In October, the province reported just one local case. The outbreak in Zhejiang – home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba - has led more than a dozen publicly listed companies to halt production on Monday. Their shares fell sharply as a result. The companies said that they would comply with the anti-virus control measures imposed by the local government, which will decide when production can be resumed. Among the worst-affected cities in Zhejiang province is Shaoxing. Since 5 December, 123 of the 192 cases detected in the province were from the city of 5 million. A mass testing programme is under way. Early this month, the Chinese region of Hong Kong – which runs a separate health system from the Mainland - reported it first cases of Omicron. On Monday, the territory reported two additional cases of the variant, bringing the total to seven. Hong Kong’s health authorities said that both cases were imported from the UK, where Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs on Monday that Omicron now represents 20% of Covid cases in England. Reuters has published some facts and figures on the Covax programme, which is backed by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), and aims to deliver vaccines to poorer countries. The programme has delivered more than 610m Covid-19 vaccine doses to 144 countries, Gavi data shows. But in September, the 2021 delivery target was cut by nearly 30% to 1.425bn doses. China has detected its first Omicron case, in a traveller arriving from overseas in the northern port city of Tianjin, state-run Tianjin Daily reports. The traveller arrived in the city on 9 December and is being treated in isolation in hospital. Hungary has detected its first two cases of Omicron, according to state television. Denmark is pushing forward its vaccine programme to enable everyone over 40 to receive a third booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. This would mean that everyone aged 40 and above can get the vaccine four and a half months after the second jab, the country’s health authority said. Reuters reports: A third dose is “safe and effective” as soon as three months after the initial vaccine course, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said last week. Denmark is second worldwide only to the UK in confirmed cases of Omicron, with both countries having extensive sequencing of samples to detect variants quickly. Russia’s parliament is abandoning a draft bill that would have required people travelling by plane or train to present QR codes showing proof of immunity to Covid-19. Reuters reported that the U-turn came in response to strong public opposition to the proposal, which would effectively have forced people to get vaccinated - or show that they had caught the disease and recovered - in order to travel around the country. Russia has the third highest death toll from Covid-19 after the United States and Brazil, and the Kremlin has expressed frequent frustration at the slow public uptake of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine. British prime minister Boris Johnson said on Monday the first patient had died after contracting the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, Sky News reports. The Guardian’s full report is here: Norway will further tighten its coronavirus restrictions this week in order to limit the spread of the virus, Reuters reports. Prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre told Norwegian news agency NTB on Monday. “The situation is serious. The spread of infection is too high and we have to take action to limit this development.” Norway is setting record highs both in terms of new Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations, partly due to the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. A news conference will be held at 8pm CET tonight to outline the measures. UK vaccination centres have been overwhelmed with demand for the booster vaccination, which is a key tool in the country’s bid to stem a “tidal wave” of Omicron. The NHS website has crashed under the scale of demand, while long queues have been reported outside vaccinations centres around the country. On Sunday night, the prime minister Boris Johnson unveiled plans to vaccinate 1 million people per day – higher than any time so far in the campaign – to limit the variant’s rapid spread and avoid reintroducing restrictions that would have onerous implications for society and the economy.

Thailand will halve to three months the time between administering a second Covid-19 vaccine shot and a booster, health officials have said, to try to strengthen immunity in anticipation of a local spread of the Omicron variant. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa, 69, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, though is showing only mild symptoms, the presidency said. Indonesia will start administering Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six to 11 on Tuesday. Australia’s most isolated state – Western Australia – will fully reopen its borders on 5 February after almost two years sealed off from Covid and the world. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, announced on Monday plans to allow interstate and international travellers to enter the state without quarantine from midnight on 5 February, when the state was expected to hit its 90% fully vaccinated target. Russia says it has detected Omicron in 16 people who returned from South Africa. The Interfax news agency cited deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova giving the figures. Pakistan has also detected its first confirmed Omicron case. New work from home guidance takes effect in England today, following recently tightened coronavirus guidance. British prime minister Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccinations, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to stem an incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. New Zealand health authorities are investigating claims that a man received up to 10 Covid-19 vaccination doses in one day on behalf of other people, believed to be skirting tough restrictions on the unvaccinated. That is it from me, Martin Belam, today. You can look forward to the company of Rachel Hall to take you through the rest of the day’s global Covid news. Andrew Sparrow has our combined UK Covid and politics live blog. I will see you tomorrow. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic the president of one of the largest Native American–run non-profits has warned that health and economic disparities are still seriously affecting Indigenous communities, despite some progress achieved by the Biden administration. Josh Arce, president of the Partnerships with Native Americans (PWNA), told the Guardian in an interview that challenges affecting Indigenous groups ranged from health inequities such as high rates of diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses to inadequate infrastructure such as running water and reliable electricity. Nearly all of these problems were worsened by the pandemic. “The issues are, by and large, some of the same issues that we’ve been confronted with but they’ve been really highlighted and exacerbated by Covid-19 throughout the past two and a half years,” said Arce, who added that such challenges “really permeate all aspects of Native life and communities”. For centuries, Indigenous communities in the US have faced challenges in public health, education, infrastructure and other areas, an aftershock of violent colonization and widespread racism. While the Biden administration has marked some progress, such as the appointment of Native American Deb Haaland as secretary of the interior, an achievement that Arce noted was critical and brought hope to Native communities, Arce warned that more action is needed to ensure more progress for Indigenous communities in the US. Read more of Gloria Oladipo’s report here: Native American communities lashed by Covid, worsening chronic inequities India has reported its lowest tally of active Covid-19 cases in 18 months, but a sharp drop in the use of protective face masks is causing concern after a rise in the number of infections with the Omicron variant. Many people have been standing or sitting close to each other without masks, or covering only their chins, at big rallies held by political parties in several states before elections. Something similar happened before the Delta variant ravaged India from April. Cases have come down sharply since then, with an active Covid-19 total of 91,456 as of early Monday, the lowest in 561 days, according to the health ministry. Krishna N Das and Chandini Monnappa report for Reuters that cases of the Omicron variant though have risen to at least 36 in India, and accounted for 3% of the virus sequences analysed in the country in the past two weeks, with Delta accounting for the rest. Health authorities have been urging people to cover their mouths in public. “The falling graph of mask use could cost us,” top Indian health official Vinod Kumar Paul told a recent news briefing. “Mask is a universal vaccine, works on every variant.” France will be hit by a sixth Covid-19 wave next month due to the emergence of the new, more contagious, Omicron variant of the disease while the country is still in the midst of the current, Delta-fuelled, fifth wave of the pandemic, according to a leading French hospital executive. “We haven’t said a word on the sixth wave, which is Omicron, which will come later, in January,” Martin Hirsch, head of Paris’s AP-HP hospitals group, Europe’s largest hospital system, told RTL radio according to Reuters. Pakistan has confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant, in the country’s most populous city of Karachi, the country’s National Institute of Health (NIH) said on Monday. “The NIH has been able to confirm … that a recently suspected sample from Karachi is indeed the ‘Omicron variant’,” the NIH said in a Tweet. “This is the first confirmed case but continued surveillance of suspected samples is in place to identify the trends.” Authorities in the south Asian nation had begun investigating a first suspected case of the Omicron variant of coronavirus last week, a health ministry official told Reuters on Thursday. After a provincial official in southern Sindh province initially said the variant had been identified in a private hospital patient, the NIH had then said they were still carrying out sequencing to confirm the case was that of Omicron. Pakistan this month placed travel restrictions on several countries in southern Africa in the wake of the discovery of the variant. Andrew Sparrow has launched our UK Covid and politics live blog here, so he will be picking up further UK developments there. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the globe. Stephen Reicher, professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews, urged people to “think carefully” about their social contacts in the run-up to Christmas. PA Media quotes the member of government advisory body the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B) told ITV’s Good Morning Britain saying: At the moment, we’re in a situation where the new variant in effect is coming at us like an express train. We’ve got to do something or else we’re in real danger of overwhelming our society and overwhelming the NHS. And there’s so many things you can do. The first thing, and the most obvious thing, is that if you reduce the number of social contacts you have you limit the spread of the infection. Now, nobody wants to give up their Christmas parties, and nobody wants to miss out on meeting up with people. It’s a little bit like Christmas dinner – if you have too big a Christmas breakfast, then you spoil your appetite for your Christmas dinner, which is what really counts. And I think, in the same way, we need to think really seriously about our contacts. How important are they? Do we really need them and is it more important to act carefully now so that the contacts we really want and we really need are still happening? We won’t get any official figures on the impact of England’s new “work from home if possible” directive on transport for a few hours yet, but ITV’s London political correspondent Simon Harris has just posted a picture of his very empty commute this morning. Some follow-up on the latest Omicron concerns in Wales, where Cathy Owen reports for WalesOnline that health minister Eluned Morgan has warned new restrictions might be needed. Owen writes: Speaking on BBC Politics Wales, Ms Morgan said she expected the numbers in Wales to “change very quickly in a very short space of time”. Asked whether that advice might change, Ms Morgan said: “I think there will come a point where that may be likely to happen. The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind of restrictions that we saw last Christmas unless we absolutely have to. We know that last Christmas was really disappointing for so many people. That’s not where we want to be. But we will always act in the best interests of the people of Wales.” Wales’ coronavirus rules are now being reviewed weekly instead of every three weeks in response to the new variant. In response to Boris Johnson’s televised statement yesterday, first minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said: This is a fast-moving form of coronavirus, which has the potential to cause a large wave of infections in Wales. This could lead to large numbers of people needing hospital treatment at a time when our NHS is under significant pressure. Our best defence continues to be vaccination. Emerging evidence shows the booster dose is vital. We are doing everything we can to accelerate our vaccination programme to increase the number of people who will receive their booster in the coming days and weeks. Older people and those at greatest risk are being prioritised at the moment. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf has been on the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland radio programme today, and said that it was “inevitable” that first minister Nicola Sturgeon would announce further anti-Covid measures when she addresses the Scottish parliament tomorrow. Sturgeon has said that following yesterday’s television address by the UK’s prime minister, Scotland would also be expanding its booster programme. The BBC quote her saying: I can confirm that urgent work is under way to further accelerate roll out of the booster vaccination programme in Scotland. Scotland already has the highest proportion of the over-12 population protected with booster or third doses of all the UK nations. Now, however, urgent efforts are being made to step up the pace even further with the aim of offering a booster jag appointment to all eligible adults by the end of this year if possible. Thailand will halve to three months the time between administering a second Covid-19 vaccine shot and a booster, a health official said on Monday, to try to strengthen immunity in anticipation of a local spread of the Omicron variant. Reuters report that Thailand has so far detected eight imported cases of the Omicron variant but has yet to see community transmission, according to its health ministry. Omicron has been reported in dozens of countries. “Because Omicron is now widespread, the booster third shot would help lessen the severity of symptoms and reduce the death rate,” said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, spokesperson for the government’s Covid taskforce. Taweesin said recipients of a second shot in August or September could get boosters right away at any vaccine centre nationwide. More than 43 million people – or 60% of people in Thailand – have received two doses of a vaccine so far. The UK’s health secretary Sajid Javid has been across the airwaves this morning. Another couple of key points to emerge over his appearances. Firstly he has not been willing to rule out any further measures to attempt to curb the predicted spread of the Omicron variant, including closing schools. He also suggested that non-clinically trained civil servants could be drafted in to helping with the administration at vaccination centres as the government attempts to roll-out booster jabs at an unprecedented rate. Javid has also defended the planned introduction of vaccine passports, which will be voted on in parliament this week and is due to come into force in England from Wednesday, describing them as a “perfectly reasonable ask”: The Spectator, meanwhile, is suggesting the the current count of Conservative MPs set to vote against further Covid restrictions is up to 71. Here’s a reminder of the latest numbers in the UK: The chief executive of an acute hospital NHS trust in England talks anonymously to us today about the pressures the service is facing: The strain on hospitals is very visible and quite visceral – you can see ambulances queueing outside and people sleeping on chairs because you can’t get them into cubicles to be seen because too many sick people are waiting for beds. But what we can’t necessarily see is what’s happening to all the people who are at home getting sicker. That’s a very large, invisible problem. Many of the people in our hospital are very old and very frail. They don’t necessarily need to be in an acute hospital but they need to be in a bed somewhere, with someone looking after them round the clock. Social care is a massive, massive concern; not being able to get these people who are medically fit to be discharged out and home is what blocks up the “front door”, our A&amp;E. We’re going great guns at treating people on the waiting list. And this winter we’re doing more than ever to protect that, as well as dealing with all the other pressures we have. We are holding beds for people on the waiting list who are having surgery. But that raises really difficult ethical dilemmas. Do you hold an intensive care bed for someone with an aneurysm that could kill them at any minute, or bring in someone who’s just arrived through A&amp;E and needs surgery? Is there a bed for someone who comes in and needs a thrombectomy, a potentially life-saving operation after a stroke? You can imagine how some of our staff feel about unvaccinated people with Covid eating into our supply of ICU beds when you’re making these decisions, about whether someone with stage 4 cancer or an aneurysm can have an operation.

The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, announced on Monday plans to allow interstate and international travellers to enter the state without quarantine from midnight on 5 February, when the state was expected to hit its 90% fully vaccinated target. But the premier warned that once the state’s hard border was eased, unvaccinated or “high-risk” arrivals will still be required to quarantine for 14 days – unless they are under 12 or exempt on medical grounds. “I’m confident that this is the right time and the right way to take this important step,” McGowan said. “West Australians have lived a normal life inside our Covid-free bubble and nearly 2 million people have done the right thing and gotten vaccinated. The announcement comes on the same day Scott Morrison said that visa-holding skilled workers and students will be allowed into Australia from Wednesday. Read more of Narelle Towie’s report here: Western Australia to reopen border on 5 February after almost two years sealed off from the world The boss of the organisation which represents NHS trusts said pressure on health services is “not sustainable”. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News a combination of record highs in 999 calls, the second-highest ever number of emergency department admissions, elective procedure backlogs, the extension of the booster campaign, and social care pressure mean the NHS is “busier than its ever been before.” He said: “That’s obviously a worry because it’s before the traditional winter peak in January and it’s before any cases really coming into hospitals and we are now starting to do in terms of Omicron cases, so we’re already at beyond full stretch, in our view, before either of those things occur so it’s a worrying time, but as you’d expect everybody on the NHS frontline is doing absolutely the best they can to provide the best possible care.” He added yesterday’s request from the prime minister for “extraordinary effort” comes as staff are “very, very tired”. PA Media quote Hopson saying: “I think staff are worried, to be frank, that this level of pressure is going to become normalised and it’s not sustainable.” He also told Sky News a social care staff shortage and the removal of some beds to control coronavirus infections meant hospitals were trying to operate with 30-35% fewer beds. He said 11% of beds were occupied by patients who were fit to leave hospital but could not be discharged due to a lack of social care staff, meanwhile hospitals were operating at between 94% and 96% capacity. He explained how the social care sector could not deliver 1.5m hours of at-home care for patients because workers had left to take jobs in retail, logistics, and hospitality because of better pay and sign-on bonuses, revealing a lack of a “sustainable workforce model” in the NHS and social care. One line of questioning for UK health secretary Sajid Javid this morning has been the effectveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine. PA Media quote him saying it would be “completely unfair” to suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine was not as good as once thought. Javid was asked on Sky News: “Is it because AstraZeneca wasn’t as good as we initially thought and actually the booster, either Pfizer or Moderna, is what’s helping?” He replied: “No, I think that would be completely unfair. AstraZeneca has played a phenomenal role in protecting our country.” He added: “The difference now is... this variant, and different types of vaccines will react in different ways. But whether it’s AstraZeneca you had for your first two doses or its Pfizer or Moderna, you still need a booster shot to be protected against this new variant.” There’s been some advice from Ami Jones, an intensive care doctor from Wales on BBC television this morning in the UK to avoid sitting in unventilated rooms with people you don’t know. Associated Press writer Justin Spike has an interesting piece this morning looking at the difficulty of reporting on Covid in Hungary, and how some people argue that a paucity of official information is playing into low vaccination rates. Although Hungary has secured vaccine doses from China and Russia in addition to those provided by the European Union, nearly a third of its adults still have not received a single shot. That hesitancy is something immunologist Andras Falus said can be partly attributed to official communications about the pandemic being “extremely poor, inconsistent and totally incapable of maintaining trust.” “A significant proportion of the population no longer believes when they receive real data, or resign themselves to not paying attention to the data because they feel almost viscerally that it is inconsistent and unreliable,” said Falus, professor emeritus at Semmelweis University in Budapest. Illes Szurovecz of the Hungarian news website 444.hu says the information released by the conservative government of Viktor Orbán does not provide a clear picture of how the outbreak is developing and that it is opaque and difficult to follow. “There’s a lot we don’t know,” Szurovecz said. “If there was more detailed data, people would be better able to judge how severe the pandemic is and how dangerous the virus is. ... Doctors from different parts of the country would be better able to compare their results and care could be improved.” In lieu of more comprehensive data from official channels, Szurovecz and his colleagues track what few numbers the government releases and create detailed data visualizations on trends in the pandemic. Without that, he said, “it would be virtually impossible to look back in Hungary today and see how the pandemic has gone.” Lacking official information on how hospitals are faring, many journalists have tried to report from inside Covid wards to get a clearer picture. But Hungary’s government has barred journalists from entering medical facilities to report on the pandemic, and prohibited medical staff from giving interviews, something journalists say has made it impossible to report on worsening conditions, creating a false picture of the situation’s severity. Russia says it has detected Omicron in 16 people who returned from South Africa. The Interfax news agency cited deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova giving the figures this morning. We know that Russia reported its first two Omicron cases on 6 December. Reuters say that it was not immediately clear if the 16 cases announced this morning included the two reported earlier this month. The UK government health minister Sajid Javid has defended the government’s work from home if possible advice in England, which comes into effect from today. He said on Sky News: At the end of the day, as ministers you have to take all this into account, and understand the trade-off. Because when you do take action like here – we’ve asked people to work from home from today – you know, this has a big impact on people’s lives. It’s not just a distraction, it can be really difficult for people to be away from the office, not to have that social interaction, it can impact their life chances, so we wouldn’t take this action lightly at all. So, based on the advice that we’re getting, but now also on the observed data, we do have two weeks of data where we are seeing this phenomenal growth in infections. It’s already, we estimate, around 40% of infections in London. And so because of this growth rate, and what we now know on the vaccines, that’s why we’ve announced this national mission on the booster programme. UK health secretary Sajid Javid has said “we’ve got to act early” over the Omicron variant because of the threat of exponential growth, despite a low-level of hospitalisations and no reported deaths in the UK yet involving the new variant. On Sky News, interviewer Kay Burley put several Covid-sceptic points to him, suggesting that reports so far show that people infected with the Omicron variant only suffer from a mild illness. Javid said: Omicron has only taken hold in the UK in the last three weeks. It’s already growing at a rate of doubling two to three times two every two to three days. It’s doubling and at that rate you will have a million infections by the end of the month. If I can explain it this way. With Delta, let’s assume that of all the infections around 2% of those people end up in hospital. Omicron, let’s assume it’s half the severity. That’s just half it. If it’s 1% of a much larger number, you still end up in a lot of hospitalisations. To put those figures into a bit more context, what Javid is saying is that if you have 1m infections with Omicron, and that leads to 1% of people being hospitalised, you would have 10,000 hospital admissions. Then the number of infections would double again within three days, and you would have another 20,000 people requiring hospitalisation. The peak level of daily hospitalisations in the UK at the previous height of the pandemic in January 2021 was around 4,500. Javid went on to say: If the government just sort of stuck its head in the sand and said, ‘Let’s just wait and see what happens. Let’s wait for the deaths to happen’, by then it would be too late. The infection growth rate for the next couple of weeks would have been baked in. The next three or four doubling times would have been baked in, and then you’d have me here rightly saying ‘Why didn’t you act earlier? Have you not learned any of the lessons about this virus? Have you not learned about how to try to protect people from it and take action in advance?’ And you would rightly have been able to ask me this question. The first salvo of UK health secretary Sajid Javid’s interview on Sky News has been a restating of the government’s case to expand the booster programme as set out by the prime minister on TV last night. Javid said: What we now know about Omicron, first of all, is that it is spreading at a phenomenal rate, something that we’ve never seen before. It’s doubling every two to three days in infections. And that means we’re facing a tidal wave. We are once again in a race between the vaccine and the virus. The second thing that we now know for sure is that the vaccines two doses are not enough, but three doses still provide excellent protection against symptomatic infection. And that’s why the booster programme has become more important than ever. He also made a direct appeal to viewers We are throwing everything at it, and can I just please say this to your viewers, please play your part. This could not be more important. We need to win this race against this virus. We’ve never seen this kind of growth before. So please do come forward. Protect yourselves, your loved ones, and your community. Here is a reminder of the latest situation in the UK. Over the last seven days there have been 360,480 new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK. Cases have increased by 11.9% week-on-week. There have been 834 deaths recorded with 28 days of a positive Covid test in the last week. Deaths have increased by 0.5% week-on-week. Hospital admissions have increased by 3.7% week-on-week. At the latest count on the UK government’s own dashboard, there were 7,413 people in hospital in total with coronavirus, of whom 900 are in ventilation beds. Hello, it’s Martin Belam here in London taking over from Samantha Lock in Sydney. The UK media round is being done by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, this morning. He is up on Sky News first, so I’ll have the key lines from that shortly. New work from home guidance takes effect in England today, following recently tightened coronavirus guidance. British prime minister Boris Johnson made the announcement at a Downing Street press conference last week, saying people must work from home where possible from Monday. Although the government instruction that people in England should work from home where possible from Monday is advice and not legally mandatory, organisations across the country are switching to home working where possible. However, some companies have told workers they can continue to come to the office if required for their mental health. Ukraine has just released its daily Covid count. Another 4,073 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were recorded for Sunday, 12 December. The country also reported 188 deaths. If you’ve just joined us, here is a quick run-down of all the latest Covid developments. British prime minister Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccinations, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to stem an incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. Announcing the booster offensive, Johnson said two doses of vaccine were not enough, but scientists were confident that three would make a huge difference. The US is approaching the grim milestone of 50m coronavirus cases with a total of 49,921,405 reported since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The number of deaths stand at 797,346. Although infections appeared to be in decline, daily increases have been reported for the past two weeks, with the number of hospitalised Covid patients also rising and up 20%. States in colder parts of the country are seeing the biggest surge in new infections on a per capita basis, including Vermont, New Hampshire and Michigan. Britain faces a “tidal wave” of the Omicron variant and two vaccine doses will not be enough to contain it, prime minister Boris Johnson warned, as he accelerated the nation’s booster rollout programme. Russia has recorded a cumulative total number of Covid cases that now exceeds 10 million. The European Central Bank’s vice-president Luis de Guindos has tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-isolating, the ECB said. The US is set to reach 800,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine is the “optimal care” but two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or one of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine remains the US government’s official definition of fully vaccinated, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said. Australia will shorten the wait time for people to receive a Covid-19 booster following a rise in Omicron cases. More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies have suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of China’s eastern Zhejiang province. Australians are preparing for quarantine-free travel across most of the country during the Christmas period as the state of Queensland opened its domestic borders to all vaccinated people for the first time in nearly five months. South Korea will test artificial intelligence-powered facial recognition to track Covid-19 cases. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa, 69, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, though is showing only mild symptoms, the presidency said. Indonesia will start administering Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six to 11 on Tuesday, a health ministry official said. New Zealand health authorities are investigating claims that a man received up to 10 Covid-19 vaccination doses in one day on behalf of other people, believed to be skirting tough restrictions on the unvaccinated. More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies said they had suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of China’s eastern Zhejiang province in response to local government’s tightened Covid-19 curbs, Reuters reports. Share prices have also reportedly plunged. Zhejiang reported a total of 173 locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms during the 6-12 December period, official numbers showed on Monday, marking the province’s first domestic cluster outbreak this year. In October, the province reported just one local case. A slew of companies, including Ningbo Homelink Eco-Itech Co Ltd (301193.SZ), Zhejiang Zhongxin Fluoride Materials Co Ltd (002915.SZ), Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical &amp; Electrical Co Ltd (300316.SZ) and Zhejiang Fenglong Electric Co Ltd (002931.SZ), announced the production suspension through exchange filings over the weekend. Their shares fell sharply in early trading on Monday with some falling more than 7%. India has just released its daily Covid report. The country reported 7,350 new cases in the last 24 hours with an active caseload of 91,456; the lowest in 561 days. Another 202 deaths were also reported. Super-spreader events in NSW and reinfections in Victoria have health authorities worried as Covid-19 infections continue to grow. Victoria reported 1,290 new cases and two deaths, while New South Wales recorded 536 new cases, amid increasing numbers of the Omicron variant. Health authorities in NSW are battling to contain several large transmission events, including cases of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant – with 64 cases of the new strain now recorded in the state. Of the 536 new cases announced in the state on Monday, nine were confirmed to have the Omicron variant, with NSW Health saying “more are expected as results of genomic testing are confirmed”. Read the full story here. Germany is reporting an additional 21,743 new daily Covid cases and 116 deaths, according to recently published figures from the Robert Koch Institute. The numbers are a significant drop from previous days, with 39,585 cases reported on 10 December 45,460 cases on 9 December. Covid infections have been steadily decreasing in the European nation since new lockdowns were introduced. South Africa has reported an additional 37,875 new coronavirus cases, which includes 19,840 retrospective cases and 18,035 new cases, according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). In the past 24 hours a total of 18,035 positive Covid-19 cases and 21 Covid-related deaths were reported. The total number of fatalities in the country currently stands at 90,137. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, is currently in self-isolation in Cape Town and has delegated all responsibilities to deputy president David Mabuza for the next week. Experts have warned that the next variant of Covid-19 to sweep the world could emerge on Australia’s doorstep, due to incredibly low rates of vaccination rates in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is Australia’s closest neighbour, and at its nearest point is just 4km from Australian territory in the Torres Strait. At various points in the pandemic there have been fears that travellers from PNG could bring the virus to Australia. Adrian Prouse, head of international humanitarian programs at the Australian Red Cross, said: I’m worried that PNG is the next place where a new variant emerges.” “In PNG less than 5% [of the adult population is vaccinated], in Indonesia, just under one-third. Two countries right on our doorstep with significant challenges in getting vaccines into arms.” Stefanie Vaccher, an epidemiologist with the Burnet Institute who has been based in PNG since last year, echoed this concern. “In populations that have low rates of vaccination coverage, there are more opportunities for the virus to spread and mutate. In PNG, where less than 4% of the population are vaccinated, there are a lot of opportunities for the virus to mutate and spread.” Read the full story here. Canada will start recognising molecular Covid-19 tests conducted at an accredited lab in South Africa for residents returning home, dropping travel restrictions previously introduced to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. Ottawa faced pressure from doctors, stranded passengers and the World Health Organization to reverse requirements that travellers from 10 southern African countries get molecular PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests in a third country before returning to Canada. Canada has now dropped the need to obtain a pre-departure negative Covid-19 PCR test from a third country, according to a travel advisory issued on Saturday. The exemption will be in place until 7 January 2022 and will apply to all indirect flights departing from South Africa to Canada, the advisory added. There is no change to Canada’s ban on all foreign travellers from 10 African countries. Here’s a quick snapshot of the latest Omicron report from the World Health Organization (WHO). Based on current limited evidence Omicron appears to have a growth advantage over Delta. It is spreading faster than Delta in South Africa where Delta circulation was low, but also appears to spread more quickly than Delta in other countries where the incidence of Delta is high. Given the current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs. While preliminary findings from South Africa suggest it may be less severe than Delta and all cases reported in the EU/EEA to date have been mild or asymptomatic, it remains unclear to what extent Omicron may be inherently less virulent. More data are needed. There are limited available data, and no peer-reviewed evidence, on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness to date for Omicron. Preliminary evidence suggests a reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission associated with Omicron.” Here’s an interesting story out of New Zealand today. Health authorities are investigating claims that a man received up to 10 Covid-19 vaccination doses in one day on behalf of other people, believed to be skirting tough restrictions on the unvaccinated. The Ministry of Health said it was taking the matter seriously. “We are very concerned about this situation and are working with the appropriate agencies,” its Covid-19 vaccination and immunisation spokesperson, Astrid Koornneef, said. Local news outlets report the man is believed to have visited several immunisation centres and was paid to get the doses. In New Zealand vaccines can either be booked through a website, via a doctor, or people can turn up to walk-in centres. To be administered a vaccine, a person must provide the health care worker with their name, date of birth and physical address, but no further identification is required. Read the full story from our reporter, Eva Corlett, on the ground in New Zealand. The United States surpassed 50 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally. After about two months of declining infections, the United States has reported daily increases for the past two weeks, driven by the more easily transmitted Delta variant. States in colder parts of the country are seeing the biggest surge in new infections on a per capita basis, including Vermont, New Hampshire and Michigan. The number of hospitalised Covid patients is rising as well, up 20% since the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November. Over the past month, deaths have increased by 4.6%, with the country’s death toll surpassed 800,000. Nearly half of US states have detected cases of the Omicron variant, but the Delta variant still accounts for 99% of current Covid cases, CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said. Speaking of South Korea, the south Asian country has just released their daily Covid numbers. A further 5,817 coronavirus cases were recorded over the past 24 hours, with 40 confirmed deaths. A total of 83.7 % of the eligible population has at least one Covid vaccine and 81.2 % are fully vaccinated, according to ministry of health data. South Korea will soon roll out a pilot project to use artificial intelligence, facial recognition and thousands of CCTV cameras to track the movement of people infected with the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The nationally funded project in Bucheon, one of the country’s most densely populated cities on the outskirts of Seoul, is due to become operational in January, a city official told the news agency. The system uses an AI algorithms and facial recognition technology to analyse footage gathered by more than 10,820 CCTV cameras and track an infected person’s movements, anyone they had close contact with, and whether they were wearing a mask, according to a 110-page business plan from the city submitted to the Ministry of Science and ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and provided to Reuters by a parliamentary lawmaker critical of the project. The Bucheon official said the system should reduce the strain on overworked tracing teams in a city with a population of more than 800,000 people, and help use the teams more efficiently and accurately. The system can reportedly track up to ten people in five to ten minutes, cutting the time spent on manual work that takes around half an hour to one hour to trace one person. South Korea already has a high-tech contact tracing system that harvests credit card records, cellphone location data and CCTV footage, among other personal information. Bucheon mayor Jang Deog-cheon argued that the system would make tracing faster. “It sometimes takes hours to analyse a single CCTV footage. Using visual recognition technology will enable that analysis in an instant,” he said on Twitter. The Ministry of Science and ICT said it has no current plans to expand the project to the national level. It said the purpose of the system was to digitise some of the manual labour that contact tracers currently have to carry out. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, but was showing mild symptoms, the presidency said. “The President started feeling unwell after leaving the State Memorial Service in honour of former Deputy President FW de Klerk in Cape Town earlier today,” the statement said. “The President, who is fully vaccinated, is in self-isolation in Cape Town and has delegated all responsibilities to Deputy President David Mabuza for the next week,” it added. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as we go through all the latest coronavirus developments. The Omicron variant has now spread to 63 countries with faster transmission noted in South Africa and the UK, the World Health Organization has said. Britain faces a “tidal wave” of the Omicron variant of coronavirus and two vaccine doses will not be enough to contain it, prime minister Boris Johnson has warned, as he accelerated the booster rollout programme, bringing forward a target to give over-18s a booster jab by one month to the end of December. “No one should be in any doubt: there is a tidal wave of Omicron coming,” he said in a televised address, after the country’s medical advisers raised the Covid Alert Level due to a “rapid increase” in infection from the variant. “I’m afraid it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need,” Johnson added. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and is receiving treatment for mild symptoms, the presidency said. “The President started feeling unwell after leaving the State Memorial Service in honour of former Deputy President FW de Klerk in Cape Town earlier today,” the statement said. “The President, who is fully vaccinated, is in self-isolation in Cape Town and has delegated all responsibilities to Deputy President David Mabuza for the next week,” it added. Here is a snapshot of the latest Covid developments: The WHO says the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy but causes less severe symptoms according to early data. British prime minister Boris Johnson launched an “Omicron emergency booster national mission” to protect the NHS and patients, ramping up vaccinations and rolling out 1m booster jabs a day. The UK recorded 48,854 new Covid cases and 52 additional deaths, raising the Covid alert level from 3 to 4. The UK also confirmed an additional 1,239 Omicron cases, marking the biggest daily rise to date with the total number of confirmed cases 3,137. America’s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said that Omicron “clearly has a transmission advantage” over previous Covid strains and stepped up calls for Americans to get booster shots as the new variant spread to at least 25 states. Austria has ended lockdown restrictions for vaccinated people across most of the country, three weeks after it was imposed. However, more than 25,000 demonstrators turned out in several cities to protest against the country’s compulsory vaccination plan, forcing citizens to be jabbed or face fines from February. Vaccinated people who are identified as a contact of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 should take an NHS rapid lateral flow test every day for a week, the UK government announced. Russia’s registered Covid cases passed the 10 million mark today, after nearly 30,000 cases were reported in the last 24 hours. Scotland aims to offer booster jabs to all eligible adults by the end of the year."

          "headline": "Capitol attack panel votes to recommend Trump’s ex-chief of staff Mark Meadows for criminal prosecution – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack voted on Monday to recommend criminal prosecution for former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, punishing Donald Trump’s most senior aide for refusing to testify about the 6 January insurrection. The select committee advanced the contempt of Congress report for Meadows unanimously, sending the matter to a vote before the full House of Representatives, which is expected to approve the citation as soon as Tuesday. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, said in an opening statement before the panel recommended Meadows’ referral to the justice department that Trump’s former White House chief of staff displayed willful noncompliance in his defiance of his subpoena. “It comes down to this,” Thompson said. “Mr Meadows started by doing the right thing: cooperating. He handed over records that he didn’t try to shield behind some excuse. But in an investigation like ours, that’s just a first step. “When the records raise questions – as these most certainly do – you have to come in and answer those questions. And when it was time for him to follow the law, come in and testify on those questions, he changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn’t even show up.” The select committee said in the contempt report they were seeking charges against Meadows after he attempted to obstruct the investigation in myriad ways, from refusing to testify to frustrating their efforts to locate and discover documents relevant to the Capitol attack. The select committee also said Meadows should be prosecuted since he refused to testify even about information he voluntarily provided to the panel through his own document production and conceded were not covered by claims of executive privilege advanced by Trump. And over the course of a near-hour-long business meeting, the select committee outlined in chilling detail the materials Meadows had turned over to the panel – and how Meadows then promptly refused to testify about those very records. Meadows turned over about 9,000 documents as part of a cooperation deal, the select committee said, in his effort to engage with the inquiry to a degree in order to avoid an immediate criminal referral that befell other Trump administration aides who defied subpoenas. That’s it from us today. Check the Guardian home page for more on the congressional committee’s decision to recommend contempt charges against Mark Meadows. Here’s what else happened today: Democratic governors are voicing serious concerns about the threat to American democracy, as Republican-led legislatures approve voting restrictions and Donald Trump continues to spread the “big lie” of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Governor Jay Inslee of Washington told CNN over the weekend, “I don’t think you can be overly concerned about this. The American psyche has not recognized we were one vice-president away from a coup.” Joe Biden and Joe Manchin are meeting today to discuss the Build Back Better Act, as Democrats race to pass the legislation before the end of the year. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer needs all 50 of his caucus members to support the bill in order to get the proposal approved via the reconciliation process. At least 64 people are dead in Kentucky after tornadoes swept through the state on Friday. The state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said the final death toll may exceed 80, as search and rescue efforts continue. Biden is visiting the state on Wednesday to survey damage from the storms. The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection voted to recommend contempt charges against Mark Meadows, Trump’s former chief of staff. The meeting started with a readout of text messages Meadows received from Trump officials, Don Trump Jr and Fox News hosts who pleaded with Meadows to ask the president to tell his supporters to go home. The insurrection organizers also sued to stop Verizon from sharing their cell phone records with the select committee investigating the riots. On the Coronavirus front, the supreme court declines to block New York state vaccine mandates. Health and hospital workers will still be required to be vaccinated against Coronavirus despite emergency requests to include religious exemptions in the statewide rules. States across the country are tightening their mask and vaccine mandates in the face of a surge of Coronavirus cases. -- Joan Greve and Johana Bhuiyan The organizers of the Capitol rally-turned-riot have filed a lawsuit against Verizon to block the company from providing their phone records to the congressional committee investigating the riots. The committee’s subpoena to Verizon seeks call, text and location information from the cell phone records of the organizers. In their lawsuit, the organizers argue the order “lacks a lawful purpose and seeks to invade the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to privacy and to confidential political communications”. Law enforcement has increasingly relied on the use of subpoenas and warrants to obtain cell phone and other digital records from companies like Verizon, Google, Twitter and Facebook over the last few years. The committee investigating the 6 January insurrection is meeting now to discuss whether Donald Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows should be referred to the Department of Justice on criminal contempt of congress. Congresswoman Liz Cheney started the meeting reading out texts Meadows received from Trump officials, Fox News hosts as well as Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Coronavirus cases are rising again in states across the country, prompting local officials to reinstate mask and other mandates. California will require masks indoors across the state starting on Wednesday and until at least 15 January, after statewide case rates increased 47% since Thanksgiving. Unvaccinated people attending “mega events” also have to show proof of a negative test from within the day. Last week, New York reinstated a statewide indoor mask mandate in all indoor public places that don’t require proof of vaccination, that will also be in effect until at least 15 January. The city of Philadelphia will also now require proof of vaccination to eat or drink indoors starting on 3 January in the face of rapidly rising Coronavirus cases. A rioter who participated in the Capitol insurrection on 6 January said he now realizes he and other supporters of Donald Trump were lied to by the sitting president in a new letter to the judge. In the letter, which can be read in full here, Robert Scott Palmer said Trump and those acting on his behalf “kept spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was ‘our duty’ to stand up to tyranny. Little did I realize that they were the tyrannical ones”. The supreme court upheld the New York state vaccine mandates for hospital and health workers after turning away two emergency requests. One request was filed by a group called We the Patriots USA, which argued the rule currently allows for medical exemptions but not religious exemptions. Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas dissented. Gorsuch said the religious beliefs of the objectors should be respected. Some of the nurses said they objected to the vaccine because of the “distant relation to fetal cell lines developed from abortions in the 1970s and 1980s”, according to CNN. Despite a note approved by Pope Francis and written by the Vatican’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith last year that said receiving the shot was morally permitted, the nurses said they “object to deriving any benefit - no matter how remote - from a process involving abortion”. After five years of legal battles, the survivors of former gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar have reached a $380m settlement with USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee and their insurers. Here’s more from the Guardian report: “This settlement is the result of the bravery of hundreds of survivors who, despite legal obstacles, long odds and the best corporate legal talent money can buy, refused to be silent. The power of their story eventually won the day,” John Manly, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said on Monday. The settlement will cover claims brought by hundreds of women. They include Olympic gold medalists Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney, all of whom are among the most high-profile survivors of Nassar’s sexual abuse. All three women testified about the abuse they suffered during a Senate hearing this year. At the hearing, they attacked USA Gymnastics and Olympic officials for failing to stop Nassar and they took the FBI to task over its botched investigation into Nassar’s actions. Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of abuse, said she was relieved to have reached a conclusion to the battle for compensation. “This chapter is finally closed. Now the hard work of reform and rebuilding can begin. Whether or not justice comes, and change is made, depends on what happens next,” Denhollander tweeted on Monday. Read more Joe Biden signed an executive order today intending to make it easier for Americans to access government benefits including social security, student loan relief and disaster aid. The order would cut down the “time tax” or the friction and time filling out forms and waiting in lines adds to the process to access benefits. The order targets 36 federal services across agencies and departments but will likely have the biggest effect on Americans over the age of 65. “In addition to a new online tool designed to make claiming social security benefits easier, the government will also develop a portal for Medicare recipients to identify ways to save money on drugs and health care,” a Bloomberg report read. Biden told reporters the order will “ensure that the federal government puts you, the American people, at the front of the line and are first in anything we do”. Former US Senate candidate from Maine Max Linn has died at age 62. Linn, who ran for Senate in 2020 as an independent, was found dead in his hot tub from an apparent heart attack, Linn’s lawyer told the Bangor Daily News. Linn, billed as one of the more “colorful” characters in Maine politics by the Sun Journal, became notorious for his stunts on televised debates during his campaign including cutting up a mask and responding “request denied” when asked a question. A retired financial planner, Linn also ran for congress when he lived in Florida in 2018. He was also recently accused of pulling a gun on a former assistant in an argument over a cryptocurrency investment. The assistant, Matt McDonald sought and was granted an order of protection against Linn. From the Associated Press: “McDonald alleged in court documents that Linn gave him money to invest in cryptocurrency earlier this year but that Linn reversed course upon return from an overseas trip and sought to buy drugs falsely touted as COVID-19 cures. Linn pointed a gun in McDonald’s direction when the two met to try to resolve the dispute, McDonald said in the court filing.” A new Guardian report from environment reporter Oliver Milman reveals the Biden administration was not legally obligated to auction drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico when it offered up more than 80m acres of the gulf’s seabed for fossil fuel extraction last month. More from Oliver: The enormous sale, which took place just four days after crucial UN climate talks in Scotland, represented a spectacular about-turn from Joe Biden’s previous promise to halt offshore drilling and was denounced by outraged environmental groups as a “huge carbon bomb”. The president’s administration insisted it was obliged to hold the lease sale due to a court ruling in favor of a dozen states that sued to lift a blanket pause placed on new drilling permits by Biden. But a memo filed by the US Department of Justice before the lease sale acknowledges that this judgement does not force the government to auction off drilling rights to the gulf. “While the order enjoins and restrains (the department of) interior from implementing the pause, it does not compel interior to take the actions specified by plaintiffs, let alone on the urgent timeline specified in plaintiffs’ contempt motion,” wrote government lawyers to the federal court in Louisiana in August. The issuance of new drilling permits would require further steps under federal laws, the memo states, adding that “the court’s order does not compel the agency to act in contravention of these other authorities”. The memo’s language was first referenced by The Daily Poster. Just a month after arguing that it was not required to hold the sale, however, the department of interior’s bureau of ocean energy management (BOEM) announced it would auction off an area of the gulf that is two times the size of Florida to oil and gas companies. The expanse of the gulf put up for auction contains around 1.12bn barrels of oil and 4.2tn cubic ft of gas, with the leases locking in years – and potentially decades – of planet-heating emissions. It comes at a time when the International Energy Agency has said no new fossil fuel projects can be established after this year if the world is to avoid catastrophic heatwaves, flooding and other disastrous impacts from runaway climate change. “The administration has been misleading on this, to put it mildly. It’s very disappointing,” said Thomas Meyer, national organizing manager of Food and Water Watch. “They didn’t have to hold this sale and they didn’t have to hold it on this timeline.

In Minneapolis, the AP is reporting Derek Chauvin – the police officer who was convicted of murdering George Floyd – is expected to change his plea from not guilty to guilty. The AP is basing its report on a new federal docket entry. More from the AP: “The federal docket entry shows a hearing has been scheduled for Wednesday for Chauvin to change his current not guilty plea in the case. These types of notices indicate a defendant is planning to plead guilty. The court system also sent out instructions for media to attend the hearing.” It’s unclear if the other three former officers involved will plead guilty as well. Chauvin has already been sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison after being convicted of state murder and manslaughter. However, in this case he would be pleading guilty to violating Floyd’s civil rights. “All four officers were charged broadly in federal court with depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority, but the federal indictment broke down the counts even further,” the AP reported. “A count against Chauvin alleged he violated Floyd’s right to be free from unreasonable seizure and from unreasonable force by a police officer.” That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Johana Bhuiyan, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: Democratic governors are voicing serious concerns about the threat to American democracy, as Republican-led legislatures approve voting restrictions and Donald Trump continues to spread the “big lie” of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Governor Jay Inslee of Washington told CNN over the weekend, “I don’t think you can be overly concerned about this.

The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection will meet this evening to discuss recommending contempt charges against Mark Meadows, Trump’s former chief of staff. The meeting comes a week after Meadows ended his cooperation with the committee, citing the former president’s claims of executive privilege over certain records. Johana will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Joe Biden spoke with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö today, as the US and its allies continue to express concern about the Russian troop build-up along the country’s border with Ukraine. “They discussed their shared concerns about Russia’s destabilizing military buildup along Ukraine’s border and the importance of transatlantic efforts to de-escalate the situation,” the White House said in its readout of the call. The White House added, “President Biden welcomed Finland’s selection of the F-35 for its next fighter jet, noting this procurement would provide a strong foundation for even closer bilateral defense ties for years to come.” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell reflected on the losses sustained in Kentucky after tornadoes swept through his home state on Friday. “Kentucky has been devastated, but we have not been defeated,” the Republican leader said in a floor speech moments ago. McConnell added, “Kentuckians are resilient people. We will stay strong and united through the crisis.” Earlier today, McConnell thanked Joe Biden for quickly approving Kentucky’s major disaster declaration, giving the state access to federal funds to help residents find temporary housing and start home repairs. Joe Manchin is expected to participate in a meeting tomorrow to discuss how Senate Democrats may be able to alter the filibuster to advance national voting rights legislation. Punchbowl News reports: Manchin will also meet Tuesday with a group of moderate Democrats on voting rights. Voting-rights advocates want to see if Manchin would be open to a ‘carve-out’ to the Senate’s filibuster rule for voting rights legislation. The idea gained more urgency for voting rights advocates after the chamber approved a ‘one-time exception’ to its rules to approve a debt-limit increase by a simple majority vote. As Democratic governors sound the alarm over the threat to American democracy, civil rights leaders are once again urging the Senate to pass national voting rights legislation. NAACP President Derrick Johnson argued the Senate needs to approve the Build Back Better Act as quickly as possible to shift lawmakers’ attention to voting rights. “Pass Build Back Better so we can move on to other legislative priorities, most urgently voting rights,” Johnson said in a statement. “Our democracy isn’t waiting around on a couple senators, and neither are the states slashing our constitutional rights.” However, it’s still unclear whether centrist Democrat Joe Manchin will support the Build Back Better Act, and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer needs all 50 of his caucus members to back the bill in order to get it passed. And Schumer will also need Manchin’s support to alter the filibuster and allow voting rights legislation to advance. As of now, Republicans have the votes to block any voting rights bills from moving forward, and they have repeatedly done so. Democratic governors are seriously concerned about the future of American democracy, but they fear they cannot get voters to care enough about the issue to prevent widespread Republican gains in next year’s midterm elections. As of now, with the midterms a little less than a year away, Republicans are heavily favored to flip control of the US House. Joe Biden’s sinking approval rating could also give Republicans a significant advantage in state legislative and gubernatorial races. Republican victories could help the party implement more voting restrictions, as Donald Trump continues to spread the “Big Lie” of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Already this year, at least 19 states have enacted 33 laws that restrict access to the ballot box, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. A dozen governors gathered for the Democratic Governors Association’s annual conference over the weekend, and they voiced concern that Americans will not wake up to the threat to their democracy until it is too late. “We have to be Paul Revere every chance we get to let people know what is at risk and why it is at risk. We live it. Every time we eat breakfast we think about these things,” Governor Jay Inslee of Washington told CNN. “I don’t think you can be overly concerned about this. The American psyche has not recognized we were one vice-president away from a coup.” Read CNN’s full report on the Democratic governors’ conference here. The tornadoes that whirled through eight states on Friday night hit Kentucky hardest but also ripped up an Amazon.com warehouse in Illinois, killing six people. Now the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is launching an investigation into the company in relation to the building’s fatal collapse, an official at the Department of Labor said a little earlier. Reuters further reports: OSHA has six months to complete its investigation, issue citations and propose monetary penalties if violations of workplace safety and or health regulations are found, Scott Allen, a US Department of Labor regional director for public affairs, said via email. He added that compliance officers have been on site since Saturday. Six workers were killed when the Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, buckled under the force of the devastating storm, police said. A barrage of tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km). An Amazon spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The National Weather Service said a tornado hit the area between 8:28 p.m. and 8:32 p.m. local time on Friday, intensifying rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse. With estimated peak winds of 150 miles per hour (241 kph), the force was so severe that the roof was ripped off and 11-inch (28-cm) thick concrete walls longer than football fields fell in on themselves. At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. The company has three facilities in Edwardsville: the delivery station hit by the storm as well as a fulfillment center and a sorting station. The delivery station opened in July 2020 to prepare orders for last-mile delivery to customers. Joe Biden will visit Kentucky on Wednesday to see for himself the devastation wrought by unseasonal, powerful tornadoes and said a little earlier that he was concerned about the state of mind of victims there. The US president noted at the weekend that he wasn’t rushing immediately to the disaster-hit area because he didn’t want to be in the way as every resource there was needed to help survivors, search for the dead and missing and work to get people shelter, warmth and water - vital resources missing for many, amid temperatures below freezing. Today he said he’s concerned about the mental health of the hundreds of thousands of people affected. “That’s what worries me most, the uncertainty. You can see it in people’s faces,” he said. The official death toll is currently 64 in Kentucky alone, but is projected to rise. Recovery efforts are being hampered by the sheer scale of the wreckage. Several people have been killed in other states. Read all our coverage here. The White House press briefing has now concluded. Here’s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden and Joe Manchin are meeting today to discuss the Build Back Better Act, as Democrats race to pass the legislation before the end of the year. Senate Democrats need all 50 of their caucus members to support the bill in order to get the proposal approved via the reconciliation process. At least 64 people are dead in Kentucky after tornadoes swept through the state on Friday. The state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said the final death toll may exceed 80, as search and rescue efforts continue. Biden is visiting the state on Wednesday to survey damage from the storms. The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection will meet this evening to discuss recommending contempt charges against Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump. The meeting comes a week after Meadows ended his cooperation with the committee, citing the former president’s claims of executive privilege over certain records. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. One reporter asked Jen Psaki to respond to multiple reports raising speculation about the potential Democratic presidential field in 2024 if Joe Biden does not run for reelection. “The president has every intention of running for reelection,” the White House press secretary said in response. Biden’s sinking approval ratings have intensified questions over whether he will seek a second term, although the president and his team insist he intends to do so. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, is now holding her daily press briefing, and she provided a couple more details on Joe Biden’s meeting today with centrist Senator Joe Manchin. Psaki said the president looked forward to “communicating directly” with Manchin about the Build Back Better Act, adding that the senator has been acting “in good faith” throughout the negotiations. The press secretary said the meeting represented a “continuation of that conversation,” but she would not outline what sticking points remain for Manchin before he will support the bill. Joe Biden will travel to Kentucky on Wednesday to survey the damage from the deadly tornadoes that swept through the state on Friday. “On Wednesday, December 15, the President will travel to Ft. Campbell, Kentucky for a storm briefing, and to Mayfield and Dawson Springs, Kentucky to survey storm damage following the devastating tornadoes and extreme weather,” the White House said in a new advisory. The president confirmed his travel plans after meeting with several senior advisers to discuss the federal government’s response to the storms, which killed at least 64 people in Kentucky. “We’re going to get this done. We’re going to be there as long as it takes to help,” Biden said in the Oval Office moments ago. The president also promised to provide states with “whatever they need when they need it” to help residents affected by the storms. Biden has already approved a major disaster declaration in Kentucky, making federal funds available to help residents find temporary housing and start home repairs. If the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection recommends contempt charges against Mark Meadows, the full chamber will need to vote on the matter. Assuming the House also approves the contempt resolution, which seems highly likely, the justice department will need to determine whether to prosecute Meadows. The justice department is already prosecuting Steve Bannon for refusing to cooperate with the select committee. A federal grand jury indicted the former Trump adviser last month on two counts of contempt of Congress. The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection will convene this evening to consider whether Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, should be held in criminal contempt. The meeting comes after Meadows ended his cooperation with the committee, claiming investigators were not respecting the former president’s claims of executive privilege over certain records. However, the Democratic chair of the committee, Bennie Thompson, said in a letter to Meadows’ attorney last week that his client is also refusing to discuss his own personal records, which are not subject to executive privilege claims. “There is no legitimate legal basis for Mr. Meadows to refuse to cooperate with the Select Committee and answer questions about the documents he produced, the personal devices and accounts he used, the events he wrote about in his newly released book, and, among other things, his other public statements,” Thompson said in his letter. “The Select Committee is left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution.” Centrist Senator Joe Manchin confirmed he will be meeting with Joe Biden today to discuss the Build Back Better Act, per NBC News. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Manchin said he is concerned about some of the bill’s programs expiring after a year or a few years while the costs of the legislation extend over 10 years. However, if Democrats attempt to alter the bill to better reflect Manchin’s concerns, that time-consuming process will likely stretch well into 2022. And Democratic leaders are still hoping they can pass the bill before the end of the year, in order to allow checks from the expanded child tax credit program to be mailed out next month. The Guardian’s Edward Helmore, Nikhita Chulani, Harvey Symons and Arnel Hecimovic report: Powerful tornadoes barrelled through five US states on Friday, levelling houses and factories and bringing down power lines. In Kentucky, the worst-hit state, one tornado alone followed an extraordinarily long and destructive path of more than 200 miles. Authorities are still tallying the devastation, and the death toll has not been confirmed, but Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, estimated on Monday that at least 64 people had died there with dozens more unaccounted for. At least six people have been killed in Illinois, four in Tennessee, two in Arkansas and two in Missouri. One of the hardest hit towns was Mayfield in west Kentucky, where a candle factory was levelled, killing at least eight people. Police and fire stations in Mayfield were destroyed, homes were flattened or lost roofs, giant trees were uprooted and street signs mangled. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky thanked Joe Biden for quickly approving his governor’s request to declare a major disaster in the state following the deadly tornadoes on Friday. “Thank you @POTUS for your rapid approval of Kentucky’s Major Disaster Declaration,” the Republican leader said on Twitter. “Our entire congressional delegation came together to support @GovAndyBeshear’s request. I appreciate the Administration’s quick work to speed resources to help deal with this crisis.” Biden approved the request last night, allowing Kentucky to access federal resources to help provide residents affected by the tornadoes with temporary housing and money for home repairs, among other services. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said officials now expect the state’s final death toll from the tornadoes to exceed 70 and potentially 80. “With this amount of damage and rubble, it may be a week or even more before we have a final count on the number of lost lives,” Beshear said. Officials believe there are currently at least 105 state residents who are unaccounted for, and search teams are working to find them. The Democratic governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, acknowledged he is struggling to reckon with the staggering losses from the tornadoes that swept through his state on Friday. “I know, like the folks in western Kentucky, I’m not doing so well today, and I’m not sure how many of us are,” Beshear said. The governor said he was taking notes on the confirmed deaths this morning, and he realized that he was writing on the back of one of his children’s school assignments. The assignment was about inertia, the scientific principle that objects in motion will stay in motion. “So we’re going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and push through this,” Beshear said. “To the people of western Kentucky, we’re not going anywhere. We’re going to be with you today. We’re going to be with you tomorrow. And we’re going to be there with you to rebuild.” At least 64 people are now confirmed to have been killed in the tornadoes that swept through Kentucky on Friday, governor Andy Beshear said. Speaking at a press conference this morning, the Democratic governor noted that 18 of the known victims are still unidentified. “Of the ones that we know, the age – the age range is five months to 86 years, and six are younger than 18,” Beshear said, his voice breaking with emotion as he updated the death toll. The governor had previously said that officials feared the death toll would exceed 100, but those estimations have decreased as more potential victims have been found alive. Joe Biden will soon receive a briefing from senior advisers on the federal government’s response to the deadly tornadoes that swept through Kentucky on Friday. The president will be briefed by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Fema administrator Deanne Criswell and Homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall in about 45 minutes. Biden has already declared a federal emergency in Kentucky, as rescue efforts continue across the state. The Democratic governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, had initially said officials feared the death toll would exceed 100, but that number is now expected to be closer to 50. “We are praying that maybe original estimates of those we have lost were wrong. If so, it’s going to be pretty wonderful,” the governor said yesterday. Read more of the Guardian’s coverage on the tornadoes: The US government’s leading infectious diseases official, Anthony Fauci, has stepped up calls for Americans to get a Covid-19 booster shot, as the US is approaching 800,000 lives lost to coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Fauci warned that the Omicron variant appeared to be able to “evade” the protection of two initial doses of the mRNA-type Covid vaccines – Pfizer/BioNTech’s and Moderna’s – as well as post-infection therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma. Omicron is spurring new fears as US infections begin to surge again, with infections currently still led by the highly-transmissable Delta variant that has dominated since the summer. Fauci said an extra vaccine shot provides “optimal” protection against Omicron, even though the government’s official designation of “fully vaccinated” remained at two doses of Pfizer or Moderna, or one of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine, which was developed by another method. Although Joe Manchin currently seems to be Democrats’ largest obstacle in passing the Build Back Better Act, he is far from the only hurdle in the way. Democrats are trying to pass the legislation using a process known as reconciliation, meaning they only need 51 votes to get it approved rather than the 60 votes that are usually necessary when Republicans filibuster a bill. The Washington Post reports: As they prepare to release more legislative text this week, Democrats also must work out the finer points of their proposal with the Senate parliamentarian. The reconciliation process carries strict rules in the Senate, requiring lawmakers to ensure every element of their plan has direct effects on the federal budget. If it does not, Republicans then can try to strike entire sections from the bill once it reaches the Senate floor. For now, the two parties are set to battle it out in another round of private meetings in front of the Senate’s chief rule-keeper. The process already has imperiled some of Democrats’ initial policy ambitions, including their hopes to proffer reforms to the country’s immigration laws as part of the social spending bill. One potential concern for Joe Manchin when it comes to the Build Back Better Act may be how the legislation will impact inflation in the US. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that US prices rose by 6.8% over the past 12 months, marking the largest year-over-year increase since 1982. Over the summer, Manchin called for a “strategic pause” in the negotiations over the $1.75tn spending package until lawmakers had a clearer picture of how inflation was faring. However, since Manchin published that September op-ed, a number of economists and market analysts have said they do not believe the bill will significantly worsen inflation, which may have somewhat alleviated the West Virginia senator’s concerns. For more information on the latest inflation news, read the Guardian’s report from Friday: Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. Centrist Senator Joe Manchin will reportedly meet with Joe Biden in the next couple of days, as Democrats race to pass the president’s Build Back Better Act before the end of the year. Punchbowl News reports: Biden and Manchin will speak about the BBB as early as today, a discussion that will go a long way toward deciding whether the $1.7 trillion package -- the president’s top legislative priority -- can be finished before Christmas or will slide into 2022. ... With so much at stake, the lobbying of Manchin from both sides is getting frantic. [Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer] met with Manchin last Thursday on BBB, and other Democrats have been seeking private one-on-ones with him as well. In the past, Manchin and Schumer had a close relationship, although it has clearly frayed during the last year under the enormous strain of the 50-50 Senate. If Democrats cannot pass their bill before the end of the year, it will jeopardize the extension of the expanded child tax credits, which have become a life-saving benefit for many American families over the past year. If the bill does not pass, the party will likely have a much harder time convincing voters to reelect them next year, and Biden could face the same dilemma in 2024. So the stakes could not be higher, and once again, all eyes are on Manchin to see whether he will allow Democrats to move forward. Stay tuned."

          "bodyText": "A decade of reforms to save the Murray-Darling basin could be undermined by New South Wales’ plans to license too much flood water harvesting, with insiders warning that NSW’s processes will result in irrigators being licensed to take billions of litres of flows without proper environmental assessment. Two members of the four-person Healthy Floodplains Review committee, which hears appeals from irrigators about their proposed flood plain water entitlements, say the system is “sloppy”, “flawed” and should be reviewed immediately. They say over the last 12 months the committee has been swamped with more than 400 appeals, involving 1,300 separate flood plain harvesting structures; the committee is overwhelmed and applications are often accompanied by poor evidence. Irrigators, they say, are now “consultant shopping” to achieve outcomes many times larger than the initial assessment by the Natural Resources Access Regulator, which conducted an on-the-ground survey of dams and other structures used in flood plain harvesting. The two members – a NSW Farmers Association member, Xavier Martin, and the Nature Conservation Council’s representative, Bev Smiles – have written to the head of the NSW department responsible to detail their grave concerns. The other members of the committee are both irrigators: one is appointed by NSW Irrigators and the other independent chair is a cotton farmer. The department disputes the members’ concerns, saying it has had two probity reviews of the committee and both have found the appeals process robust. A sense of perspective The NSW Irrigators’ Council said it was important to keep flood plain harvesting in perspective and that the current average annual take is 350-390 gigalitres – about 3% of northern basin inflows. “This will be the largest removal of water from irrigators to the environment since the Basin Plan, and will be a difficult adjustment for farmers losing water access, but everyone agrees flood plain harvesting needs to be reduced, licensed and metered,” said the chief executive, Claire Miller. The question is how to do it. The committee members’ letters were obtained by Guardian Australia after a call for papers by the Greens in the NSW upper house. The result, they warn, is that NSW could be licensing an unsustainable amount of water that will have long-term implications for the future health of the river system and wetlands in western NSW. Southern basin farmers are also concerned that they will be left short on their allocations of water from the river because of the reduced flows reaching the river. The growth in flood plain harvesting – the practice of capturing small floods as they move across plains toward the river, using giant storages, levees and channels – has been blamed for the 20% shortfall of water in the Murray-Darling river system compared with what was expected. Over the last three decades the practice of taking this water – which can be taken for free (unlike river water which requires a licence) – has increased. Large cotton farms have laser-levelled plains and built huge shallow storages which are fed by elaborate systems to direct water into them. Now the NSW government wants to license flood plain harvesting as required under the Murray-Darling basin plan, a move which both environmentalists and farmers agree is necessary. A tricky equation But working out how much should be licensed to ensure a sustainable river has been hampered by poor data, many unlicensed structures and uncertainty about the impact of climate change. As the first step in the licensing, the NSW Natural Resources Access Regulator sent staff to western NSW to inspect structures, with the idea being that “historical take” via structures approved by 1994 would be permitted. Other structures will need to be removed. In recognition that farmers were already capturing water in this way, the NSW government said licences would be free, but it will effectively cap the practice in the future. The licences are probably worth millions; conversely, if the NSW government has to buy back licences due to overallocation, it will potentially cost millions. An indicator of the value, Smiles said, could be seen in sales of major agribusinesses in the last six months, which have included price tags of $3m to $4m for draft flood plain harvesting entitlements. Initially, the plan was to get the licences in place by June 2021 and the NSW Natural Resources Access Regulator worked toward this deadline. But this proved too ambitious. Instead there have been a flood of appeals to the HFR committee and a parliamentary inquiry which will report this week. Flawed information Martin, who joined the committee in May as the NSW Farmers representative, wrote a scathing letter soon after joining. He says the committee is relying on flawed information from the department and from applicants, yet is under pressure to approve applications. “It is inappropriate to approve applications where significant evidence exists as to the inaccuracy of the information supplied,” he wrote. For example, Martin said the remote-sensing imagery used by the committee could not adequately differentiate between irrigated and dryland fields and was in some cases causing errors of greater than 100%, leading to bigger water allocations. He said the committee was also “dealing with returning ‘errors’ on a regular basis, which are clearly linked to lost or inadequate departmental records”. “This has resulted in ‘consultant shopping’ and multiple submissions returning five or 10 times or more,” he said. This in turn has led to “stretch shopping” with applicants disputing the relevant rainfall measurement sites, the area from which water is harvested, the size of reservoirs and assessments of the size of the pumps installed. He said some registrations of interest were unsigned and statutory declarations as to the truth of the information provided often simply referred to the consultant’s opinion. He also said he had concerns with some unapproved structures being licensed even though there had been no environmental assessment of any kind. “Despite the oft-repeated desire that the Review Committee act with “consistency” and “get it right” these goals were often in conflict and not resolved by evidence, ….including ambiguous declarations, poor photos, inconclusive site verification,” Martin said. Smiles has expressed grave concerns about the departmental models which are used to calculate the volumes. She described them as “a black box” and warned that they could result in allocations above a safe level. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW government defended its licensing processes and said the licensing reforms were vital and long overdue. Implementing the policy now would reduce the practice by more than 25%, or about 100 gigalitres in the northern basin, a spokesperson said. “The committee has to date provided advice on all cases brought before it, with advice on more than 95% of cases decided on consensus. In more than 90% of cases, the committee’s recommendations align with recommendations made by the [Department of Planning, Industry and Environment],” she said. “Fewer than 1,000 were contested by landholders. That means more than 85% of assessments were uncontested – an impressive outcome given the complexity and scale of this work over such a long time period,” she said."

          "headline": "UK Covid: Sajid Javid says Omicron makes up 20% of cases in England – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Late update: The UK Health Security Agency has been in touch to offer final confirmation as to what Sajid Javid meant when he told MPs earlier that “the current number of daily infections are around 200,000”. He did mean that it is estimated that 200,000 people are getting infected with the Omicron variant every day. That is what we thought originally, but we took down the headline on the post (see 4.19pm) after it was suggested he meant something else, and it has taken a while to get clarity from officials. A UKHSA spokesperson said Javid was “referring to the number of new infections today [13 December] based on modelling, not the number who are currently infected”. I have amended the wording in the summary as a result. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has told MPs that around 200,000 people are getting infected with the Omicron variant per day and that it now accounts for 20% of Covid cases in England. (See 4.19pm and 6.19pm.) At least one person in the UK had died with the Omicron variant, Boris Johnson has said as he refused to rule out imposing further restrictions across England in the run-up to Christmas. Johnson has said that he personally broke no Covid rules in Downing Street last year - implying the inquiry by Simon Case may concluded that some of his staff did. (See 2.15pm.) Headteachers are warning of “chaos” in England’s schools as Omicron sweeps across the country, with high levels of staff and pupil absences and reports that parents are planning to keep children home to avoid the virus before Christmas. Lateral flow home test kits have become unavailable online and NHS England has advised people attempting to book a Covid booster jab to try later or on Tuesday as extremely high demand overwhelmed the government’s website. Bookmakers have made the Liberal Democrats the favourites to win this week’s North Shropshire byelection, odds that if reflected in Thursday’s vote would deliver a significant fresh blow to Boris Johnson’s authority. That is all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global Covid blog. It’s here. All eligible adults in Wales are to be offered an appointment for a booster jab by the end of this month. But this does not mean that everyone who wants one will actually get the jab by 31 December becausee some will take place in January. The Welsh administration has not gone as far as the UK, which has said that the aim is for all adults to get a booster before the end of the year, not just to be able to book one. Welsh ministers believe their ambition is more realistic than the UK’s. In a televised message to Wales on Monday evening, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, will hint that more restrictions may not be far away, saying: We have already taken some steps to increase protections in Wales and we may need to take some further steps to keep Wales safe. Drakeford is to say: We must be prepared for omicron cases to rise quickly and very steeply – just as they have in other parts of the UK. We are still learning about this new form of coronavirus. All the information we have tells us we are facing a very serious situation. By the end of the month, omicron will have become the dominant form of the virus in Wales, bringing a new wave of infections and illness. This could then translate into a large number of people needing hospital treatment just at a time when the NHS is already under significant pressure. The Welsh government will do everything we can to protect people’s health and keep Wales safe. We have already increased the speed of the roll-out of our booster programme. New clinics have been opened and operating hours extended. Urgent efforts are now underway to accelerate the programme even further so we can offer all eligible adults an appointment by the end of this year if possible. Drakeford is urging people to come forward for a booster. “Please make getting a booster a priority.” A health source has clarified what Sajid Javid meant in the Commons when he implied Omicron infections were running at 200,000 per day. (See 4.19pm and 5.2opm.) Javid was indeed referring to Omicron infections, not Covid infections. But he was speaking about a UK Health Security Agency estimate for the total number of people currently infected with Omicron, not the number who are catching the infection for the first time every day (ie daily new cases). UPDATE: Later the UK Health Security Agency said the figure was actually for the number of people being infected with Omicron for the first time on a given day (today). See 7.46pm. The Scottish parliament has again cancelled an evidence session with Nicola Sturgeon this week after the authorities reduced in-person hearings because of the fresh Covid crisis. The decision means the first minister has avoided around four potential witness sessions on her policies due to restrictions imposed during the pandemic. The first minister was due to be quizzed by all Holyrood’s committee convenors on Wednesday, in a session which has previously lasted several hours. These sessions are supposed to take place every six months: the last was in November 2019. In a statement, Holyrood said: Due to the decision by the Scottish parliament corporate body to move committee meetings to a virtual format, the conveners group has decided to postpone Wednesday’s session with the first minister. Instead, the conveners group has determined that they would prefer to question the first minister in person and will look to reschedule the meeting at a time when it can go ahead safely. During his statement in the Commons Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said he wanted strict travel rules for people arriving in the UK eased given the spread of Omicron already in this country. Labour’s Ben Bradshaw called for the “very draconian, costly and complex” travel rules introduced only recently to try and stop Omicron arriving in the UK to be dropped. Javid replied: I think [Bradshaw] makes a very good point, given that we already know that the Omicron variant is fast becoming the dominant variant in our capital city, spreading rapidly throughout the country, the justification for having those rules is minimised. It’s something that I’ve already raised with my colleagues in the Department for Transport and I do hope that we can act quickly. Getting booster jabs to all Scots aged 18 and above by the end of this year will be a “monumental challenge”, Nicola Sturgeon has conceded. PA Media says: With the vaccination programme being accelerated in a bid to combat the new Omicron variant of the virus, the first minister said she did not underestimate the scale of the challenge. But as she stressed vaccination was the “best line of defence” against Omicron, Sturgeon said: “We’ve got to bust a gut to get this programme done as quickly as possible.” To meet the ambition of offering all eligible adults a booster dose of vaccine by the end of December means that more than 70,000 Scots a day will need to get jagged, it has been estimated. Sturgeon, who has previously warned Omicron could lead to a “tsunami” of new infections, told BBC Scotland that government officials were currently working with local health boards to speed up the programme. The first minister said they were considering “all of the possible options to build capacity in a system that is already operating at a very fast pace”. This will be done by a combination of bringing in additional staff to give the injections, increasing the number of appointments at vaccine centres and looking at opening up new centres. NHS leaders in England have told MPs that they would be “irresponsible” not to approve the government’s Plan B when parliament votes on its provisions tomorrow. Matthew Taylor, chef executive of the NHS Confederation, said: Given the rapidly rising infection levels from Omicron and how much pressure the NHS is under already, we are urging MPs to vote in favour of the government’s plan b interventions. We may find that these measures are not enough but with independent modelling suggesting that Omicron could cause up to 75,000 deaths in England and over 490,000 hospitalisations by the end of April, it would be irresponsible not to give them a go. Failing to put in place measures to slow the spread of coronavirus could lead to much tougher restrictions being introduced next year, Taylor added. The NHS Confederation represents NHS care provider organisations in England and Wales. Taylor went on: If Omicron is allowed to spread out of control then the worry is that far stricter interventions will be needed in the new year and no one wants tougher measures when it is clear they can have a devastating impact on people’s health and wellbeing. The NHS is working at lightning speed to ramp up the booster programme and our members expect parliament to use its position of influence to send a strong statement in the national interest. In his opening statement Sajid Javid seemed to be talking about there being 200,000 Omicron infections per day, but he may have been talking about 200,000 Covid infections per day. The Department of Health and Social Care have been asked to clarify this, and an official is due to call me back. In the meantime I have taken down the headline on the post at 4.19pm. Recorded Covid cases are running at around 50,000 per day - today’s figure is 54,661 - but many people who are ill do not do a test, and many people get infected asymptomatically. The ONS Covid surveillance report published last week estimated that more than one million people in the UK had the virus, but that was covering the week ending 1 December. Mark Harper, chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, asked for an assurance that the government would recall parliament over Christmas if it wants to tighten regulations. He has been asking this question repeatedly in recent days without getting an assurance MPs would get a vote. And Javid did not give him one today. He just said there were no plans for further restrictions over the recess. The i’s Paul Waugh says that, judging by Sajid Javid’s comments in this statement, now seems keen to argue that the plan for Covid passes, or passports, isn’t really about these documents at all. Iain Duncan Smith (Con) asked if the government would get rid of the rule requiring people to wait in a clinic for 15 minutes after getting a Pfizer or Moderna jab. (See 3.37pm.) Javid said this was being “very actively looked at” and an announcement would be coming soon. In his opening statement Sajid Javid also announced that once all adults have had a reasonable chance to get a booster, the Covid pass rules will change so that only people who have had the booster count as fully vaccinated That means early in the new year, presumably, given the govrenment wants all adults to have the chance to get a booster before the end of the month. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw says almost all Tory MPs in the chamber this afternoon are wearing a mask. At the afternoon lobby briefing Downing Street indicated schools in England would only be closed in “the direst ... emergency”. The PM’s spokesman said: Throughout we’ve always sought to keep face-to-face schooling open and have only restricted it in when there’s the direst public health emergency. There’s certainly no plans to do that. We think we’ve got the right balance through plan B and our big uptick in boosters. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said that Labour supported the target of getting vaccinations up to 1m per day. He said this may prove impossible, “but we applaud the ambition”. He went on: If anyone can do it, the NHS can and the whole country will be willing them on and will not knock them for trying. But he suggested Javid was “living on a different planet” if he thought lateral flow tests were easily available. And he ended with what he said were words aimed directly at members of the public. He said: We realise on these benches the prime minister has tested patience by asking people to follow the rules when ... the prime minister’s actions in recent weeks have undermined trust at a critical moment. So I say to people feeling let down or lied to ... I do trust the chief medical officer. I do trust the chief scientific adviser and I do trust the NHS. The prime minister might not lead by example, but the rest of us can. We, the Labour party, trust you, the British people, to do the right thing to protect yourselves, to protect the ones you love and to protect the NHS. Javid says we have also learned that a booster jab provides strong protection against Omicron. He repeats what Boris Johnson announced last night about the booster rollout being speeded up. To meet the target of every adult getting a booster, vaccinations will have to take rate at a much faster rate than before. Until now the highest number of jabs that we’ve delivered in a single day in the UK was over 840,000. We’ll not only need to match that but we will need to beat that every day. He says people who have had Covid recently should wait 28 days until after their infection before getting the booster. He confirms that non-urgent medical appointment are being postponed. He says MPs are voting on the new restrictions tomorrow. Even with plan B, we still have far fewer restrictions in place than Europe. And he says from tomorrow a fully-vaccinated contact of an Omicron case will be able to take a lateral flow test every day, instead of having to self-isolate. He says the Covid pass for international travel will be rolled out for 12- to 15-year-olds. And he says, “with a heavy heart”, the government is limiting visits to people in care homes to just three nominated visitors, not including nominated care-givers. Sajid Javid says no variant has spread as fast as Omicron. He says that infections are estimated to currently be running at 200,000 per day. There are now 4,713 confirmed cases of Omicron in the UK. And the UK Health Security Agency estimates that the current number of daily infections are around 200,000. While Omicron represents over 20% of cases in England, we’ve already seen it rise to over 44% in London and we expect it to become the dominant Covid 19 variant in the capital in the next 48 hours. UPDATE: See 7.46pm for clarification of what Javid meant. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts by expressing his disappointment that Boris Johnson is not making this statement himself. He says given the PM made a TV statement last night he should have been here in person. He says he is really, really disappointed TV is taking precedence over the Commons. UPDATE: Hoyle said: Before I call the secretary of state for health and social care I want to put on record my disappointment the prime minister is not here to make this statement. Can I say, last night when the secretary of state called me to say that the prime minister felt the need to make the announcement to the country yesterday, I am surprised that he did not therefore think it appropriate to come to this House to answer questions to announce it today. I have got to say I have respect for the secretary of state for health but I am really, really disappointed that once again this house has become second runner-up to TV news. Not acceptable. If this is a game we are going to play, we are going to have to play hardball. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is about to make a statement to MPs about Covid. These are from two journalists reporting bad experiences with vaccine walk-in centres. From the Sunday Times’ Shaun Lintern earlier From my colleague Nicola Davis now There’s been a fantastic start to the Guardian and Observer 2021 charity appeal, with readers donating more than £100,000 to our Climate Justice campaign during its opening weekend. This year the appeal is supporting four great charities tackling the human impact of climate crisis and extreme weather: Practical Action, Environmental Justice Foundation, Global Greengrants Fund UK, and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The focus of the appeal is on projects helping individuals and communities in some of the world’s poorest countries who find themselves bearing the brunt of the climate emergency. As the Guardian’s editor-in chief Katharine Viner explained in her introduction to the appeal: The richest countries pollute most but it is in the poorest where climate change is most harshly felt, through extreme poverty, food and water insecurity and the displacement of millions of people from their homes. The appeal runs until early January. You can find out more about our charities here. Donations can be made online by credit card, debit card or PayPal, or by phone on 0151 284 1126. Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP who chairs the all-party parliamentry group on coronavirus, has said the website problems people have been having today with ordering lateral flow tests or booking booster jabs suggest little planning went into Boris Johnson’s announcement last night. She said: Both the British public and the NHS are stepping up to play their part in the fight against Omicron and people are understandably asking why they are being turned away after the prime minister’s prime-time address last night. These critical failures are adding weight to accusations that last night’s announcement was all about politics but lacked the necessary plan or preparation from the government, leaving the NHS to pick up the pieces yet again. Fraser Nelson says the Spectator’s tally of Tory MPs who are set or likely to rebel in the vote on the new Covid measures tomorrow has reached 77. Nelson says this is two of 79, the government’s current working majority. But the government is in no danger of losing tomorrow, because Labour is voting for the measures. And, in a division where all the opposition parties are voting against, the majority total is a red herring; only half that number plus one (40 Tories) would have to vote with the opposition parties for the government to lose. Ipsos Mori has published its latest monthly political monitor polling survey, and it suggests that, in the wake of the partygate controversy, Boris Johnson’s ratings have slumped, and Keir Starmer is now ahead of him by 13 points on the question of who would make the most capable prime minister. The firm says this is the first time a Labour leader has been ahead on this measure since January 2008. Dylan Spielman from Ipsos Mori says John Major is the only PM to have worse approval ratings at this stage in his premiership. But Margaret Thatcher’s ratings were almost as low at this point in her premiership, Spielman points out, and she went on to win two more elections. Jim Reed, the BBC’s health reporter, says the government is planning to drop the requirement for people to stay in a vaccine centre for 15 minutes after having a Pfizer or Moderna jab to make sure they don’t suffer an adverse reaction. Prof Azeem Majeed, professor of primary care at Imperial College London, said earlier that this change would speed up the through-put at vaccination clinics. The UK Health Security Agency has also released a little more information about the 10 patients hospitalised with a confirmed case of Omicron in England, one of whom has died. (See 11.55am.) The Conservative MP Marcus Fysh told the BBC earlier today that he would not be voting for the introduction of Covid passport for large venues in England because he did not want to live in a “papers please” society. Displaying a cavalier disregard for Godwin’s law, Fysh told Radio 5 Live. This is not Nazi Germany ... It’s the thin end of an authoritarian wedge. NHS Digital says 290,000 people have now booked a vaccine appointment on its website. In response to questions about why the website has been overwhelmed with demand, a spokesperson said: The vaccine booking service is facing extremely high demand and is operating a queuing system to manage numbers. We would advise people currently unable to book to try again later today or tomorrow. The UK Health Security Agency has said the number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK has risen by 1,576 from yesterday and is now 4,713. That is a 50% increase. Here is the clip of Boris Johnson responding to questions about his participation in a Downing Street Christmas quiz on 15 December last year when he was interviewed this morning. In it, he clearly said that Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, would be able to look at this event in his review of No 10 parties, and whether they broke lockdown rules. But as Sky’s Beth Rigby, who interviewed Johnson, points out, the PM also seems to have shifted his line on wrongdoing at No 10 last Christmas. He is now stressing that he personally broke no rules. “I certainly broke no rules,” he said. Until now the line from No 10 has been that no rules were broken last year. Now Johnson seems to be implying that perhaps others did break the rules. Case was looking into “all these things’, Johnson said. Dominic Cummings, the PM’s former chief adviser who, since his departure from No 10, has become one of his most vehement critics, thinks this means Johnson is preparing to dump the blame for partygate on others. Almost half of “outstanding” schools in England have been downgraded by Ofsted following inspection this term, with more than one in 10 dropping to “requires improvement” or even “inadequate”, according to data published today. Outstanding schools were until recently exempt from regular inspection, so many have not been visited by the schools inspectorate for up to 10 years or more. They are however likely to feel aggrieved at being downgraded at a time of widespread disruption in schools due to Covid. Data published by Ofsted today shows that during the three months up to the end of November 47% of schools previously rated outstanding have lost their top rating following inspection this term. Ofsted said the data relates to 99 previously outstanding schools visited by inspectors during the autumn term. According to Ofsted, 36% of these schools were downgraded to “good”, 9% went down two rankings to “requires improvement” and 2% were judged “inadequate” which is the lowest possible ranking. The overall grade profile for schools has, however, improved overall, Ofsted said, with 83% of schools judged good or outstanding between September and November this year, compared with 77% between September 2019 and March 2020 when inspections were suspended due to the pandemic. This is from Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government’s health secretary, on the lateral flow test supply problems. The Downing Street lobby briefing was dominated by questions about Covid this morning. Here are the key points. No 10 said that lateral flow tests had not run out, and that people could not order them today because of postal problems that were being addressed. (See 1pm.) Downing Street said “further capacity” was being added to make it easier for people to book booster appointments on the NHS website. Asked about the problems being encountered today (see 10.46am), the PM’s spokesman said: Across the programme we are increasing our capacity, be it making sure there is further capacity on the site to adapt to the increased demand, or indeed capacity on the ground. The spokesman also said 110,000 people booked a booster before 9am this morning. The spokesman did not rule out the government introducing tougher restrictions over Christmas during the parliamentary recess. He said that all options were kept under review and that “in extremis” the government could introduce public health measures without a vote in parliament first. He said that the government’s aim was for all adults to get a booster jab before the end of the year, not just to be able to book one. He said booster jabs should be available on Christmas Day. He said: My understanding is that there will be appointments available on Christmas Day, and obviously the NHS will monitor what the demand is. Last year vaccines were available on Christmas Day, he said, although “we didn’t see a huge demand”. The spokesman said around 750 troops had been mobilised to support the booster programme, as well as 50 military planning experts working centrally. He said the government was still waiting for approval from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before going ahead with vaccines for under-12s. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, has claimed the problems people are having ordering lateral flow tests from the government website today show Boris Johnson has got his priorities wrong. This is what the UK Health Security Agency said about the problems people are having today ordering lateral flow tests from the government’s website. A spokesperson said: Everyone who needs a lateral flow test can collect test kits – either at their local pharmacy, some community sites and some schools and colleges. Due to exceptionally high demand, ordering lateral flow tests on gov.uk has been temporarily suspended to fulfil existing orders. Information about how to collect a lateral flow test from a nearby pharmacy is available on the NHS website here. In the Commons a Home Office minister will respond to an urgent question from Labour’s Dame Margaret Hodge at 3.30pm about the Met failings in the Stephen Port case. That means the Sajid Javid statement on Covid will start at about 4.15pm. The number of people using 16 major railway stations in England and Scotland between 6am and 9.30am on Monday was down compared with the previous week, PA Media reports. PA says: According to Network Rail, the stations with the largest week-on-week reductions were Cannon Street (38%), Leeds Central (35%), Waterloo (34%), Kings Cross (28%), Liverpool Street (26%) and Euston (25%), Reading (25%) and Bristol (25%). Other stations that experienced a drop in usage include Birmingham New Street (24%), Charing Cross (23%), Paddington (20%), Manchester Piccadilly (20%), Liverpool Lime Street (17%), Edinburgh Waverley (11%), Victoria (8%) and Glasgow Central (7%). Stations are London, unless otherwise stated. Today the new advice in England to work from home if possible came into effect. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip and Brexit party who is now a GB News presenter, but who claims to be mulling over a politcal comeback, claims that Boris Johnson is just talking up the threat from Omicron as a “cynical ploy” to save his career. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesman said that a shortage of postal slots, not a shortage of lateral flow tests, has been the reason for people not being able to order lateral flow tests on the government’s website this morning. (See 11.29am.) The spokesman said: There is no shortage of lateral flow tests. We have more than sufficient supply. What we are seeing is, because of the heightened demand today, those available to be posted out today, those slots have been filled already. We are working with the postal service and others to further increase slots. But it is important for people to understand if they do encounter trouble, they can go to their local pharmacy. The slots refresh daily. I will post more from the briefing soon. The Scottish parliament is to suspend all in-person committee meetings after the Christmas and New Year holidays, in a preemptive measure to limit the expected surge in Omicron cases. Instead, Holyrood will shift to remote committee meetings unless MSPs believe there is a compelling reason to meet in person or in hybrid form, the parliament’s business bureau has decided. The new rules will come into force on 17 January, when Holyrood resumes business after the holidays. A parliament spokesperson said that staging chamber business, including first minister’s questions, in hybrid form will remain under close review. The Holyrood authorities plan to make hybrid meetings the norm in future, and are investigating options for a more sophisticated system after procedural problems emerged during FMQs last week. Alison Johnstone, the presiding officer, had to repeatedly warn Scottish National party MSPs in the chamber to stop interrupting opposition speakers working remotely, particularly Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, who was self-isolating at home after coming into contact with a positive case. The current hybrid system means the public cannot see or hear what is being said in the chamber if an MSP working remotely is talking. Johnstone believes making hybrid meetings and remote voting permanent will improve Holyrood’s flexibility. Here is a summary of the news lines from Boris Johnson’s pooled TV interview this morning. Johnson said at least one patient in the UK has now died with the Omicron variant. (See 11.55am.) He urged people to “set aside” reports that Omicron is a milder version of coronavirus than Delta. He said: I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that’s something we need to set on one side and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population. So the best thing we can do is all get our boosters. He was not denying reports that Omicron is milder than previous variants. There is evidence from South Africa suggesting it is. Instead, he was making an argument about the threat it poses because of its ability to spread so quickly. He repeatedly refused to rule out introducing further Covid restrictions before Christmas. He said: Throughout the pandemic I’ve been at great pains to stress to the public that we have to watch where the pandemic is going and we take whatever steps are necessary to protect public health. We think the steps that we are taking - so plan B, combined with a hugely ambitious acceleration of the booster campaign, bringing it forward by a month so we offer a booster to every adult by the end of the year - we think that’s the right approach. He said there was no shortage of lateral flow tests. Although they have not been available for order on the government’s website (see 11.29am), Johnson said: We do have a ready supply of lateral flow tests. If you can’t get one online for any reason, then there are ample supplies in the shops. Commenting on the demand for tests, he said: “What I think, if I may say so, what that also shows is that people are doing the sensible thing, and getting tests as well.” He urged Tory MPs to vote for the new Covid measures tomorrow, saying they were “balanced and proportionate” and that there was “no room for complacency”. He claimed he “certainly broke no rules” in relation to events at No 10 last Christmas. And he indicated his participation in a No 10 quiz event last Christmas might be included in the investigation by Simon Case, the cabinet secretary. He went on: If I may respectfully say to you ... of course, all that must be properly gone into - you’ll be hearing from the cabinet secretary about it all. He said Case would report back as soon as “reasonably” possible. He went on: But frankly, when I look at what we’re trying to do now, the crucial thing is that people understand the challenge that is posed by Omicron. But also understand that this is a challenge that collectively we can meet. What I’m focused on, frankly, is the vaccine rollout. He claimed that by tomorrow Omicron would be the dominant variant in London. He said: Here in the capital [Omicron] probably represents about 40% of the cases. By tomorrow it’ll be the majority of the cases and it’s increasing the whole time. The Northern Ireland first minister, Paul Givan, said this morning - perhaps more realistically - that Omicron is already dominant in London. (See 11.48am.) Johnson praised those delivering the booster rollout. He said: We now want to hit warp speed and we’ll have to attain a pace and a number of daily booster doses that will exceed anything that we’ve done before. But I’ve got no doubt at all that we have the people, we have the enthusiasm, we have the fundamental optimism about what we can do, which we’ve learned from the experience of the last 18 months. And I know that people are going to rise to this. As expected, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, will make a statement to MPs this afternoon. Boris Johnson has confirmed that at least one patient in the UK has now died with the Omicron variant. In an interview during a visit to a vaccination centre in London, he said: Sadly yes Omicron is producing hospitalisations and sadly at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron. So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that’s something we need to set on one side and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population. So the best thing we can do is all get our boosters. I will post more from his interview shortly. Earlier Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said around 10 people were in hospital with confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in England. (See 9.31am.) Paul Givan, the Northern Ireland first minister, has said Northern Ireland must prepare for a “storm” of Omicron cases. He told BBC Radio Ulster: I think there’s certainly a storm coming our way. You need to make preparation for that because we can see what’s happening in London, where this new variant is now the dominant strain of new cases, that has increased rapidly over the past three to four weeks. Similarly in Scotland that is the case as well, and with the movements that take place across the common travel area, we have already a number of small cases in Northern Ireland, but the expectation is the same trajectory that is happening in Great Britain is likely to occur here in Northern Ireland. As PA Media reports, Northern Ireland’s Covid certification scheme became legally enforceable today. The scheme requiring people to prove Covid status to gain entry to a range of hospitality venues and larges attendance events was introduced late last month with a two-week grace period to allow businesses adjust. Patrons wishing to enter nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises will need proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test or evidence of a previous Covid-19 infection. On Friday the UK Health Security Agency released a report (pdf) saying that 41% of Covid cases in London were Omicron. That was was double the rate for the region with the next highest Omicron levels, the south-east, where they accounted for 21% of cases. But those figures were from 6 December. Given the doubling rate of Omicron, it is now thought to be dominant in London. Here is my colleague Jamie Grierson’s story about lateral flow tests not being available for order on the government’s website in England. ITV’s Paul Brand says the Met is still not planning to investigate parties as No 10, despite the picture published yesterday of Boris Johnson taking part in a quiz night. Here is the Met statement on this from last week. Boris Johnson’s TV address to the nation last night was watched by more than 12 million people, Darren McCaffrey from GB News reports. BBC One will broadcast a pre-recorded address to the nation from Keir Starmer at 7pm in response to Boris Johnson’s own remarks on coronavirus booster vaccines, Labour has said. Today is the first day that people aged 30 to 39 can officially book a booster jab in England. Although the website has been overwhelmed (see 10.46am), NHS Digital says more than 140,000 people have managed to book vaccine appointments this morning. James Fransham from the Economist thinks it was unrealistic of Boris Johnson to offer all adults in England a booster jab by the end of the year. He explains why in a Twitter thread starting here. And some people in England are also finding it impossible to order lateral flow tests through the government’s website. This is what showed up when I tried just a few minutes ago. Following Boris Johnson’s announcement last night, the NHS in England is being overwhelmed by people trying to book a booster appointment online. A reader has sent me this screenshot telling them there were number 3472 in the queue. The NHS is now advising people, on Twitter, to try again later, or tomorrow. Tomorrow MPs will vote on the plan B Covid measures for England announced last week. According to the Spectator, which has been keeping probably the most comprehensive tally of likely rebels, there are now 75 Tories who have said they will vote against, or indicated they are likely to. These are from Fraser Nelson, the Spectator editor, with quotes from some of the latest additions to the list. These figures suggest Johnson is on course for by far the biggest rebellion of this parliament. The previous biggest came on 1 December last year, when 53 Tories voted against the government’s plan for tougher Covid tiering rules for England, with another two Conservatives acting as tellers for the rebels. And this is what Sajid Javid said in his morning interviews about Boris Johnson and partygate. Javid said he expected Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, to extend his investigation into parties in No 10 to include the participation of Boris Johnnson in a quiz night. Asked about the story, Javid said. I saw the photo of that quiz, like anyone else. What I can see is it’s a virtual quiz with the prime minister sitting at his desk. I don’t know all the details. What I can see [is] it’s a virtual quiz. And Simon Case has been given a broad remit to investigate anything that he thinks ... any type of gathering in Downing Street that should be looked at on any particular day he wants to. And so if he wants to look at this he will - that’s going to be a decision for him. It’s not right, I think, for a minister to tell him what he should or should not investigate. According to Oliver Wright in the Times (paywall) Case has already decided that the quiz night will be included in his investigation. “[Case] said originally that he would look at credible allegations of other gatherings and you can’t really say that a photo of the prime minister is not a credible allegation,” a government source told Wright. Javid claimed that Johnons is working “every minute of the day” for the public. Asked if the PM has the right qualities to handle the Covid crisis, Javid said: [What I see from] the prime minister, especially since I’ve been back in the government as health secretary, is one that is working every minute of the day, literally every minute of the day. I don’t think he gets any time to rest whatsoever. Totally and utterly focused on the nation’s challenges. But especially, I would say, over the last few weeks with the emergence of this variant, thinking about everything we can possibly do to make sure that we stay ahead in the race against this virus. That’s what I see. And that’s what I think the nation saw from the prime minister yesterday - that he couldn’t be working harder to secure the future of this country.” This is from Prof Susan Michie, a psychologist who has participated in Sage meetings but who is a leading member of Independent Sage, a group of scientists who have published their own advice to government and who have been critical of the government for not imposing tougher Covid restrictions, responding to what Sajid Javid said about cancer patients this morning. (See 9.01am.) Here are some more lines from what Sajid Javid said about Omicron and the booster jabs rollout in his morning interviews. Javid, the health secretary, said that he could not confirm that anyone has died from the Omicron variant in England. There are about 10 people in hospital with the variant, he said. But he dismissed claims this meant it was not a threat. “There is always a lag between infection and then hospitalisation and then, sadly, death,” he told Sky News. He also pointed out that a huge rise in infections would lead to more people going to hospital, even if most cases were mild. He refused to rule out schools having to close in response to the Omicron wave. Asked if he could ruled this out, he told LBC that he did not want to see it happen. But he also said: If you are asking me for guarantees, I will just say… as the health secretary, there are, when it comes to our fight against this pandemic, there are no guarantees. He said it “should not be the case” that people die because they can’t get treatment on the NHS during the Covid booster drive. On Times Radio he was asked: “Will anyone sadly die because they can’t get the treatment they need in the NHS?” Javid replied: Well, that certainly should not be the case at all because as well as focusing on this, there will be a focus on any urgent need and any, of course, emergency care. He said that he was personally responsible for the success of the booster rollout programme. He was responding to a question on the Today programme about who was in charge given that Maggie Throup, the vaccines minister, does not seem to have the clout of her predecessor, Nadhim Zahawi, who attended cabinet. He said he thought people should go ahead and spend Christmas with family and friends, but that they should be cautious too. He was planning to see family, he said. But he said when he was entertaining friends at home this weekend, he asked them to take a lateral flow test first. He said it was “completely unfair” to suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine was not as good as once thought in the light of evidence last week suggesting two doses offer very little protection against Omicron. He said AstraZeneca had “played a phenomenal role in protecting our country”. Good morning. Boris Johnson has set a target for the government to offer all adults a booster vaccine by the end of the month. Here is our overnight story reporting the announcement. This morning Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has been giving broadcast interviews, and he has admitted that, as GPs and hospitals in England focus on this target over the next few weeks, non-urgent appointments will be postponed. He told the Today programme: It does mean that, when it comes to primary care, for the next couple of weeks that our GPs will only be focusing on urgent needs and vaccinations. And it also means that non-urgent appointments and elective surgeries may have to be postponed into the new year. Javid insisted that this would not affect people wanting to see a doctor about cancer symptoms. That would count as an urgent appointment, he said. Asked what hospital appointments might be postponed, Javid replied: It will be anyone who’s got some elective surgery planned, for example, that can be postponed until the new year. So that might mean, for example, a knee operation or hip operation, something that sadly someone has probably been waiting [for] for a long time in any case, but the hospital concerned would have the right to postpone it if it meant they would get a lot more booster jabs done. Javid said these decisions were “not easy”. But there was limited capacity in the NHS. Asked if this would mean people dying who would not have died if these appointments had not been posptponed, Javid said: “What will lead to real harm is if we don’t do this.” I will post more from his interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Boris Johnson is visiting a vaccination centre, where he is expected to give a TV interview. 11.30am: Downing Street holds its lobby briefing. 3.30pm: Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs about the vaccine booster programme. 4pm: Antonia Romeo, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the courts backlog. 4.30pm: Max Hill QC, director of public prosecutions, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about rape prosecutions. Also today Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, will be meeting foreign ministers from the Balkans. I will be largely focusing on UK Covid-related issues today, but there is much more coverage on our global Covid live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"

          "bodyText": "Name: Zoombies. Age: They are products of our times. Appearance: Pale blue talking heads, dead behind the eyes. I remember them – they lived on an island and needed rescuing. You’re thinking of Zoombinis, the children’s video game. Yeah, maybe. My brain is fried. We’re talking about Zoombies – the exhausted, zombie-like survivors of back-to-back Zoom meetings. This sounds like a pandemic thing. It is – part of a new tide of office jargon coined for a workforce that hasn’t visited an office in almost two years. I love working from home. I’ve only got dressed from the waist up for almost two years. Nevertheless, remote working has consequences. Zooming recreates all the stress of the office without the mitigating compensation of actual human contact. It’s dispiriting and exhausting. I had a Zoom meeting this morning, and everyone was bright-eyed and totally focused on work. If you can’t spot the Zoombie in the Zoom meeting, then the Zoombie is probably you. Everyone did keep asking if I was OK. I’m just tired, I guess. Have you been polyworking, by any chance? No, I’m married. “Polyworking” is another new term: it means seizing the opportunity of home working to perform two or more jobs. You mean people are working harder at home than they would in the office? What is wrong with this country? You know what they say: if a thing is worth doing badly, it’s worth doing two things badly for twice the money. I confess I’d not heard that one. What other jargon is arising from employment in the time of Covid? “Blursday” is a word coined to evoke the idea that the days of the week have lost their significance in the new paradigm. That’s very 2020. And 2021 too, come to think of it. Give me another. Workers now talk about “synchronous communication”, when they just mean speaking to each other in real time. Not in my Zoom meetings they don’t. What else? Are you familiar with the acronym RTO? It rings a bell. It stands for “return to office”, and relates to timings and strategies for the gradual reintegration of a remote workforce into fully synchronous, in-person employment. I’m starting to think we might not need that one. You may be right. Email me asynchronously about it. Do say: “The account manager Zoom-bombed our hybrid team meeting today, which was unprecedented.” Don’t say: “Sorry, I need to take this – it’s my other boss.”"

          "bodyText": "Maps depicting Renaissance Tuscany are back on display at the Uffizi Galleries in Florence after being hidden from public view for more than 20 years. The wall paintings were commissioned in the late 1500s by Ferdinando I de’ Medici after the republic of Florence’s conquering of its rival Siena led to the creation the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and depict the newly unified territory. More than 1,200 cities and towns, whose names are written in gold, are featured in the three maps designed by the cartographer Stefano Bonsignori and painted by Ludovico Buti. The maps were the first large-scale representation of Tuscany and are displayed in the museum’s “hall of the geographical maps”, where the Italian director Dario Argento shot a scene from his 1996 film The Stendhal Syndrome, about the mysterious illness thought to strike visitors to Florence after they become overwhelmed by the beauty of the city’s artistic masterpieces. One wall depicts the map of the Florence territory, while another depicts Siena. A third wall features a map of Elba Island off the Tuscan coast. The room also contains a huge window from where visitors can get a bird’s eye view over the landscape of present-day Florence, including the Palazzo Vecchio and the basilicas of Santa Croce and San Miniato al Monte. The restoration of the maps cost €700,000 (£600,000). “Even the smallest and most remote towns are elegantly written in gold and are often accompanied by the first known pictorial representation of the various locations,” said Eike Schmidt, the director of the Uffizi Galleries. “The inhabitants of the [Tuscan] region will be able to recognise places they love in these large maps.” The room, which also now contains seats for visitors, had been closed since the late 1990s. “It was a very old-fashioned, stuffy room that was clearly in need of restoration, although the official reason for keeping it closed was always lack of staff,” said Schmidt. “The wall paintings were darkened and you were really able to notice the dust. We’ve been able to restore them, clean them and install technology that automatically counts the number of people inside the room at one time.” The maps will be on show to the public from Tuesday to a maximum of 20 visitors at a time. The maps were commissioned by Ferdinando I to celebrate the conquering of Siena by Florence. Ferdinando I was the son of Cosimo I de’ Medici, the first grand duke of Tuscany, who commissioned the architect Giorgio Vasari to build the Uffizi palace in 1560."

          "headline": "Folk singer Michael Hurley at 80: ‘The way music comes to you, it’s like dreaming’",
          "bodyText": "‘Calling me an outsider artist … yes, I think it’s apt. It’s taken me a long time to join the gang.” On Thanksgiving Friday, Michael Hurley – freak-folk singer-songwriter and artist of nearly 60 years’ standing – is considering where he fits in. He’s calling from his little house in rural Oregon, among the doug firs and tall pines, where he’s just brewed 11 gallons of cider from his homegrown apples. “It’s really quiet here. Few cars go by. It suits me. It’s remote. It gets a little lonely sometimes.” To celebrate his 80th birthday, Hurley is releasing his first album of new material in 12 years, The Time of the Foxgloves, named after his favourite flower and his favourite time of year. His band on it includes the left-field bluesy singer-songwriter Josephine Foster, one of many contemporary fans. Other admirers include Cat Power (who has covered his songs Werewolf and Sweedeedee), Devendra Banhart (who released two Hurley albums on his Gnomonsong label), Lucinda Williams, Yo La Tengo, Violent Femmes and Will Oldham. “He’s a real hero,” Oldham said in 2017. “Seeing him singing and smiling makes me think I can get through this life doing what I do.” You hear some of their influences in Hurley’s eccentric, pared-back, bluegrass and blues-inspired back catalogue. At times his songs are sparse and tender (Be Kind To Me; Valley of Tears) at others spikily surreal (and with titles to match, like What Made My Hamburger Disappear?). The music’s playfulness is underscored by his records’ cartoonish cover art, featuring werewolves inspired by his childhood pet collies Boone and Count, psychedelic sunrises and women in bars drinking beer – “my favourite thing to draw”, Hurley says. Born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in 1941, Hurley spent childhood summers on the road with his siblings and operetta-directing father, travelling between their home and theatres in Florida. In the car, they would soak up artists including Fats Waller and Jelly Roll Morton, and make up “simple songs”; he also got on stage for the first time back then. “At the beginning of the shows, we’d be there, us kids, pretending we were fishing into the orchestra pit. Then the actors would come on and chase us off, make it part of the show!” His voice flutters with sleepy delight. “I always wanted to be a creative writer. I never dreamed that I would record.” He became a teenage school drop-out who passed his time making fanzines with names such as The Outcry and The Morning Tea – then he started playing music and hitchhiking with his sister’s blond Stella guitar (“I loved the way it looked and the way its strings would resonate”). One day, he was picked up by the folklorist Fred Ramsey, who lived up the local river road; he’d recorded traditional music across the south in the 50s and invited Hurley to his house to play his songs. He liked what he heard. Hurley’s debut album, First Songs, produced by Ramsay, came out in 1965 on the renowned Folkways label, home to Woody Guthrie and Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music. On its cover, Hurley already looked different, slightly edgy, peering from under a roguish swoosh of dark hair, a devil-may-care 22.  He was also playing the Greenwich Village coffee house scene at the time, where Bob Dylan and Paul Simon had made early career moves. He had meeting with major producers but nothing transpired: one assumes Hurley never wanted to be a bigger musician. “I did,” he replies, “but I didn’t have a progressive drive about it. I didn’t enjoy the process of applying for gigs, that determination to penetrate things, all this trouble you had to go through. I preferred playing parties. Little gatherings. Drinking with friends, hopping across the river.” He says he didn’t seem to fit people’s ideas “of what the blues or bluegrass or folk should be”. He thinks it’s funny that he first played the Newport folk festival in 2013. “By which time there was practically no folk at all, just indie-rock, so I played a real old folk song, Barbara Allen. Now I’m acceptable!” Seven years passed between his debut album and its follow-up, Armchair Boogie, in 1971. In the meantime, he’d got married, had kids, separated from his wife, had another kid with his girlfriend, and worked as a hospital janitor, artist’s model, shoe pattern-maker and pretzel vendor on the streets of Boston. But he kept making music. His 1975 album, Have Moicy! with the Holy Modal Rounders and Jeffrey Frederick &amp; the Clamtones became a cult favourite: its raggedy, joyful folk-rock holds premonitions of early-80s REM. Over the next three decades, Hurley managed to make a modest living selling his art, touring and making drowsy new albums every few years (the critic Robert Christgau said 1984’s Blue Navigator “sounds as if Hurley padded over to the studio before he was done with his nap”). This has meant his social life has for decades been on an international cycle. “I’ve been spoilt over the years in a way, catching up every year with old friends.” The pandemic has been hard. “I’ve been adjusting to staying in my locality. Doing two to three gigs a month. Going to drive-in automobile places … and I’m scared to fly yet. Hopefully I’ll be lucky in spring when the conditions will be better.” In recent years, he has enjoyed the new interest in his work from younger artists. He adores lots of their covers, highlighting the Hackles’ softer, subtler version of 2002’s O My Stars and Cat Power’s 2000 version of Werewolf, an eerie classic he wrote in the 60s, inspired by the horror films of Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff. “Cat’s version puts it in a whole different place. I don’t want people to sound like me. I want them to sound like them.” His new compositions on The Time of the Foxgloves warmed his heart in the summer: he says he loved playing with a full band in a studio – violin, pump organ, upright bass, banjo and percussion. Tracks include Knocko the Monk, an instrumental where a pump organ wheezes beautifully behind his spiky, nimble finger-picking, and Jacob’s Ladder, on which Josephine Foster’s ghostly alto acts as an antique, woozy foil for Hurley’s reedier tones. “The way music comes to you … it’s like dreaming,” he says. “Something’s going on. Melodies just drop into my thinking.” He has a theory about the type of person who is drawn to his songs. “They respond to the irregularity of it, how it’s not ordinary. A mother of a young son wrote to me recently and said, ‘My son gets so stressed but when I play your music, it calms him way down.’ Oftentimes, musicians have trouble with irregularities, but not everyone’s the same.” He takes a moment in silence. “That’s how it is. Some people feel its beauty.” The Time of the Foxgloves is out now on No Quarter Records."

His first dart pings the red treble-20 bed. His second dart nestles in alongside it. Without breaking stride Price throws his third and final dart: another treble-20. As the crowd in Wolverhampton rise to their feet, Price pumps his fist for the camera as referee George Noble fills his lungs and belts out the signature call: “ONE HUNDRED AND EIIIIIIIIIIGHTY!” Viewers watching on Sky Sports, however, will have experienced this moment slightly differently. No sooner had Price’s second dart thudded into the treble-20 than a remote camera stationed just behind the stage was sharply zooming in to the bed, magnifying the tension ahead of the third dart. For even semi-regular watchers of darts the 180 zoom has become so familiar it is barely even noticed any more, part of the tapestry of darts for more than 40 years. The 180 zoom is probably the most famous camera shot in the whole of televised sport. And yet it’s essentially a gimmick: an entirely confected and artificial injection of drama that bears no resemblance to anything the players themselves are experiencing on the stage. Virtually nothing like it exists in any other sport. It is the equivalent of adding a Batman-style “KAPOW!” graphic to the screen every time someone gets punched in boxing, or a comedy bassoon sound effect when a footballer misses an open goal. Yet whereas such devices are decried and detested in other sports, darts has always been radically different. Right from the start of its existence as a professional pursuit it was designed to be a television product as much as a sport in its own right. And so really the 180 zoom is more than a piece of nifty camerawork. In a way, it is the story of how darts burst out of the pubs and clubs and took over the world. In late November I spent an afternoon with the Sky Sports production team in Wolverhampton to see how the 180 zoom works in practice. Out in the arena a cameraman called Chris Pendlebury operates the crucial Camera Two, which is usually homed in on the treble-20. Until 2017 the zoom was still done manually but now it runs robotically, according to a pre-set computer programme. The hard part is being able to decide when to push the button. The man who has to make that call is Keith Deller. Deller is probably best known as the 1983 world champion but these days he is one of Sky’s “spotters”, whose task is to instruct the director and camera operators where a player is going to throw his next dart. “Down!” he shouts from his seat at the back of the production truck. “Back up! Now treble-20, double-18… double nine!” It is one of the most high‑pressured, nerveless jobs in television. Deller needs to watch the players’ eyes, so he can see when their gaze shifts down towards the treble-19. He needs to know which players like which combinations. He needs to know that some players – like Portugal’s Jose de Sousa – are prone to miscounting and throwing at the wrong number entirely. A typical two-minute leg of darts will contain about 50 different camera shots, almost all of them commanded in real time by the spotter. “It’s hard,” he says. “But you mustn’t panic.” These days there is an added tactical dimension. Not every player who hits two treble-20s will necessarily aim for a third. Maybe the bed is blocked. Maybe treble-19 offers a better route to a finish. “Players back in the day would just continue on the treble-20,” says the Sky analyst Wayne Mardle. “But that doesn’t always leave you the easiest route to finish. The players have evolved. There’s more money in it, it’s more professional. They’re playing the percentages.” Players such as Michael van Gerwen often like to go for three treble-19s. Others, like Michael Smith, will go for the 180 even if he’s on 182. “There’s something special about the call of a 180,” Mardle says. “The guys get a buzz out of it. Sometimes board management goes out of the window, Russ Bray or George Noble bellows ‘180’, the crowd roars like lunatics. And just maybe, it gets into your opponent’s head.” The tactics have changed, the psychology has changed, the pace of the game has changed, and yet what is striking is how little the product has changed. Visually speaking, darts on television is largely the same as it was more than 40 years ago, when the BBC decided to take a punt on the inaugural world championships in 1978. Nobody really knows for sure who invented the 180 zoom. Perhaps the strongest claim lies with Nick Hunter, the former BBC Sport director in charge of organising the corporation’s coverage in the 1970s and 1980s.Until that point televised darts had largely been a messy low-budget affair, characterised by frequent awkward cuts between the player and the board and a jarring lack of visual consistency. The board itself was invariably shown in wide angle, making it hard to see where darts had landed. But at some point between the quarter-finals and the final of that 1978 championship came the transformation that would change the sport forever. Hunter’s idea (or possibly presenter David Vine, or possibly producer Ray Lakeland, or possibly co-commentator and spotter Tony Green) was to film in split-screen, with one camera trained on the board and one on the player’s face. “This simple technical solution,” writes Dan Waddell in his book We Had Some Laughs, “changed darts from a sport that was difficult to capture to one made for the medium.” Zooming on a 180 had been tried before on ITV’s Indoor League, but only after the third dart had been thrown. The genius of the BBC’s innovation was to initiate the zoom after the second treble, instantly letting us know that a 180 was on. It quickened the pulse. It drew the viewer in a little closer, a technique almost cinematic in its manipulation. “The camera zoom told the story,” says Rory Hopkins, who has produced Sky’s darts coverage since 1994. “When it starts, you know you’re watching the ultimate.” These days various sports have tried similar tricks. In football La Liga has begun experimenting with a dramatic high-focus camera for its touchline shots. Cricket briefly flirted with a giddy low-angle camera shot for free hits. Inevitably such innovations have felt weird and ersatz. By contrast darts was conceived first and foremost as a piece of storytelling. It was not simply a case of pointing a camera at the action: the camera became the action. Perhaps this explains why, through changing habits and changing audiences, darts has not just endured but thrived. While other sports fret about how to make their product more television‑friendly, darts was there long before them. The split‑screen, the facial close-ups and the 180 zoom established by the BBC in the 1970s created a powerful visual grammar that, a few minor touches aside, has endured largely unchanged until the present day: a classic formula that, in hindsight, was decades ahead of the game. “We’ve looked at how we can make it better,” says Hopkins. “But really, they got it right the first time.” Sky Sports Darts is showing the William Hill World Darts Championship from 15 December to 3 January."

          "headline": "Native American communities lashed by Covid, worsening chronic inequities",
          "bodyText": "Amid the Covid-19 pandemic the president of one of the largest Native American– run non-profits has warned that health and economic disparities are still seriously affecting Indigenous communities, despite some progress achieved by the Biden administration. Josh Arce, president of the Partnership With Native Americans (PWNA), told the Guardian in an interview that challenges affecting Indigenous groups ranged from health inequities such as high rates of diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses to inadequate infrastructure such as running water and reliable electricity. Nearly all of these problems were worsened by the pandemic. “The issues are, by and large, some of the same issues that we’ve been confronted with but they’ve been really highlighted and exacerbated by Covid-19 throughout the past two and a half years,” said Arce, who added that such challenges “really permeate all aspects of Native life and communities”. For centuries, Indigenous communities in the US have faced challenges in public health, education, infrastructure and other areas, an aftershock of violent colonization and widespread racism. While the Biden administration has marked some progress, such as the appointment of Native American Deb Haaland as secretary of the Interior, an achievement that Arce noted was critical and brought hope to Native communities, Arce warned that more action is needed to ensure more progress for Indigenous communities in the US. “The consultation and the meetings and the tribal input will only go so far until there starts to be some action behind the words that they’re saying and the policies that they want to put in place,” said Arce. Like other marginalized communities, Native Americans were disproportionately affected by Covid-19, dying from the virus at twice the rate of white Americans. Health infrastructure in Native American communities, provided through the Indian Health Service, often is substandard , with hospitals and other medical centers generally under-resourced and understaffed, said Arce. Native Americans are also more likely to be uninsured, according to data from the office of minority health in the US Department of Health and Human Services, adding another barrier to tackling complicated health challenges such as the current pandemic. “A tribal hospital system might only have six beds in their ICU, and so you start to run out of space a lot more rapidly than you do in a mainstream system,” said Arce. The pandemic also affected mental health in many Indigenous communities. Native American populations already experience higher death rates from suicide, about 20% higher than non-Hispanic white Americans as of 2019, and higher rates of depression. But isolation and grief triggered by the pandemic has made the mental health epidemic worse, specifically among Native American youth, says Arce. “That type of isolation, prolonged isolation, has really had an adverse effect on communities,” said Arce. Arce also noted that generally poor mental health among Native American youth and insufficient resources to address mental health concerns were worsened by the pandemic, with rates of suicide among Native American teenagers “sky high”. Economic challenges such as poverty – affecting one out of three Native Americans – and high rates of unemployment are also chronic concerns in Native American communities, said Arce. While Arce noted that much-needed aid was delivered to Indigenous communities through the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, different reservation communities, notably those in more rural areas, still face challenges securing basic infrastructure needs such as reliable electricity and running water. “If we can overcome that next hurdle and really get these basic needs met for the reservation community, that’s going to be a huge improvement to the lives and wellbeing for those tribal members,” said Arce. Education nationwide has also been hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic, but historically underfunded schools within the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) system were already struggling to cope. The impact of the pandemic – such as meeting remote learning needs – has made the sector even more challenging. Native communities had problems accessing reliable, high speed internet, an inequity termed the “digital divide”. Previous attempts to deliver broadband to tribal communities did not take into account power limitations in some areas. While there has been a surge of funding from recently passed social aid packages, Arce says that communities are still facing long-term problems such as the blighted conditions of school buildings, understaffed districts and teachers not receiving adequate pay. Climate change will also affect Indigenous communities, Arce said, with its effects differing by region. For low-lying tribes based in states like Florida or Louisiana, predicted sea level rises could subsume communities. Similarly, Indigenous people in the northern plains could see their growth seasons, a critical fixture, disrupted. “They’re going to essentially get evicted by the results of climate change,” said Arce. Arce said that the Navajo nationis still dealing with the aftereffect of pollutants from uranium mining that occurred decades ago. Other tribes have struggled without basic necessities like clean drinking water, with one in 10 Indigenous Americans lacking access to safe tap water or basic sanitation, a phenomenon called “plumbing poverty”. Arce said that many of these struggles within Native communities aren’t new phenomena but areproblems that have been plaguing residents for decades. While the Biden administration is “definitely [moving in] a positive trajectory”, Arce said he is hopeful that more action can be taken in combination with recently passed policy to address basic necessities in tribal communities and other overwhelming needs. “I know that the pace of government can be very slow so I hope that these policies and improvements turn into action and not just be a policy that doesn’t have a whole lot of teeth,” said Arce."

          "headline": "She killed her ex-husband in self-defense. Can she now find peace? ",
          "bodyText": "There is a phrase Rachel Bellesen can’t shake, even to this day. It echoes in her dreams, the moment the judge read her the charges: deliberate homicide. Punishable by death. Punishable by death. To this day, Bellesen can’t remember much past that phrase. The last 24 hours had already been a blur: the assault, the shooting, the arrest and now this – her arraignment. It was 9 October 2020. Bellesen had started the day thinking she was the victim. After all, she had already explained how her ex-partner attacked her. How he tried to rape her. How she shot and killed him in self-defense. But throughout the night, Bellesen noticed she hadn’t been treated the way a crime victim should. Still, she figured if she was being charged something, it had to be because she had been driving drunk or didn’t have the proper gun permit. It didn’t occur to her until now that the justice system saw her as a perpetrator – as a killer. Not after everything she had survived at the hands of Jacob Glace. “I felt like I was dead inside,” Bellesen says, looking back. “I felt like a person standing very still in the center of a tornado that was just exploding all around – and not being able to move or breathe or think or feel anything.” In the United States, nearly one in four women – and one in 10 men – experience intimate partner violence or stalking during their lifetimes. Bellesen thought she had left that all behind; moving to Montana was supposed to be a fresh start. But her history with Glace was about to come flooding back – in a public trial that would test the lengths necessary to prove self-defense, even after a lifetime of domestic abuse. Until her move, Bellesen had lived with the specter of violence almost her entire life. It started, she says, with abuse she sustained as a child at the hands of a relative. Then came Glace. Bellesen, née Hansen, was only 15 when they met, living in a remote mountain neighborhood outside Leavenworth, Washington. Glace was 23, a pot dealer with a handsome face and a love of the outdoors. They were dating within weeks. At first, the relationship spelled freedom for Bellesen. They shared a passion for hiking and snowboarding, and Glace, with his car, could whisk Bellesen far from the confines of her tiny town. But soon, freedom turned to isolation. Bellesen got pregnant shortly before her 16th birthday. Her mother presented her with a choice: either have an abortion and move with her family to their new home in Montana, or stay in Washington with Glace. She chose Glace. Cramped with him living in a shed that had been converted into a studio apartment, Bellesen felt increasingly adrift. She stopped going to school. She lost contact with most of her friends. And without a driver’s license, her horizons seemed to shrink. Glace, once so eager to sweep her away on adventures, increasingly left her at home. Bellesen says Glace started raping her after the birth of their first child. If she rebuffed his advances, he would call her a tease. If she cried as he pinned her down, he would berate her for making him feel bad. It would take years for Bellesen to realize that what was happening was a crime. She was still in her teens when she found herself pregnant with her second child. He stopped raping her during the pregnancy, but the violence continued. Glace would shove her as he passed, often with an “Oops, sorry, I didn’t see you there.” Once, while holding her firstborn child, Bellesen made the mistake of interrupting him while he was outside with friends. As she turned to leave, a sharp pain pierced her shoulders. Her infant slipped from her fingers. Glace had thrown a beer bottle square against her spine. Whore. Bad mother. Ugly. Loveless. Clingy. The insults were daily. And then, days after she returned home with her second child, Glace started raping her again. “That was much more violent than before,” she would later tell her defense team. The sutures from her C-section nearly tore open. She attempted suicide. When she woke up in the emergency room, Glace looked like he’d been crying. He seemed scared – more for himself than for her, she suspected. The physical assaults stopped for a while after that. Glace promised to do better, to be better. It was during that lull that Bellesen agreed to marry Glace. She figured it was the right thing to do: they had children together, after all. But Glace soon returned to his pattern of violence, only now it escalated. Strangulation became part of the routine, Bellesen says. One incident left her so injured, she peed blood for three days afterwards. Bellesen tried to leave, but she faced pressure from family to stick it out and be a good wife and mother. Even after they finally separated – following an incident where Bellesen says she discovered Glace sleeping with another teenager – she would sometimes notice Glace’s black Chevy Tahoe following her. Feeling alienated from family and friends, Bellesen went through periods of homelessness, of addiction to drugs and alcohol, as she attempted to recover from all she endured. Montana was going to be different. In 2005, after reconnecting with her mother – whom she hadn’t spoken to in years – Bellesen hopped on a train out of Washington with nothing more than a backpack. Given her lack of housing, a judge had awarded Glace custody of their children. “Moving here was very difficult. I left behind everybody I knew. I left behind my kids,” Bellesen says. “I didn’t know if I was jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. But I really felt like it was my only choice to really try and get my life back on track.” Bellesen initially settled in the tourist hub of Whitefish, a ski destination just like Leavenworth had been. The resort-town dynamics felt familiar: there were the locals, and then there were the tourists. In Leavenworth, Bellesen had the pride of being on the locals’ side. “We felt like it was our town,” she recalls. But in Whitefish, the tables had turned. It was a lonely time. The only people she knew in Montana were her sister, her mother and her stepfather – and those relationships remained largely strained. Without a support system, Bellesen continued drinking, leading to a string of convictions for intoxicated driving. But slowly, Bellesen turned her life around. With Glace’s agreement, Bellesen’s two sons came to live with her. She received treatment for her addiction, and in 2012, newly sober, she registered for the dating app Match. One profile stood out to her. It featured a father of two from southern California, with a description that was brief and to the point: Not social. Doesn’t do bars. Must like kids. And no drama. It belonged to Corey Bellesen. They exchanged emails and telephone calls for a couple of weeks before they agreed to meet in person. Corey, a tall man with bright eyes and a scruffy, close-cropped beard, remembers being instantly smitten. In her plaid shirt and jeans, Bellesen seemed casual but confident. Her hair, long and dark at the time, spiraled down past her waist. And then there was the ease he felt around her: “It was like talking to an old friend,” he recalls. Their first date played like something out of a movie. First they went for a meal, followed by a stroll by a lake. Sitting on a rock by the water’s edge, lost in conversation, they were caught unaware when the sky turned black. But even as the downpour began, they chose to stay – if but to remain in each other’s company a little while longer. Soaking wet, they drove back to Corey’s house to dry off on the porch. He knew right away that she was the one. “It was crazy,” he says. “She just had a smile and a gleam in her eye.” They got married that same year. By 2017, Bellesen was finishing a degree in addiction studies. She wanted to be a counselor. Looking for opportunities, she stumbled across a listing for the Abbie Shelter, a Kalispell nonprofit supporting survivors of domestic and sexual violence. She decided to volunteer. Entering its headquarters for the first time proved to be a shock. It was nothing like the cold, institutional shelter Bellesen had spent nights in back in Washington. She made her way across a big yard dotted with flowers and a swing set, toward a welcoming, purple-trimmed house. Inside, she was greeted with the fuzzy pillows, couches and a room buzzing with life. At the center of it all was the Abbie Shelter’s executive director, Hilary Shaw. Bellesen met Shaw at her first volunteer meeting. A chipper, self-described ski bunny from Connecticut – who jokes that she moved to Montana after meeting a “cute guy,” her husband – Shaw sat breastfeeding in the middle of the room. It was an image of confidence that seared itself into Bellesen’s mind. “When she spoke, she spoke in a way that I never really heard another woman speak before,” Bellesen explains. “It was the voice of a woman who had been told her whole life that she was perfect just the way she was and that she was confident and capable and strong.” Bellesen pauses. “And I had not experienced women like that, ever.” Bellesen set to work making herself an essential part of the Abbie Shelter community. She even brought her own set of power tools, helping to fix the fence and rewire the electrical system. Soon, she was promoted from volunteer to staff member. Still, Bellesen kept much of her personal experiences to herself. “I’ve found over the years that, when I would tell people about my history with Jake or growing up with my stepdad, they either would get extremely angry about the situation or they would get completely grossed out about it and distance themselves.” But even as Bellesen made strides in her new life, she couldn’t shake her nagging self-doubt. Glace’s voice echoed in the back of her mind, taunting her, warning her she wasn’t good enough. She couldn’t escape it. Nor, as it turns out, could she escape Glace himself. The assertive Roman nose. The blue-grey eyes. The small ears. The strong jawline. Every time Isaac Glace caught a glimpse of himself, he saw a younger version of his father: “I’d look in the mirror and I’d see the person I hated the most on this earth.” Isaac, now in his early 20s, hadn’t always felt that way. Growing up, he saw his parents’ relationship as nothing more than “an awkward game of custodial tug of war”, no different than in other divorced families. As Glace and Bellesen’s youngest son, Isaac was too little to remember his move to Montana. But he does recall that his father started commuting to the state shortly afterwards. Glace would try to insinuate himself into his children’s lives, attending birthdays and theater recitals. “My father, he would show up one night, like every six months, and take me and my brother out to dinner or something,” Isaac recalls. He could tell his parents’ reunions were uneasy but that they muscled through with a “do-it-for-the-kids” attitude. But something still felt off. As Isaac entered his teenage years, he started to realize the tension went beyond the usual divorce drama. It prompted Bellesen and her husband Corey to join him for a family therapy session. There, Isaac started to learn about his mother’s past – and his father’s violence. “It felt so obvious in hindsight, you know? And I felt bad for not understanding sooner what had gone on,” Isaac says. As he grew older, there were more and more incidents that chipped away at his father’s nice-guy persona. The turning point came one night when Isaac was about 15 years old. He had gone to visit Glace in the town of Plains, Montana, where he was living with his then-girlfriend, Jasmine Sayler. It was close to midnight when Isaac was awoken up by the sounds of a fight. “Whore.” “Bitch.” Isaac remembers his father, drunk, shouting in Sayler’s face. He feared the insults would escalate into violence, so he dialed 911. But then Glace did a sudden about-face. His anger disappeared. He seemed calm, kind even. And with the 911 operator on the other end of the line, he convinced Isaac to end the call. “The moment I hung up, he went right back to being incredibly violent and incredibly abusive – but this time to me.” Isaac says Glace pointed a rifle in his face before storming off into the night. Ultimately, it was on the premise of talking about his son that Glace suggested he and Bellesen meet on the afternoon of 8 October 2020. Bellesen felt she had little choice: Glace was upset at Isaac and itching to confront him. If Bellesen didn’t agree to a visit, she feared Glace might ambush Isaac and berate him – or worse. The day started like any other. Her husband Corey, an operations manager at an internet service provider, got out of bed in his Lakeside home and kissed his sleeping wife goodbye before heading to work. By the time he saw her again that evening, she was sitting at the Cornerstone Convenience store on a desolate stretch of Highway 28, racked with shock. Corey’s eyes traveled from her tattered shirt to the blood on her jeans. Bellesen had been planning for a relaxing afternoon. She had a half day off, so as soon as she wrapped up her work at the Abbie Shelter, she headed to the slopes of Blacktail Mountain for a hike with her dog. That’s when she received Glace’s telephone call, pressuring her to meet. She was irritated. Still, she did what she thought was right: She returned the dog home and prepared to set out on the hour-long drive to Paradise, Montana, where Glace was living at the time. Nobody knew where she was going, not even her husband – Corey wouldn’t have approved. Instead, she texted him and kept her absence vague: “work is busy, I’ll see you late tonight.” When Bellesen arrived, she noticed Glace had been drinking. His demeanor seemed a little too friendly. “He has this face that he gets where he smiles, but his eyes don’t smile,” she would later tell her defense team. Bellesen had arrived in a new car, a 2020 Land Rover Discovery, and Glace insisted they take it for a drive. It would give them more privacy, he argued. She obliged, despite her misgivings. She suspected his friendliness was a smokescreen for his anger. With Bellesen behind the wheel, Glace guided her out of his sleepy little town, away from its lonely antique store and white picket fences. They drove across the Clark Fork River, over train tracks and down an empty road where the conifers grew tall and dense. A rocky outcropping rose out of the ground before them, about two stories high. Glace instructed Bellesen to turn onto a dirt road behind it, where a clearing opened onto the river. They parked, and Bellesen lifted the back hatch of the car. She sat on the tailgate while they shared swigs of vodka. “Well, what do you want me to say?” Bellesen remembers asking, exasperated. The conversation about their son had reached an impasse. Glace deflected: “You look really good.” He commented on her breasts, sneering about how Corey was a lucky guy. His temperament seemed erratic – and Bellesen grew anxious to leave. She glanced at her cellphone. No signal. Glace moved in for a kiss. She quickly pushed him away, but by then, the hairs on the back of her neck were standing on end. She moved to slide off the tailgate, but her feet never reached the ground. In that second, she says, Glace had come at her again – only this time, he pinned her down by the shoulder and was ripping at her shirt with his free hand, tearing the buttons and the clasp of her bra. It all happened so fast. Trapped under his weight, she feared he would choke her like he had in the past. She felt like she might die. His eyes seemed so narrow, so glassy. Scratched and bruised, she managed to wriggle free – but Glace’s hand shot forward as she sprinted around the side of the Land Rover, catching her pants with such force that her pants went slack. Her zipper had broken. But she made it to the front car door. As she tried to climb inside, Glace behind her, she noticed Corey’s Glock 26 pistol in the car’s center console. She spun around, closed her eyes, and squeezed the trigger. Missoula-based attorney Lance Jasper was not looking for another homicide case to represent. In fact, as he puts it, he was having a pretty shitty day. His wife lives with progressive multiple sclerosis, an incurable disease that attacks the nervous system, and was in the process of transitioning to a wheelchair. Jasper was frustrated: there was nothing he could do to stop the disease’s advance. He was faced with a constant onslaught of bad news he was powerless to do anything about. “I like to have control – or at least think I can direct the outcome of something in a manner consistent with effort, right? If you try hard enough, things will get better,” he says. “Whereas when you are stricken with a disease you can’t do anything about, you just watch it take a person, the person you love the most.” It was during this time that a friend at the public defender’s office tipped him off about a new case: a woman was in jail in Thompson Falls, Montana, charged with deliberate homicide in the shooting of her abusive ex. Would Jasper be interested in representing her? He wasn’t sold on the idea but leapt at the prospect of getting out of the office. Driving helped clear his mind. A straight-talking ex-construction worker with a round face and a horseshoe mustache, Jasper counts nearly two decades of working criminal defense cases. But what he saw in the Thompson Falls jail that day was a rarity in his line of work. It was a “unicorn” case – a true instance of self-defense. Bellesen sat across from him behind a glass window, speaking into a telephone mounted on the wall. She kept repeating: “I didn’t have a choice, I didn’t have a choice.” Bellesen was afraid she was facing the death penalty, but Jasper knew such a verdict was rare in Montana. Only three people had been executed in the state since 1976. A lengthy prison sentence, however, was not out of the question. “I saw a woman really in terror,” Jasper says. “I didn’t quite have a real idea of all the trauma at that point in time that she had went through. But what I saw was a victim.” Experts often explain domestic violence as a means of control – a pattern of behavior used to intimidate, silence and isolate victims, on top of any physical injury they may endure. As he started to delve into Bellesen’s case, he saw how that control had played out in Glace and Bellesen’s relationship. But here was a chance to seize back the control – both in Bellesen’s life and his own – by coming to her defense. Jasper decided to take the case pro bono. “It helps balance me, in the sense that seeing someone else in need, that’s something I can do,” Jasper says. “You’re not changing the world, but you can change some things.” The first hurdle, however, was getting Bellesen out of jail. Bellesen had been in custody ever since police officer Gary Stanberry picked her up from the convenience store where she and Corey dialed 911. Home since then had been a square cement cell she shared with three other women. One of her cell-mates, Bellesen soon learned, was a domestic abuser herself. Lying on her bunk, Bellesen tried to drown out the insults the woman screamed over the telephone to her family by placing a blanket over her head. “Being forced to listen to that every day for three weeks was horrible,” she says. Estimates vary as to how many incarcerated women have suffered sexual abuse and domestic violence themselves, though many studies suggest a correlation. One 1999 survey of female prisoners in New York documented a rate of physical and sexual abuse as high as 94%. And yet, a struggle remains when states hand down charges and sentences. In 2021 alone, advocates in Washington state and Oregon introduced bills requiring courts to consider histories of domestic abuse, when relevant, as cause for lowering criminal penalties. These bills were modeled after similar legislation in California, Illinois and New York, which enacted its Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act in 2019. Both bills have thus far failed to pass, but they are part of a growing field of domestic violence law that, itself, is relatively new. “The fact of [domestic] violence has gone on for hundreds, thousands of years. But it’s only, I would say, since the 1960s and 1970s that there has been the recognition, understanding it as a serious legal harm,” says law professor Elizabeth M Schneider, an early leader in the field. Even when legal strides are made, it can take time for the public – and the justice system by extension – to catch up. “What we see in many areas,” Schneider explains, “is that even when the law changes, it can take the public a very, very long time to change.” Even though Bellesen had survived what she saw as an attempted rape, Jasper noticed that her body wasn’t treated like the crime scene it was. No photos were taken of her ripped clothing, her scratches, when officers first encountered her. And what evidence was collected was improperly handled, he says. “We only had what the police put in their report, which was geared to saying it was a homicide,” Jasper explains. Later, as he interviewed Sanders county investigator Brian Josephson as part of Bellesen’s defense, Jasper would discover that officers delayed taking Bellesen to a clinic certified in collecting forensic evidence for sexual assault. “Why did you not take her there?” Jasper asked him. Josephson replied: “There was not penetration, so I decided not to take her there.” There are moments in life when your world suddenly shifts. For Abbie Shelter executive director Hilary Shaw, one of those moments came late on 8 October 2020, when her phone rang with a call from Bellesen’s husband Corey. Those early hours were filled with shock and confusion. She knew little beyond the basics: that Bellesen had shot her abuser. “There wasn’t a clear path of escalation in Jake and Rachel’s relationship towards homicide, the way there typically is when someone’s still in that abusive relationship,” Shaw says. Only later did she discover that Glace’s violence had escalated – just with different partners. At the time of his death, he faced two charges from 2020 of felony “partner or family member assault” – one in nearby Mineral county and one in Sanders county itself. Still, Shaw never doubted that her colleague acted in self-defense. “It’s a great illustration of how there are some abusers that you just can’t ever be free of,” she says. That night, Shaw didn’t sleep. Instead, she drafted a list of who to call in the morning, laying the groundwork for a grassroots campaign in support of Bellesen. One of the first people she reached out to was Kelsen Young at the Montana Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. Whenever she’s asked to illustrate the hurdles of prosecuting domestic violence in Montana, Young points to one fact: it takes only two offenses for an animal abuser to qualify for a felony. For domestic abuse, it takes three. But the solution isn’t as simple as changing the laws. “I would love to be able to say that our criminal codes need enhancements and that the path to enhancing those is clear. It’s just not,” Young says. A bill designed to stiffen penalties for domestic violence might enter the Montana legislature — and come out with amendments that make existing punishments more lax, Young explains. The result is that her organization sometimes has to defeat its own legislation. Bellesen’s case was playing out against the backdrop of an election year, so Young had to be careful. Montana Republicans were on the eve of taking back the governor’s mansion for the first time in a decade. Young had to weigh whether her coalition’s support would turn Bellesen’s case into a political football. “Just the right amount of pressure might’ve made it worse” for Bellesen, Young says. The initial plan was a show of force at Bellesen’s bail hearing: bail was set at $200,000, far beyond what she and Corey could afford to pay. Bellesen’s colleagues at the Abbie Shelter had started a GoFundMe campaign to offset the costs. The next step was to show support, either by calling the prosecutor or attending the hearing itself. Young did receive pushback from members of her coalition, which includes advocates based in state and local government. They felt it was a conflict of interest to weigh in on the affairs of their colleagues in Sanders County. But Shaw was adamant they move forward: “It’s like: Who are we serving? Are we serving our partners in the judicial system who can’t handle being held accountable for their mistakes? Or are we serving survivors? When we try and advocate for survivors in a way that reflects poorly against prosecutors, it’s not okay for us to be shamed about that.” On 27 October 2020, Bellesen and Jasper appeared in front of Judge James Manley in an attempt to lower the bail. Due to the pandemic, the public was invited to attend remotely, via Zoom. Bail hearings are usually sparsely attended – a few dozen people on a good day – but this time, Jasper remembers the tally of Zoom participants kept climbing. “Judge Manley’s a guy that kinda has got a furrowed brow. And he just starts looking at me, shaking his head,” Jasper recalls, chuckling at the judge’s bewilderment. The number of participants that day peaked at over 100. By the evening, Bellesen was free from jail, her bail dropped to $20,000. It was a triumphant day – but not wholly so for Bellesen. What she remembers, more than anything, is the shame she experienced walking into the bail hearing. Even to be transported from the jail to the courthouse – neighboring buildings – Bellesen says she had to be shackled at the ankles and wrists, with a big leather belt across her stomach to secure her chains. With the addition of a face mask to protect against the spread of Covid, she felt like Hannibal Lecter. As she turned a corner to walk past the metal detector, she found herself face to face with her husband and kids. It was humiliating. “I had to walk past them dressed with those chains and everything. I wasn’t allowed to look at them,” she says softly. And then there was the courtroom itself. To her left, a TV was set up to display the Zoom participants. The screen was speckled with little squares, each representing a different viewer. It felt like the whole world was watching – and there she was, looking like a murderer. Bellesen had been aware that Glace had had other relationships since their marriage. But she never knew just how violent those relationships had been. She had no clue other women had been raped, too: “I thought it was just me.” But in the courtroom that day, Jasper called a witness Bellesen knew personally: Jasmine Sayler. She and Glace met in the winter of 2010, when Sayler was a single mother working at a casino. Within months, they were dating. At first, Glace seemed polite and caring. But then the insults and accusations started. And when Sayler became pregnant with the first of their two children in 2013, Glace turned physically violent. From there, the aggression only intensified. Sayler remembers one incident when her son was four: Glace had shoved her on a coffee table, with his forearm across her throat and his fist balled around a handful of her hair. His other arm was raised to punch when her son burst in, yelling: “No! Don’t hurt mommy!” She felt like a shell of the person she once was. Even her kids were affected. The slightest disturbance sent them into a state of terror. Once, a FedEx delivery man knocked on the door unexpectedly. “I found them in the kitchen with my son protecting my youngest daughter behind him with a butter knife.” Sayler pauses. “They were seven and five at the time.” Sayler says she stopped counting how many times she called the cops on Glace – how many times her neighbors called, her kids called. Each time, when the authorities arrived, Glace had either settled down or left the house. No action was taken. “The main thing people don’t get is that men, women and children are not just sitting there getting abused, doing nothing,” she says. “They also don’t understand that people do try to leave, but when you try to leave, that’s when it’s more dangerous.” Sayler was one of the two women who filed felony assault charges against Glace in the spring of 2020. But even after Sayler and her children enrolled in the Montana’s Address Confidentiality Program as part of a protection order to keep Glace away, Sayler still had to contend with his manipulations. She says he used family and friends to gather information about her whereabouts. Speaking to the court by telephone in Bellesen’s bail hearing, Sayler remembers being asked if she was afraid – not of Glace but of Bellesen. The question alone made her angry. Her answer was matter of fact: No, absolutely not. The evidence of Glace’s prior assaults was overwhelming. There was a trail of police reports stretching back to his time in Washington state. But what Jasper needed to understand were the specifics of Bellesen’s self-defense – specifics that could help diffuse any arguments that this was an “execution,” as one police detective termed it. After all, that same history of abuse could be argued as motive for premeditated murder. Jasper knew the burden was on the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Bellesen’s actions did not constitute self-defense. But he was also aware that, around the country, defendants with histories of sexual violence routinely end up behind bars, despite claims that they feared for their lives. They include high-profile cases like Cyntoia Brown, Nicole “Nikki” Addimando and Marissa Alexander. Studies indicate that juries can bring powerful misconceptions into the courtroom, including the idea that an abused partner can simply exit the relationship. A 2012 report found 62% of mock jurors felt battered women were convicted in self-defense cases because they should have found an alternative to homicide. Jasper had to find a way to make Bellesen’s fear real for the courtroom. In her panic, Bellesen had taken actions even Jasper struggled to understand: how did she manage to shoot Glace five times in the heat of the moment, when she only remembers squeezing the trigger twice? Why did she wait to dial 911? And why did she jettison Glace’s shirt and cellphone as she drove away? He had to illustrate the toll domestic violence could take on the psyche. Bellesen’s future depended on it. “If you do lose, you know that that innocent person’s likely going to spend the majority of their life in prison,” Jasper reminded himself. So he decided to assemble a “million-dollar defense”: a group of experts, all working pro bono, that he dubbed “the A-Team”. Jamie Merifield was among the firearms specialists, medical experts and legal advisors that Jasper assembled. A blonde woman with short curly hair, born and raised in Montana, Merifield formerly served 12 years as a police detective specializing in domestic and sexual violence. She also happened to have firsthand experience with sexual assault. Her abuser, she says, was a fellow detective, a good-time guy everyone seemed to like: quick with a smile, quick with a laugh. In 2007, she alleges he trapped her in her chair, opening her legs and placing his knee between them while “verbally berating” her. “When I was assaulted, I was terrified,” Merifield says. The distrust many sexual assault survivors feel toward the criminal justice system was something she grappled with herself, even as a member of the police force. “I didn’t say anything for six weeks.” What stood out to Merifield about Bellesen’s case was that she was never treated like a victim. Bellesen was put into handcuffs before the police even ascertained whether she needed medical attention. “Law enforcement is a power-and-control job, and so is domestic violence. The difference is, law enforcement should be on the right side of it,” Merifield says. While Merifield was tasked with reviewing police procedure, Sarah Baxter – a clinical and forensic psychologist – was brought on board to help unravel the dynamics of abuse. In a state where outsiders can sometimes be viewed with suspicion, Baxter takes pride in the fact that she’s from Twodot, a tiny agricultural town named for the dots a local cattleman used to mark his herds. Her goal was to articulate why Bellesen took actions others might struggle to understand. “Sometimes child sexual abuse survivors seem to really repeat that pattern and hook up with people who tend to be also abusive,” Baxter says. “They don’t read dangerous situations well. And rather than learn from their experiences, they seem bound to repeat them to some extent.” That mindset can be difficult for judges and juries to understand, Baxter adds. “That can turn into victim-blaming, in the sense of people asking, ‘Well, why was she drinking? Why did she go out to X, Y or Z location?’” Baxter also believes the burden of shared parenting played a large role in Bellesen’s decisions. “That’s a failing of our legal system, because we can’t figure out very effectively how to manage the co-parenting relationship when there’s been domestic violence,” she says. For Bellesen herself, the challenge was how to work through her trauma. Jasper feared that she might sound rehearsed on the witness stand if she delved too deeply into the events during therapy. “When you go to trial, you don’t want to have someone necessarily that has dealt with the issues [with a counselor]. It all needs to be raw,” Jasper explains. “It needs to be as real as it can be.” But that was difficult. “I really just tried not to think about it,” Bellesen says. She immersed herself in house projects: repainting her kitchen, baking, watching a lot of what she calls “stupid TV”. Sitting at her black Janome sewing machine, she threw herself into quilting for the first time in years, piecing together tiny scraps of fabric into a king-size blanket. Her everyday routines had been upended. Before, she and Corey used to eat brunch in a little café each weekend, the kind of place where the wait staff knew your name. But the events of October 2020 put a stop to that. “I don’t think we’ve been back to that place twice since October,” Corey says. The first time they did attempt to go out, for a meal at Famous Dave’s BBQ, Rachel’s face was plastered on the front cover of the local newspaper. Copies were available for guests to read at the entrance of the restaurant. “Sure as shit, it was sitting right there as we walked in,” Corey recalls. As his wife sat down at a table, clearly shaken, Corey excused himself. He walked over to the stack of newspapers and turned them upside down. “I don’t think there was a day we could go by without being reminded of it,” he says. “We constantly lived with the fact that, if [the trial] goes wrong, this could be the end.” The Bellesens describe themselves as an introverted family, and the media attention and the pressure of the case made them retreat even further. Articles rehashed Bellesen’s history with addiction and suicide, plunging her into anxiety and shame. Knowing her friends and colleagues at the Abbie Shelter could be called as potential witnesses, Bellesen couldn’t reach out to them. “I was cut out of the very service that my agency provides,” she says. Her children were supportive, but she was keenly aware that they were grieving too – and that she was the person who killed their father. She offered them comfort as best as she could, but her past threatened to overwhelm her. “Not only did it all just come rushing back out of nowhere – all of the memories are just as vivid as if those things had just happened – but the whole world knows about it now,” Bellesen says. Glace’s voice kept echoing in her mind: “No one’s going to believe you.” Bellesen desperately wanted to stay in bed until the whole ordeal was over. But as the months passed and the winter snows started to melt, the defense team proposed a new tactic: reenacting the afternoon of 8 October on the very site where it happened. “I was horrified. I did not want to do that,” Bellesen says, furrowing her brow at the thought. By that point, she was working with A&amp;E on a TV documentary about her case. The legal team would be recording the reenactment for her defense, while the A&amp;E crew would capture it for TV. The day of the reenactment, Bellesen had three sets of microphone wires snaking up her shirt. All eyes were on her. She plucked up her courage by reminding herself this was a chance to tell her story: If the media was going to talk about her anyway, she might as well have her say. One moment in particular caught her off-guard. She looked up to see the crime-scene dummy in the same position Glace was lying in after he was shot. “Everything was exactly the same as in that moment,” Bellesen says. “It all came flooding back. Like I got hit by a semi-truck.” Baxter caught sight of Bellesen as she doubled over. “I thought she was going to vomit, but she was just gasping for breath.” But despite the stress involved, the defense team hoped the reenactment would help bolster their evidence – and convince Montana assistant attorney general Chris McConnell to dismiss the case. In April, the prosecution seemingly relented. It submitted a motion to dismiss the case, citing the difficulty it faced in meeting the high burden of proof. But in the final paragraph, the prosecution included an ominous note: it hoped to “make a determination at a later date” whether to refile the case. Jasper says that language infuriated him. “I don’t think I’ve been that pissed in my life ever. When I get a dismissal, I should be doing a dance,” he says. The possibility that Bellesen could be recharged left his client vulnerable. Chances were high that she wouldn’t have the same resources in the future as she did with Jasper. And because there is no statute of limitations for deliberate homicide charges, the case would hang over her head for the rest of her life. “It frustrated the shit out of me,” Jasper says, swearing liberally at the thought of it. His voice rising, he emphasizes that self-defense is perfectly legal: “There’s nothing wrong with the state patting someone on the back and saying, ‘You know what? You did follow the law. And that’s why it’s here. It’s here to protect you.’” For Jasper, the evidence was clear. “She didn’t get away with murder. She saved herself from being murdered.” Bellesen also found herself filled with rage. “It was a slap in the face,” she says. She decided then and there that she would risk trial rather than living with the possibility of criminal charges looming over her. She was done staying silent. Isaac Glace had to psych himself up to go to court on 25 May. He didn’t know if the hearing would be another step in sending his mother behind bars – or if it would result in her freedom. He felt so nervous, he forgot to take his sunglasses off as he walked into district court judge Amy Eddy’s courtroom. Lance Jasper and his mother were already seated; so too were supporters and experts ready to testify. But a counter-protest had also assembled: about 10 individuals wearing shirts printed with the slogan “Justice for Jake.” From the get-go, Bellesen and her supporters were nervous. They were pushing for what seemed to be the impossible: a dismissal with prejudice, one that would prevent prosecutors from ever pursuing the case again. After hearing arguments from prosecution and defense attorneys, Judge Eddy announced she was prepared to issue a decision immediately. Citing Bellesen’s constitutional rights and a lack of substantive outstanding evidence, she announced the case was indeed dismissed – with prejudice. Rachel Bellesen threw her head back in relief. “I think I had been holding my breath while she was talking. And then when she said that, it was like all the air just rushed into my body,” she says. “It was indescribable really – maybe the exact opposite of the way it felt when that first judge said ‘punishable by death.’” Jasper himself had been feeling the ups and downs of the court acutely: “At first you think you’re winning. Then you’re losing, winning, losing.” When he sensed the judge was about to make her final pronouncement, he did something he doesn’t ordinarily do: He glanced at his client’s face. “So I turn, and I look at her. And there was a moment there I’ll never forget – of seeing that weight lifted and that faith coming back to her, in a way that I just can’t describe.” The decision came as such a surprise that Isaac didn’t even realize his mother had won until he started to hear clapping. A wave of relief rushed over him, as if hope itself had been restored to his life. “There gets to be a tomorrow,” he remembers thinking. “There gets to be a future.” Isaac believes his mother’s legal victory sends a message: “If it can happen in small-town, rural Montana, despite the odds, it can happen anywhere.” He is now in college, studying criminology. He aims to help families like his. When Bellesen woke up the morning after the verdict, she didn’t feel the elation she expected. Instead, she was swallowed by depression. “I couldn’t figure out why I was feeling that way,” she says. “I’m like, ‘The best possible outcome that one could expect happened. I got what we fought so hard for. Why am I not happier?’” In ways big and small, the people around her were contending with similar feelings. For Abbie Shelter executive director Hilary Shaw, it was a quote published in the Associated Press that got under her skin. A “Justice for Jake” supporter had told the reporter, “She walked out of there after she killed my best friend because she knew the right people, she knew what to say, she knew what she was doing.” Those words cut deep. “When Jake’s friend made that comment of ‘she knew all the right people,’ that was painful for me,” Shaw says. “Not that I thought he was right, that Rachel unjustly or unethically utilized her connections to get an unjust outcome. But that, because Rachel is connected to all the right people, she did receive more support than most survivors would. And as service providers, that is painful for us to admit.” Corey Bellesen was likewise grappling with the fury he felt reading reactions on social media – comments along the lines of: “Money can buy you freedom.” He understood, to a degree, where those reactions stemmed from. “You’re supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. But in reality, if you don’t have the means to prove your innocence, you’re guilty,” he says. He estimates his family’s out-of-pocket expenses ranged from $30,000 to $40,000, just for travel, medical bills, jailhouse phone calls and costs like the alcohol monitoring bracelet Bellesen was forced to wear. His nails dig into his crossed arms as he recalls how he installed a camera in his truck at one point, fearing he was being tailed by the police in Sanders county. If Jasper had not offered legal services for free, he believes his wife would be in prison. “Do I think if this was in the hands of the public defender that we would have had such a favorable outcome? Absolutely not.” Bellesen herself echoes those concerns. She sees factors like race and class weighing heavily in her case, paving the way for a successful outcome. “If you’re a victim of abuse, you probably struggle with substance abuse and chronic, untreated mental illness,” she says. “And if you do have to use lethal self-defense, odds are you’re probably not going to be the right color. You’re probably not going to be someone with enough money. You’re not going to be sober enough.” In the months since Judge Eddy’s decision, Bellesen and her family have endeavored to move on from last year’s events. In June, Bellesen’s Land Rover was released from the police impound. After cleaning away the crime scene tape, Corey quickly sold it. He didn’t want his wife to see it again. Bellesen herself was able to return to work at the Abbie Shelter in a new role: community advocate. She lights up just talking about it. Ever the crafter, she already plans to paint a landscape onto the wall of her new office: a window onto the world that’s forever sunny. When asked about whether she feared lingering suspicions in the community – or from the “Justice for Jake” crowd – Bellesen instead expresses sympathy. “Abusers are manipulators, the very best of the kind, and they don’t just manipulate their partners. They also manipulate everyone they’re around,” she says. Glace’s supporters may not know it, she adds, but they’re victims too: “Just a different kind of victim. They’ve been completely duped.” Still, Bellesen struggles to move forward as she seeks to redefine her life without the violence that shaped her. “All the way up until the day of the hearing really, I had spent all of my life just fighting against one abuse after another, one horrifying event after another,” she says. “When you go through things like that over and over and over and over again, it just becomes part of who you are. It’s written into your narrative, your internal belief system about yourself.” Her chin quivers. “I did not know how to live in a life where those things didn’t exist anymore.” Those feelings are beginning to subside, though the nightmares about Glace endure. Still, it pains her to see the people she cares about wrestling with the fallout of Glace’s death. At least one is battling mental health and substance abuse issues. On 8 October 2020, after Bellesen shot her abuser, she remembers thinking, “It couldn’t get any worse than this.” But now she says it can – and it has. “I can honestly say that I would rather go through October 8th every day for the rest of my life” than watch her loved ones suffer, she says quietly. Since her legal victory, well-wishers have congratulated her. “I bet you’re glad to have your life go back to normal,” they offer. But Bellesen knows life doesn’t go back to normal after domestic assault. There is no normal to go back to. The only thing she can think to do now is discover who she might be without violence in her life – and go forward from there. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

          "bodyText": "With that, we’ll end our live coverage for today. Here’s a recap of today’s major news developments: Western Australia will ease its border rules from 5 February. Both international and domestic travellers will be able to enter the state without quarantining from that date, by which point it is expected to have vaccinated 90% of its population over 12 with two doses. All travellers will need to be vaccinated, with a very small weekly cap of hotel quarantine spots for unvaccinated international arrivals. Thousands of Queenslanders will be finally enjoying dinner in their own homes on Monday after spending months trapped across the border in New South Wales. The border between the two states reopened just after midnight Queensland time. Scott Morrison welcomed the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to Canberra on Monday, with the leaders heralding closer defence ties as they witnessed the signing of a previously announced $1bn military equipment contract with a South Korean firm. Australia’s international border will open to more travellers on Wednesday, as the prime minister confirmed that his government would end the “pause” triggered by the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. Covid-19 infections are continuing to grow, with Victoria reporting 1,290 new cases and two deaths, while NSW recorded 536 new cases, amid increasing numbers of the Omicron variant. Have a great evening. We’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. The auditor general has just published the annual report on major defence acquisitions. It’s basically a yearly stocktake on where major projects are tracking, based on information supplied by the Department of Defence. This is the report for the 2020-21 financial year, so it is looking backwards. Grant Hehir, the auditor general, found nothing that caused him to believe any problems with the accuracy of the information supplied by Defence as part of the process. But the voluminous report notes: “Defence’s assessment indicates that some elements of capability to be delivered by projects may be ‘under threat’, but the risk is assessed as ‘manageable’.” The report said the four project offices “experiencing challenges with expected capability delivery” are the Joint Strike Fighter, MRH90 helicopters, Overlander medium/heavy vehicles, and Battlespace communications systems (land) 2B. The second project listed there – MRH90 helicopters – is also known as the Taipan. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, announced last Friday a plan to acquire up to 40 Black Hawk helicopters in order to retire the MRH90 early. Rest assured, readers, we will be going through this report in greater detail in the coming days. Paul Mercurio, the actor and dancer known for his role in Strictly Ballroom, has been preselected as the Labor candidate for the Victorian state seat of Hastings. Premier Mark McGowan has said Western Australia will not reopen its borders earlier than 5 February even if it achieves 90% double-dose vaccination coverage before that date. He said this is because businesses need to prepare for a specific date and have certainty things won’t change. Western Australia’s quarantine cap for unvaccinated international arrivals could be limited to fewer than 100 people per week. Mark McGowan said an exact number had not yet been determined, but that “it may be down at 100 or perhaps less per week”. By contrast, New South Wales’ unvaccinated arrival cap is 210 per week, while Victoria’s is 250. As McGowan explained earlier, WA will only be allowing a small number of unvaccinated travellers arriving from overseas, and they will have to go through 14 days of hotel quarantine. Domestic arrivals will need to be double-dose vaccinated. Asked if he was considering extending the option of hotel quarantine for unvaccinated domestic travellers, McGowan said: “Not at this point in time, no.” McGowan explains that his strict stance on maintaining rules for unvaccinated people and poorly vaccinated regions after 5 February is because of vulnerable people in the state. Specifically, he mentions older and Indigenous residents. “We’re just trying to save their lives. It will find the unvaccinated. You might live in the desert but it can still find you.” Premier Mark McGowan was asked if further spread of the Omicron variant in other states could delay Western Australia’s border reopening date of 5 February. McGowan didn’t go as far as ruling it out, but said it was very unlikely. “Barring some unforeseen emergency or catastrophe which we can’t predict. But that’s the nature of Covid.” He said “it’s a very safe bet” that the border will reopen on 5 February. Western Australia’s health minister Roger Cook has urged residents in his state to use the time between now and 5 February – when the state will reopen its borders – to get vaccinated. Cook addressed the fact that an already stretched health system in the state was predicted to buckle if Covid spread when its vaccination rate was low. He said nearly 500 doctors and 350 graduate doctors have joined the system this year. Cook said: Make every day count, every day must be counted between now and 5 February. We have the precious gift of time to continue to get as many people vaccinated as possible. We need to make the most of this opportunity, Make no mistake about it, Covid is coming into our state. Western Australians are going to be in for a real shock from 5 February. We are going to be living with Covid-19. But there is no easy way of living with the worst virus in 100 years. McGowan is warning that there could still be travel restrictions for certain remote communities because of lower vaccination rates. McGowan said “some regions have dramatically lower vaccination rates”, flagging the Pilbara, Goldfields and the Kimberley specifically. “These are the only regions that currently have a first dose rate below 80%,” McGowan said. He said the Pilbara is of most concern, with a double -dose vaccination rate of just 46.1%. “If individual regions do not get their vaccination rates up, then further measures will be needed to protect the community.” Mark McGowan is now explaining how Western Australia’s new border rules will work when they come into effect from 5 February. International arrivals will still be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure and undertake a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival in Perth, as well as six days after arriving. If the traveller is double vaccinated, there will be no quarantine requirement. For those who are not double vaccinated or have received a vaccine that is not recognised in Australia, they will have to go into a hotel or dedicated quarantine facility when it opens. McGowan said the cap of quarantine places for unvaccinated travellers will be smaller than WA’s current cap for all arrivals. Domestic arrivals must be double vaccinated unless they have a valid exemption. Domestic travellers will still be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure and undertake a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival in Perth If a traveller’s stay in WA is for five days or less, they will only be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure, and won’t need to get another test within 48 hours of landing. Premier Mark McGowan has announced that Western Australia’s hard border will ease on 5 February. It will take effect from 12:01am on that day, a Saturday. McGowan explained that he was making the announcement because WA had on Monday just reached 80% double dose vaccination coverage of residents 12 and over. By 5 February, McGowan said he expects the state to have reached 90% coverage. McGowan said: Even though Western Australians have lived a normal life inside our Covid free bubble, nearly 2 million people have done the right thing and gotten vaccinated. We followed a different model to the others. And it’s worked. I want to acknowledge each and every Western Australian for everything they’ve done over the past two years. Western Australia’s current zero Covid environment and high vaccination rate will help deliver the softest landing to minimise the impact of the virus. When it enters our state, McGowan’s announcement has defied earlier speculation on Monday that the state would ease its border rules from late January. Australia’s international border will open to more travellers on Wednesday, as the prime minister confirmed that his government would end the “pause” triggered by the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. Scott Morrison, welcoming the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to Canberra on Monday, said Australia would open to travellers from South Korea and Japan and also international students and skilled workers more broadly. While pandemic recovery was on the agenda for the talks at Parliament House, the leaders also heralded closer defence ties as they witnessed the signing of a previously announced $1bn military equipment contract with a South Korean firm. Moon said he respected the Australian government’s “sovereign” decision to strike the Aukus deal with the US and the UK – an arrangement that China has claimed poses a threat to regional stability, amid worsening tensions between Beijing and Canberra. But the South Korean leader also voiced a desire to maintain a harmonious relationship with China, which he said was important to securing North Korea’s denuclearisation. He ruled out joining Australia, the US and other countries in a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

AccuWeather forecasts clear skies for Melbourne and Hobart on 25 December, while clouds are expected to linger across the rest of the country into the evening. Ahead of the release on Saturday of the Bureau of Meteorology’s official forecast for the week of Christmas, AccuWeather has predicted possible showers in Queensland and the Northern Territory on Christmas Day, with temperatures hitting the high 20s in most major cities. Here is the run down for every capital city: We’re expecting Mark McGowan to outline Western Australia’s border reopening date at 2pm WA time/5pm eastern daylight time. We’ll bring you that update here as it happens. Meanwhile in Victoria, the Australian Workers Union has raised concerns about the preselection process for the 2022 election amid ongoing factional turmoil in the state arising from the exit of party powerbroker Adem Somyurek. AWU branch secretary Ben Davis has written to state secretary Chris Ford calling for a halt to the preselection process that is being run by the national executive, alleging irregularities that are “potentially fraudulent”. Davis says that a number of party members have alleged that nomination forms have been filled out before a candidate has been selected, which he says is “potentially creating a false document pursuant to the Crimes Act. “As a member of the Interim Governance Committee (IGC) I hereby request that nomination forms for all contested ballots be provided to me, and if you see fit to the other members of the IGC also, before any ballots of national Executive are held,” the letter says. “Delaying the ballots in the contested seats should also occur until the party can conduct an appropriate investigation.” So far, seven sitting Labor MPs have been targeted as a result of the factional in-fighting, with one of these, upper house MP Cesar Melhem, describing the situation as “total bloodletting”. Millions of tourism dollars are expected to be injected into the Queensland economy after the state reopened its borders to fully vaccinated visitors, reports AAP. Tens of thousands of people began flooding into Queensland on Monday following the decision to drop entry and quarantine restrictions at 1am for fully jabbed travellers after hitting the 80% double vaccination target. The arrival of interstate travellers in time for the festive season is a much-needed boost for tourism, particularly in the state’s far north. Tourism Tropical North Queensland chief executive Mark Olsen said the region had been losing millions of dollars a day since early 2020. He told Nine: It’s been a really tough 21 months for the (far north) tourism industry. One third of our visitors are normally international ... and we haven’t seen them since February 2020 ... Both NSW and Victorian visitors put a million a day each into this economy so we have really been looking forward to having them back. Olsen said more than 9,000 tourism jobs in the far north had been lost since early 2020 but was confident it could bounce back after Monday’s reopening. You can read more about Queensland’s border rules easing from today in this article, filed by Jennifer King in Tweed Heads. There are 16 new cases of Covid-19 in the Northern Territory, with the government considering ramping up Covid rules for some communities. Of the new cases announced on Monday, 14 are from East Katherine, where authorities had been doing a testing “blitz”. A chief health officer directive will be issued from today requiring anyone in the NT who has been in Katherine recently to get tested. Nicole Manison, deputy chief minister of the NT, has also revealed there were only five Covid tests conducted in Tennant Creek – a town of about 5,000 – on Sunday despite positive wastewater detections of Covid. She said “frankly, that is not good enough”. Manison said it was “likely” the government would escalate Covid rules and introduce “lockouts” – where unvaccinated people are placed in lockdown – in some regional communities in the territory in coming days. South Australian premier Steven Marshall has said there are 13 new Covid-19 cases in his state for the reporting period announced on Monday. He said the majority of the cases are believed to be the Delta variant. There have so far been two confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in SA. There has been a bit more sun across New South Wales in recent days, prompting concern for people swimming in hazardous conditions at beaches in the state. Over the weekend, Surf Life Saving NSW volunteers performed more than 60 rescues, with two people requiring resuscitation. Sadly, a middle-aged man was unable to be revived at Coffs Harbour on Saturday. He was pulled from the water about 300m north of the patrol flags, semi-conscious and still breathing. NSW Ambulance inspector Charnan Kurth said “drownings can occur in seconds – we have to be constantly looking out for each other”. In the UK, Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccinations, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to stem an incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. The army will be deployed across the country to help rapidly accelerate the vaccine program and GPs will be told to cancel appointments to dedicate resources to offering vaccines to every UK adult by the end of December. In a televised address to the nation on Sunday night, the prime minister said he was “afraid we are now facing an emergency in our battle with the new variant, Omicron, and we must urgently reinforce our wall of vaccine protection to keep our friends and loved ones safe”. Read more: The RSPCA has teamed up with two other leading animal welfare organisations to lobby both clothing brands and sheep farmers to move away from mulesing sheep. RSPCA Australia, Four Paws and Humane Society International say they will work with the wool industry to encourage the breeding of sheep that do not require mulesing. Mulesing is the process of removing folds of skin from the tail area of a sheep. It’s done to reduce flystrike and is mainly practised on sheep that have folds of skin, like merinos. It used to be the industry standard in Australia, where flystrike can be a deadly problem, but over the past two decades many wool producers have focused on breeding sheep that do not require mulesing. Some farming organisations are also changing their standards to discourage mulesing. The Victorian Farmers Federation lobbied for regulations requiring the mandatory use of pain relief when mulesing sheep, which came into effect last year. But the Australian Superfine Wool Growers Association remains in support of the practice. Four Paws’s wool expert, Rebecca Picallo Gil, said more than 3,000 Australian woolgrowers had already switched to no-mules flocks. Humane Society international’s Georgie Dolphin said: With the advanced genetics available today, it is unacceptable to continue to breed wrinkly sheep that are prone to flystrike. Our organisations want to see an end to mulesing within the next decade, a target that is easily achievable. One of the most tangible announcements from the joint presser was Scott Morrison confirming the international borders would reopen as planned this Wednesday. We reported last week this was likely, but a bunch of international students and other travellers have been anxiously messaging Guardian Australia over the weekend hoping for some certainty. This should come as a relief to them. First, a quick recap: the government announced in late November it was delaying the plan to reopen Australia to international skilled and student cohorts, as well as humanitarian, working, holidaymaker and provisional family visa holders, from 1 December until 15 December. That “pause” also included reopening to travellers from Japan and South Korea. It was to gather more information about the Omicron variant. As it stood, the Australian border was “already closed to travellers except fully vaccinated Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family, as well as fully vaccinated green lane travellers from New Zealand and Singapore and limited exemptions”, per the government release at the time. All arrivals to Australia also require a negative PCR test and to complete Australian traveller declaration forms detailing their vaccination status and confirming requirements to comply with state and territory public health requirements. While the government has been signalling it wanted to get on with reopening, these things are always subject to change, based on latest advice about Omicron – so many travellers were worried about whether their plans would be disrupted once again. But Morrison, standing next to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, told reporters: We also have tourism and education links that run deep – some 20,000 Korean students come and study in Australia – and we are looking forward to welcoming them back as we are the many tourists and business travellers and skilled migrants. And on Wednesday of this week, we will move again forward. The borders will be reopened both to Korea and to Japan and for skilled migration and for students as we conclude the pause that we announced several weeks ago. Morrison praised the high level of vaccination in both countries, adding: I know the more than 123,000 Australians of Korean ancestry will be looking forward to seeing their friends, their family and them being able to join together and that has been made possible because of the outstanding achievements in Korea in managing Covid and I congratulate the president on their achievements.

With that, I shall hand you over to the amazing Elias Visontay, who will bring all the news for the rest of the afternoon. In other news, John Gerrard has now officially taken up his position as the new Queensland chief health officer after Jennette Young moves on and up to the governor role. A small word of caution on the defence announcement out of the Scott Morrison/Moon Jae-in joint presser. The Morrison government has confirmed that a $1bn defence contract for new Self-Propelled Howitzers for the Australian Army has been awarded to Hanwha Defense Australia. From Morrison’s release: “Based in Greater Geelong, the contract will procure Self-Propelled Howitzers and Armoured Ammunition Resupply Vehicles, under the LAND 8116 Phase 1 project. The government committed to this project in May 2019.” The then defence minister, Linda Reynolds, announced in September last year that Hanwha Defence Australia had been chosen to build 30 self-propelled howitzers for the ADF, to be built in the Geelong region, as you can see from this story at the time. The contract signing was witnessed by Morrison and Moon before their joint press conference in parliament house in Canberra this morning. In today’s release, the government says the initial contract “covers 30 Self-Propelled Howitzers, 15 Armoured Ammunition Resupply Vehicles, and weapon locating radars that help find enemy artillery, collectively referred to as the Huntsman family of vehicles”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, said: “The prime ability of the new vehicles is to fire and move quickly, avoiding enemy counter-attack. This project will mean a significant increase in the level of firepower and security for Australian artillery capability.” A group of male koalas from Victoria’s Strzelecki Ranges will be brought to Adelaide as part of a new breeding program aimed at securing the survival of the species. The koalas are expected to arrive in coming weeks to join a group of disease-free male and female koalas at the Cleland Wildlife Park in the Adelaide Hills. The Cleland population, including some koalas rescued from the 2020 Kangaroo Island bushfires, is considered to be the only sanctuary-managed colony free from both chlamydia and koala retrovirus in Australia. Environment minister David Speirs says the transfer of the koalas is part of a bold conservation initiative that will help secure the survival of the species. Catastrophic events like last year’s bushfires across Australia significantly reduced koala numbers... That’s why this unique breeding program, which will include the addition of the Strzelecki koalas, will help to safeguard populations and provide opportunities for research as a priority for the species’ long-term survival. The Victorian koalas are being taken from a private forest plantation after assurances from wildlife authorities their removal was in the interests of conservation. Koala Life, an independent not-for-profit organisation set up for the conservation and research of koala diseases, said the relocation would increase the number of disease-free genetically diverse animals, which would ultimately help to protect the species from future challenges. Chief executive Chris Daniels: It’s also an important step in our scientific breeding program and significantly assists our research into the species... These koalas will form part of a breeding program that can support the long-term conservation of the species, particularly in response to natural disasters. Thousands of Queenslanders will be enjoying dinner in their own homes on Monday at last after spending months trapped across the border in New South Wales. The border between the two states reopened at 1am Queensland time. Queensland’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, estimated that 50,000 vehicles would be crossing in the early hours of Monday morning, with long delays expected. All vehicles were required to present a border pass that was only made available to those travelling from hotspots one hour before the border opened, leaving many already anxious travellers more worried about getting home. You can read the full report below: On the day borders reopen, Queensland has recorded one new locally acquired case, as well as two overseas-acquired cases and seven interstate-acquired cases, detected in hotel quarantine. Moon’s response, to paraphrase, was basically: “Dude, we have a rogue nation with a bunch of nukes right above us that we are technically still at war with - yeah we are going to try and be friends with as many people as possible, mate.” Moon: With regard to the question on the relationship with China, that was your question: Korea and Australia uphold the same values and our position in terms of the geopolitical situation, we are like-minded. First of all, in terms of our alliance with the US, it’s the basis of our diplomacy as well as security affairs and in terms of the economic relationship, of course, the relationship with China is important. However, Korea has another factor to take into account and that has to do with the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and also denuclearisation of DPRK. We need the constructive efforts of China to enable the denuclearisation of [the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea]. Therefore, Korea is focused on the steadfast alliance with the US and also with China; we want a harmonised relationship. And we want to maintain such a relationship and we will be putting in the efforts to make this happen. And, of course, with regard to the relationship with China, there may be certain conflicts and there may be some issues of competition. However, if you look at climate change and the supply chain issue, and also in terms of pandemic and infectious diseases, there are global challenges and these are domains where we do need cooperation and collaboration. Morrison: I have absolutely no doubt that our only ambition between Australia and Korea is to ensure a peaceful and safe and free and open Indo-Pacific. Where all nations in the region can trade openly and well and positively, free from any coercion and have their own choices about how they move forward. Reporter: President Moon, Australia, like South Korea, has faced billions of dollars in Chinese trade sanctions as punishment for domestic policy decisions. How should countries respond to Chinese economic coercion? And to Scott Morrison: how can Australia and Korea work together to counter Chinese economic coercion? Morrison jumped in to answer first (perhaps as the question was being translated?). I might start - the question has come from the Australian side. I would say this. Australia and Korea are like-minded liberal democracies and we work together to ensure there are economic choices in the region. There is a strengthening of our capabilities both from defence security point of view and not just in the traditional, but also in the new areas of cyber and new technologies that occurs in a security space, but also occurs in an economic space. The fact that we’re working together on critical minerals supply chains and rare earths, these are the critical minerals and rare earths that power and support a new energy economy. And so ensuring that there are trusted supply chains between like-minded countries is incredibly important for our region. It brings stability, it brings balance. Moon says that this trip has nothing to do with China and Morrison immediately added: When you are engaging with other countries in these types of contracts, it is an objective to be doing so with those countries who are like-minded in their outlook, and I think between Korea and Australia we share a very similar view and a similar aspiration for the Indo-Pacific. Moon Jae-in has been asked by reporters if visiting Australia just days after the government decided on a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics was likely to upset South Korea’s relationship with China (which is always fairly strained anyway, given the issue of North Korea). He was also asked if South Korea intend to issue a similar boycott. Moon: With regards to the Beijing Olympics on the diplomatic boycott, we have not received a request from any other country, including the United States, to participate in the diplomatic boycott. We are not considering a boycott measure. With regards to AUKUS, we respect the decision made by the sovereign state, Australia, and this is the decision made by Australia as a sovereign nation and we respect that. And Australia is making efforts for peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region and within the region. Australia does not desire dispute arising in the region and, for peace, we will continue to cooperate with Australia. And the state visit I make at this time has nothing to do with our position over China and we believe that between Korea and Australia it is very important that we cooperate over the core minerals and for the hydrogen economy and for the low-carbon emissions technology. Moon: Third, we agree to strengthen supply chain cooperation. Australia, the world’s richest country in mineral resources, and Korea, a major producer of batteries and electric vehicles, play an important role in the global supply chain. Our two countries share the view that establishing a stable mineral supply chain is important not only for the two countries but also for the global economy, and we have signed the MoU on cooperation in the critical mineral supply chain. We will systematically cooperate throughout the entire resource development cycle including mineral exploration, development, production and mining disaster management, further strengthening human exchange and technical cooperation. Today, the two countries have set a new milestone in cooperation based on the solid friendship and trust we have built over the past 60 years. We will, together, prepare for a new era. South Korea and Australia are also apparently great space buddies now! Moon: Second, we have agreed to nurture our key future industries together. The two countries declared to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and are focusing on a transition to a low-carbon economy. Today, the prime minister and I signed the plan for low- and zero-emissions technology partnership by broadening the ecofriendly technologies such as hydrogen economy, solar power and carbon capture mechanisms. We will turn it into an opportunity to create new jobs and industries. We have also decided to strengthen space cooperation. Australia established a space agency in 2018 and is spurring efforts to foster its space industry. Korea has also set a new turning point for space development, with the launch of the new rocket this year. I hope that the MoU regarding space cooperation will enhance exchange and foster cooperation in fields from space exploration in the launch vehicle industry to satellite navigation, and I hope the agreement becomes a stepping stone for the two countries. If you were wondering whether this is all a thinly veiled front to send a message to China about who really has power in the Indo-Pacific, here is Moon: The prime minister actively supported the Korean people and the peace process and two countries continue working to the towards the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, and also peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Moon is now delivering his speech in Korean. Luckily I’m fluent! (I’m not, I shall be using the ABC translation.) Your excellency, prime minister Morrison, thank you very much for the warm hospitality. You have invited me as Australia’s first [leader] since the Covid-19 outbreak and today our two countries have formed a close cooperative relationship. I think this will be a great gift for the people of two countries to celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties ... Today the prime minister and I advanced our bilateral relations and elevated to a comprehensive Australian partnership. Together our two countries will leap forward as global leaders and look forward to moving towards a future of shared prosperity. First, we agree to strengthen ... strategic cooperation for fostering regional prosperity. Morrison: Australia and Korea have some of the highest vaccination rates double-dose of anywhere in the world, and so that is enabling our economies to open up and we see that today here in Australia as the borders come tumbling down there in - between Queensland and the rest of the country - and Australians are being reunited because of their effort to get vaccinated and to see families reunited, to see Australians coming together as we get to the end of this year. This is encouraging, but I know the more than 123,000 Australians of Korean ancestry will be looking forward to seeing their friends, their family and them being able to join together. This has been made possible because of the outstanding achievements in Korea in managing Covid and I congratulate the president on their achievements. We look to proceeding with the many agreements that we have announced today, whether in defence, defence materiel, the memorandum of understanding to establish an implementation plan for Australia and Korea’s low zero-emissions technology partnership that the president and I agreed we would proceed with when we met together in the UK at Carbis Bay at the G7. Here is Daniel Hurst with a bit more information on those deals that were signed by Morrison and Moon this morning. Morrison: Today, as always, our economies complement each other. We are important trading partners and we welcome the prospect of Korea joining the CPTPP [comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership] and we look forward - should they wish to take that decision and step - we look forward to being an encouraging partner. The CTPPP sets a high bar for countries that understand the importance of the rule of law in trade that deals with its partners fairly and consistently in a way that promotes free trade and Korea has already achieved those marks, not only in their relationship with Australia, but with the many trading partners with whom they have trusted relationships. This investment goes in both directions and we look forward to that continuing. We’re also important security partners as we have just witnessed with the howitzer contract, a billion-dollar armoured vehicle centre for excellence to be located in the Geelong region. Here is Morrison speaking, and yes, he did get the name of the Korean War wrong ... while speaking to the president of Korea. It’s a great honour to have you here in Australia in what is your first ever trip to Australia along with first lady Kim. As guest of our government on this important state visit, the first of these we have had since the outbreak of Covid ... As you know, the friendship between your nations is deep and historic. From Kapyong to here we are now in Canberra. Our ties were forged during the Vietnam - during the Korean - War. Australia was the second nation after the United States to come to Korea’s aid in those very dark days. More than 17,000 Australians fought to defend your freedom and, indeed, the freedom of all liberal democracy peace-loving countries in these conflicts. Australia and South Korea have struck a $1bn defence deal as leaders Scott Morrison and Moon Jae-in hold formal talks in Canberra, reports Paul Osborne from AAP. The South Korean president and first lady Kim Jung-sook were welcomed to Parliament House, where they signed the official visitors book, by the prime minister on Monday. Australia and South Korea will upgrade their ties to “comprehensive strategic partnership” status during the visit. The $1bn deal - under which Korean defence company Hanwha will provide 30 self-propelled howitzer artillery weapons, 15 ammunition supply vehicles and radars to detect enemy artillery - is the largest defence contract struck between Australia and an Asian nation. The new vehicles will be able to quickly fire and move to avoid enemy counterattacks. Defence minister Peter Dutton touted the deal as a boost for Australian firepower and security in the Indo-Pacific. [It] is one of several projects that will modernise the Australian Army, ensuring it continues to maintain a capability advantage now, and into the future... We are committed to keeping our region safe while protecting our interests in a rapidly changing global environment. The deal is expected to create at least 300 jobs in the Greater Geelong region, where the manufacturing facility will be based. Construction is due to start in 2022. Morrison said the relationship continued to grow, underpinned by trade, shared values, common regional strategic interests and a commitment to an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. Our comprehensive strategic partnership with the Republic of Korea is underpinned by our joint commitment to defence and security cooperation. This year mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. Moon is the first international leader to visit Australia since borders reopened. So Moon and Morrison are signing some partnerships and deal first, and I assume will speak after that. We are standing by for Scott Morrison and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to give a joint address from Parliament House in Canberra. A flood warning and total fire ban in the same state on the same day has pretty big “post-apocalyptic” energy, doesn’t it? It’s time to have a chat about what’s going on at The Sydney Morning Herald. Overnight, the newspaper posted an article confirming that newly appointed editor, Bevan Shields, had called longtime opinion columnist Elizabeth Farrelly and ended her arrangement with the paper after she “failed to disclose that she had registered as a candidate for the Labor party in the Strathfield local government elections when she wrote a piece criticising Liberal and independent councillors in the electorate”. The writer has now issued a statement on the situation via a Facebook post, stating that it was “an oversight on my part” not to disclose her registration, but says she never actually intended to run for local government. Simply to keep my options open, I registered my interest online. I was not preselected for the Labor federal candidate, nor for the Labor council ticket, so I did not run in the recent council election. I was involved with the Labor campaign only insofar as I agreed to have a placard on the front lawn for a couple of weeks and to hand out on polling day for 2 hours. This was done in thanks for the warm welcome I received to the neighbourhood. The ABC is reporting this morning that the Victorian Greens have referred the government-owned logging agency VicForests to the state’s anti-corruption watchdog and the ombudsman. It follows the ABC’s reporting of allegations that VicForests had logged sites illegally and spied on a conservationist. The logging agency has denied it logged illegally and said it always complied with the law. The Greens’ Ellen Sandell has written to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) and the ombudsman, asking them to launch investigations. I respectfully request that IBAC conduct an investigation into whether these actions by VicForests — especially the allegations of spying on a private citizen — constitute corrupt conduct and warrant further investigation... Using taxpayer money to hire a private investigator to spy on a private citizen I would consider a gross misuse of taxpayer funds. Serious allegations of widespread illegal activity by a Victorian public sector agency I would consider something also worthy of investigation by IBAC. Trade minister Dan Tehan has urged businesses not to hoard a chemical key to keeping Australia’s freight and logistics sectors on the road, reports AAP’s Georgie Moore. Australia has about seven weeks’ worth of urea – used in the diesel exhaust fluid AdBlue – left amid a global shortage as China restricts exports. The federal government is speaking to countries including Indonesia about shoring up Australia’s supply. It is also approaching Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Japan. Korea last month flew 27,000 litres of urea to Australia. Tehan told ABC radio this morning that the Covid-19 pandemic had highlighted the fragility of some supply chains: There will always be some stock which they [businesses] keep in warehouses ... But what we don’t want to see is the excessive warehousing of AdBlue at this stage. He is confident Australia will be able to secure the urea it needs: There is obviously issues around containers, shipping disruptions which we’re also working through ... But from everything that we’re seeing, there is clear supply which we can bring to Australia. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has spoken to Radio National about the plight of Australian Julian Assange. Although attempts to extradite him from the UK to the US are ostensibly for their court system, Wilkie said “the reality is it’s always been intensely political” because he claims charges are politically motivated against Assange for “doing his job” as a journalist and reporting via WikiLeaks: This can be solved politically by Scott Morrison picking up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson and saying, ‘This has gone on long enough – it’s not acceptable that an Australian Walkley award-winning journalist is being kept in jail for really doing nothing more than publicising hard evidence of US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, let’s release him and let him come back home.’ Wilkie also called on Labor leader Anthony Albanese to commit to the same, if he is elected. Wilkie said jail “is killing” Assange. On who he will help form government in a minority parliament, Wilkie said he had been burned by Julia Gillard reneging on his pokies reform, and in future he will treat “every vote on its merits including confidence and supply” – meaning no deal to support one side. Still, he said climate change will be important to him and Morrison has done “terribly” on the anti-corruption commission issue. Scott Morrison is currently welcoming the South Korean president, Moon Jae-In to Australia. Gosh, we are so far away from everyone, it’s always exciting when a political leader makes their way down here! Federal health minister Greg Hunt is speaking now from Melbourne where he has just announced that Medicare-funded telehealth options will become permanent. He also reiterated that Australia is on track to open the border for skilled labourers and international students: The first is about the reopening of the borders for students and for skilled labour on 15 December. Yes, we are on track for that. That has been reconfirmed over the weekend. We said on the 29th of November that we were intending to reopen on 15 December. That has been through the national cabinet process ... Then in terms of telehealth, it’s a continuation of the existing measures across the work of GPs, allied health and specialists and I want to thank everybody for their involvement in that. All of the different parts of the medical community have played their role but the RACGP has been our principal partner on that front and well supported by the AMA and ACRM. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has implored Scott Morrison to pick up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson to end the prosecution of Julian Assange, AAP reports. The former intelligence analyst told the ABC: The reality is this has always been an intensively political matter and it can be solved politically by Scott Morrison picking up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. It comes after reports the 50-year-old WikiLeaks founder suffered a stroke in prison in October. Wilkie said: Jail is killing Julian Assange. There is no way he will survive continued incarceration in the UK. Assange has just suffered a legal blow after the UK high court ruled he could be extradited to face charges in the US. His lawyers say they intend to appeal the decision in the UK’s highest court. He faces an 175-year prison sentence on espionage charges in the US over an alleged conspiracy to obtain and disclose classified information which revealed alleged war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. Just very normal things happening on the NSW/Queensland border. After a Gold Coast man who bludgeoned his teenage girlfriend to death escaped a murder charge by arguing that he had been provoked by her tales of infidelity, the Queensland government decided to step in. “Other than in exceptional or extreme cases you can’t rely on words, or conduct that consists substantially of words,” the state’s then attorney general, Cameron Dick, said in 2011. “We need a change to the law … just because you say something it doesn’t mean that you should be killed.” A decade later, another Queensland man, Arona Peniamina, also convinced a jury his spouse’s suspected infidelity had provoked him into ending her life in a jealous rage. The government’s reforms had not prevented him from successfully arguing he was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, because he had been provoked. You can read the full report below: Watch out, Queensland! Anthony Albanese is in your state now and is bringing the election campaign with him! Here’s what he had to say to the ABC before jumping on his flight to the sunshine state. We need to reconnect with Queenslanders, we didn’t do well enough in the last election. When I was locked out of Sydney because of restrictions, I spent a long time in Queensland, I did a couple of road trips up and down the coast. I visited every small place that there was in between Rockhampton and Brisbane down the coast, and I think that Queenslanders know that this is a tired government, the end of its third term, they don’t have an agenda for today, let alone a vision for tomorrow and I’ll be talking today about our plans including 465,000 free Tafe places, 20,000 additional university places, and how we build back stronger. We need to take of the sacrifice that Australians have made by actually trying to envisage how we become more resilient, how we make more things. On my trip to Queensland a few months ago, I went to Maryborough, they’re doing fantastic there. Making trains, building things, creating jobs in regional Queensland and that’s what I want to drive. A total fire ban has been declared for north-western Victoria, AAP reports. The Country Fire Authority says the Mallee and Wimmera regions will be subject to a total fire ban on Monday, It means no open-air fire can be lit or remain alight, and strict rules apply for the use of farm machinery, chainsaws and lawnmowers. “CFA advises people living in areas at risk of fire to activate their bushfire plan,” the authority said. Temperatures are expected to reach the mid to high 30s in the two regions, with strengthening north-westerly winds forecast early before a blustery southerly change crossing the state throughout the day. There is also a low risk of dry lightning in the area. A high fire danger rating applies for central, north-central, northern country and south-west regions, while the eastern parts of the state are of low to moderate risk. It is only the second total fire ban of the season, thanks in part to cooler and wetter-than-average weather in November. The outlook for this fire season indicates a lower threat of prolonged bushfires but grass and crop blazes remain a high risk across the state after average to above-average rainfall and strong fuel growth. CFA acting chief officer Garry Cook said: Overall, we’ve had milder conditions leading into this fire season, but we can’t afford to be complacent about these hot and windy days where the fire danger spikes. Grass and crop fires are prevalent this season and can move at speeds of up to 25km/h and jump highways. A person in New South Wales has been admitted to hospital infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the first Omicron patient to be hospitalised since it arrived in Australia last month. It comes as thousands of protesters marched through capital cities yesterday to oppose vaccine mandates, and Western Australia and Queensland prepared to reopen their borders. After two years of border closures, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, is today due to announce when the state’s borders will reopen to domestic and international travellers, after reaching the 80% vaccination milestone at the weekend. And “tens of thousands” of people are expected to cross into Queensland after its borders reopen at 1am on Monday. It will be the first time in 229 days people will not need to quarantine on arrival, provided they are fully vaccinated. You can read the full report below: Of course with Queensland’s border opening, tourism minister Dan Tehan is out and about this morning taking a victory lap (even though the decision to open the border has nothing to do with the federal government). Here he is chatting to ABC radio: All the forecasts are, when it comes to domestic tourism, by the end of next financial year it will be back to pre-pandemic levels and international tourism will follow on the back of that, so there are positive signals for our tourism industry ... 660,000 jobs in our tourism sector, we want to make sure that reaches beyond post-pandemic levels and we need those overseas skills ... here in Australia helping us strongly rebuild the tourism sector. Things seem to be getting pretty loose over in the Barnaby Joyce isolation suite, with the deputy prime minister placing his phone inside a microwave to get the perfect camera angle for his Sunrise interview. I feel like there is a joke about radiation frying your brain in there somewhere, but I’ll just leave that up to you. China has responded “irrationally” to the Aukus pact between Australia, the US and Britain, defence minister Peter Dutton says. The conservative Australian minister continues to mount forthright criticism of the Chinese government, accusing it of “bullying” countries that stand up to it. Yesterday Dutton said the Australian government had formed the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK because it wanted to see “see increased stability and peace in our region”. “The response by China to that, I think, was irrational,” he told Sky News Australia. You can read the full report below: Time to chat about next year’s election, and the battle the treasurer is facing from an independent in his home seat. Michael Rowland: You are now facing, as we know, Monique Ryan in the seat of Kooyong. She’s a Royal Children’s hospital doctor. You’ve labelled people like she, an independent, as a front for Labor and the Greens. What evidence do you have for that? Josh Frydenberg: Well, at the last election, I had an independent who said they were gonna vote for Labor. That’s a pretty clear indication. We’ve also seen plenty of cases where they’ve just mirrored the policies of our political opponents. Rowland: But what evidence do we have at this time? Frydenberg: This is a rinse-and-repeat, Michael. What we’ve seen, we’ve seen obviously a lot of funding going into these independents around the rest of the country, and it’s a democracy, so people can put their hand up. ABC News Breakfast host Michael Rowland: Just on Omicron, you might have caught up with the news just in the last hour or so, Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, made an address to the nation there. He’s declared a tidal wave of Omicron case is about to hit the UK. He’s declared it a public health emergency, and has declared that all British adults over the age of 16 can get a booster shot by the end of the year. Taking that into account, are we being a bit too sanguine about Omicron here in Australia? Treasurer Josh Frydenberg: We saw the medical advice, and that saw a pause for two weeks of the reopening of the border to international students and to skilled workers. That was a precautionary measure. But we will continue to listen and follow the health advice, and it has served us well to date. But at the same time, we need to ensure that our economy keeps this momentum going. And we’ve seen a very strong rebound, Michael. We’ve seen 350,000 jobs come back since the start of September. We’ve seen business and consumer confidence lift. We’ve seen Australia maintain its AAA credit rating. We’ve seen a very strong pipeline of investment, both in the housing market and more generally across the economy. The Queensland premier taking a victory lap as the borders reopen this morning. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg is chatting to media this morning, discussing the Queensland border reopening. He was asked if he is “absolutely confident” that state border closures are now a thing of the past. I certainly hope so ... We do know that the Omicron variant is not the first or not the last variant that we will probably see with respect to Covid. We also know that it’s highly transmissible, but perhaps not as severe as previous variants. We also know that the vaccine has proven to be a very effective defence against the virus, with the number of hospitalisations and deaths coming down, and restrictions being eased accordingly. So, I’m very hopeful that the state premiers will stick to the plan, keep their borders open, and allow Australians to be reunited at Christmas and allow businesses to flourish. The NBN has announced plans to switch to 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2025 and use electric or hybrid cars where possibly by 2030, reports AAP. Australia’s NBN Co has announced a “towards-zero carbon ambition”, with the company outlining a plan to use electricity exclusively from renewable sources by the end of 2025. As well as purchasing 100% renewable electricity from December 2025, an initial three-year roadmap works toward switching to electric or hybrid cars were possible by 2030, and reducing annual energy use by 25 gigawatt hours by the end of 2025. Total electricity generation in Australia was estimated to be 265,232 GWh in 2020, according to government numbers. More than 8.3m premises are connected to the NBN network, and the company says it will seek a “more efficient use of energy as data demand and the number of connected premises continues to grow”. NBN Co chief executive Stephen Rue said: Beyond the direct impact of becoming an environmentally sustainable business, what’s equally exciting is the power of the network to help enable digitisation, and the huge benefits that unlocks for the nation in terms of emissions reductions, as well as socio-economic benefits. The company has already entered into a renewable power purchasing agreement intended to deliver almost 20% renewable energy to the network by the 2o23 financial year. It plans to reach the 100% target through further power purchase agreements and contracts for renewables. The announcement comes as NBN Co becomes the first Australian telco and government business enterprise to join RE100, a global initiative joining “the world’s most influential businesses committed to 100% renewable power”. RE100 Australian co-ordinator Jon Dee said: It joins 110 other major companies in Australia that have joined RE100 and made the commitment to switch to 100% renewable electricity. Between them, Australian members of RE100 use more than 5.5 terawatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power 800,000 Australian homes. The towards-zero carbon ambition is part of NBN Co’s second sustainability report released toay, which also looks at social and economic impacts. With 33% of management positions held by women, NBN Co outperforms the national average, it notes. Additionally, as at 30 June 2021, NBN Co had a gender pay gap of less than 1%. Good morning everyone and welcome to the new week! It’s Matilda Boseley here on the blog with you today and I have some good news to start us off. After nearly five months the Queensland border has finally opened! As of this morning, anyone from Victoria and NSW can enter the sunshine state as long as they are fully vaccinated and have proof of a negative PCR test before beginning their journey. With tens of thousands of people expected to travel today, Jen King is up on the NSW/Queensland border this morning to bring us all the updates. Let’s go west now because Western Australia’s premier is set to finally reveal when the state’s borders will open, ending months of speculation. Mark McGowan is expected to announce a firm date for the reopening, this morning, likely in late January or early February. The state’s borders are closed or heavily restricted to every other state or territory except Tasmania. It’s anticipated the vaccination rate will have climbed to 90% by the time the borders finally reopen. Once the borders come down, transitional restrictions will come into effect. This will likely include mask mandates in high-risk indoor settings, and proof-of-vaccination requirements for large events with crowds of more than 1,000 people, nightclubs and casinos. Entry to remote Indigenous communities will remain restricted and contact registers will still be used. OK! With all of that out of the way, why don’t we jump right into the day?"

          "headline": "The pandemic is a blow to mental health – and that means more missing children",
          "bodyText": "The first few years of life weren’t easy for Leo*. His mother was severely dependent on drugs, as were other members of his family. There were periods of neglect, and he was taken into the care of his local authority while still a very young child. Now 16, Leo lives in semi-independent accommodation. But his difficulties haven’t evaporated. Often he has felt lonely and unwanted. On several recent occasions, Leo has been the subject of a missing persons report. When visited by caseworkers after returning, conversation has repeatedly turned to his mental health struggles. He just feels low most of the time. Leo’s story is not unique, just as the UK’s missing persons crisis is nothing new: 170,000 people are reported missing every year, at a rate of one every 90 seconds. More than 70,000 are children and the majority, like Leo, boomerang in and out of sight repeatedly, perhaps living in care or unstable households. Though it’s rarely possible to pinpoint one single cause leading to a disappearance, poor mental health is very often a significant contributing factor. One in five children subject to a return interview with the charity Missing People has disclosed information about mental health issues. This much was true long before the pandemic. But the events of the past 18 months have only accelerated existing trends. In a report published by the social business and charity Catch-22, the link between children’s mental health and missing episodes is made explicit. Its own data has shown that mental health was a factor in a third of all children’s missing incidents reported between April 2020 and April 2021. The highest figures came between October and December 2020, in the teeth of lockdown and school closures. But even after the end of restrictions, rates have remained alarmingly high. When someone returns after they have been missing, there is an invaluable chance to understand some of what led to the disappearance in the first place. And most missing people – whether adults or children – do return. The latest figures suggest that 90% of missing children are back in sight within 48 hours. Statutory guidance in England and Wales now states that every one of these returned children should be offered an independent “return home interview” (known as return discussions in Scotland). They are supposed to offer the chance of an intervention, conducted by a trusted non-police body, such as Catch-22 or Missing People. Leo’s story is one of many. Take 15-year-old Alice*. Her relationship with her parents was already fractious, and lockdown exacerbated matters. Alice had quickly become isolated and found remote learning difficult. Already living with several neurodivergent conditions, she had put herself under huge pressure to conceal her mental health struggles from her family. Even after the loosening of restrictions, arguments have persisted – mostly centred on schoolwork and seeing friends. Unable to cope at home, Alice has repeatedly gone missing and has begun to self-harm. Clearly there is something deeply broken, in a year when record numbers of children and adolescents have been referred to mental health services in England. Between 2020 and 2021, NHS data shows there were 527,339 referrals in total, up 33% from 2019. The wider UK picture is just as troubling. In early December, it was revealed that nearly 2,000 young people in Scotland had been waiting more than a year for an appointment with child and adolescent mental health services – a rise of 106% from 2020. Statistics hardly represent the lives of increasingly vulnerable young people like Leo and Alice. For one consultant child psychiatrist in Liverpool who spoke recently to the BBC, the consistent severity of self-harm is the worst they’d ever seen. In times of severe distress, the likelihood of going missing only increases. The majority of missing young people might return “safe and well”, but there are many who don’t. One in seven of those who completed return home interviews with Missing People had been sexually exploited. Crises rarely emerge fully formed overnight. They tend to build over years. Cuts to children’s mental health services are nothing new, even if the effects of the pandemic have brought things to an unignorable boiling point. It’s why one of Catch-22’s key recommendations involves timely access to professional support. After all, collating scrupulous data from returnees is one thing; turning it into action is quite another. Our society is riven by deep inequalities, and the world of missing people is no different. For children living with poor mental health, in poverty or flitting in and out of the care system, the risk of disappearance is significantly increased. These are not academic questions – the stakes could hardly be higher. This summer marked a first in the history of Catch-22’s missing services. A child with significant mental health problems had been reported missing and was later found to have taken their own life. They were just 14 years old.

          "headline": "Skipping class: have Victorian students fallen behind because of remote learning?",
          "bodyText": "At the end of a second year of interrupted schooling thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, Victorian teachers are circumspect. “Last year, we got away with it,” says Melissa*, a primary school teacher in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. “Everyone was quite worried about the kids, so we really worked hard to make sure they didn’t fall behind. I destroyed myself; the parents, for the most part, pushed themselves as hard as they could. This year, there was a lot of fatigue.” By the time the Delta outbreak hit in June and New South Wales and Victoria went into lockdown, the “novelty” of remote learning had worn off. When students returned to school in October, the effects of 18 months of broken and remote schooling had compounded, Melissa says. “Almost none of my students have moved from where they were in the middle of the year,” Melissa says of the children she teaches in grades prep, one and two. “Nobody can tell the time, nobody can do fractions, nobody can spell anything and nobody can write. If there’s one thing they won’t do for their parents, it’s write. They’ve had two years on and off of just not being taught spelling.” Melissa is not alone in such observations. The preliminary Naplan results released in August were trumpeted by the Victorian government as evidence that the state’s students had defied the interruptions of the pandemic on their schooling. Teachers and researchers alike are awaiting the forthcoming release of the more granular data this month. But there is scepticism that those detailed results will tell the whole story, especially as – since the tests were performed in May – they will not encompass the most recent extended lockdowns in NSW and Victoria, which, anecdotally, were some of the hardest. And they cannot measure the level of social understanding or personal growth in students, or show the overlapping of family circumstances, socioeconomic conditions, social status and temperament that contribute to how individual children learn. Tim* teaches in a Catholic primary school in Melbourne’s south-east. He says he’s worried most about his incoming grade twos. “Overall the remote learning plan was good, but in some places kids were more disadvantaged – where English is their second language, where the kids didn’t have laptops or the internet, or they had dual-income families working essential worker jobs and their parents were not able to support them with remote learning – that was very difficult,” Tim says. While the children’s learning suffered, he says, more concerning is the fact they have had two deeply formative years without the intensive socialisation of school. “When we came back to school after the last lockdown, the kids couldn’t interact with each other properly,” Tim says. “They didn’t know how to take turns, or how to have respectful interactions. They’d been online for so long they had trouble focusing on real people. They might have said things they didn’t mean while online that they wouldn’t have said to someone’s face.” Tim and Melissa both say that their young students needed intensive social and emotional learning activities when they returned to the physical classroom, as they grappled with the behavioural expectations that came from learning and interacting with other people in the same physical environment. Malcolm Elliot, president of the Australian Primary Principals Association, tells Guardian Australia that this is something primary teachers are seeing across the board in places where remote schooling was prolonged. “We’ve seen plenty of examples of children who have gone backwards in their socialisation. Where they had made progress in learning how to collaborate, work with others, and be in the school environment, this has declined. There’s a period of catch-up certainly needed there,” Elliot says. Older children with more capacity for self-direction seemed to better cope with online learning than younger children, but Elliot warns that this depends a lot on highly variable individual circumstances. “Many students have been in circumstances that have been far from ideal in lockdown periods. Students experiencing disadvantages have become no less disadvantaged during the pandemic,” Elliot says. “The circumstances between people vary markedly. There are children in our community, and we have to open our eyes to this, for whom school is their safe place and their home is not a safe place. They will have experienced setbacks in their learning. Some students, particularly socially, will go backwards.” Lessons from remote learning John Hattie, emeritus laureate professor at Melbourne Graduate School of Education, says the key lesson from Covid schooling so far is “don’t presume”. “Every kid deserves to be evaluated and assessed on their own merits,” Hattie says. “Don’t presume that certain categories of kids did better or worse. So-called gifted kids, for example, overly depend on their teacher – they are often very compliant and reliant on their teacher. They suffered in Covid too.” Hattie says we ought to be asking why, from the data made available so far, remote learning appeared to work so well in so many cases. It would be a mistake, though, to presume it worked for all children. “I’m not Pollyanna in believing that Covid was brilliant; it wasn’t. But there’s no question for the majority of kids, though, the key issue [with remote schooling] was [its effect on] friendships. So I’m not going to ever advocate for distance learning, but I do think that a lot of the stuff we learned from Covid should be applied going forward.” Critically, Hattie says, schools shouldn’t be too hasty to return to old habits. “There’s a massive move to rush back to the old normal. Most children know how to play that game, but there’s a large percentage of children who aren’t well-served by the old normal. What an incredible opportunity to learn from Covid about what makes a difference to those children.” Catching up for lost classroom time The Victorian government has provided money for tutoring to help catch up any students that have fallen behind, which has been gratefully received by schools. It shakes down to an allocation of about $15-$18k per school, though, which means the programs can only target a small cohort or subject. Elliot seeks to reassure parents who might feel responsible for their child’s learning gaps due to their circumstances during lockdown. “Parents shouldn’t feel like they’ve done anything wrong, provided they’ve been kind and thoughtful and loving towards their kids during this time. Any deficit in learning can be repaired and may not take as long as we think.” Still, teachers aren’t expecting smooth sailing ahead. “I don’t know how long it will take to catch kids up because it depends on how interrupted next year is and that depends on Covid,” says Melissa. “In a normal year, really going for it, six months and I think they’d be fine. But that would assume a normal year where everyone’s not tired and families are stable. Everyone planned for a normal year this year and then it didn’t happen. I don’t feel like I can look ahead to a normal year.” * Names have been changed for privacy reasons"

          "bodyText": "Two weeks out from the Christmas break, and across the US the annual note from school PTAs reaches parents: it is time to recognise this year’s efforts by teachers through contributions to the holiday fund. It’s a solicitation that goes out every year, but this year the wording is particular. The past 12 months have been terrible, period, but particularly terrible for those working in schools. Please dig deep, we are advised; these are uniquely difficult times. It’s not only a whip-round but an invitation for thanks and praise that, in these endless, waning days of the pandemic, seems to belong to an earlier time. If we were frightened in 2020, there was also a sense of readjustment, much discussed, about what we owed to one another. There was a warm glow of mutual responsibility. Those taken for granted were lauded and rewarded. In New York, food delivery apps introduced a button for a 40% tip, and teachers and doctors were heroes. Nothing lasts, of course, but the collective sense of a near-death experience meant that – as many thought in the heat of the moment – some version of this gratitude would. It didn’t, obviously. Over the past year, gratuities winnowed back to 20% and griping about school schedules resurfaced. What’s curious, perhaps, isn’t the return to business as usual, but a decisive swing from valorising certain groups to effectively demonising them. Last month, in some school districts in the US, school closures were announced not as responses to rising Covid numbers, but to accommodate teacher burnout. Detroit public schools decided that, until the end of the year, they would close their classrooms every Friday and revert to online learning. In Florida, the school holidays were extended. Seemingly on a dime, the mantra “teachers are great” flipped to “teachers don’t want to work”. People were furious. Part of this dynamic is just basic energy flow. It’s a feature of burnout that while one’s own is deeply felt and definitely real, other people are mostly faking it. The state of burnout erodes tolerance. To nurse one’s own bruised system relies on everyone else’s being up and running. No one has the bandwidth to accommodate the needs of others, particularly if they make one’s own life more difficult. There’s a question of association, too, perhaps. For a lot of people, school functionality is the single biggest barometer of where we are in the pandemic. Part-closures, teacher burnout, even solicitations for gratitude interfere with the sense that we are on the other side of this thing. No one wants to be reminded of the awful days of 2020, when our kids sat frozen for hours on Zoom. At every stage of the pandemic, there has been a second world war analogy waiting unhappily in the wings, and in this case it’s Churchill being voted out of office in 1945. According to the teaching unions in the US, reverting to a partly remote learning schedule is an effort to keep teachers from resigning. “What you hear from teachers is that it’s been too much,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, told the New York Times. “And they’re trying the best that they can.” It’s an appeal to reason that will get precisely nowhere with parents forced to scramble for childcare if their kids’ school suddenly shuts every Friday. Even without the practical implications of partial school closures – or indefinite mask mandates when all school-age kids in the US are vaccine-eligible – there is an emotional need served by pivoting to trashing those one latterly admired. A friend referred to it as “the pendulum of hate”, and I suppose if nothing else it’s a swing that falsely implies movement where there might actually be none. These people, once great, have now become tiresome, clinging to how things were when the rest of us have moved on. It’s not the pandemic itself holding us back, but the more absorbable problem of truculent teachers and inflexible unions – a question of perception, not reality. At this point, all that stands between us and the world as it was in 2019 is apparently a large dose of common sense and the exhortation to buck up. To think otherwise – to consider that we’re all in the same boat, burnt out, fed up and incapable of returning to anything – is simply too dismal a possibility to allow.

          "bodyText": "When a young family died mysteriously on a trail in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains in August, authorities scoured the area for clues. Maybe there was a gas leak from a nearby mine. Maybe the family drank water that contained toxic algae. In the end, as a new report showed, the answers were more prosaic, if just as tragic: the triple-digit temperatures and tough terrain created a fatal situation. Nearly 80 pages of investigative reports obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle lay out the tragic missteps that led to the death of the young family and hold important lessons about the dangers of hiking in a grueling climate. The family, Ellen Chung, 31, Jonathan Gerrish, 45, along with their one-year-old daughter, Miju, and dog, Oski, set out to hike at the Hites Cove Loop trailhead in a remote area of the Sierra Nevada national forest on 15 August. Their truck was found near the trailhead two days later and crews soon found the bodies of Gerrish and Miju – with Chung’s body a little higher on a hillside. The local sheriff’s office announced in October that the family died of overheating and probably dehydration. “This is an unfortunate and tragic event due to the weather,” Mariposa county sheriff, Jeremy Briese, said at the time. The records show that Gerrish had used the AllTrails app to map out the hike and that he had hiked a portion of the same loop in May 2017. But the temperatures at the time had been much lower and the 2018 Ferguson fire hadn’t yet burned out tree canopy in the area. Grueling mid-day temperatures and a lack of shade had moved locals in recent years to avoid the hike during the summer. But the family was new to the area: they had moved to Mariposa, in the Sierra foothills, during the pandemic and bought numerous properties. Chung was a yoga instructor and graduate student and Gerrish was a Snapchat engineer. According to the report, a US Forest Service volunteer who had hiked the nearly eight-mile loop more than a dozen times told a deputy the family appeared “completely unaware of the dangers”. They carried only a sippy cup and a backpack with a 2.5-liter reservoir for water, the records show. For Wesley Trimble, a communications and creative director with the American Hiking Society, the tragic incident serves as a reminder to be prepared when going hiking, by planning before leaving the house. He advises telling people where you are going and when to expect you back. “People often don’t think about it, but it’s a critical step: telling a neighbor or a family member that you are going to a specific location and that you’ll be in touch when you are back in an area with a cell signal,” Trimble says. And if you don’t return when you expect, give someone specific instructions, like the sheriff’s office for the county where you are hiking, if they don’t hear from you at a specified time. Another way to plan before hitting the trail is to really look at maps and come up with a game plan, including when to turn around based on timing, even if it means not reaching a desired destination. “In the winter time frame, that might mean getting back before it’s dark, and in warm weather it might be looking at the forecast,” says Trimble. The day of the Mariposa family’s hike, the temperatures were in the upper 70s in the morning, but rose to 109 in the afternoon when they were on the trail. That shows it’s important to consult detailed weather predictions, Trimble says – and to check the weather not just with the widget on a smartphone, but with better technology. Noaa has a website that can do pinpoint forecasting on a map, which will give a much better idea of what the forecast is, he says, because geography plays a critical role in weather. Trimble also suggests checking in with locals about a trail – a gear shop or even a tourist office will have insight into local conditions that may not be listed on a trail-mapping app. The American Hiking Society has a list of the ten essential items that everyone should have when heading out for a trek. For hikes during hot weather, it’s essential to haul enough water. “It’s hard to give people a very specific number with water,” says Trimble, though most hiking experts say about 16 ounces or a half liter per hour per person, for moderate temperatures and terrain. “If you are hiking in triple degree temperatures you will need at least a liter of water for every hour you plan to be out,” he says. In addition, for warmer-weather hiking, it’s important to be familiar with the symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. “You want to be able to pick up on if you or someone is experiencing nausea and headaches and other symptoms, because if you are hiking in hot temperatures it’s a good sign that you are probably starting to get dehydrated,” says Trimble. “Make sure everyone is drinking water consistently – by the time you are thirsty, you are already starting to become dehydrated.”"

          "bodyText": "The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron Sars-CoV-2 variant feels like a flashback to last year’s grim festive season when much of the world went into lockdown to avert the worst of the Alpha variant wave. But though the sense of eerie, impending doom feels familiar, the epidemiological and political situations are different from one year ago. The Omicron wave represents a key turning point in the pandemic. But no plausible outcome looks particularly auspicious – it feels largely like a lose-lose deal. If if turns out to be roughly as severe as previous pandemic waves, it might normalise harsh mitigation measures and render the prospect of a return to post-pandemic normality fairly remote. If it turned out to be milder than feared, this could spell the end of lockdowns with Covid-19 on its way into endemicity. The cost would be a loss of trust in political and public health authorities, which may make it difficult to deal with future threats. Omicron is a different beast to the Alpha and Delta variants, which emerged in the pre-vaccine phase of the pandemic and spread in largely immunologically naive populations. Their threat came from the increased ability to replicate quickly within their host and their higher contagiousness. Both variants were associated with higher hospital admisssion rates and deaths. However, neither variant was good at escaping immune recognition, although each could cause occasional “breakthrough infections” in immunised people, with high contagiousness allowing these variants to barge through the first-line immune defence. Omicron is different. Rather than just relying on brute force, as Delta did, it is far better at sneaking through immune defences, thanks to a number of mutations that it acquired in key regions of its spike protein. These reduce the ability of neutralising antibodies to bind to it. As such, it spreads primarily by (re-)infecting previously immunised hosts. The centre of the Omicron outbreak was Gauteng province in South Africa, which experienced a dramatic rise of nearly 400% in the number of cases in the first week of December. The Gauteng outbreak seems to be receding with its peak expected within a week or so. Other regions of South Africa also show signs of their epidemics slowing down despite no measures having been taken to suppress transmission. Many countries are seeing rapid rises of Omicron cases, which are recorded as doubling every two to three days in the UK. But there is considerable uncertainty about the virulence of Omicron. Early, largely anecdotal, evidence from South Africa suggested Omicron might be milder. Such data has to be interpreted carefully as essentially all infections start with mild symptoms and there is a time lag before severe disease develops. As additional data has landed in the past two weeks, the hypothesis of the Omicron wave being significantly milder becomes increasingly plausible. Reported deaths and hospitalisations in South Africa, in particular those requiring intensive care or ventilation, have remained far below numbers recorded during previous waves. Virulence is not just a property of a pathogen but of the interaction with its host. Most populations on Earth have acquired high rates of immunisation through vaccination and prior infection. While Omicron can largely bypass neutralising antibodies, it remains well recognised by T-cells, which do the heavy lifting to control infections that can’t be averted. As such, vaccines largely retain their efficacy against severe symptoms caused by the variant and a recent third dose still seems to provide significant protection against infection. Irrespective of the relative virulence of Omicron, the large peak of cases anticipated over the coming weeks is expected to add further stress to healthcare services, which no government can allow to become overwhelmed under its watch. A case for harsh mitigation measures based entirely on the protection of healthcare services might be less well received by many nearly two years into the pandemic, in particular given the uncertainty around the severity of Omicron. The first lockdowns in early 2020 were generally well accepted by the population as a temporary measure in the face of an exceptional threat. Many felt that later lockdowns were justified as a means to delay the epidemic until the population could be vaccinated. A lockdown to deal with Omicron may be a more difficult sell; it comes with no obvious endpoint besides its objective to “flatten the curve” and allow for a marginal increase in the number of people vaccinated or boosted before the peak of the wave. How to respond to the Omicron wave poses extreme challenges to political and public health authorities globally. So far, western governments have enforced early, harsh travel bans against African countries, which have been widely criticised, including by the World Health Organization. Given the rapid rise in local community transmission of Omicron, those travel restrictions have lost all efficacy they might have had early on. Increasing the rate of vaccination, including third doses, in particular for those most at risk, should make a real difference in terms of morbidity and mortality over the coming months, but time is rapidly running out given the remarkably fast increase in daily Omicron case numbers. Many governments are also taking more intrusive or coercive measures, which could rapidly escalate to compare with previous lockdowns. How effective those measures are at reducing viral transmission over the coming weeks will largely depend on the population’s willingness to follow the rules. In the absence of a clear sense of fear and a possible loss of trust, adherence may be far lower. As I noted, Omicron’s legacy could be huge if its impact proves to be especially rough or mild. But even an intermediate outcome might cause additional resentment and further the deep divisions in society. • Francois Balloux is the director of the Genetics Institute at University College, London"

          "bodyText": "A year ago last week, rugby was thrown into turmoil. Steve Thompson, a 2003 World Cup winner, announced that he and seven other former players were launching a lawsuit against World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union, after their diagnoses of dementia or, in the case of the 31-year-old Adam Hughes, post-concussion syndrome. The players with dementia were all in their early 40s. The eight have since been joined by another 150, drawn from the same generation, with a further 75 from rugby league. Fifty more, and counting, wait in the wings weighing up their options. Of the 150, half have been diagnosed, the other half have been tested and await results, but all report similar unnerving symptoms. Who knows how many others are suffering in silence? And who knows how many more from this generation, the first to play full careers in the professional era, will develop conditions in the next 20 to 30 years? If they are diagnosed before the age of 65, their dementia will be categorised as “early onset”, or unusually young. For anyone in their 30s or early 40s, the odds of such a diagnosis are around one in 10,000. The 75 diagnosed already represent roughly one in 20 of those who played rugby union in England or Wales during the first 15 years of the professional era. The lawsuit is still in its pre-action phase, a routine of information-gathering and posturing between parties. If a settlement cannot be reached, proceedings will be issued, probably in the new year. The best guess is that a date for trial will be set within a couple of years of that. A settlement out of court could bring an end to proceedings but the prospects of this happening any time soon seem remote. The three defendants are governing bodies of a sport that knows the issue of brain injury represents a threat to its very existence. The line they must tread as they try to take responsible steps to address the problem while not admitting liability is delicate. As for the sort of unqualified acknowledgement many would like to see of the gravity of the predicament, such a confession would hardly reassure mums and dads across the world of rugby’s wholesome charms. We should not be surprised, then, that there seems no settlement on the horizon, or that some of the recent releases from the defendants have smacked of jockeying for position in advance of a hearing. Meanwhile, the independent studies keep tumbling in. The Drake Foundation engaged in an extraordinary game of press-release tennis with the RFU recently, each offering its different interpretations of the same study they had partnered up to produce. You can guess whose take was the more airbrushed. Other independent research institutions, such as those at Durham University and the University of South Wales (USW), have weighed in this year with more research that inches us ever closer to certainty about the hideous truth hardwired into collision sports. The more players improve, the more dangerous they become to each other, particularly in the most precious realm of all, that of cognitive health. Worse still, with every study the hypothesis firms up that it is not the arbitrary syndrome known as concussion that is the key factor in one’s risk of developing neurodegenerative disease in later life. So far almost all of rugby’s attempts to address the crisis have focused on concussion management, as have the majority of the findings of the inquiry by the digital, culture, media and sport committee of backbench MPs that was set up this year to look into the relationship between sport and long-term brain injury. The government’s response last week necessarily focused on concussion too, but neuroscience is now virtually certain the decisive variable is the sheer number of blows taken over a long career, otherwise known in the field as “cumulative dose”. What no tweak to the laws has ever achieved – and realistically ever could – is to reduce significantly the number of collisions per match in the modern game, or even just to stop its escalation as the fitness and power of players increases year after year, despite the plateau in their size that was reached circa 2010. A reduction of the blows suffered outside match day is an area for exploration. Under pressure from one of the benefits of the past year, the emergence of independent player-support groups such as Progressive Rugby and Head for Change, World Rugby has issued a recommendation that teams restrict contact training to at most 15 minutes a week. That could only help but, bar perhaps the odd unreconstructed coaching regime, most profess to a bare minimum already. This elicits a more hopeful hypothesis – that the hinterland between the amateur era and the more sophisticated methods of the current will prove a one-off. No consolation for those who played through it, but maybe the prospects for those playing now have already improved. The counter-evidence is a continuing escalation in the intensity of the matches themselves, as charted by burgeoning tackle and ruck counts and soon, we hope, the extensive use of instrumented mouthguards to anatomise the toll on each player in real time. The plan to adopt this technology across the Premiership was recently delayed by another season because, it is understood, the RFU and World Rugby could not agree on which technology to use. The latest studies do not suggest the worst is over. The Drake Foundation released one in the summer that revealed abnormal reductions in white matter in the brains of half of a cohort of current elite players, and axonal injury in 23% of them. Another from USW a couple of weeks later mapped changes in cerebrovascular function across a season and found a direct link to the number of “contact events”. And these are just within a given season. Further studies are in the offing, comparing the starting point of the brains of collision athletes in off-season with those in non-collision sports. Do not expect good news. Which brings us to the dread question of the number of games. Play fewer games, take fewer blows. The equation is simple. Harder to negotiate is the relationship between reducing games and keeping the sport afloat financially. There is barely an institution in rugby that is not haemorrhaging money as things are. The only way they could begin to countenance losing fixtures or increasing squad sizes would be to cut back on player pay. The irony is that the very danger to which players are exposing themselves for our entertainment makes such a policy anathema to any right-thinking observer. Watch the players’ forebears go down with terminal conditions, then dock their pay. There might be one other development more disastrous for the sport’s image, and that is for its governing bodies to take on its stricken former players in a court of law. That is the path rugby seems as set on now as it was this time a year ago. To see a graceful way out of the predicament that does not turn off more parents looking to occupy their kids on a Sunday morning is next to impossible. Because this is not about conspiracy or criminal intent. This is what happens when a collision sport goes from a part‑time amateur status to full-time professional, when players stop drinking beer and start on protein shakes, when science brings to bear all its advances to improve them, when the defining energy of a new century anyway is the lust of everyone, from schoolkid to international, to “be the best I can be”. When athletes in a collision sport pursue that blessed state, the repercussions of their increased threat to each other are deleterious. You cannot repeatedly collide with other people without repeatedly jolting your head. A year on, rugby is nowhere nearer solving this conundrum than any of the rest of them."

It’s dry, so we fix the mower at its highest setting. Henri trims. It works. We spread some of the broken leaf on the borders. As always there is too much to do in the time we have away from remote working. We pick the last apples from the old-style Danish tree: Ingrid Marie from Funen. Henri makes her pie. We store the rest of the fruit in the garden shed, hoping the mice have left. We have a polecat that moves into the roof most winters.

          "bodyText": "Australia has said it will shorten the wait time for people to receive Covid-19 booster vaccines. Health minister, Greg Hunt, said the time interval will be shortened to five months after the second dose. Another 633 Omicron cases have been found in the UK, the biggest daily increase since the Covid-19 variant was detected last month. The latest figure, a 50% day-on-day increase, brings the total number of confirmed Omicron cases to 1,898 across the country, the UK health security agency said. Brazil’s supreme court justice, Luis Roberto Barroso, has ruled the country must demand proof of vaccination for visitors seeking to enter the country. The Omicron variant could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England over the next five months if no additional measures are taken beyond Plan B, according to scientists advising the government. A booster dose means the risk of symptomatic infection with the Omicron variant is “significantly reduced”, according to health officials who have urged all those eligible to make sure they get their third jab. Tens of thousands gathered in Austria’s capital Vienna to protest mandatory Covid vaccines and home confinement orders for those who have not yet received the jabs. Taiwan’s government said on Saturday that it had detected the island’s first cases of the Omicron variant, found in three people who had arrived from abroad. Mexico’s health ministry reported 235 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the country’s official toll since the pandemic began to 296,620. The health ministry has previously said the real number is likely significantly higher, Reuters reports. Boris Johnson is facing further questions over whether he breached Covid laws after pictures emerged of him hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street while London was under tier 2 restrictions. The prime minister was pictured on a screen reading out questions while staff were sat behind computers and conferred on the answers, the Mirror reported. London was then under restrictions banning any social mixing between households. Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Staff working for the Work and Pensions Secretary (DWP) in England drank alcohol and ate takeaways “late into the evening” on a number of occasions while coronavirus restrictions were in place, the department confirmed. It comes after the Sunday Mirror reported that political staff and officials frequently drank after work until the early hours of the morning, and ordered food to Therese Coffey’s office at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The newspaper said some of these evenings took place while hospitality and office parties were banned under Covid regulations. The DWP has confirmed there were times when alcohol was consumed in a work space outside the Cabinet minister’s Whitehall office but stressed it took place while work was continuing past normal employment hours. A source told the PA news agency the desks in the office are socially distanced and there was “no party atmosphere going on”. A DWP spokesman said: “Throughout the pandemic, DWP officials have followed Government guidance while continuing to deliver vital services for millions of people. “Staff worked from home where possible but a core team working directly to the Secretary of State regularly worked from the office, in accordance with the Covid-19 rules as they evolved. “The team regularly worked late into the evening and on a number of occasions they ate takeaway food and drank some alcohol. No karaoke took place.” Asked about the Sunday Mirror’s suggestion that Coffey gave presents to staff while they stayed late one night over last year’s festive period, the spokesman replied: “On one occasion close to Christmas, the Secretary of State gave gifts to her core team, as she does every year.” The Treasury has confirmed “impromptu drinks” occurred when England was locked down. People in the UK should be able to get their Covid-19 jabs while doing their Christmas shopping, Labour said, as the opposition party calls for a “national effort” to increase the rate of booster shots. With recent research from UK scientists finding that booster shots are likely to be effective against the Omicron variant, Labour is urging ministers to open more vaccinations sites and to open up booking slots to all double-jabbed adults. Pop-up vaccination centres in supermarkets and shopping centres should be set up so people can get their third shot while on the high street doing their Christmas shopping, the party has suggested. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, is pressing the government to “pull out all the stops” to meet the prime minister’s target of having offered a booster jab to all those aged over 18 by the end of January, PA reports. Brazil has registered 53 new Covid-19 deaths, the country’s health ministry said on Saturday, bringing fatalities in the country to a total of 616,744. The country had 3,355 new cases of coronavirus over the last 24 hours, reaching a total of 22.19 million, Reuters reports. Australia has said it will shorten the wait time for people to receive Covid-19 booster vaccines following a rise in cases of the Omicron variant. It had previously said it would offer a booster to everyone over-18 and who had their second dose of the vaccine six months prior, Reuters reports. But with rising cases of the Omicron variant, Australia’s health minister, Greg Hunt, said the time interval will be shortened to five months after the second dose. “A booster dose, five or more months after the second dose, will make sure that the protection from the primary course is even stronger and longer lasting and should help prevent spread of the virus,” Hunt said in a statement. Brazil’s supreme court justice, Luis Roberto Barroso, has ruled the country must demand proof of vaccination for visitors seeking to enter the country. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied requests of state health regulator Anvisa to demand vaccination proof from visitors, Reuters reports. But Barroso said in his decision that Brazil needs to avoid supporting what he called “anti-vaccine tourism.” The justice said the requirement for proof of vaccination can be waived only when the traveller comes from a country where no vaccines are available or the individual was prevented from vaccination due to health reasons. The government has delayed for a week a regulation that would require non-vaccinated visitors to quarantine for five days due to a cyberattack on the health ministry on Friday. You can follow the latest Covid developments in Australia in our dedicated blog: Israeli researchers said they found that a three-jab course of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine provided significant protection against the Omicron variant, Reuters reports. The findings were similar to those presented by BioNTech and Pfizer earlier in the week, which were an early signal that booster shots could be key to protect against infection from the newly identified variant. The study compared the blood of 20 people who had received two vaccine doses five to six months earlier with the same number of individuals who had received a booster a month before. “People who received the second dose five or six months ago do not have any neutralisation ability against the Omicron. While they do have some against the Delta (strain),” Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba, told reporters. The first six cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus have been detected in Turkey, health minister Fahrettin Koca was reported as saying on Saturday by state broadcaster TRT Haber. Five of the cases were in the western city of Izmir and one in Istanbul, but none of those affected needed hospital treatment, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported. Three West Indies cricketers and a member of the team management have tested positive for Covid-19 after they arrived in Pakistan for the upcoming tour. There was confusion on Saturday about which age groups in England are now eligible to book a booster jab with the NHS, after an apparent glitch allowed younger people to book before they were expected to qualify. People aged 30 and over in England were expected to be able to book a Covid-19 booster from Monday as long as it has been three months since their second vaccine dose, but many 30-somethings reported on social media that they had been able to book their appointments already. The NHS website still said on Saturday evening that “the NHS is working on plans to offer a booster dose to everyone aged 18 to 39 years old”, and that people should note that this service is not yet available to book via their portal. “Please wait to be contacted by the NHS,” a disclaimer on the website added. Almost twice the number of coronavirus patients could be admitted to hospital in England compared with last year due to the Omicron variant, new modelling suggests. Experts from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) have calculated figures which propose that a large wave of infections could occur over the next few months if tougher Covid measures are not brought in, PA reports. The study projects a median peak of 7,190 daily hospital admissions in England in the worst case scenario – which could see the variant evading vaccines at a high rate as well as low effectiveness against the variant from boosters. The most optimistic scenario (low rate of the variant evading vaccines, high effectiveness of boosters) “is projected to lead to peak daily hospital admissions around 60% as high as the peak in January 2021 in England”. This would mean a median peak of 2,410 daily admissions compared with 3,800 daily admissions in January this year, the study said. France has also reported 120,383 coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic, Reuters reports. France has reported 53,720 new coronavirus cases. The country has had more than 8.1 million cases overall. Here is more on the protests in Vienna against mandatory vaccines and confinement orders for people who are unvaccinated. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a former UK government adviser, has tweeted the following: More than half of Angola’s doctors will indefinitely continue a national strike over pay and conditions as the coronavirus pandemic strains the African nation’s depleted public health services. Angola resorted to asking China and Cuba for help to fight the first Covid-19 wave last year with more than 250 Cuban doctors arriving, AFP reports. According to 2020 figures, Angola has 5,200 doctors. The country’s national doctors’ trade union on Friday said 3,000 of its members would “continue the national doctors’ strike in all public health units” after the industrial action began at the start of the week. Tens of thousands gathered in Austria’s capital Vienna to protest mandatory Covid vaccines and home confinement orders for those who have not yet received the jabs. Police said an estimated 44,000 people attended the demonstration, the latest in a string of huge weekend protests since Austria last month became the first EU country to say it would make Covid vaccinations mandatory. A partial confinement since last month ends on Sunday for the vaccinated, but those who have not received the required doses will have to remain at home, AFP reports. The UK recorded 54,073 cases in the latest 24-hour period, bringing the total to 10,771,444. There were also 132 deaths recorded, bringing the total to 146,387. More data from Italy. Patients in hospital with Covid – not including those in intensive care – stood at 6,539 on Saturday, up from 6,483 a day earlier. There were 76 new admissions to intensive care units, the same as the previous day, Reuters reports. The total number of intensive care patients edged up to 818 from 816 on Friday, which compares with 708 a week earlier. Some 565,077 tests were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 716,287, the health ministry said. Dozens of US Navy medics have deployed to New Mexico to treat a Delta variant-fueled surge in Covid-19 patients as part of a military operation to treat virus hotspots across western and midwest states. New Mexico is suffering one of the highest levels of new coronavirus infections in the country, its hospitals reaching record capacity levels. Nearly 50 Navy medics are treating Covid patients at the San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington, northwest New Mexico, where critical care patient numbers have been over 200% of capacity for weeks, Reuters reports. The speed at which scientists worked to develop the first Covid jabs was unprecedented. Just nine months after the UK went into lockdown, 90-year-old Margaret Keenan officially became the first person in the world outside a trial to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. But the virus is mutating, and the emergence of the Omicron variant last month is already focusing attention on the next generation of jabs. Italy reported 96 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new infections rose by 21,042, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 134,765 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth highest in the world. The country has reported 5.2m cases to date. Another 633 Omicron cases have been found in the UK, the biggest daily increase since the Covid-19 variant was detected last month. The latest figure, a 50% day-on-day increase, brings the total number of confirmed Omicron cases to 1,898 across the country, the UK health security agency said. In England, another 618 confirmed cases of the variant were reported, with 1,757 in total. Scotland reported 11 more cases, with 121 now confirmed. In Wales, two additional cases were reported, bringing the total to 15. A further two were confirmed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total to five. New coronavirus restrictions could be introduced in Scotland next week, the deputy first minster, John Swinney, has said. PA reports that Swinney said ministers are spending the weekend “wrestling with the challenge of what are the right rules to have in place”. But he said he does not think that Scots will face a restricted Christmas. Asked on BBC Breakfast if new Covid measures would be put in place next week, Swinney said: I can’t say definitively that will be the case, but that’s certainly been looked at over this weekend. And we have to judge what’s the best set of measures that we can take to try to interrupt the circulation of the virus. We can’t have it moving at the pace its moving at just now because the danger is that will overwhelm our public and private services. Nicola Sturgeon is due to give a statement in the Scottish parliament on Tuesday. On Friday, she told a televised press conference that Scotland faced a “tsunami” of Omicron cases. Swinney’s comments come as the latest statistics show 11 more Omicron cases have been confirmed in Scotland, taking the total to 121. There were 4,087 coronavirus cases in total reported in the last 24 hours, with 12 deaths. Asked if Scotland faced a restricted Christmas due to new Covid measures, Swinney said: I don’t think so and I hope not. And we’re working very hard just now to make sure that does not become the case. Meanwhile, a hospital ward in Inverness has been closed to new admissions due to a Covid-19 outbreak. NHS Highland said that Ward 7a at Raigmore Hospital is closed to new admissions and visiting following the detection of a small number of cases of coronavirus. Tests are establishing whether any of the cases are of the Omicron variant and the results are expected next week. The projected number of deaths and hospital admissions caused by Omicron [see 12.12pm.] in England could be “substantially” overestimated if the new variant causes less severe disease than Delta, according to an expert. Prof Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said any model was “only as good as its assumptions”, adding that one key assumption in this model is that severity of disease outcomes for Omicron is the same as for Delta. He said: Although we will not know for certain for a few weeks indications from South Africa do suggest that Omicron does cause less severe disease than Delta. There is also early as yet not peer reviewed data suggesting that although Omicron mutations are enough to escape antibody, T-cell immunity would be less compromised. It is thought that T-cell immunity is more important for reducing risk from severe disease than it is for reducing the milder nose and throat infections. If Omicron is indeed associated with less severe disease as is, in my view, likely to be the case then these models would overestimate hospital admissions and deaths, possibly substantially. Prof Hunter said he suspects these models “overstate” risk of hospital admissions and deaths and the “worst case” scenarios are “unlikely to be seen”. He added: As better data becomes available in coming weeks we can expect these models to be refined. Authorities in France want to accelerate vaccinations against the coronavirus before Christmas as infections surge and more people with Covid seek medical attention, AP reports. “People can celebrate Christmas normally, but we must respect the rules ... and get vaccinated,” the French prime minister, Jean Castex, told public radio outlet France Blue during an interview on Friday. France has registered a daily average of more than 44,000 new cases over the past week, a 36% increase from the previous week, according to the latest government figures. Weekly hospitalisations of people with Covid went up 1,120, a 41% rise. The government on Monday closed nightclubs until 6 January and tightened social distancing measures in closed spaces and outdoors. Castex said the government is not considering another lockdown that would limit or prohibit public events and social gatherings. With over 48 million of France’s 67 million people fully vaccinated and tens of thousands signing up for either their first shots or booster doses, the country could make it through the holiday season without additional restrictions on public life, the prime minister said. Health workers in France were administering 700,000 vaccine doses a day, Castex said, adding that 90% of French residents had had at least one vaccine dose. “It’s an excellent figure,” he said. The government is discussing whether to have France join other countries that have authorised vaccines for all children aged 5-11. Children under the age of 12 who are considered at risk of complications from Covid will be eligible starting 15 December. Castex, 56, tested positive for the coronavirus on 22 November. His office said at the time that he had contracted the virus from his 11-year-old daughter. He was fully vaccinated, but his daughter was too young to get jabbed. Pointing to himself as an example, the prime minister said: “So yes, vaccinating children is necessary.” Care home residents in England will be allowed only three visitors and one essential care worker under updated UK government guidance announced as part of new measures to protect the sector from the spread of the Omicron variant. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the move was “in order to balance the current Covid-19 risk and the need to keep people safe in line with clinical advice”. It is understood the guidance will come into force from Wednesday. Fully vaccinated residents visiting family and friends outside the care home will be asked to take a lateral flow test on alternate days for two weeks after each outing, while those not vaccinated will have to isolate after an outside visit. Staff testing will be increased from two lateral flow tests a week to three, alongside a weekly PCR test. The chair of the National Care Association has said new rules on care homes have “almost” taken people back to the restrictions that were in place a year ago. Nadra Ahmed said she was hoping to get clarity on several details on the new guidance, including if people could change the nominated three people to visit someone in a care home. The full story is here: Care home residents in England to be allowed only three visitors at Christmas The Omicron variant could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England over the next five months if no additional measures are taken beyond Plan B, according to scientists advising the government. New modelling from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, who also sit on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) or the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), used experimental data to look at how Omicron may transmit as the country heads into 2022. Even under the most optimistic scenario (low immune escape of Omicron from vaccines and high effectiveness of booster jabs), a wave of infection is projected which could lead to a peak of more than 2,000 daily hospital admissions, with 175,000 hospital admissions and 24,700 deaths between 1 December this year and 30 April 2022. This is if no additional control measures are implemented over and above the current Plan B introduced by the government in England. The team said mask-wearing, working from home and booster jabs may not be enough, and predict a peak of daily hospital admissions of 2,400 in January. In this scenario, bringing in control measures early in 2022 – such as restrictions on indoor hospitality, the closure of some entertainment venues and restrictions on how many people can gather in one place – would be sufficient to substantially control the wave, reducing hospital admissions by 53,000 and deaths by 7,600. The most pessimistic scenario looked at by the modellers (high immune escape from vaccines and lower effectiveness of boosters) projects a wave of infection that is likely to lead to a peak in hospital admissions about twice as high as the peak seen in January 2021, if no additional control measures are taken. This could cause 492,000 hospital admissions and 74,800 deaths, according to the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. In this scenario, the team estimates that stronger measures may be required to keep the peak number of hospital admissions below the January 2021 peak. The scientists assumed Omicron causes the same severity of illness as Delta but did not look at the impact of measures such as mass population testing to control its spread. The paper reads: These results suggest that Omicron has the potential to cause substantial surges in cases, hospital admissions and deaths in populations with high levels of immunity, including England. The reintroduction of additional non-pharmaceutical interventions may be required to prevent hospital admissions exceeding the levels seen in England during the previous peak in winter 2020-2021. Dr Rosanna Barnard, who co-led the research, said that while there remained a lot of uncertainty over Omicron, “these early projections help guide our understanding about potential futures in a rapidly evolving situation”. She said: In our most optimistic scenario, the impact of Omicron in the early part of 2022 would be reduced with mild control measures such as working from home. However, our most pessimistic scenario suggests that we may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed Mask-wearing, social distancing and booster jabs are vital, but may not be enough. Nobody wants to endure another lockdown but last-resort measures may be required to protect health services if Omicron has a significant level of immune escape or otherwise increased transmissibility compared to Delta. It is crucial for decision-makers to consider the wider societal impact of these measures, not just the epidemiology. Earlier, we reported that the Treasury has defended an “impromptu” drinks party after Rishi Sunak’s autumn spending review during lockdown. A spokesperson insisted it was a “small number” of staff who celebrated around their desks, despite reports put the number closer to two dozen civil servants at the event. A team of officials working on the chancellor’s spending review announcement stayed after hours for the party on 25 November 2020, the Times reported (paywall). Government sources said the drinks were not planned but the civil servants involved bought beer and wine from a nearby supermarket. A Treasury spokesperson told the Guardian: A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the spending review 2020. We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event. The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas. Here is my colleague Tom Ambrose’s story: Treasury defends ‘impromptu’ drinks party after Sunak’s autumn budget Labour has called on the UK government to give a “Christmas vaccine guarantee” to the hundreds of thousands of eligible children in England who have been unable to receive a Covid jab. With recent figures showing that just 44% of children in the 12-15 age group had been vaccinated on 8 December, Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said the government needed to make a bigger push to vaccinate the remainder before they returned to school in the new year. “As Omicron cases in the UK are rising, it’s essential that ministers use the Christmas holidays to get the vaccine out to children, preventing continued chaos next term,” Phillipson said. “Labour has been calling on ministers to use pop-up and walk-in clinics, and bring back volunteers and retired clinicians to increase vaccine rollout, but 13 weeks after the jab was approved [by the chief medical officers] the Conservatives have failed to deliver. “With hundreds of thousands of children out of school each week this term, the government must urgently get a grip and stop neglecting children’s education.” The government had initially aimed to offer vaccinations to all 12- to 15-year-olds by the October half-term break. But the most recent figures suggest it will struggle to vaccinate half by the end of term next week. Read the full story here: Labour demands ‘Christmas vaccine guarantee’ for pupils in England Mauritius has recorded its first two infections of the Omicron variant, with a dozen more contact cases feared, AFP reports. The health minister, Kailesh Jagutpal, told a press conference on Friday the pair were asymptomatic and had tested negative the day before. “They have already gone home,” he said. He added that contact tracing for the two people had been carried out, revealing 12 positive cases with a missing S gene – a telltale sign of Omicron. Health authorities were currently analysing the samples to determine if they are in fact Omicron. One of the two Omicron cases was detected in a man who flew home to the island from South Africa on 27 November 27. The second case was recorded in a woman in the island’s south whose husband had returned from South Africa on 18 November. Mauritius fully opened its doors to international visitors at the start of October, hoping to rebuild its vital tourism industry after long months of isolation because of the pandemic. But it was forced to reimpose restrictions last month as Delta variant cases surged. According to latest figures reported to the World Health Organization, Mauritius has had 62,652 Covid cases and 680 deaths. More than 900,000 people have been fully vaccinated, representing 73.5% of the population, government figures show. What’s the truth about lockdown-busting parties at No 10? Don’t ask Shagatha Christie, writes Marina Hyde in her column this week. Here are some extracts: There was simply no other place a Johnson government would ever end up but mired in rampant lies, chaos, negligence, financial sponging and the live evisceration of public service. To the Conservatives and media outriders somehow only now discovering this about their guy, I think we have to say: you ordered this. Now eat it. Regrettably, though, space constraints must end our recap of the week here. But on it all goes, as Omicron closes in. We’ll play out with a reminder that in a pandemic that has so far killed 146,000 of the Britons who these people are supposed to be in politics to serve, the absolutely vital public health message has now TWICE been most fatally undermined by people who worked at the very heart of No 10 with Boris Johnson. That is absolutely a disgrace, and absolutely not a coincidence. Read the full column here: I have updated my entry for 8.23am to add details of where the arrivals who tested positive for Omicron in Taiwan had travelled from. You may have to refresh the page in order to see the updated post. A year ago humanity embarked on a project to vaccinate every person against Covid-19. But in recent months a shadow vaccination campaign has also been taking place. From giraffes to snow leopards, gorillas to sea lions, zoos around the world have been inoculating their animals with an experimental Covid vaccine as an insurance policy against what they fear could be a similarly fatal illness for certain mammals. Meanwhile, veterinary scientists have been scrambling to understand the scale of Covid-19 infection in our furry household companions, and what the consequences could be for their health – and our own. Last week two hippos at Antwerp zoo in Belgium became the latest in a coterie of creatures to contract Covid from humans. Fortunately, Imani and Hermien had no symptoms apart from runny noses, but other animals haven’t been so fortunate. In November three snow leopards died from Covid-related complications at a children’s zoo in Nebraska. Other zoos have reported infections in gorillas, lions, tigers and cougars. Although Sars-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in an animal, most likely a bat, until recently most of the scientific focus has, understandably, been on human cases of disease. Yet ever since the early days of the pandemic, scientists have worried about the possibility of other animal infections. “We’ve always recognised that coronaviruses have this tremendous capacity to jump species. So it was always predicted that there would be a variety of domestic animals, livestock and potentially wildlife that could be infected,” said Margaret Hosie, a professor of comparative virology at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research. If other animals can become infected and transmit the virus, this could put pressure on it to adapt and acquire new mutations, raising the prospect of new variants that could be transmitted back to people. “You could be concentrating on eradicating the virus in humans, but meanwhile the virus could be mutating away quietly in an animal species, and getting hotter and hotter,” Hosie said. Read the full story here: From hippos to hamsters: how Covid is affecting creatures great and small Where did Omicron come from? By all accounts it is a weird variant. Though highly mutated, it descended not from one of the other variants of concern, such as Alpha, Beta or Delta, but from coronavirus that was circulating maybe 18 months ago. So where has it been all this time? And why is it only wreaking havoc now? Researchers are exploring a number of hunches. One is that Omicron arose in a remote region of southern Africa but failed to spread until now. Another is that it evolved in infected animals, such as rats, and then crossed back into humans. But a third explanation is gaining ground as more data come to light, that Omicron arose in a person with a weakened immune system: someone having cancer treatment perhaps, an organ transplant patient or someone with uncontrolled HIV. The latter possibility has sparked global concern. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to two-thirds of the global population living with HIV. For a whole series of reasons, ranging from lack of access to clinics to fear of stigmatisation and disrupted healthcare, 8 million people in the region are not on effective HIV therapy. Beyond the direct problems this causes with disease progression and vulnerability to Covid – people with advanced or uncontrolled HIV are far more likely to die from coronavirus – is the risk that uncontrolled HIV is driving the emergence of Covid variants. “For me there are two key things,” says Dr Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, who was part of the team that first reported Omicron. “First there is the science that needs to go on to get a better understanding of this. But more importantly, on a public health level, we don’t need to wait for the science. It is a reminder that while addressing the immediate challenge of Covid-19, we also need to intensify efforts to end HIV as a public health problem.” Read the full analysis of why HIV prevention could be key to stopping coronavirus here: As Omicron cases are on the increase and a new wave threatens to overshadow Christmas in the UK, the scientists working on Covid are also making calculations about which of their own festivities to go ahead with and which to scale back. Hannah Devlin and Nicola Davis spoke to them about how they will navigate the festive season: Omicron is spreading so fast in the UK that people are “very likely” to meet someone infected with the variant unless they are “living the life of a hermit”, Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease, said this morning. The University of Edinburgh academic also warned “a lot of people” could still end up in hospital even if the coronavirus mutation proves to provoke milder symptoms than the Delta variant. Prof Riley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Omicron is spreading so quickly that, I think, unless you are living the life of a hermit, you are very likely to come across it in the next few weeks. I don’t think anyone should be going around thinking they are not going to catch it, I think that situation has changed. She added: There is a huge ‘if’ about this, ‘is it milder?’. I think it is very dangerous to compare data from South Africa, say, to the UK. Even if it is milder and, therefore, a smaller proportion of infected people end up in hospital, given that so many people are going to come across this virus, even a small proportion of a lot of people is a lot of people in hospital. Some Treasury staff who worked on the autumn spending review last year had office drinks while England was in lockdown, The Times reports (paywall). It comes after more than a week of controversy over allegations of rule-breaking festivities in Downing Street in the run-up to last Christmas. The Times reports that about two dozen civil servants were present for the drinks on 25 November 2020. A Treasury spokesman said: A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the spending review 2020. We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event. The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas. At the time non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including work if it could not be done from home. The Times said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was not at the event and that it is understood he was not aware of it at the time. On Friday, Downing Street said it has cancelled any plans to hold a Christmas party this year. It came as Boris Johnson’s ex-aide Dominic Cummings said there were “lots” of photos of parties in No 10 that would “inevitably get out”. Cummings dismissed defences from the prime minister’s allies that he would not have known about celebrations going on under his roof amid signs Johnson’s popularity is slumping. The government chief whip, Mark Spencer, insisted Downing Street staff “were not drinking alcohol” and partying during Covid restrictions after it emerged the prime minister’s press chief addressed staff at one event last Christmas. No 10 said Johnson retained full confidence in Jack Doyle to serve as communications director despite ITV reporting he addressed up to 50 people and made a speech at one party on 18 December. Read more: Boris Johnson pressed to say if there were parties in his flat during lockdowns Taiwan’s government said on Saturday that it had detected the island’s first cases of the Omicron variant, found in three people who had arrived from abroad. The Central Epidemic Command Centre said the infections were detected in travellers from the UK, Eswatini and the US. Like all entrants, they were tested on arrival and already subject to two weeks of quarantine. A booster dose means the risk of symptomatic infection with the Omicron variant is “significantly reduced”, according to health officials who have urged all those eligible to make sure they get their third jab. It comes as the experts warned Omicron could become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December, with the communities secretary, Michael Gove, saying everything is being kept “under review” in terms of measures to tackle the spread. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines provided “much lower” levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared to Delta. But the preliminary data, which looked at 581 people with confirmed Omicron, suggested effectiveness seemed to “increase considerably” in the early period after a booster dose, giving about 70-75% protection against symptomatic infection. The findings come as daily Covid cases reached their highest level in almost a year and the UKHSA predicted that, if current trends continue, the UK will exceed 1 million infections by the end of the month. Read more: Two jabs offer little protection against Omicron infection, UK data shows Gove warned of a “deeply concerning situation” after holding a Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the latest data and the co-ordinated response across the four nations. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said while their early data should be treated with caution, it indicated that “a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain”. She added: The data suggest this risk is significantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible. Speaking to broadcasters, Gove said the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England “and possibly even faster in Scotland”. He added that 30% of reported cases in London were the new variant, and warned that evidence suggested Omicron was “more likely” than past Covid variants to “potentially” lead to hospital admissions among the fully vaccinated. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, earlier warned of the possibility of a “tsunami of infections” from the new variant – and said she could not rule out more restrictions north of the border as a result. But No 10 maintained that there were “no plans” to go further with measures in England, amid reports that proposals are being drawn up for a “Plan C” featuring even tougher rules. Gove said the current approach being taken was “proportionate”, but acknowledged that “we absolutely do need to keep everything under review”. He said: Action is absolutely required and, as new data comes in, we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data. The Guardian reported that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, had been given a presentation from the UKHSA earlier this week warning that even if Omicron leads to less serious disease than Delta, it still risks overwhelming the NHS with 5,000 people admitted to hospital a day. It said the leaked advice said “stringent action” would be needed on or before December 18 if the variant’s doubling time stays at 2.5 days, although what such restrictions might entail were not set out other than to say measures that would bring the R number – representing the average number of people each Covid-positive person goes on to infect – below 1. Read more: Javid advised to take ‘stringent’ Covid measures within a week, leak reveals Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose data was instrumental to the UK going into lockdown in March 2020, told the Guardian that projections suggested Omicron could “very substantially overwhelm the NHS, getting up to peak levels of admissions of 10,000 people per day”. He said such a figure could be reached “sometime in January” but added that it was based on assumptions around the variant’s ability to get around existing protection, and the premise that it is similar to Delta in terms of the severity of disease it causes – something that is not yet known.

          "bodyText": "On 15 December 2014, inside a repurposed shipping container in the Atlanta Botanical Garden in the USA, Mark Mandica heard an unfamiliar animal call. It was a reddish-brown frog about the size of a peach, called Toughie. He had lived silently for nine years since arriving from Panama – where the highly infectious chytrid fungus disease had arrived, leaving swathes of dead frogs in its wake. He was believed to be the last Rabbs’ fringe-limbed tree frog in the world. “I was always extremely curious what the call sounded like … it was a loud call that sounded like a barking dog,” Mandica says. “Then it struck me that this frog was still vital and sounded very strong, and was singing out for a mate that would never come.” When Toughie’s heart stopped on 26 September 2016, the species died out. The next morning, across the country in San Diego, amphibian expert Natalie Calatayud was presented with Toughie’s testicles. This strange gift was part of a plan to use “biobanking” for conservation. The idea of freezing biological material is not new, having been used in medical research and livestock breeding programs for decades. But by using liquid nitrogen to lower animal tissues to -196C, where almost all processes of life within a cell halt, scientists hope to buy more time for assisted reproduction to help a captive colony, to investigate a devastating disease, or preserve DNA for cloning. Toughie now exists as 16 vials of precious mush, awaiting a time when technology – and potentially an unknown surviving mate – allows for the revival of the lost species. Unlike the Rabbs’ tree frog, most species disappear years before humans realise, along with any chance to preserve their genetic material. A group of scientists in Australia, in the grip of one of the world’s worst extinction crises, is hoping that some of our own endangered species can avoid this fate. They are calling for a national operation to freeze our native wildlife before that chance is lost. ‘Australia has lagged behind’ Australia was the first country to attempt a truly national biobank: the Animal Gene Storage and Resource Centre of Australia (now the Australian Frozen Zoo) was created in 1995. But funding and donations dried up, says its current director, reproductive expert Peter Temple-Smith. It could never fulfil its potential. The “zoo” exists as a two-metre-tall cryotank that’s been shuffled around Monash University, reliant on volunteer staff formally employed in other roles. Meanwhile, co-founder and former director Ian Gunn says biobanking for conservation has been gaining popularity overseas. “Other countries have moved ahead, and Australia has completely lagged behind.” Alongside the original, and languishing Frozen Zoo, there are now scattered facilities that cryo-preserve animal samples in pockets across the country at some zoos, universities, and museums. In March, five conservationists met with then threatened species commissioner Sally Box arguing that these must become a coordinated network – with standardised operating procedures for the technical work, dependable funding to ensure the facilities can be maintained, and one database to log every existing sample so they can be fully utilised in research. Even with their wish to create a national strategy for proactively “banking” priority species, it will be too late for some: the government itself predicts 280 animals and plants will be extinct by 2039. For these animals, their suspended cells may be the species’ last hope. Reproductive biologist Rebecca Hobbs, of the Taronga CryoDiversity Bank in New South Wales, did not attend the meeting with Box, but says national operating procedures for collecting, storing, and using samples would be crucial. Biobanking, she stresses, must work with, not replace, habitat protection and captive breeding. In captive breeding programs, variety is literally the spice of life: as the number of animals dwindles so does the genetic diversity of the group. Eventually, inbreeding leads to fertility and other health issues and the group is doomed – unless new genes are introduced. This is where advocates say biobanking is useful: in the US, researchers have reversed the black-footed ferret population out of an inbreeding spiral using frozen sperm from the “founding ferrets”, and even cloned a ferret from skin frozen in the 1980s. Banking species in the threatened-to-near-threatened categories may be most cost-effective, Hobbs says. “You may get more bang for your buck if you apply it to species that haven’t declined so much that the genetic variability has declined too dramatically for it to work.” Now back in Australia, Calatayud says current conservation strategies aren’t working, nor being done at the necessary scale. “The need for captive populations to maintain threatened species is growing at an alarming rate, disproportionate to the funding available and the logistical availability of space and staff. With biobanking, you could manage a smaller captive population by inserting new genetics whenever you needed to.” She says that biobanking domesticated species has been long accepted. Australia also has a national network to bank seeds of native plants. “Farmers everywhere bank their bull semen … and no one bats an eyelid. But in the context of wildlife, suddenly people think you’re selling some pipe dream.” Big decisions and a leap of faith Deciding which species get banked will be gruelling. Some won’t make it. “It’s a huge judgment call, it’s unfair, but it’s a case of, ‘who do I bank to save this ecosystem’? Who do we save for the greater good, because we can’t save everybody,” Calatayud says. Conservation biologist Simon Clulow, of the University of Canberra and Newcastle University, says that amphibians and reptiles are the “most imperiled vertebrate classes on Earth” but have had the least attention when it comes to biobanking. “It really wasn’t until the start of this century that we and one or two other labs around the world started to really look at developing sperm freezing and IVF techniques in frogs … for reptiles, we’re about 20 years behind that.” Despite not knowing how to successfully freeze – or bring back – every species, he’s confident the remaining hurdles will be solved given the pace at which the technologies are evolving. Some years ago Clulow and his father, John, helped produce live embryos of the extinct gastric brooding frog from tissue samples frozen decades ago. “We should absolutely be doing it, right now … You can’t go back in time once a species has disappeared.” John Clulow, who attended the Canberra meeting with Box, feels cautiously optimistic that momentum is building toward a national bank. An ecologist with expertise in reproductive technologies, he and colleagues at the University of Newcastle recently received federal funding to collect sperm from frogs in bushfire-affected areas, for use in captive breeding programs at Taronga. He says some conservationists worry that habitat protection will lag if the species in it have been preserved. “The other thing is, philosophically, conservationists are often about preserving animals within habitats, whereas this is a technological approach and that’s not as culturally embraced.” Reproductive biologist Steve Johnston says it’s too late to be hands-off. “With the koalas in south-east Queensland, we’re down to the point where if you just leave them alone, they’re just going to die,” says Johnston, of the University of Queensland. “Even with all the funding and publicity that they get, they’re still struggling.” Less charismatic species, like reptiles and amphibians, tend to attract less funding and interest. Johnston is a pioneer of the technique for successfully extracting sperm from the largest reptile alive. Lacking funding for specific facilities, he worked with Koorana Crocodile Farm. “If we could develop [the method] in the saltwater crocodile, we could apply it to other species.” His work involved enticing a 4.5m croc up to a fence with a dead chicken, putting a noose around its snout, sedating it, and hoisting the croc – a predator that has remained unchanged for 65 million years – into the air with a crane. Once it was laid across the back of two flat-tray utes, Johnston could crawl underneath to extract the penis from the slit at the junction of its legs and tail, and “milk” the sperm. The technique is now being used by different groups. “It’s somewhat invasive … but works well without causing any trauma to the animal.” Hope and silence The group has not heard from the commissioner’s office since their March meeting. Box left the role in October and a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment did not answer whether acting commissioner Fiona Fraser was briefed about the proposal. They say the Threatened Species Strategy 2021-31, which includes one mention of biobanking, “recognises the importance of being prepared.” Mark Mandica is also preparing. He has mixed feelings about reviving extinct species; the need to remove them from the wild for their survival, he says, is “profoundly dark”. But to hear a Rabbs’ tree frog call again would fill his heart. “Sometimes, I think about how maybe there’s a remote population of them out there, gliding from tree to tree, that just haven’t been found yet.” Lydia Hales received support from the Science Journalists Association of Australia for this story."

          "bodyText": "Back in spring 2020, when it became clear that coronavirus wasn’t going away, book lovers spied an opportunity for a rare, government-mandated reading holiday. Here, at last, was a chance to have a go at Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Proust’s In Search of Lost Time. Robert Macfarlane reported that he was working his way through the great Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh. Ali Smith urged readers towards Boccaccio’s Decameron. Diana Evans’s thoughts turned “heavenwards” by way of Homer’s Odyssey. I downloaded 27 hours of The Brothers Karamazov audiobook in anticipation. All lovely ideas. With 20 months of hindsight, however, which books did we actually end up turning to? The bestseller lists from the three different lockdowns may not tell you the contents of Britain’s soul, but then again, the numbers do not lie. We read: The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman. Sophie Hinchliffe’s Mrs Hinch: The Little Book of Lists. Lots of David Walliams, who topped the Lockdown 1 and Lockdown 2 charts with Slime and Code Name Bananas respectively. JK Rowling: the first three Harry Potter books steadily rose up the charts through the pandemic. Joe Wicks. The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse. A Pinch of Nom, plus spin-offs. Sally Rooney’s Normal People. Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race. So: cosy crime, uncosy crime, tidying up books, weight loss books, self-improvement books, children’s books, books offering cutesy wisdom, romance and escapism all did well during the pandemic. But then again, so did the books industry as a whole. Despite the chaos of lockdown – bookshop closures, supply chain issues, disruption to release schedules, cancelled literary festivals, live talks and book clubs – by the end of 2020, overall sales of print books were up 5% year-on-year, according to industry watchers Nielsen BookScan, with the upwards trend continuing this year. Fiction did particularly well – adult fiction increased 8% in volume terms, with 147m books sold. So too did children’s books, up 7%, to 109m books. Overall, the British public spent £1.8 bn on 202m print books. Digital sales soared, ebooks growing 16% and audiobook sales 21% year on year. “Books had a real moment,” says Hannah Bourton, publishing director at Viking, which scored the big hit of the pandemic with Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club. “They were immediate, they were accessible. We all wanted to escape into different stories.” “It sounds bad, but the pandemic has been quite good for us,” agrees Phoebe Morgan, editorial director of HarperCollins. “Particularly in the commercial area of the market. Obviously there have been times where things have been difficult – and especially for the authors. But it has also shown that there’s a bigger appetite for reading than ever.” Even so, many people – myself included – found that they couldn’t necessarily follow through on their grand ambitions. “I heard a lot of people say that now was the time to read all of the books that they’d always meant to read, or finally sit down and write their novel,” says Damian Barr, the author of Maggie and Me and presenter of the Big Scottish Book Club. “But what I found was that the constant state of emergency really fractured my ability to concentrate.” He turned to poetry instead: Mary Oliver, Mark Doty, Richard Scott. “I found poetry meaningful and sustaining but short enough that I could manage it.” Personally, I abandoned Dostoevsky pretty swiftly, and soon found my level was the odd audiobook and as many Inspector Maigret mysteries as I could lay my hands on. Still, the uptick in book sales shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. When museums, galleries, theatres, cinemas and concert venues closed in March 2020, books (along with TV) were an obvious source of refuge: cheap, immersive, low-tech and solitary. A survey by Nielsen in May 2020 found that 41% of British people were reading more; the UK as a whole doubled the amount of time it spent reading books, from 3.5 hours to six hours per week. Philip Stone of Nielsen even noticed a “brief spike” in physical book sales just prior to the first lockdown, which he puts down to panic buying. “People really did rush out to buy books to keep them company as they bedded in.” Once the shops were closed, publishing was unusually well positioned to capitalise, argues Stone. “Even before the pandemic, online retail accounted for about 50% of the books market, so book consumers were pretty used to buying online.” So which books did we turn to in that first lockdown, when the world around us seemed so uncertain and alarming? Alongside pre-pandemic bestsellers by Lee Child and Hilary Mantel were school textbooks by homeschooling parents and the aptly timed thriller Lockdown by Peter May. Baking books did well, says Stone, adult colouring books had a second wave, and anything on personal development and mindfulness also sold strongly. Meanwhile, the Black Lives Matter protests helped to focus attention on writers of colour through the summer: Bernardine Evaristo and Reni Eddo-Lodge both sold well. But overall it’s what’s not on the charts that tells the bigger story. With the usual channels of recommendation disrupted, Amazon’s sales algorithms and supermarket buyers played an outsized role in shaping taste. “Tesco really stole a lot of market share and that had a huge influence on what people were reading,” says Bourton. “A book like Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens, which was already selling well in spring, became a big ongoing phenomenon. The high street plays a huge role in breaking new authors, whereas what the supermarkets excel at is the familiar. Sainsbury’s didn’t actually take any new titles last April – they just sold more of what they already had.” Morgan says that the closure of bookshops actually helped sales for the commercial thrillers and crime fiction in which she specialises. “A lot of the stuff I was publishing was really overperforming in the supermarkets.” She noticed that “locked-room” mysteries performed particularly well: “An ensemble cast, assembled in a remote location, perhaps somewhere exotic.” Among big sellers were The Guest List by Lucy Foley, which is about a murder at a wedding on a remote Irish island, and The Chalet by Catherine Cooper, set in a snowed-in ski resort. “There’s an obvious reason for that when everyone is locked in their house and can’t actually travel anywhere,” she says. However, the runaway hit was The Thursday Murder Club, an Agatha Christie-esque murder mystery set in a retirement complex, published in September 2020. It has now sold well over 1 million copies, spawned a sequel (The Man Who Died Twice), and had its movie rights snapped up by Steven Spielberg. Osman is a well-known TV personality and Viking won the rights to the novel after a 14-way auction in 2019, so its success wasn’t totally out of the blue. Still, Bourton feels in retrospect it was perfectly placed to capitalise on the pandemic. “It is a comforting story about a small community – and it also has such respect and reverence for characters who are older,” she says. “The main characters are all 70-plus and experiencing end-of-life care. That was reflecting something we were going through as a society with a sudden extreme loss of elderly people due to Covid.” We can expect more “cosy crime” in the future: the Reverend Richard Coles’s crime debut, Murder Before Evensong, is due in June next year. However, as Bea Carvalho, head fiction buyer at Waterstones, notes, all kinds of crime fiction did well. “There’s something comforting about the structure of crime novels, a puzzle that needs to fit together,” she says. “When the world is so uncertain and hard to understand, those traditional narratives, where by the end the author will have done the work for you – that’s pretty appealing.” The fact that Osman and Coles are celebrities tells its own story about the winners and losers in this period. The Bookseller found that, notwithstanding the industry’s success, 63% of authors had lost income in 2020 – with debut authors bearing the brunt. For those without name recognition or a pre-existing platform, the pandemic took its toll. “There were lots of authors who were published for the first time in lockdown who really missed out,” says Barr, who was forced to cancel all the events surrounding the paperback release of his own debut novel, You Will Be Safe Here. “We’re in danger of losing two or three years of amazing writers who just haven’t had the attention they deserve.” For all the challenges of lockdown, there were stirring successes when stores finally reopened. “We’ve really felt the power of recommendation since we’ve welcomed customers back in again,” says Carvalho. “You can’t really get that from algorithms.” One of her most successful books has been The Appeal, by former screenwriter Janice Hallett, which tells the story of a murder at an amateur dramatic society via a series of letters and emails, but asks the reader to solve the mystery. Bookshops were closed when it was released in hardback in early 2021, and, as a debut author, Hallett was not afforded any supermarket listings and had little publicity. Waterstones sold only a thousand copies online in its first month. However, those who did read it urged their friends to buy it and when shops opened again, it began to sell in ever-larger numbers, becoming their bestselling book in July. Another hit was Exciting Times, a love triangle set among bratty young expats in Hong Kong by the young Irish writer Naoise Dolan. Released during the first lockdown, the combination of exotic locale, escapist love story and Rooney comparisons (just as the Normal People adaptation was on TV screens) hit a sweet spot. There were also mini-trends. One was mythology. From children’s books about myths to contemporary retellings such as The Women of Troy by Pat Barker, Circe by Madeline Miller, or Ariadne by debut author Jennifer Saint, it seems we couldn’t get enough of those archetypes. Another was “armchair travel”. Actual travel books suffered badly – travel guides lost around 90% of sales in the first lockdown (though have mostly recovered) – but books that conjured specific locales fared well. And Carvalho has noted a huge increase in teenagers buying Japanese manga and graphic novels – often filming themselves doing so. This is a TikTok trend that has migrated over into real sales; she is now increasing the space devoted to manga across the chain. Tom Robinson actually managed to open a new independent bookshop mid-lockdown: Gloucester Road Books in Bristol. He has been pleasantly surprised by how ambitious his new customers have been, reporting a roaring trade in Ann Quin’s highly experimental novel Berg, sold simply by recommending it to customers. Another success has been The Weak Spot by Lucy Elven, published by the tiny Prototype press. “Bookshops develop and sustain relationships with their customers and their communities,” he says. “There was a growing consciousness about what Amazon and other low-cost retailers had done to books. I’m finding that people will take the hit of a couple of quid to order it from me instead. And there are lots of people who come in soliciting opinions, bringing in their recommendations, and telling me how they got on with them, too. I’ve realised this is such a significant part of what bookshops do.” So did any of us fulfil those ambitions we set out with at the beginning of the pandemic? Old favourites have sold well over the last 18 months, says Jessica Harrison at Penguin Classics. “We noticed that people really were turning to those great doorstopper novels: Middlemarch, Anna Karenina, Don Quixote, David Copperfield,” she says. “All of their sales increased by significant amounts in 2020, and sales are usually steady so it has been quite noticeable.” Nor has the trend stalled in 2021, she says, suggesting that these books are classics for a reason. The big mover has been The Plague by Albert Camus, which increased by more than 1,000% and is still selling strongly, as is Journal of a Plague Year by Daniel Defoe. She also sold lots of books by writers of colour: Women, Race and Class by Angela Davis, The Autobiography of Malcolm X and James Baldwin’s oeuvre all had an uplift. The major trend, however, was the Stoics. “Meditations by Marcus Aurelius was huge for us,” she says. “As was Letters from a Stoic by Seneca – that sold absolutely loads in lockdown – and so did Epictetus.” Seneca and Marcus Aurelius were also the two biggest classics audiobooks during lockdown. “I guess lots of people were looking for ancient wisdom during lockdown.” Coming soon to a supermarket near you, hopefully. * * * The bestselling books Lockdown 1 March to June 2020 Slime David Walliams HarperCollins The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse Charlie Mackesy Ebury Mrs Hinch: The Little Book of Lists Sophie Hinchliffe Michael Joseph Normal People Sally Rooney Faber Jack Reacher: Blue Moon Lee Child Bantam Where the Crawdads Sing Delia Owens Corsair Girl, Woman, Other Bernardine Evaristo Penguin Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race Reni Eddo-Lodge Bloomsbury Wean in 15 Joe Wicks Bluebird The Family Upstair Lisa Jewell Arrow * * * Lockdown 2 November to December 2020 Code Name Bananas David Walliams HarperCollins A Promised Land Barack Obama Viking The Thursday Murder Club Richard Osman Viking The Ickabog JK Rowling Little, Brown Guinness World Records 2021 Guinness World Records Guinness World Records The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse Charlie Mackesy Ebury Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Deep End Jeff Kinney Puffin Shuggie Bain Douglas Stuart Picador A Del of a Life David Jason Century Jack Reacher: The Sentinel Lee Child &amp; Andrew Child Bantam * * * Lockdown 3 January 2021 to April 2021 Pinch of Nom: Quick &amp; Easy Kay Featherstone &amp; Kate Allinson Bluebird The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse Charlie Mackesy Ebury The Thursday Murder Club Richard Osman Viking The Midnight Library Matt Haig Canongate Tap to Tidy Stacey Solomon Ebury Grown Ups Marian Keyes Penguin Where the Crawdads Sing Delia Owens Corsair Pinch of Nom: Everyday Light Kay Featherstone &amp; Kate Allinson Bluebird Pinch of Nom: 100 Slimming, Home‑style Recipes Kay Featherstone &amp; Kate Allinson Bluebird The Fast 800 Easy Dr Clare Bailey &amp; Justine Pattison Short"

          "headline": "Why fighting Omicron should include ramping up HIV prevention",
          "bodyText": "Where did Omicron come from? By all accounts it is a weird variant. Though highly mutated, it descended not from one of the other variants of concern, such as Alpha, Beta or Delta, but from coronavirus that was circulating maybe 18 months ago. So where has it been all this time? And why is it only wreaking havoc now? Researchers are exploring a number of hunches. One is that Omicron arose in a remote region of southern Africa but failed to spread until now. Another is that it evolved in infected animals, such as rats, and then crossed back into humans. But a third explanation is gaining ground as more data come to light, that Omicron arose in a person with a weakened immune system: someone having cancer treatment perhaps, an organ transplant patient or someone with uncontrolled HIV. The latter possibility has sparked global concern. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to two-thirds of the global population living with HIV. For a whole series of reasons, ranging from lack of access to clinics to fear of stigmatisation and disrupted healthcare, 8 million people in the region are not on effective HIV therapy. Beyond the direct problems this causes with disease progression and vulnerability to Covid – people with advanced or uncontrolled HIV are far more likely to die from coronavirus – is the risk that uncontrolled HIV is driving the emergence of Covid variants. “For me there are two key things,” says Dr Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, who was part of the team that first reported Omicron. “First there is the science that needs to go on to get a better understanding of this. But more importantly, on a public health level, we don’t need to wait for the science. It is a reminder that while addressing the immediate challenge of Covid-19, we also need to intensify efforts to end HIV as a public health problem.” The suspicion that variants of concern can evolve in patients with weakened immune systems is not new. The Alpha and Beta variants, first spotted last year in the UK and South Africa respectively, are widely thought to have emerged after long-term infections in patients. The mechanism was laid out by Charles Darwin more than 150 years ago: evolution through natural selection. If a person is infected with Covid but mounts a weak immune response, the infection can persist for months. In that time, antibodies neutralise some of the virus, but not the versions they bind to less well. These surviving viruses proliferate, mutate and undergo further selection – potentially leading to variants that evade immune defences. A preliminary study posted online this week reveals the process in action. Scientists in South Africa, Lessells among them, traced a particular sample of coronavirus to a 36-year-old woman who was not receiving effective antiviral therapy. Tests revealed that she had harboured the Covid virus for 216 days, in which time it accumulated 32 mutations, making it similar to the vaccine-evading Beta variant. If weakening of the immune system by HIV drives Covid evolution, the researchers say, then antiretroviral therapy must be ramped up to prevent it. Writing in the journal Nature, Lessells and his colleagues make the case more strongly. They warn that the failure to tackle the Covid pandemic “with sufficient urgency” in countries with high rates of uncontrolled HIV “could lead to the emergence of variants of the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that spread more easily between people or render the vaccines less effective”. With Omicron, one possibility is that the virus lingered in an immunocompromised patient for months – explaining why it descends from such an old version – before it acquired the right mutations to break out and spread like wildfire. The effort needed, then, is huge. Covid has caused massive disruption to healthcare services, with HIV patients among those badly hit. More than 1,300 healthcare workers have died of Covid in South Africa alone. Thousands more may leave the profession because of the unsustainable strain. The UK’s hefty cuts to international aid, including slashing funds for the UN agency focused on fighting HIV/Aids from £15m to £2.5m, will hardly help the situation. Meanwhile, 70% of Britons are vaccinated against Covid, compared with 7.5% in Africa. What vaccine has arrived on the continent has been prioritised for the oldest, in line with strategies in many countries, but this means few of those with HIV are protected: about 80% of people with HIV in Africa are under 50 years old. Prof Penny Moore at the University of the Witwatersrand and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa said there was “good data” to indicate that immunocompromised people who could not clear Covid infections as quickly as others were a risk for new variants. “That includes HIV-positive people with uncontrolled viral replication, as well other groups like people on immunosuppressants,” she said. “But this is probably still a rare event. “Increasing access to Covid-19 vaccines will reduce that risk, for sure, and there is a worrying overlap between areas where HIV prevalence is high and Covid-19 vaccine coverage is low,” she added. “I do think we need to translate our sense of urgency from Sars-CoV-2 to HIV prevention and treatment in parallel to tackling uneven vaccine coverage globally.” • A heading on this article was amended on 13 December 2021 to reflect more closely the stance of the South African scientists."

          "headline": "Allegorizings by Jan Morris review – delightful musings",
          "bodyText": "There’s much to be said for idle thoughts in the right minds, and Jan Morris was particularly good at giving whimsy free rein. A writer of places and their people, she didn’t much care for the label “travel writer”, presumably because of its trivial and transactional connotations, and I doubt she would have been so grandiose as to style herself an “adventurer”. This book of brief essays, written in the last decade or so of her life and always designed to be published posthumously – “by the time you read it I shall be gone!” she writes cheerfully in her “pre-mortem” introduction – is filled with whimsy and, aside from decidedly light musings on matters such as sneezing, marmalade and hot-water bottles, she proves that being fanciful is not the enemy of seriousness. Take her jeu d’esprit in the matter of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, that “burr in the heart of the monarchy, lovely but sly”. In Morris’s view, her death was marked in precisely, diametrically, the wrong way: “The nation mourned a martyr when it should have been celebrating a miscreant.” It would have been far better, the writer suggests, had Britain embraced her true nature while she was alive, given her the royal yacht Britannia, repainted it in bright colours and instructed her to tour the world’s ports, spreading glamour and cheer on behalf of the nation. Imagine, Morris asks us, Diana and hunky entourage arriving at some dusty and remote Mediterranean island at dawn, blasting rock’n’roll by way of reveille, and leading its bemused and bewitched inhabitants in a merry dance around the harbour until wine flows from the fountains and flowers rain down on the streets. It is, if nothing else, a rather more enticing vision of noblesse oblige than those to which we have become wearily accustomed. But Morris’s penchant for allegories means that her essays are rarely “nothing else”. Threaded through these pieces is a “dedication to the proposition that nothing is only what it seems”, and a recurring fascination with applying that principle to weighty topics that range from the difference between nations and nation states, patriotism and nationalism, the contrasts between the conception and the execution of the feminist project, the subtle changes that mark the transition between countries and cultures, the past and the present. Prompted by a graffito in Trieste – a city of complex origins and identity about which Morris wrote a whole book – the writer ponders her response to its exhortation to “FUK NATIONS”, a sentiment that she grants the status of not only “considered historical opinion” but one with which she sympathises. “I dislike the word ‘nationalist’. I dislike the ungenerous, niggling, mean sound of it. In my mind it goes with wars and squabbles and prejudices and old historic quarrels best forgotten. But I am sick to death of nationality, too, and think it is a dying concept anyway. The earth is becoming just too small for political nationalities. To my mind they will one day seem as absurdly primitive as dynastic wars, or the divine right of kings.” What Morris does believe in is attachment; that a commitment to an idea, whether emotional or intellectual, is itself an inalienable form of belonging. Her elaboration of that argument in terms of patriotism – including her own proud Welshness – is both stirring and moving: “I like to imagine a world,” she writes, “in which the things that are rightly Caesar’s, like war and foreign policy and higher economics, are left to Caesar, at the centre of things; but the things that are rightly God’s, the way we think, and behave, and talk, and believe, and organise our private lives, are left to the nations.” And there is a rousing sting in the tail: “As for the Nation-States, which have done so much evil in their time, and bring out the worst in us still, fuck ’em all.” Among the several pleasures of Allegorizings are its shifts in tone and mood; alongside ideological and philosophical argument come Morris’s self-conscious indulgence of her own idiosyncrasies, and her airing of private passions (see the above marmalade, which sparks a revelation that Morris eats the stuff with apples when she is being austere, and sausages when seeking hedonism). She is, on occasion, like a faintly ironised Charles Pooter, wondering where England’s glories have been hidden as she takes a train through the industrial heartlands of the Midlands, reflecting that those glories “were almost beyond my imagination, indeed, as I masticated the Penn State Sour Cream and Chive-Flavoured Pretzels with which Virgin Rail sustains its first-class passengers”. Naturally, given that Morris wrote these pieces towards the end of her life – she died in November last year, at the age of 94 – there is a fair amount about the challenges of ageing; the time when you might begin to keep a note of the best cities, in terms of helpful bystanders, in which to fall over. Her account of a cruise holiday is wonderfully delicate, seeing her move from a mild and comical suspicion of her fellow travellers to a whole-hearted admiration for their determination to extract maximum pleasure from their surroundings, even in the face of limitations. She begins the voyage by christening the ship the Geriatrica, but ends by renaming it the SS Indomitable, bookending her story with a woman who quotes Groucho Marx to her at the beginning of the holiday but gets it wrong: “‘It goes like this,’ said she. ‘Next to a dog, a book is a man’s best friend, but inside it’s too dark to read anyway. Isn’t that hilarious? I just love it.’” Morris is non-plussed. On the final day aboard, she pops up again, having worked out her mistake: “‘I knew I’d got that Groucho story wrong. I’ve been thinking about it all this time, and this is how it should go: Outside of a dog, a book is a man’s best friend, but inside it’s too dark to read anyway.”’ “This time I really did laugh,” writes Morris. “I marvelled that throughout our voyage, in museum, taverna and Seafarers’ Lounge, she had been assiduously worrying out that joke; and even as she spoke my eyes strayed to the Sunshine Promenade above her head, where the passengers were seizing their last chance of seaboard exercise around the measured mile.” Really significant writers are made so by the quality of their noticing, their attention to what happens both when they are there and when they are not. Allegorizings might be an addendum to a life that brought us so much of this kind of significant work, but it’s a welcome and delightful one. • Allegorizings by Jan Morris is published by Faber (£14.99).

          "bodyText": "That’s it for the live blog today. But before we go, let’s recap the biggest stories from Saturday 11 December 2021. New South Wales recorded 560 new cases, and three Covid-related deaths. It is the highest daily case tally recorded in NSW since 9 October, and the second day in a row with more than 500 infections. The state also recorded three more cases of the Omicron variant, bringing the total to 45. Victoria recorded 1,193 new Covid cases and 13 deaths. The ACT recorded 11 new coronavirus infections. There are five people in hospital, two of whom are in intensive care; none are ventilated. The latest figures show that 98.2% of the territory’s population aged 12 and older are fully vaccinated. Queensland recorded one new community case of Covid. The state health minister, Yvette D’Ath, also announced new changes to quarantine rules. From 1 January, Queenslanders who are fully vaccinated and deemed close contacts will only have to quarantine for seven days, rather than 14. South Australia recorded seven new Covid cases. The Northern Territory recorded one new Covid-19 case. As a result, the remote Northern Territory community of Beswick entered a three-day lockout from 2pm this afternoon. A food and beverage staff member who worked at the Sydney Opera House from 8 to 9 December, the same time that the Aacta awards were taking place, has tested positive for Covid-19. NSW Health said those who were at the Opera House at the same time have not been deemed close or casual contacts, but should monitor for symptoms. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, is attending a G7 meeting this weekend, despite the fact that Australia is not a member state. The meeting is billed as a show of unity against China and Russia amid growing international tensions. Cricket Australia officially confirmed that the fifth Ashes Test will be played in Hobart. At the Gabba today, Australia won the first Ashes Test and Nathan Lyon took his 400th Test wicket, becoming the third Australian bowler to achieve the feat. Western Australian police suspect that the bushfire in the Margaret River region, first reported on Wednesday, was deliberately lit. In a statement, police said that the fire had burnt about 5,500 hectares of land as of Saturday. Based on an initial assessment of the fire scene by Strike Force Vulcan detectives, it is believed the fire was deliberately lit, and may have been ignited near Mammoth Cave. The statement went on to say: “Detectives would like to hear from anyone who saw any suspicious activity in the vicinity of Mammoth Cave on Wednesday (8 December) or who has dash-cam or mobile phone vision of people or vehicles in the area at the time.” NSW Health has sent through a statement in response to questions about a Covid-19 case at the Aacta awards at the Sydney Opera House on Wednesday night. A spokesperson for the South Eastern Sydney Local Health District said NSW Health had been notified of one case of Covid-19 in an employee who worked at the Sydney Opera House while infectious. “NSW Health has identified the venue as low risk and the SESLHD Public Health Unit is currently investigating this matter,” the spokesperson said. “People who attended the venue during the times that the employee was there are not considered close or casual contacts but must monitor for systems.” The spokesperson added that the staff member who tested positive is in isolation, and the variant has not been determined to be Omicron. Nathan Lyon has finally taken his 400th Test wicket, becoming the third Australian bowler to achieve the feat. Read the Guardian’s story about Lyon’s journey to pass 400 here: From vaccine scepticism to calls to “drain the billabong”, a growing number of Liberal and National figures are playing directly to the political fringes. Read Guardian reporter Paul Karp’s analysis as to why fringe elements within the government are appealing to the radical right: And with that, I am going to hand you over to my colleague Justine Landis-Hanley who will take you through the last bit of today. As always, it’s been a complete pleasure. Health authorities in Victoria are investigating seven suspected Omicron cases. One is a household contact of a person who has tested positive for the variant. More to come. Queensland police have commented after people wanting to cross from New South Wales into Queensland have been warned to expect delays ahead of the much-anticipated border reopening at 1am on Monday. In a media conference on Friday acting chief superintendent Rhys Wildman said there were “no plans” for special lanes at border checkpoints. We’ve looked at this a number of different ways to try and provide the best efficiency. The issue with providing a special lane for border zone residents is the vast majority of traffic is border zone residents. So we’d wind up with a lane that stretches for many kilometres and the other checkpoints would be just about empty. On Saturday, a Queensland police spokesperson said heavy vehicles are “waved through” to an inspection station on the M1 at Coomera. That’s been active since last Thursday night after we closed the heavy vehicle checkpoint on the Gold Coast Highway at Bilinga. The remote Northern Territory community of Beswick will enter a three-day lockout at 2pm today after the territory recorded one new case. The new case is a man in his 20s who tested positive to the virus after a testing blitz in Katherine. The health minister, Natasha Fyles, said authorities were “concerned” by Covid-positive wastewater detected in Beswick and Barunga. Seven new Covid cases have been recorded in SA. A spokesperson for the Opera House said that “a thorough cleaning of affected areas has been carried out and we are taking all necessary steps as required by NSW Health”. The Opera House currently has a number of measures in place in line with our Covid safety plan and our commitment to the health and safety of everyone on our site. Opera House patrons who attended the site on those dates are not required to take any action unless advised by NSW Health via the Service NSW check-in notifications. A Sydney Opera House spokesperson has confirmed that a food and beverage staff member who worked during the Aacta awards has tested positive for Covid-19. The person worked at the Opera House from 8 to 9 December. From AAP: The federal government has been accused of sitting on its hands while Australian “hero” and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange faces extradition to the US on espionage charges. Assange, 50, is wanted in the US over an alleged conspiracy to obtain and disclose classified information following WikiLeaks’ publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In January a UK court ruled Assange should not be sent to the US, citing a real and “oppressive” risk of suicide, but after a two-day appeal hearing, the high court on Friday sided with the US. The senior judges concluded the risk of suicide was mitigated by assurances from American authorities that Assange would not being held in highly restrictive prison conditions if extradited. Assange’s lawyers have said they intend to challenge the ruling with another appeal, this time in the UK’s supreme court. The federal independent MP Andrew Wilkie is calling on the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to “end this lunacy” and demand the US and UK allow Assange to be released. Mr Assange should be looking forward to spending Christmas with his two young boys and his fiancee, but instead he’s facing a 175-year jail sentence and the very real possibility of living out his final days behind bars. He is a hero, not a villain, and journalism is not a crime. Again the United Kingdom proves it’s a lackey of the United States and that Australia is delighted to go along for the ride. People wanting to cross from New South Wales into Queensland have been warned to expect delays ahead of the much anticipated border reopening at 1am on Monday. But those who have been navigating the checkpoints for months say poor traffic management is to blame for the current wait times. Queensland truck driver Michael told Guardian Australia he does three return trips to Sydney every week. So every second day I’m coming back across that border. I’ve watched it all. Michael said the checkpoint on the M1 pulls together cars and trucks into a single lane, creating a “huge bottleneck”. This was a problem when border checkpoints first began, he said, but was solved in recent months with a system where cars were sent to the left lane to be checked and trucks to the right lane where they were permitted to roll through and provide their papers at a later point. In recent weeks the checkpoint moved and it’s back to the single lane, Michael said. They’ve created the big bottleneck again and all the headaches. It’s not that there’s too many people passing through, it’s just ineffective traffic management. Queensland police did not immediately respond to questions on Saturday. Large number of travellers have begun arriving at the border ahead of the scheduled reopening on Monday morning. Stranded Queenslanders unable to enter their home state since July have been forced to live in caravans and at showgrounds in the NSW northern rivers region while waiting for the border to reopen. But authorities have warned of hours-long delays and asked people to consider travelling at a later date and to “pack their patience”. The online system where people can apply for new border passes to enter Queensland will go live at midnight on Sunday, just one hour before the border opens on Monday at 1am. The Aactas red carpet at the Sydney Opera House on Wednesday has reportedly been listed as a Covid exposure site – we are working on confirmation and will have more details for you soon. The event was attended by some of Australia’s biggest celebrities – Rebel Wilson, Taika Waititi, Sarah Snook, Rachel Griffiths, Deborah Mailman and Baz Luhrmann to name a few. The Western Australian government has created an awareness program to help deal with sexual assault and harassment in the mining industry. From AAP: A new $1.9m awareness program will address the “completely unacceptable” level of under-reporting of sexual assault and harassment in WA’s mining and resources sector. The Mental Awareness, Respect and Safety program is the WA government’s latest move to address the crisis, exposed in a recent parliamentary inquiry. The initiative aims to address mental health, workplace culture, drug and alcohol use, and mine safety issues. The culture of WA’s mining and resources workplaces have been under the spotlight this year after several women came forward to police detailing claims of assaults on major mining sites. A parliamentary inquiry prompted by the revelations heard evidence of widespread sexual misconduct within the industry. “The level of under-reporting of sexual assault and harassment in the mining and resources sector is completely unacceptable,” said WA women’s interests minister, Simone McGurk, in a statement on Saturday. “The McGowan government is acting to ensure workers – especially those working on mine sites – are safe and protected at work.” And I’ve got a better breakdown of Victoria’s Covid numbers. Yesterday, 4,056 vaccine doses were administered by Victoria’s state-commissioned services. The total number of doses administered through state-run services is 4,887,560. Some 94.2% of Victorians aged 12 and over have now had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 92.0% have had two doses. This excludes the most recent commonwealth data. There are 323 Covid-19 cases in hospital in Victoria – 68 active cases in ICU, with 29 of those on a ventilator. There are an additional 44 cleared cases in ICU. Of those in hospital, 61.8% were not fully vaccinated, and of those in ICU, 81.8% were not fully vaccinated. Victoria was notified of 1,193 new cases of Covid-19 yesterday. All cases were locally acquired except for two that were acquired overseas. The 11 local government areas with the highest number of new cases are Hume, Casey, Brimbank, Whittlesea, Moreland, Greater Dandenong, Melton, Kingston, Monash, Glen Eira and Port Phillip. All locations containing new cases will be published today at Victorian Covid-19 data. There are 11,457 active cases in Victoria. The total number of confirmed cases in Victoria since the beginning of the pandemic is 134,911. There are no new confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in Victoria. To mark a century since the birth of the late Adelaide-born artist Jeffrey Smart, the National Gallery of Australia is showing 125 of his works. One reason his paintings have gone up in price is because that’s what happens when there’s a big show, such as the one at the National Gallery of Australia celebrating 100 years since his birth. Another reason is love. Specifically, how the love for Smart’s paintings stays unrequited because it’s never wholly fulfilled. Read the full story here: The Queensland government has unveiled plans to set up an independent Environmental Protection Agency in the state. From AAP: Queensland has started the process of setting up an independent environmental regulator. The state is the only jurisdiction remaining in Australia that doesn’t have an Environmental Protection Agency dedicated to protecting the environment. In other states, EPAs work with businesses, government, community and environmental groups to reduce pollution, waste and any adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The state environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, has launched a public consultation to set up an EPA. “We made an election commitment to investigate and consult on the establishment of an independent Environmental Protection Agency to protect our environment, provide greater investment certainty, and support economic recovery,” she said in a statement on Saturday. “Queensland is the only state in Australia without an external independent Environmental Protection Agency.” The government has called for members of the public to fill in an eight-question online survey, which will be used to plan the new agency. And lastly, Leigh is asked if states should reimpose restrictions if Omicron pops off. This is what he has to say: States will make their own decisions based on the health advice that comes in. There’s still a lot of uncertainty around the Omicron variant. There’s uncertainty over whether it is more contagious. Whether it is deadlier. And how it responds to the various vaccines that are on offer. As that information emerges, we’ll be in a better place to understand how to respond to the Omicron variant. So I don’t think that any responsible politician would be answering hypotheticals as to how we should react to Omicron. We need to do it based on all of the evidence and guided by the health experts. In response to Josh Frydenberg’s announcement this morning in The Australian that the government will increase permanent migration to around 160,000 a year, Leigh says this: We don’t have the detail that would allow Australians to judge what the migration settings will look like. That’s going to go to the migration mix. It’s got to talk about how our balance between temporary and permanent, between family and the unskilled and skilled migration. There’s a lot of good work that’s been done on this by the Grattan Institute, the Migration Council. It’s not like there’s a shortage of good ideas out there. But instead, now, I feel like we’re getting a rewind of the duplicity that we saw in 2019 when the Morrison government, within months, was trying to claim credit for both the decrease and an increase in the migration intake. Leigh says the government should listen to the states rather than pick fights with them: “I know that the Morrison government is desperate to try to deflect attention away from their economic failures, their failures on vaccines and quarantine, and the way in which that has damaged Australia. But I think that rather than trying to pick fights with premiers and chief ministers, they’d be better to work with the states and territories and to focus on sorting out the issues that are clearly the remit of the federal government. Providing a sense of certainty to Australians as to what the migration settings will look like. The federal government does have clear responsibility for our external border, but instead it wants to change the conversation and talk about the internal ones. Leigh says the government has no real policy on migration: We’ve also had some announcements today around migration. Well, more headlines than announcements to be honest. Australians are wise to this mob when it comes to migration. Australian people will remember in 2019 Scott Morrison going out there and claiming a congestion-busting cut to migration. And then, just months later, Josh Frydenberg bringing down a budget that had baked into it a significant increase in Australia’s migration. They want to have it both ways. We have in Australia now record numbers of migrants who don’t have a pathway to permanency. Leigh says the Australian economy will rebound, but it will be because of the Australian people – not the government. The Morrison government is a little bit like a guy who digs a really deep hole and then wants people to pat him on the back because he starts to make his way out of it. The fact is the Australian economy is struggling. Right now, we’ve got real wages going backwards. We’ve got housing affordability at historic lows. And we have many Australians feeling that their pay packet just isn’t keeping up with the cost of living. The shadow assistant minister for treasury, Andrew Leigh, is speaking in Canberra, in response to Josh Frydenberg’s presser earlier which made the argument for strong economic bounce back. Leigh says: While good governments take the blame on their own shoulders and pass the credit on to others, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg are just the opposite. The moment the Australian economy is struggling, they’re nowhere to be seen, but they’re racing for a headline the moment there’s any chance for an uptick. At the start of this year, Australia had the slowest vaccine rollout in the advanced world. And in the September quarter, partly as a result of that, we recorded the worst quarterly growth performance in the advanced world. Look out Queensland – new contact tracing locations have just been added to the list: A Perth man who practised as a psychiatrist is facing nine child abuse charges. From AAP: WA police say their investigation into the 47-year-old began after they received information relating to his activities while he was practising as a psychiatrist, between 2012 and 2016. The probe found another nine victims, the police say. Police raided addresses associated with the man and seized various items. The man was then charged with seven counts of indecent dealings with a child under 13 and two charges of indecent dealings with a child under 16. The man, from Success, will face Perth magistrates court on Saturday. Police are calling for anyone with relevant information to come forward. Earlier we had some lines from Lane Sainty on the Western Australian bushfires. But you can read the full story here: The New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has talked up the trans-Tasman friendship in an interview with AAP: Jacinda Ardern insists the trans-Tasman friendship with Australia is in fine health, and she won’t join the international pile-on critiquing Scott Morrison’s foreign engagement. But nor is the New Zealand prime minister willing to support her Australian counterpart for recent dealings that have left France fuming, the US cold and have further provoked China. In a rare sit-down interview with Australian media, Ardern said she hadn’t drawn any conclusions about Morrison’s trustworthiness from the Aukus episode, which upset a trio of world powers. “I don’t have to base the relationship on what I observe of others because I’ve got my own experience to base the relationship on,” she said from her Wellington office. The two leaders’ most recent dealing came last week, when New Zealand joined Australian forces in the Solomon Islands to diffuse tensions there. “We do stay in regular contact ... and we don’t schedule it, we just pick up the phone,” Ardern said. The trans-Tasman relationship is pivotal to New Zealand, which has one-fifth of Australia’s population and a GDP seven times smaller. Australia’s centrality was demonstrated this week by new opposition leader Christopher Luxon, who was quizzed by TVNZ’s QandA program after taking the top job. “Our most important relationship is that of Australia ... our economy is very tied to the success of Australia,” he said. Ardern is an avid follower of Australian goings-on, referencing the vaccine rollout in Queensland and Covid-19 restrictions in the ACT during the interview. She is acutely aware of the upcoming federal election, which could unite the Australian Labor and NZ Labour parties in office – which has happened for just one year of the past three decades. She has an association with the Australian opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, having invited him to Wellington previously, and the pair maintain irregular contact but she insists she will “not jump into the politics” of Australia. “Our relationship with Australia is so important to us that I will place a priority on making sure that there is a solid one with the prime minister of Australia, and we do have a solid relationship,” Ardern said. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, is attending a G7 meeting this weekend, despite the fact that Australia is not a member state. The G7 meeting, held against the backdrop of a potential invasion of Ukraine, tensions in the South China Sea and the potential collapse of the Iran nuclear deal, is being billed by the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, as a “chance to show a united front against malign behaviour – including Russian posturing towards Ukraine”. It will also be interesting to see what happens when Payne comes face to face with her French counterpart, JLe Drian, for the first time since Australia announced the Aukus pact, effectively ending its contract to buy French submarines. Read more here: New Zealand has reported 63 new Covid cases, its lowest daily total in 52 days, which it attributes to soaring vaccination rates. AAP reports: New Zealand’s grip on its Delta outbreak continues to tighten, ahead of a major shake-up of domestic settings. On Saturday, health officials announced 63 new community Covid-19 cases, the lowest daily total in 52 days. Public health experts attribute the drop in daily cases – down from highs more than 200 in mid-November – to soaring vaccination rates. Vaccination rates are slightly above Australia’s, with 94% of Kiwis aged 12 and above partially vaccinated, and 89% fully vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer. Of Saturday’s 63 cases, 53 are in Auckland, with the rest spread across Northland, the Waikato, Taranaki and Canterbury, and a historical case in Southland. One of the Auckland cases is a border worker. An investigation will probe whether they were infected in the community or through a quarantine leak. From Wednesday, and for the first time since mid-August, the government will allow travel in and out of Auckland for all Kiwis. While travellers must show proof of vaccination or a negative test, health officials warn the spread to different corners of the country is inevitable and have urged vaccine hold-outs to inoculate themselves. New Zealand’s death toll stands at 46, after two deaths on Friday. There are 60 Kiwis in hospital, with three in intensive care. Earlier the Queensland health minister, Yvette D’Ath, also announced new changes to quarantine rules. From 1 January, Queenslanders who are fully vaccinated and deemed close contacts will only have to quarantine for seven days. On day five they will have to return a negative test to be released on day seven. After they leave quarantine they will need to continue to wear a mask outdoors and avoid high-risk settings from day eight to 14. “We don’t want you going into hospitals, aged care facilities, correctional facilities, youth detention centres and the like,” D’Ath said. “We know there is still a risk from day eight to 14, but we know that risk is reduced when you are fully vaccinated.” What better way to symbolise your favourable turn in fortune than with adorable bunnies, the sign of good luck? Comedian Hannah Gadsby has marked her return to the Sydney Opera House with four rabbits across the stage, though you will probably first notice the one in the Joan Sutherland theatre that functions as a lantern, a beacon of hope. Read our five-star review here: Firefighters are hopeful milder weather conditions on Saturday will help contain an out-of-control bushfire at Margaret River. The fire in Leeuwin-Naturaliste national park has burned through 5,200 hectares since it started on Wednesday morning in Boranup, Western Australia. The blaze was “reasonably steady overnight” but remains uncontained and uncontrolled, a Department of Fire and Emergency Services spokesperson said on Saturday morning. It is burning in an easterly direction, with more than 150 firefighters on the scene. An emergency warning remains in place for people in the national park bounded by Mammoth Cave Road to the north, Caves Road and the park boundary to the east, Grace Road and Bridle Trail to the south and the coast to the west. People in the area are urged to leave now. If they cannot, they should shelter at home in a room with two exits and water, such as a kitchen or laundry. An evacuation centre has been set up at the Margaret River Recreation Centre. Watch and act and advice warnings are in place for other parts of the Augusta-Margaret River shire. Bussell Highway has been closed between Forest Grove Road and the Brockman Highway due to heavy smoke in the area. Queensland has recorded one new community case of Covid, the state’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, has announced. The case was flagged as a potential positive on the Gold Coast yesterday and was confirmed today. The person had been potentially contagious in the community for five days on the Gold Coast between 6 and 10 December. And lastly, Frydenberg again makes his case for a strong economic comeback from the pandemic: Our strong economic support through programs like jobkeeper have put us in the position we are in today. There are some $370bn that has been accumulated on household and business balance sheets that was not there at the start of the pandemic. That is money that people have saved because they have not been able to go out and spend because of the health restrictions in place. But also the economic support that we as a government have been providing. Frydenberg is asked how the government plans to help alleviate the skills shortage. He says: Skilled workers are in high demand. We are seeing that in a range of sectors across the economy – construction, mining, agriculture, hospitality and professional services as well. We have announced that we were bringing in 200,000 people, whether they were skilled workers, whether they were people who were coming through the humanitarian intake. Obviously we made a decision to put a two-week pause on that reopening, based on medical advice at the time with respect to Omicron. We will make a decision in the coming days about the next steps with respect to that pause, but the early signs are indeed positive, as I say. We are certainly focused on opening those borders as soon as possible so that international students and skilled workers can come in and play their role across our economy. We are also investing heavily in new programs like the jobtrainer program, providing 450,000 places, of which 250,000 already have enrolments in. At the same time, we have supported apprentices. Frydenberg is talking about what advice the government has received on Omicron: The medical advice is still coming in, in terms of the Omicron variant, but we have heard from the medical professionals and the chief medical officer that it looks encouraging and that some of the early signs are more positive than initially thought. The virus is certainly highly transmissible but perhaps not as severe as other variants. We have not seen the mass hospitalisations in South Africa, for example, the vaccination rates are lower than a country like Australia, and there is no evidence, as yet, that the vaccine is not a defence against Omicron. Frydenberg is asked if all Australians could be together at Christmas – which leads, of course to discussing Western Australia: Obviously WA is taking its own decision and it needs to explain to its own public. But as the vaccination rates have lifted we have seen states be more confident that they can reopen in a Covid-safe way. I am looking forward to this Christmas. I am not getting ahead of ourselves. We have a lot of work still to do to maintain this momentum in the economic recovery, to ensure that Australians are kept safe from Covid, and next year there is an election to be won as well. Frydenberg says the pandemic is not over: The Omicron variant is a reminder of the challenges that we face. But states need to keep calm and carry on. And not overreact to the Omicron variant. Our economic recovery depends upon it. We have the vaccination rates now at record highs and that has proven to be a vital defence against Covid. So Australians can go into Christmas confident about the future, looking forward to being reunited with friends and with family, enjoying a well-deserved break after what has been a pretty trying two years. Frydenberg says with lockdowns lifting, the economy has grown strongly: Business investment is up 16% over this year and next, and that is the strongest business investment since the mining boom more than one decade ago. Non-mining investment will reach its highest level on record at $200bn. Non-mining investment, I say that again, non-mining investment will reach its record level at more than $200bn. This is a sign of growing confidence in our economy by businesses big and small and by households who are going out and spending. Frydenberg is speaking about the Australian economy, arguing government policies saved jobs and helped the economy rebound: Jobkeeper, which saved more than 700,000 jobs, the cashflow boost, $750 pensioners’ payments and others on income support. It was a team Australia moment. And what we saw was that Australia, ahead of any major advanced economy in the world, had employment levels and growth levels coming back to where they were pre-pandemic. This was a strong sign of the recovery in the Australian economy. And then we were hit by Delta. And 13 million of our fellow Australians went into an extended lockdown period. And that hurt the economy. And we saw that reflected in the September quarter of the national accounts. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is speaking now in Melbourne. There were three new cases confirmed with the Omicron variant of concern overnight, and more are expected as the results of genomic testing is confirmed. It brings the total number of Omicron cases to 45 in NSW. To date, no Omicron cases have been admitted to hospital in NSW for treatment of Covid-19. NSW recorded 560 new cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. Sadly, NSW Health is today reporting three deaths. A man in his 80s from south-western Sydney died at Liverpool Hospital. He was a resident of the Gillawarna Village Aged Care facility, where he acquired his infection. He had received three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and had underlying health conditions. This is the second death linked to this facility. A man in his 80s from eastern Sydney died at St Vincents Hospital. He had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and had underlying health conditions. A woman in her 70s from the Riverina region died at Albury Base Hospital. She had received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine and had underlying health condition. There are currently 150 Covid-19 cases admitted to hospital, with 25 people in intensive care, eight of whom require ventilation. There were 82,517 Covid-19 tests reported to 8pm last night, compared with the previous day’s total of 90,223. And we’ve got a breakdown of Covid numbers from the ACT: In the last 24 hours to 8pm, the territory recorded 11 new cases, meaning there are 76 now active. There are five people in hospital, two are in intensive care but none are ventilated. A whopping 98.2% of the population aged 12 and over are now fully vaccinated. That’s actually incredible. Details of the shock decision to close Circus Oz are emerging as circus company members meet to try to save the revolutionary 44-year-old troupe, which started as an artist collective and put Australia’s larrikin spirit on the world stage. On Friday, the board of Circus Oz released a statement saying the members of the company had voted to reject reforms proposed by its funding partners – choosing instead to wind up its operations. Good news for parts of Vicotria as that weather moves offshore. Cricket Australia has officially confirmed that the fifth Ashes Test will be played in Hobart. AAP reports: CA has confirmed the series finale, beginning on 14 January, will be a day-night Test staged at Bellerive. The ground hasn’t hosted a Test since 2016, while it has never featured in any Ashes series. The match was slated to be held in Perth, but CA hit a brick wall in its talks with Western Australia officials while trying to negotiate border exemptions. Cricket Tasmania and the Tasmanian government put together a bid that trumped the case to schedule a second Test at either the MCG or SCG. “I would like to thank all the states and territories who took part in this process,” CA chief executive Nick Hockley said. “The submissions we received were outstanding and we had no doubt that each of the venues that took part would have hosted a wonderful event. “There were a range of considerations, including commercial, logistical and operational factors.” From AAP: The cost of the floods and storms that hit Victoria earlier this year is set to rise, with the Victorian government pledging a further $73m to fund the recovery. The June storms brought down trees, caused major flooding and destroyed powerlines across the east of the state. The event affected 2 million hectares of public land, including in the Dandenong Ranges and Gippsland, state environment minister Lily D’Ambrosio says. Under the funding package announced on Saturday, $27.6m will go towards repairing roads and access tracks needed for firefighting. A further $10.7m will fund safety works in forests and parks, with work on hazardous trees costing another $7.5 million. The Gippsland riverbank also needs work, to the tune of $5.2m. The number of Australians challenging National Disability Insurance Agency decisions has exploded since July, with new data revealing a 300% increase in legal appeals. As the Morrison government confronts Labor claims about “stealth cuts” to funding packages, figures obtained by Guardian Australia confirm a huge rise in applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal over NDIS decisions. From AAP: It is the highest daily tally recorded in NSW since October 9, two days before lockdown lifted, and the second day in a row with more than 500 cases. Health authorities are concerned festive season celebrations are driving the spike in cases, and are urging caution. “The transmission in these types of settings is contributing to the increase in cases in NSW,” Dr Jeremy McAnulty said on Friday. “We urge people not to attend any of these social functions or venues if you have any symptoms at all, even if mild.” NSW Health is already battling to contain several large transmission events. A trivia night at a Sydney pub sparked a new cluster of cases, with at least 46 patrons testing positive to the virus after attending the Oxford Tavern in Petersham on November 30. Authorities are also concerned about 140 passengers who embarked on a Sydney Harbour cruise on Friday night which has so far resulted in five cases of the Omicron variant. The number of people diagnosed with the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in NSW has reached 42. The high court on Friday refused the Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum special leave to appeal a federal court ruling that federal environment laws don’t apply to logging in Victoria’s Central Highlands. The Victorian Forest Products Association and Australian Forest Products Association said the high court decision vindicated Victoria’s sustainable and essential native hardwood forest industry and the regional forest agreement framework. “Finally some common sense has prevailed with today’s High Court decision the final nail in the coffin in this long running legal saga, VFPA ceo Deb Kerr said in a statement. Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie also welcomed the decision, saying the Friends of Leadbeater’s Possum’s “green warfare” against VicForests’ native forest operations has jeopardised the livelihoods of thousands of workers throughout the timber supply chain. “Supporting forestry is not anti-environment,” the Victorian senator said in a statement. Barns says he sees no difference between what journalists do and what Julian Assange did: “What he did was to obtain information that was clearly in the public interest. It was clearly in the public interest for them to see the collateral murder video, where you see the gunning down of innocent people in Iraq by US troops. “That’s clearly in the public interest. There is no difference. And I think that there has been in the past, as you know, a debate about ‘is Assange a journalist or not?’ It doesn’t matter. “The issue is that the material that he was able to publish, and was published by other organisations such as the New York Times, is clearly in the public interest.” Barns is asked about Assange’s health: “Look, he’s remarkably stoic given the blows that he’s endured. But you know, he’s in Belmarsh Prison, which is a hellish place, usually reserved for those who have been found convicted of terrorism offences. “And environment for him and the continual blows that he’s getting through this process mean that his health continues to deteriorate. And, in fact, that was one of the points that was raised and successfully argued in front of the judge in January this year.” Greg Barns, who is an adviser and barrister with the Julian Assange campaign is talking on the ABC now about the high court of the UK ruling Assange can be extradited to the US. “It’s a very disappointing ruling. It’s a disappointing ruling for all Australians and particularly the Australian media. “What it means is that any Australian journalist who finds themselves in the ire of the United States for publishing material that deems that it doesn’t want to be published could find themselves on the end of an extradition request. “Because, of course, Assange had no contact with the United States.” Farmland prices are soaring at quadruple the rates of median growth in Australia’s capital cities – as 30-year price highs across agricultural commodities combine with low interest rates and generally good seasonal conditions. Experts are beginning to warn that the “exorbitant” price of farmland is prohibitive for those starting out, echoing city housing concerns. Two of the government’s biggest departments were found to have broken freedom of information law within a month of each other, prompting the watchdog to demand urgent explanations and reforms from both, documents show. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) last month found the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade breached the law by dragging out and eventually refusing a request by lawyer and FoI specialist Peter Timmins, documents seen by Guardian Australia show. From AAP: Dozens of shoplifters have been arrested after a three-day blitz across Sydney stores, with stolen goods worth more than $11,000 recovered. Operation Lightfingers this week targeted thieves in a number of major retail outlets across the Sydney CBD, Ultimo and Bondi areas. Some 84 people were arrested and either charged, issued a Criminal Infringement Notice or a warning. Among those sprung by police were a pair of woman, aged 31 and 26, who were allegedly trying to steal a trolley full of cosmetics and clothing worth more than $3400 from a store in Bondi Junction. For AAP: Some have been known to use the back of a kitchen knife, others the edge of a bench top and some (although don’t try this at home kids) their teeth. But popping the top off a cold one is about to get classy, with beer brewer James Squire poised to unveil Australia’s most valuable bottle opener worth a cool $30,000. The one-off collector’s item was handcrafted from sterling silver, burl walnut, grade 5 titanium and rare Damascus steel of the type used to make ancient swords, and took three years to source. The opener is destined to go under the hammer, with all proceeds of the auction to be donated to Rural Aid to support farmers in need. It’s not just the gossip-hungry who have been devouring every bit of news about marriage bust-ups among Sydney’s fund manager set – or, at least, it shouldn’t be. For while many may be reading the details of the dissolution of the marital bonds between fund manager Charlie Aitken and his wife, Ellie, with an eye to the details (Charlie has hooked up with his business partner’s wife, Hollie Nasser, who was Ellie’s best friend) investors who have put their money with Aitken Investment Management have a financial interest, not just a prurient one, in the unfolding drama. From AAP: One in five Australians in the outer suburbs have been living in “financial survival mode” during the pandemic and are more likely to feel stressed, frustrated and anxious than the national average. City reaches are home to many of the essential workers who kept the Australian economy ticking over during rolling lockdowns yet their needs are being overlooked, the National Growth Areas Alliance (NGAA) says. Analysis of over 80,000 interviews commissioned by the group reveals 21 per cent of outer metropolitan residents are in survival mode. More than half of them are struggling to pay at last one major bill, whether it be to meet their energy needs, groceries, rent or personal loans. For those aged 40 and under, the figure jumps to 64 per cent. NGAA CEO Bronwen Clark says government is failing a segment of the population representing 5.2 million people in total and growing at twice the national average. “Our outer suburbs are home to the most essential workers and faced the strictest lockdowns,” she said. “These are the communities that saw us through the pandemic and to date governments have failed to understand their needs. “Now, governments must join the dots between high COVID rates, high outbreak risk factors and the lag in social infrastructure in fast-growing outer suburbs.” Assistant Commissioner Nicola Hogan from the New South Wales SES is currently on ABC. She said they received 450 requests for assistance over the last 24 hours, 31 of those being flood rescues. “Predominantly in the south-east of the state, although we do still have significant flooding in the north-west and west of New South Wales. “There were some storms experienced in the Sydney metropolitan area also yesterday, so it was quite a day of wild weather that we were experiencing over the last 24 hours.” For those ready and raring for some searing political analysis this morning, I’ve got this piece from Katherine Murphy for you ... An emergency warning remains in place for a fire burning near Margaret River in Western Australia’s south-west. Despite conditions easing yesterday, the blaze at the Leeuwin-Naturaliste national park is still out of control. It has burned through about 6,000 hectares, but so far no buildings have been destroyed. Good morning, this is Cait Kelly – we will be going through the day’s news together. The number of cases of the Omicron Covid variant from a Sydney Harbour cruise is expected to grow. Last night, NSW Health added two new Covid exposure sites visited by confirmed cases linked to the cruise that could be the Omicron strain – the Albion Hotel in Parramatta and the Cult nightclub in Potts Point. There are two suspected Omicron cases in South Australia while Victoria has had three instances of the variant, two of which were in hotel quarantine yesterday. New South Wales has 42 Omicron cases of the strain but none have yet been admitted to hospital. Overall infections are on the rise in NSW. The state reported 516 new cases on Friday, its highest daily caseload in two months. Victoria recorded 1,206 daily infections and two more deaths. The ACT detected six additional cases and the Northern Territory four, while there were six locally acquired cases in Queensland. National cabinet was focusing on Omicron yesterday, with the country’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, saying health experts were in the early stages of understanding the variant. We’re going to be bringing you updates from Margaret River, where a huge bushfire has been raging the past few days. The clean-up is continuing in the NSW south coast town of Mogo, where there was flooding yesterday, including up to 200mm in some parts. And with that, let’s get cracking on the news."

          "bodyText": "The big cherry tree in the garden clung to its yellowing foliage throughout the damp, still autumn, then shed the lot in two days. Beyond the branches lie vistas unseen for months. I spend a half-hour watching a man repoint a chimney 100 metres away. I switch over to check on a loft extension going up nearby, just by swivelling in my chair. I don’t do this because I have nothing else to do; I do it because I have too much else to do. Once it gets dark there is nothing to watch. My wife and I sit in front of the TV, taking turns to change channels. We use the other remote to swap between the two black boxes that provide different, if largely overlapping, programme selections. “Why aren’t we watching this?” my wife says, showing me a text recommendation from a friend. “We don’t have that,” I say. “I thought we had everything,” she says. “Our package doesn’t include that channel,” I say. “I can’t believe there’s nothing on,” she says. “What about that other thing?” “I know the exact thing you’re talking about,” I say. “The critically acclaimed thing.” “Yes,” she says. “We don’t have that either. We’d have to download the app, open an account, and pay,” I say. “Oh,” my wife says, crushed. “Or,” I say, “we could sign up for a free trial, watch the shit out of it for seven days and then cancel.” “Yes,” she says. “Let’s do that.” After an hour’s investigation with the remote in one hand and my phone in the other, followed by a mildly humiliating consultation with our youngest son, I concede defeat. “What’s the problem?” my wife says. “The problem is the smaller of the black boxes – let’s call it Box B,” I say. “It’s too primitive to support the relevant app, which is a bit of a dead end. Unless.” “Unless what?” “Unless we get a new box for £40, opening ourselves up to a whole new world of costly viewing.” “That sounds like a complete waste of money,” my wife says. “I agree,” I say. “And that’s before we even start signing up to … oops!” “Oops what?” “I accidentally pressed Buy Now.” The next morning the chimney man is gone, his repointing work evidently completed. I can hear someone using a saw on a nearby roof, but my line of sight is obstructed by a large and still leafy oak. It is immensely frustrating; I have no choice but to work. In the afternoon a small package arrives for me: the new Box B. It takes me until nightfall to connect it to the television and the internet, before I encounter a major stumbling block. The old Box B, I learn, was linked to an account that belonged to my wife. “What was the password?” I say. “For what?” she says. We spend a further half-hour trying the kinds of passwords my wife favoured in 2015, before hitting on it. “The two exclamation points at the end,” she says, “that was for security.” Downloading the relevant app is simple, but signing up for the service is a task has to be completed on another device, which proves insurmountable. I call the middle one. He picks up his mother’s iPad and sets to work. “It says you’ve already used your free trial,” he says. “Did I?” my wife says. “When?” “In 2019,” he says. “Have you been paying since then?” “I don’t know,” my wife says. “You’ve spent two years paying for a service we were technologically incapable of accessing?” I say. “Possibly,” she says, smiling. But it proves not to be the case. A fresh account is created, after which the middle one drops the iPad on the sofa and leaves the room. “Ready to start the seven days?” I say, thumb hovering over the remote. “Are you joking?” my wife says. “It’s half past 10. I’m going to bed.” Left alone with the new box, I try to find something else to watch, maybe a channel devoted to people working on chimneys. This proves impossible. Eventually I go upstairs to the youngest one’s room. “Sorry if this sounds insane,” I say. “But do we have a password for Channel 4?” The level gaze he fixes on me is withering in its mockery, without giving even a hint of whether the answer is yes or no."

          "bodyText": "There are places in the Welsh hills where I’m assailed with a sense of unease. Often they are hill-passes. Below Garn Prys, the descent from Bwlch Blaen y Cwm alongside the Nant Llan-gwrach – “stream of the witch’s enclosure” – always brings an involuntary shiver; as does that from Bwlch y Ddwy Elor – “the pass of the two biers” – into Cwm Trwsgl, the “rough cwm”, and thence into Cwm Pennant. I walked this way recently in bright wintry weather and still felt a certain dread that only faded as I emerged from the cwm and started the rattly descent over slate spoil to the old tramway that contours round the western slopes of Moel Lefn and Moel Hebog. If anywhere in Wales is my milltir sgwâr, my own square mile, this is it. I lived here alone in a remote farmhouse through the most formative years of my life, walked these hills in all weathers, at all seasons. Bwlch y Ddwy Elor is one of the places I then mostly avoided. Was it just the quality of suggestion implicit in the name? Whatever it was, I’d hurry away. In Cwm Trwsgl, perhaps the physical form shapes the atmospherics? The huge, vegetated, falcon-haunted cliff that towers above the frozen llyn shadows the mountain hollow, acts as a sounding board for wind and rattle of stone. I’ve had doppelganger experiences here. Were they just amplifications of my own anxious heartbeat? Once, when hanging on a rope in the mist to clean a prospective new rock-climb on the fine, diamond-shaped slab above the pass into Beddgelert forest, all day I sensed voices drifting up from bronze age hut-circles below. Dusk thickened the mist. I coiled my ropes and hastened away. The name I gave to the climb, when completed, was the Exterminating Angel, from certain inescapably anxious moments experienced on it when faced with a fall on to boulders from the crux at 60ft. That feeling again hovered at my back this week as I gained the tramway’s sublime grassy belvedere, which contours round into Cwm Ystradllyn and a waiting car. • Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

          "bodyText": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a billionaire in possession of a sprawling media empire must be in want of a steady supply of bullshit. With the recent purchase of a Montana cattle ranch, home to 7,000 head, Rupert Murdoch now has access to more of the stuff than even Tucker Carlson could hope to shovel. The ranch, located in the south-west of the state, not too far from Yellowstone national park, was bought from Matador Cattle Co, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, for about $200m, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The ranch’s sale, between the two driving forces behind the conservative movement in the United States, is the largest in Montana’s history. “This is a profound responsibility,” Murdoch said in a statement. “We feel privileged to assume ownership of this beautiful land and look forward to continually enhancing both the commercial cattle business and the conservation assets across the ranch.” The property is reported to cover roughly 340,000 acres, and span 50 miles from north to south, including “4,000 elk, 800 antelope and 1,500 mule deer” as well as a “28-mile-long creek stocked with trout” and 25 homes for employees, according to a representative for the Murdochs. According to at least one neighbor and fellow rancher, John Jackson, the chairman of the Beaverhead county commission, the Koches “have been good neighbors”, as he told the Billings Gazette. He did not expect much to change with the Murdochs moving in, although it’s unclear how much time the 90-year-old media scion will be spending there (a spokesperson said the family do intend to spend time on the ranch). Many on social media were quick to joke about the parallels between the sale of the ranch and the HBO hit Succession, about a family loosely based on the Murdochs, as well as the Kevin Costner program Yellowstone. Another recent highly lauded work of fiction, the Jane Campion film The Power of the Dog, is set on a Montana ranch. In the film, head rancher and son of wealth Benedict Cumberbatch proves unable to connect with those around him and sets out to ruin the lives of everyone he encounters. Koch Industries has been busy selling off similar properties around the US of late, including one in Kansas listed for around $24m and one in Texas at about $124m. The prospect of the world’s richest families hustling to trade remote properties stocked with enough livestock and water to survive on for years is probably nothing to be alarmed about for the rest of us. • This article was amended on 13 December 2021 to remove references to the “Koch brothers” as sellers (via a Koch Industries subsidiary) of the ranch. Charles and David Koch were the two main owners of Koch Industries, but the latter died in 2019, since when his heirs have owned his share."

          "bodyText": "Florida wildlife officials will undertake a manatee feeding and rescue operation involving hand-feeding the mammals romaine lettuce, amid unprecedented mortality among the gentle aquatic creatures affectionately known as “sea cows”. Typically, manatees return to warm water winter feeding grounds, where they feast on plentiful seagrass. But algal blooms from polluted waters have devastated seagrass beds, and thereby wiped out the important food source for the manatees. Algal blooms and manatee deaths have been especially pronounced along Florida’s Atlantic coast, leading to record-breaking mortality. “Our agencies and Unified Command partners carefully considered all aspects of a short-term feeding trial,” said Shannon Estenoz, assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks with the federal Department of Interior, in a release. “It is critical we help manatees in the short term with actions that are compatible with their long-term wellbeing and resilience.” Normally slow-moving and plump, manatees along Florida’s east coast have shown signs of starvation, and appeared emaciated with protruding ribs. Manatee deaths have overwhelmed local rescue groups and even the ecosystem. Hundreds of manatee carcasses have had to be towed to remote islands, where they have been left to rot, the Palm Beach Post reported. “They are starving, and I see it in person,” Paul Fafeita, president of the Clean Water Coalition of Indian River county, told local television station CBS12 in Palm Beach. “I’m out there all the time. I’m witnessing it. It’s heart wrenching.” As a result, Florida and federal government wildlife officials said they would begin an operation to hand-feed manatees romaine lettuce, among other efforts. A temporary field response station is also expected to be set up in the Indian River Lagoon, on the coast near Orlando, where many deaths have occurred. The Florida state legislature increased an annual stipend for manatee rescue to $8m. Initial 2021 manatee mortality data from the state’s conservation department showed more than 1,000 manatees have died. Manatees are an endangered species. The most recent aerial survey of Florida manatee populations found only about 5,700 in Florida, according to Save the Manatee. In the last five years, an average of 500 manatees have died. By comparison in 2001, just 325 manatees were found dead, with boats among their biggest killers."

          "bodyText": "Three years before co-founding Bridal Babes – a bridal e-commerce boutique that caters to Black and brown wedding parties – Ashley Young was just another Black bride trying to find the perfect bridesmaid dresses. “My girls were of all shapes and sizes, and they wanted to show off the melanin and show off the curves,” Young, the company’s CEO recalls. “We needed sexy, form-fitting dresses in bold, bright colors.” But traditional bridal shops fell short. Young took her search off the beaten path, eventually finding a strappy, figure-hugging design in a sumptuous coral shade that worked with each of her bridesmaids’ complexions. Young realized then that there was a gap to be filled in the $57bn US wedding industry and, in 2019, Bridal Babes was born. Young and her husband, Charles, completely bootstrapped the business. Their efforts quickly paid off, thanks in part to the brand’s innovative virtual consultation services and remote, online showcases – services that would later become industry standard due to Covid. “I like to brag that we were doing virtual consultations a year before David’s Bridal got with the program and launched theirs,” Young says. Being ahead of the curve gave Bridal Babes its first profitable year in 2020, and Young says that the brand is on track to turn a $1m revenue for 2021. And that’s just the beginning. What do you think is driving the success of Bridal Babes? Young: We found this niche. Women of color and women with curves are often overlooked in the bridal industry. These women are in their twenties and early thirties, sometimes even younger, and they want to show off. I think having people that are thinking of women of color as they’re developing the product selection is vital. In our culture, curves are celebrated; we don’t want to mask them or hide under a big tent. When we’re modeling plus-size clothing we use a real plus-size model, not a size 14. People appreciate that because they want to know what they will look like in the dress. Bridal Babes had its first profitable year during the height of the pandemic. How did you adjust your business to be successful despite all the restrictions of 2020? Young: We have an online network of over 65,000 brides of color who tell us what they want. They were telling us they wanted bridal shower dresses, courthouse dresses, and T-shirts to show off their new status as wives. So even though people weren’t having big weddings, they were still getting married, and they told us how we could still pivot and be profitable. We listened to them and made the shifts in our inventory. What’s your husband’s role in the company? Young: We are co-founders and he quit his job to run the business. People see him and are surprised he’s in bridal, but he definitely manages more of the logistics and operations side as the president and COO. As you can imagine, we get thousands of dresses from our production facility each month, and they have to go out to our customers. So, he manages all the supply chain issues and the inventory issues. What does it mean to you to build this business with your spouse? Young: We want to be an example for Black love and Black families. Many of us in the Black community don’t see entrepreneurship in the way the general public sees it. We haven’t always had models to show us the value of providing jobs for your community and providing jobs for your family, and potentially selling your business or having an IPO that can create millions upon millions of dollars. Growing this business to provide a legacy and generational wealth for our family is important, and helping our community figure out ways to do that for themselves is at the heart of what we’re doing."

          "headline": "The arguments about abortion in the US are about one thing: controlling women",
          "bodyText": "A lot of people with a lot of power don’t see why women should have jurisdiction over their own bodies. That’s the anti-abortion argument in a nutshell, in that they claim a foetus, or even an embryo, or in some cases even a fertilised egg too small for the human eye to see, has rights that supersede those of the person inside whose body that egg, embryo or foetus might be. What was clear from the rightwing pundits and conservative supreme court justices who have piped up over the last month as arguments were being heard in the most significant abortion rights case since Roe v Wade, is that in a country whose constitution is supposed to grant us all a lot of rights, they are happy to strip away a right so fundamental it’s unimaginable in other circumstances – or that it would be stripped from other people, namely men. In the case, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the state of Mississippi is asking the court to rule on whether it can outlaw abortions after 15 weeks’ gestation. They are asking, in other words, for the right to punish women for being women. On Friday morning, the supreme court issued a mixed ruling on another state law restricting abortion access: Texas’s law, designed to evade federal oversight. Eight of the justices upheld a lower court finding that abortion providers should have the right to sue; Justice Thomas did not join them. The four more liberal judges voted for broader rights to sue; the four other conservatives ruled that they can only sue the licensing officials. Judge Sotomayor, in a passionate dissent, wrote: “This is a brazen challenge to our federal structure. It echoes the philosophy of John C Calhoun, a virulent defender of the slaveholding South who insisted that States had the right to “veto” or “nullif[y]” any federal law with which they disagreed.” She added: “The Nation fought a Civil War over that proposition.” Before the civil war, the US was split between free and slave states; the contemporary nation is increasingly divided between reproductive-rights-access states and anti-abortion states. The goal of the anti-abortionists seems to be to enhance men’s privileges by undermining women’s rights, by making us separate and unequal. (People who do not identify as female also get pregnant and bear children, but the animosity is directed at women and girls, so I’m going to talk about women and girls here.) Since acknowledging this would undermine the anti-abortion case, the emphasis is instead shifted to someone else whose rights are claimed to trump those of pregnant people, the unborn. The unborn are a convenient constituency to advocate for, since they have no voice or vote and anyone can claim to speak for them. Those who claim to protect the unborn are largely conservatives who routinely reject universal access to healthcare, let alone meeting the basic material needs of babies and children with food, clothing, shelter and daycare. They also usually oppose reproductive education, including by defunding and demonising Planned Parenthood (which is where, as a teen, I got the reproductive care that protected me from an unwanted pregnancy). This is how we know that foetuses are not the real subject here. Miscarriages are not generally regarded by anti-abortionists as a loss of human life, unless it’s to criminalise women, some of whom have been sent to prison for miscarrying after allegedly endangering foetuses through their actions. Substance use in pregnancy is considered child abuse in 23 US states, but no one will go to prison for endangering both mother and child through denial of basic needs. Accounts suggest that most of the women being punished under these laws are women of colour. It is widely known that abortion restrictions primarily punish poor and minority-ethnic people too. Wanted pregnancies are often the occasion for impregnators to preen themselves and be congratulated, but unwanted pregnancies are treated as something wicked that women do all on their own. No man is punished under the law for unwanted pregnancy, though a significant percentage of such pregnancies are the result of sexual coercion and refusing to cooperate with birth control. Then there is the risk of homicide – one study showed that 8.4% of reported maternal mortality deaths were murders – with African American women seven times more likely to die this way than white women. The largest proportion of these cases occur at the hands of a partner. There is no other experience that could be so brutal physically and psychologically, could disable for months or result in permanent disability and injury, or even death, that anyone says an individual must undergo when there is a clear and comparatively safe alternative. (Maybe the military draft in times of war is the closest equivalent when it comes to risk and loss of self-determination, and I’m against that too.) Wanted pregnancies and births can be wonderful as well as intense, and I know plenty of people who experienced it that way. But pregnancy and birth can also be, as one of my friends who is the mother of two teens put it, harrowing. I remember a friend’s first pregnancy when she couldn’t stop throwing up, know of people who were bedridden for months, have heard of pelvic bones that broke, hips that came out of their sockets, chronic pain, cases of eclampsia that were life-threatening or fatal, miscarriages that led to haemorrhages. “Women in our nation are dying -- before, during and after childbirth,” said Kamala Harris this week announcing significant investment in maternal health. “In the United States of America, in the 21st century, being pregnant and giving birth should not carry such great risk.” We all know the sheer awkwardness of people in their third trimester who are heavily laden, often exhausted, in a body so transformed in size and function that it no longer feels like their own. To make someone undergo that involuntarily is punitive. To argue that pregnancy doesn’t really disrupt a life is ridiculous, but the supreme court’s Amy Coney Barrett did so when, during the hearing, she asked why the fact that babies could be given up at birth didn’t relieve women of the burden, arguing that if “forced parenting, forced motherhood, would hinder women’s access to the workplace and to equal opportunities … why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?” Imagine telling a woman working as a janitor or a dancer or a farmer or trying to make law partner or compete in her sport that she’s unimpaired by her visibly changing body – and the physical and psychological impacts of it – because she can give away the baby at birth without being criminalised for it? It was also stunning that Barrett recognised that the subject was “forced motherhood”. Given that the majority of abortions are for women who already have children, imagine the impact on the other children of watching their mother go through an unwanted pregnancy and birth. A lot of women choose abortion out of love for their existing children and the desire to parent them as well as possible. The literature of early birth control advocates is full of the desperation of women who could not cope with the physical impact of another pregnancy and birth and the economic burden and workload of another child to care for. Medical providers I know who worked in a remote part of the Himalayas told me of women who came to them for birth control, swearing they would rather die than have another child. With illegal abortions, an alarming percentage of women do die. The mother of another friend of mine died giving birth to that friend’s younger sister, and I know of the brutality of caesarean sections, of 36-hour labours, of the rips and tears of vaginal birth that can cause incontinence, fistulas, and other permanent injuries. The hormonal changes are changes in consciousness, and for people whose wellbeing is already fragile, the experience can be devastating, and when it’s an unwanted pregnancy it can be more than that. The experience of bringing a new human life into the world is profound, and to make it involuntary is monstrous. Denying abortion without exceptions is saying that it’s fine for a child impregnated by her father to have to carry the child to term. We don’t force anyone to donate a kidney to someone dying of kidney failure; forcing someone to donate their body as an incubator is also an outrage. The late-term abortions that get so much attention are both rare and usually because the foetus is dead, not viable, or the mother’s life is at risk. Ireland’s voters legalised abortion after a dentist in Galway undergoing a miscarriage was unable to have the abortion that would have saved her from death. The lawyer arguing the case before the supreme court for women’s reproductive rights answered Barrett’s blithe nonsense thus: “Pregnancy itself is unique. It imposes unique physical demands and risks on women and, in fact, has impact on all of their lives, on their ability to care for other children, other family members, on their ability to work. And, in particular, in Mississippi, those risks are alarmingly high. It’s 75 times more dangerous to give birth in Mississippi … than it is to have a pre-viability abortion, and those risks are disproportionately threatening the lives of women of colour.” Or as the supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor put it, “So when does the life of a woman and putting her at risk enter the calculus?” She knew, we know, that for those who are committed to the punitive violence of forced birth the answer is: never.

          "headline": "War of words: ABC and News Corp journalists condemn Friendlyjordies’ verbal attack on Nicolle Flint ",
          "bodyText": "Annabel Crabb stuck her head above the parapet to defend Liberal MP Nicolle Flint this week, a particularly noble act when you consider the member for Boothby in South Australia criticised Crabb’s ABC program Ms Represented as unfair to conservative women. “There are very few reasons left to watch the ABC,” Flint wrote in the Australian newspaper in July. “However, Annabel Crabb’s new ABC TV program, Ms Represented, provides an excellent excuse to turn on the television, then turn it off again, and formally complain.” Harsh. But Crabb was acting on the principle not the personality when she responded to an article in the Australian by David Penberthy about a Friendlyjordies video, Enemy to Women? Curiously, the South Australian correspondent for the Oz referred to the video variously as an “abusive episode of his podcast” and a “profanity-laden post”. Penberthy reported that Friendlyjordies, whose real name is Jordan Shanks, “repeatedly tells Ms Flint to ‘f..k off’ from politics and also refers to her as ‘Dick-hole Flint’” and a “whiny little bitch”. The report prompted both Crabb and the Labor MP Tanya Plibersek – who is one of the ALP figures to have been in interviewed by the YouTube star – to condemn Shanks. Weekly Beast listened closely to the video and couldn’t hear the words “Dick-Hole Flint” but we are happy to be corrected. On Friday, Penberthy reported in a follow-up article that Shanks denied saying the phrase, after the comedian sent him a statement about the “multiple falsehoods” in the article. We’ve asked Penberthy to clarify whether he still believes the phrase is in the 15-minute video. As for the “whiny little bitch” insult, the phrase originated in a video last year in which Shanks compares the public figures who complain about insults with those who accept that sledging goes with the territory. “Everyone in public life cops it,” Shanks said. “It’s only the whiny little bitches like Nicolle Flint, Clive Palmer and John Barilaro who have a sook.” Equal opportunity insults perhaps? False flagging Staying on Adelaide media, InDaily journalist Tom Richardson revealed the cosy relationship between News Corp’s Advertiser and the South Australian government this week, and how occasionally it blows up in their face. Richardson says “a key plank of the Government’s COVID messaging has long been to use the daily paper as a community noticeboard to flag its intentions” and non-News Corp editors have written to the government to warn of the damage to the public health messages. One danger may be that the Advertiser is so confident it has the inside track that it publishes information before final decisions have been made within government. The ‘Tiser had a drop last Friday which said an “emergency lockout” was coming “within days”. “It is understood the crackdown will ban all but essential travel to SA while fully vaccinated returning SA residents would be required to quarantine for seven days,” the article stated. Understandably South Australians were devastated. But on Saturday, authorities said there was no lockdown. It may have been proposed, but in the end the recommendation was not accepted. “This was extraordinarily detailed information, confidently presented as insider knowledge,” Richardson said. “This was, rather, a briefing – of the kind that has occurred week in, week out throughout this pandemic as the central strategy in the government’s health messaging.” ‘No big deal’ The Australian’s former economics editor, now Washington correspondent, Adam Creighton has drawn attention to himself during the pandemic by criticising public health responses to Covid-19. Creighton has characterised strict lockdowns as an affront to personal liberty and called them “health fascism”. He recently wrote that it was “shocking how this OMICRON ‘variant’, which appears not to have killed a single person in the world, has prompted such massive disruption to millions of people, all implicitly cheered on by the media”. In April he tweeted: “Covid19 has killed free speech. Covid 19 will be the most formative event of my life. Virtue signalling dominates truth. The West is finished.” So an article by Creighton headed “I caught Covid and it was no big deal” attracted a great deal of attention online. Most of it was mocking. “I own a house so buying a house is no big deal,” was just one answer to Creighton. “Aren’t you the champion? I drove my car and didn’t die, I don’t know why we’re bothering with all of these road rules,” was another of the more than 800 largely negative responses. ABC accolades In 2018 the ABC TV drama Mystery Road became the most watched non-children’s program in history on ABC iview, and has won critical accolades across the board. But it had other benefits – series one also contributed to regional expenditure in remote Western Australia of more than $3.3m and 300 locals were hired as extras and in on-set support and intern roles, according to a report by Deloitte Access Economics published this week. The report details the ABC’s contribution to the national economy: screen commissions contributed $744m and supported more than 8,000 roles over three years, bringing financial, social and cultural benefits to the country. The role of the ABC in Australia’s production sector was also highlighted by Screen Australia’s drama report, which revealed the number of television shows produced for Australian children had halved since the Morrison government scrapped quotas for commercial broadcasters. Of the seven children’s shows produced in 2020-21, six were financed by the ABC. The report reveals that from 2017-18 to 2019-20, the ABC commissioned 433 screen productions that delivered more than 2,500 hours of Australian content to viewers. Murdoch merriment The release of the Senate report backing a call by Kevin Rudd for an inquiry into the Murdoch media empire could not have come on a more appropriate day. It was tabled in parliament hours before Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch hosted their annual Christmas bash in Sydney’s Bellevue Hill for politicians, media personalities and the business elite. The Labor and Greens senators on the committee recommended a judicial inquiry with the powers of a royal commission into media diversity, ownership and regulation – although Labor’s media spokeswoman, Michelle Rowland, immediately ruled it out as ALP policy. Committee chair Sarah Hanson-Young: “The evidence that the Murdoch media empire is indeed a dangerous monopoly was heard loud and clear.” The rhetoric didn’t seem to bother the Liberal MP Dave Sharma or the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, who were guests at the soiree alongside Qantas boss Alan Joyce, Atlassian founder and billionaire Scott Farquhar, the former NRL and FFA boss David Gallop and racing and rugby league administrator Peter V’landys. Everyone from Murdoch’s Australasian chief, Michael Miller, and Sky News Australia boss Paul Whittaker were invited, and presenters Peter Stefanovic, Chris Kenny, Paul Murray and Sharri Markson made the grade. For the record, the report defines media concentration by saying Australia now has only three national-scale commercial media voices. The biggest is News Corp, which controls about two-thirds of metropolitan daily newspaper circulation, Sky News and a free-to-air channel in regional areas. Next is Nine Entertainment, which owns the Nine television network, and the former Fairfax mastheads the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age and the Australian Financial Review, as well as digital properties. The third player is Kerry Stokes in Western Australia, who holds a controlling interest in Seven West Media Ltd, which controls the West Australian, Perth’s Sunday Times and the Community Newspaper Group, which owns 23 local newspapers across Perth, as well as the Seven TV network."

          "headline": "Hillary Clinton’s victory speech – and others that were never heard ",
          "bodyText": "It was one of the most significant branching points in recent history – and at least one artefact of the way things might have been still exists. On Wednesday the Today show in the US released a video of Hillary Clinton reading the speech she would have given if she had beaten Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Clinton, who is giving a course in “the power of resilience” with the online education company Masterclass, teared up as she read aloud from her speech. She said reading it entailed “facing one of my most public defeats head-on”. To those who viewed the election of Trump as an epoch-defining catastrophe, the excerpt was an agonising glimpse of an alternative future. Clinton said: “Fundamentally, this election challenged us to decide what it means to be an American in the 21st century. And by reaching for unity, decency and what President Lincoln called ‘the better angels of our nature’, we met that challenge.” She reflected on the significance of what her election as the first female US president would have meant. “I’ve met women who were born before women had the right to vote. They’ve been waiting a hundred years for tonight. I’ve met little boys and girls who didn’t understand why a woman has never been president before. Now they know, and the world knows, that in America every boy and every girl can grow up to be whatever they dream – even president of the United States.” Clinton grew emotional as she read a passage about her mother, who died in 2011. She said: “I dream of going up to her, and sitting down next to her, taking her into my arms and saying: ‘Look at me. Listen to me. You will survive. You will have a good family of your own. And three children. And as hard as it might be to imagine, your daughter will grow up and become the president of the United States.” Clinton’s speech, which she said she had never previously read aloud, enters a canon of speeches never given – for reasons that were variously a relief, a disappointment or a matter of ongoing political dispute. Here are some other examples of the genre. ‘Whatever terrors lie in wait for us all’: Queen Elizabeth II’s speech for the outbreak of nuclear war, 1983 Written by civil servants during one of the most tense periods of the cold war, and released in 2013 under the 30-year rule. “The horrors of war could not have seemed more remote as my family and I shared our Christmas joy with the growing family of the Commonwealth. Now, this madness of war is once more spreading through the world and our brave country must again prepare itself to survive against great odds … “I have never forgotten the sorrow and the pride I felt as my sister and I huddled around the nursery wireless set listening to my father’s [George VI’s] inspiring words on that fateful day in 1939 [at the start of the second world war]. Not for a single moment did I imagine that this solemn and awful duty would one day fall to me. “But whatever terrors lie in wait for us all, the qualities that have helped to keep our freedom intact twice already during this sad century will once more be our strength … As we strive together to fight off this new evil, let us pray for our country and men of goodwill wherever they may be. God bless you all.” ‘Epic men of flesh and blood’: Richard Nixon’s ‘in event of moon disaster’ speech, 1969 Written by the speechwriter William Safire in case the crew of Apollo 11 were marooned on the surface of the moon, and unearthed in the Nixon archive in 1999. The document directs Nixon to telephone “the widows-to-be” before making the speech and suggests that a clergyman should “adopt the same procedure as a burial at sea, commending their souls to ‘the deepest of the deep’”. “Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery. But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice … “In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood. “Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man’s search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts. For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.” ‘A nation reborn’: Alex Salmond’s speech for a yes vote in the Scottish independence referendum, 2014 Released by the former SNP leader to a university for research in 2015. “In the early hours of this morning, Scotland voted yes. We are a nation reborn. The community of this realm has spoken. Scotland shall be independent once again. To those who voted no, I extend an immediate hand of friendship … “To our friends and families across these isles waking to our new democracy, we say this: know that, in Scotland, you will always have your closest friend, greatest ally and most steadfast partner … “This morning, I want every person – yes voters, no voters, everyone in this proud and ancient nation – to pause, reflect upon and remember this greatest day in Scotland’s history. “We did this. We made it happen. We believed. We trusted ourselves and trusted each other. A country reborn. A democracy reclaimed. We reach towards the future.” ‘We are not waiting to lose before we get our act together’: David Miliband’s speech for the Labour leadership election, 2010 Obtained by the Guardian in 2011. Miliband is said to have recited the text to his wife in the back of the car on their drive home from party conference, where his brother Ed had prevailed. “My parents devoted themselves to building a family on unconditional love and support. It was a warm household in which we were encouraged to think for ourselves; to argue; to make up our own minds. Haven’t I learned that in the last few months? … “Only four Labour leaders have ever been elected prime minister. Out of 14. Reflect on that. Many good men … lots of hard work … but only four have led us to victory … “This leadership election, the new members, the new councillors, shows something is stirring. Something inspiring. We are not waiting to lose three times before we get our act together.” ‘He’s no longer Alaska’s “first dude”’: Sarah Palin’s victory speech, 2008 Written by the Republican vice-presidential candidate’s speechwriter Matthew Scully, and leaked in 2009. Palin also prepared a concession speech for the event of defeat but was stopped from delivering it by the presidential candidate John McCain’s team. “It’s been just 68 days since that afternoon in Dayton, Ohio, when Senator McCain introduced me as his running mate. He is truly the maverick. He took a chance on me. I will always be grateful for that. “It will be the honour of a lifetime to work him as vice-president of the United States. And I pledge to govern with integrity, and goodwill, and clear conviction, and a servant’s heart … “It’s been quite a journey these past 69 days. We were ready, in defeat, to return to a place and a life we love. And I said to my husband, Todd, that it’s not a step down when he’s no longer Alaska’s ‘first dude’. He will now be the first guy ever to become the ‘second dude’.” ‘Our landings have failed’: Dwight Eisenhower’s D-day defeat speech, 1944 Handwritten by the Supreme Allied Commander the night before the Normandy invasion and then put in his wallet. Now in the Eisenhower Library. “Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. “My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available. “The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.”"

          "headline": "‘No one believed him’: Tory MPs mutinous over Johnson’s actions",
          "bodyText": "Reading their phone halfway down a wintry Whitehall early on Wednesday morning, a breathless cabinet minister was agog at the leaked news that the prime minister was about to introduce plan B measures. “It’s just one fucking thing after another, isn’t it?” By the time plans got to a virtual cabinet signoff on Wednesday afternoon, the response was muted and routine. During the Covid-O meeting that preceded it, Boris Johnson agreed to temper the measures slightly, including adding the option of a rapid negative test to Covid passports – the measure that had been the main focus of opposition. Rishi Sunak and Kwasi Kwarteng also successfully pushed to keep mask-wearing rules out of hospitality. But though a tense agreement was finally reached, the private mood in SW1 among MPs and cabinet ministers in the run-up to the prime minister’s hastily arranged press conference was nothing short of mutinous. Many told the Guardian that Johnson’s personal character and authority were now on the line – with no excuses made for bad advice. Sajid Javid, once seen as the bright hope of anti-lockdown MPs, rose to give his evening statement in the Commons to a shout of “resign” by MP William Wragg. “What a load of old tripe,” another yelled as Javid said the decision was not taken lightly. Just 24 hours earlier, cabinet ministers had sat round a table where ministers clashed over the escalation of restrictions and agreed the data looked concerning but that it was too early to make the final call. As plans to immediately trigger new measures emerged on Wednesday, sources said Johnson had decided to press ahead with them only after the Allegra Stratton video joking about the No 10 party aired on Tuesday night. Furious MPs began texting their whips. Many told the Guardian they had grave doubts about their own credibility with the public. At the cabinet meeting just 24 hours earlier on Tuesday, no decision was taken on imposing more restrictions. Just three cabinet ministers voiced support for any change. Michael Gove, once the main voice of caution during the pandemic, argued for a return to home working and the use of Covid passports – even floating the possibility of further social distancing measures. He was backed by Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, who was Westminster’s patient zero last March. The other voice was Javid. “Sajid has been entirely subsumed into the Department of Health way of thinking,” a colleague said, giving insight into tensions within cabinet between groups once known as hawks and doves. “He’s like a remote control in any department – officials just point him where they want him.” The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was the most forceful voice of opposition, interrupting Gove at one point to say, “Before Michael kills the whole economy …” Sunak, the chancellor, kept largely quiet. But the majority of the other ministers round the table were sceptical about triggering plan B. MPs and cabinet ministers on Tuesday afternoon had believed the No 10 party story was coming close to running its course. That all changed ahead of the evening news on Tuesday when the video of Stratton laughing with special adviser Ed Oldfield surfaced on ITV. Message discipline has now broken down. “I’m blowed if I’m ever listening to No 10 on comms strategy again,” one cabinet minister said. “My views aren’t fit for broadcast, so I will just refuse,” an ex-minister added. Instead of a scramble over the Christmas party, Wednesday was meant to bring a rallying call for booster jabs, an invitation for over-40s to book online and mark the anniversary of the first vaccine, given to Margaret Keenan last year. In the event, Javid was pulled from the broadcast round. A No 10 source said he could not have been made to undergo the tough questioning with the prime minister planning to announce an investigation by Simon Case. A minister was unsympathetic. “Saj should have gone on broadcast. He didn’t want to, but that’s the job, you have got to do it. Dom [Raab] did it yesterday and it was awful – but resign if you don’t like it.” The only senior cabinet minister forced to face press questions was foreign secretary Liz Truss, who repeated the “the government followed the rules” mantra. “Don’t underestimate how colleagues felt about that, watching Liz read the lines off her notes,” an MP said. “She was the only person prepared to do it. What a spectacle.” Instructions went out to cabinet ministers that they must join Johnson for prime minister’s questions. Whips hustled more mute MPs into the chamber, grim-faced behind their masks. Johnson’s “unreserved apology” was met with near silence. “It was lies. No one believed him. Ministers didn’t believe him. They weren’t even nodding,” the former minister said. “This is not how you do an apology. We are constantly misled – and we were still in limbo about new Covid restrictions. This would never have happened under [Theresa] May and [David] Cameron.” The Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, and his predecessor, Ruth Davidson, broke ranks after the apology to insist there should be consequences. Ross, who has clashed with the prime minister, said he should resign if he misled MPs. “If the prime minister knew about this party last December, knew about this party last week, and was still denying it, then that is the most serious allegation,” Ross said. “There is absolutely no way you can mislead parliament and think you could get off with that. No one should continue in their post if they mislead parliament in that way.” No 10 said Stratton and Oldfield had not been suspended, in a tense briefing with journalists where two spokespeople refused to answer whether they themselves had attended any party in Downing Street. By late afternoon, Stratton had resigned and the prime minister had called a press conference. Many MPs said they had moved past the point where they thought advisers were the problem, as with the Dominic Cummings crisis and other Downing Street turmoil. “There is no point in having a greybeard in there if they aren’t listened to. The problem is him. Not the bad, evil advisers or whatever.” One senior Tory said Johnson was nearing the point of maximum danger with MPs – and said next week’s byelection after the departure of Owen Paterson would be key. Many Tories, including cabinet ministers, have indicated that they do not intend to help campaigning efforts in North Shropshire. On Wednesday, the Lib Dems created a campaign leaflet contrasting a crying elderly woman last Christmas with Johnson surrounded by festive drinks. “We’re going to lose North Shropshire and it’ll all be his fault,” the MP said. Most MPs believe few have as yet submitted letters of no confidence, but said the balance could tip if the election is lost. “In the new year, minds will focus on the next election – especially those who think he won them in his seats. And they will think about whether he is the right person to take us into the next election,” one said. “Things could start to move quite quickly.”"

          "bodyText": "Almost 30,000 homes in Ireland and 500 properties in Scotland have been left without power after Storm Barra swept in from the Atlantic bringing severe winds, rain and snow. The latest outages came days after the final homes in Britain were reconnected after Storm Arwen, which caused “catastrophic damage” to electricity networks mainly in north-east Scotland, affecting 135,000 properties. The north-west of Ireland and Scotland bore the brunt of the second day of the storm, when winds gusted at 80mph, parts of England and Wales flooded and emergency vans were dispatched to people in remote areas of Scotland. About 1,000 homes in Scotland suffered power cuts on Wednesday morning with flood warnings in 11 areas. John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, said the 511 households still affected were expected to be reconnected by 7pm on Wednesday. He said the continuing problems were discussed at an emergency civil resilience meeting chaired by Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday morning. He acknowledged the “inconvenience and hardship” caused for those affected – some of whom had only recently had their power switched back on after the damage caused by Storm Arwen. Flooding was reported in Cambridgeshire around Ely while counties in the south-west of England and in Wales remained under a yellow weather warning until 6pm on Wednesday. Bryngwyn comprehensive school in Llanelli, Wales was forced to shut temporarily after gusts of more than 70mph ripped part of its roof off on Tuesday evening. In Ireland the north-west bore the brunt of the storm overnight, and the severe weather was not expected to abate until Wednesday afternoon. Schools remained closed in 12 counties as electricity and water authorities worked to restore supplies in the next 24 hours. By 5pm the head of forecasting at Met Éireann said the country had moved into the “tail end” of the extreme weather event and weather warnings started to lift across the country. Electricity supplies had been restored to about 30,000 of the 59,000 hit by Barra in Ireland while Irish Water was working to repair supply to 68,000 customers. In Northern Ireland about 1,000 homes were without power on Wednesday morning with the strongest gust reaching 75mph at Orlock, County Down. Met Éireann said the county would experience severe or damaging gusts of between 62-80mph with localised stronger winds likely. “Owing to a combination of high waves, storm surge and high tide, coastal flooding is expected. Disruption to power and travel are likely,” the forecaster said. About 8,000 homes in the county had lost power at the peak of the storm with and extra staff brought were brought in to repair any damage to the Northern Ireland Electricity network."

          "bodyText": "I lived at sea for 10 years. I co-owned and ran a global kiteboarding expedition business. We’d sail around the world on a 60-foot catamaran, following the trade winds, kiteboarding, surfing and paragliding in remote locations. One night, I watched a Hollywood movie called The Fall, which had a section where an elephant was swimming in tropical blue water. I didn’t know if it was real or a fake Hollywood thing. But I thought: “Man, if that does exist, I’d love to photograph it.” I searched the internet and found the elephant from the film was living in the Andaman Islands, an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal. When we sailed into the capital, Port Blair, a few months later in 2010, I decided to hop off and try to find this elephant. I found Rajan on Havelock (now Swaraj) Island and spent two weeks with him, learning about his incredible story. Rajan was brought to the Andamans with nine other elephants in the 1970s to help log the islands. They needed a way to get the cut trees out to the barges just off the islands, so the elephants were forced to learn how to swim in the ocean. Elephants love fresh water but they don’t like salt water because the salt stings their eyes and dries their skin. The elephants would drag the giant cut badak trees and swim them out to barges. Once an island was logged, the elephants would be made to swim to the next island. They’d sometimes swim miles, which was mind-blowing: a group of 10 elephants swimming in open ocean. When logging was banned in 2002, Rajan was out of a job. He was the last elephant of the group to survive and lived out his days on Havelock Island until his death in 2016. When I found him, he was around 60 years old, living out his retirement with Nazroo, his caretaker, who in India is called a mahout. Every morning, Rajan would go into the jungle or walk down to the beach. He went swimming whenever he felt like it. He seemed to have adapted to swimming in salt water and even to enjoy it. I truly felt like he was having fun swimming in the ocean. I think that comes across in this picture. Many people tell me it looks like he’s smiling. At times, he’d wade into the water a little bit and decide not to swim, and other times he’d submerge himself completely and swim out into deeper water, like someone doing laps in a pool. He’d totally immerse himself and use his trunk like a snorkel, which was so cool. It’s surreal to swim with an elephant, especially in tropical blue water. I remember thinking, “Wow, this is crazy that I’m here witnessing this.” Often, Rajan was in shallower areas. But I really hoped to get a photo of him swimming weightlessly in deeper water, his legs kicking freely, in doggy paddle motion. It was challenging because I was always having to try to stay clear of him and his movements were unpredictable, which made it difficult to anticipate where he was going to swim. It all came down to whatever mood Rajan was in. On the day I took this photo, I was with him on one of his longer swims and I used a weight belt to freedive down to get the angle I wanted. Rajan’s mahout was always nearby. He felt so comfortable with Nazroo and didn’t want to be far from him. His original mahout, who was the one who had done all the brutal training, had died from a cobra bite, and Nazroo came in after that. I’ve worked on human-elephant conflict for a few years in Asia and I’ve done stories on mahouts in India, so I’ve seen different levels of the relationship between humans and elephants, but I’ve never seen a bond as strong as Rajan and Nazroo’s. It was like watching a mother and child – a caring, loving relationship. Spending time with Rajan was an amazing experience. Rajan was probably the last ocean-swimming elephant we’ll ever see, which gives the image extra poignancy. As logging bans have increased, using elephants for logging has significantly diminished. I think it still happens in some Asian countries, but it’s a practice that’s thankfully fading. I’ve had incredible experiences as a photographer. I think it’s important to share those experiences to encourage and inspire people to get out of their comfort zone and have their own adventures. It not only enriches their own lives but strengthens their relationship with nature and the environment, which means they’ll be more inclined to protect them.

          "headline": "‘There is just a lake with crocodiles!’: hope and homkesickness for Kiribati nurses in the outback",
          "bodyText": "Every night, sitting in her room in the remote Queensland town of Doomadgee, Bwerere Sandy Tebau calls her husband and daughter 4,300km away in Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati. “There is no sea!” Sandy says, when asked about the difference between her new home in the red desert of Australia and her island home in the central Pacific. “There is just a lake and in the lake are crocodiles!” Sandy is one of three nurses from Kiribati who have been brought in to work at an aged care facility in Doomadgee, a town of about 1,500 people, 85km from the border with the Northern Territory. Her employment is part of the Pacific labour scheme (PLS), a program that enables residents from 10 Pacific Island states and Timor-Leste to work for approved Australian employers in sectors such as meat processing, tourism and aged care. The program aims to tackle labour shortages that plague rural Australia. Securing a position in the program can be transformative for Pacific families, especially in remote and sparsely populated island states such as Kiribati. “I am going to save money to send back home,” Sandy says. “I will also save money for [my family’s] visa and plane ticket to come to visit me here.” A few weeks in and Sandy is enjoying the work at a facility called Ngooderi House. “We are getting to know the residents and we love the work... We are getting good feedback from Health X, who tells us we are hardworking and that they want to hire more i-Kiribati workers.” Past participants have returned to Kiribati with enough money to build sturdy concrete homes, reinforce wells, buy cars and fund their children’s education. With so much on offer in Australia, many recruits hope for pathways to stay. But back in Kiribati, the loss of the nurses to Australia is having severe impacts on the country’s healthcare system. On a humid Tarawa night, Albert O’Connor has received an all-too familiar phone call. A patient has presented at the hospital and is being prepped by O’Connor’s colleagues for an emergency C-section. Despite the fact he has only had a few hours’ sleep, hospital transport is on its way to take him back in to work at Tungaru central hospital, the country’s largest health centre. “Staff across all wards are working more double shifts,” said O’Connor, a nurse who studied with Sand. “There is no one to take our place, and we are even unable to assist shortages in other wards. “High birth rates and increased instances of non-communicable diseases stress limited resources and lead to long hours for the understaffed nurses… We often do not spend much downtime with our families.” Mereua Eete, Albert’s colleague in the obstetric ward, added: “With less staff and due to the number of patients in the obstetric ward, sometimes on our day off we are not off – we still must work overtime.” The hospital has struggled to cope with the growing needs of the community. According to sources at the ministry of health and medical services, the hospital is often overcrowded, having only 85 beds, including a 10-bed antenatal care unit housed in a tent. Kiribati has a population of about 120,000. In addition, Kiribati nurses receive low pay compared with their counterparts outside the country. The average fortnightly wage for nurses in Kiribati ranges from A$350-$500. As a result, registered nurses with skills and training are turning their sights to better paying and less intense opportunities in the Australian aged-care industry. With the arrival of Sandy and the 15 other nurses late last month, a total of 25 nurses from Kiribati are now employed in Australia through the PLS. The departure of the nurses has also come at a particularly bad time for Kiribati, as remaining staff confront a whooping cough outbreak and with fears that Covid could arrive in Kiribati – the country has so far remained Covid-free – as it plans to open borders in January. The ministry of employment and human resources said concerns about a brain drain from the country were overstated given that under PLS terms, contracts were fixed at three years and did not provide pathways to permanent residency. “At this stage, there is little concern about brain drain as these nurses will not stay in Australia permanently as they will return [to Kiribati] at the end of their contract,” the ministry said in a statement. For Sandy, while the work offers huge opportunities, it is unlikely she will look to stay longer than her posting, if it means being separated from her husband and daughter. The job is fulfilling but a tough commitment, especially during a pandemic that has made it nearly impossible to travel between Kiribati and Australia. “We miss her a lot, especially our daughter,” said Sandy’s husband, Tevevere, who remained in Kiribati. “But also we are happy for her and support her because we know she’s fulfilling one of her goals now.” “[Doomadgee] is a small town,” Sandy says. “There’s not much to do so we go to work, go shopping in the supermarket, and spend my free time in my room calling my husband and daughter. I really miss them a lot.”"

          "headline": "Journalists in China face ‘nightmare’ worthy of Mao era, press freedom group says",
          "bodyText": "Xi Jinping has created a “nightmare” of media oppression worthy of the Mao era, and Hong Kong’s journalism is in “freefall”, according to Reporters Without Borders (RSF). In a major report released on Wednesday, the journalism advocacy group detailed the worsening treatment of journalists and tightening of control over information in China, adding to an environment in which “freely accessing information has become a crime and to provide information an even greater crime”. “No matter the topic, those who refuse to comply with the official narrative are accused of harming national unity.” In the report’s forward, RSF’s secretary general, Christophe Deloire, said before Xi came to power in 2013, there was an emerging trend of improvements in press freedom, but he had “put a brutal end to this partial opening and restored a media culture worthy of the Maoist era”. “This ‘great leap backwards’ of journalism in China is all the more terrifying given that the regime has immense financial and technological resources to achieve its goals,” Deloire said. The report listed a growing number of “obstacles” to journalism, including online censorship and surveillance, paid amateur propagandists known as the “50 cent army”, increasing use of detention without trial, Hong Kong’s national security law, forced televised confessions, daily instructions from the Communist party to newsrooms and other platforms, use of allegations ranging from “picking quarrels” to espionage to silence journalists, and the weaponising of exit bans. As well as advances in surveillance and technology, the report also described a ruling introduced in October 2019 that all Chinese journalists must use a smartphone app called “Study Xi, Strengthen the Country”, which cybersecurity experts had found could enable collection of personal data and remote access to the device’s microphone. Harassment and intimidation of reporters both local and foreign has markedly increased, according to RSF and the Beijing Foreign Correspondents Club, in particular during coverage of the Henan flood disaster earlier this year. The Henan provincial government put out a tender for a journalist-specific surveillance system after the flooding. In 2020 at least 18 foreign correspondents from US outlets were expelled, while others were forced to flee, including the BBC’s John Sudworth and Australian reporters Bill Birtles and Mike Smith, who had been investigating the national security arrest of Australian CGTN anchor Cheng Lei. Several citizen journalists were arrested for attempting to report from the Wuhan lockdown, while others have been targeted for their work on #MeToo cases. Until crackdowns in 2020 and 2021, Hong Kong’s media had been considered free and separate to the mainland’s controls, however RSF said that was no longer the case, and the sector was in “in freefall”. The report cited the arrest and jailing of journalists and media proprietors such as Apple Daily’s Jimmy Lai, the raiding of newsrooms, wholesale changes at public broadcaster RTHK, and lack of consequences for police violence against reporters. “The repression no longer spares Hong Kong, once a champion of press freedom, where a growing number of arrests are now conducted in the name of national security,” said Deloire. The report made several recommendations and appeals to authorities to improve the situation, but also listed detailed advice for journalists to protect themselves and their sources from technological surveillance and intimidation. It called on global democracies to “identify all appropriate strategies to dissuade the Beijing regime from pursuing its repressive policies and to support all Chinese citizens who love their country and want to defend the right to information”."

          "headline": "As we turn away, Boris Johnson is grabbing more power. Where is the opposition?",
          "bodyText": "Whenever you watch a documentary about a dictator’s path to power, there comes a moment when you think: “Why didn’t people do something? They could have stopped him while there was still time.” We have now reached this moment. As Boris Johnson rams yet more powers into the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, a vaguely democratic nation is sliding towards autocracy. It was bad enough when I wrote about this legislation last week. After the bill had mostly passed through parliament and could be properly debated, the government slipped in a series of terrifying amendments. By curtailing the right to protest, it already amounted to the most oppressive legislation tabled by a government of this country since the end of the second world war. But now, it’s even worse. In a private letter to members of the House of Lords, the government says it intends “to introduce a new offence of interfering with the operation of key infrastructure, such as the strategic road network, railways, sea ports, airports, oil refineries and printing presses, carrying a maximum penalty of 12 months’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both”. In the previous batch of post-debate amendments, the bill sought, among other measures, to criminalise any protest that might interfere with the construction of new infrastructure. This most recent amendment will apply to existing infrastructure, potentially banning all effective protests, pickets or any other kind of action in places “such as” roads, railways, ports, airports, oil refineries and printing presses. The named infrastructure is bad enough, greatly limiting the scope of protest, but what does “such as” mean? Well, if printing presses are considered key infrastructure – an offering to the Murdoch empire, whose presses were targeted by Extinction Rebellion – this might apply to any corporate or government premises, as well as any public spaces. These are dictators’ powers. Parliament should be in uproar. The press should be in uproar. Yet you could hear a pin drop. There have been roughly as many stories published over the past fortnight in the UK press that mention Nestlé’s Quality Street chocolates as there have been about this massive attack on democratic rights. It’s not for lack of public interest: even before the amendments were introduced, 600,000 people signed a petition against the bill. But apart from columns by Ian Dunt in the i, Kevin Maguire in the Mirror, Camilla Cavendish in the Financial Times and a couple of minor items on remote pages, the mainstream media are whistling loudly while looking the other way. We don’t have to wait for the next stage of the autocrats’ trajectory – press censorship – to kick in. The press has already fallen into line. As for the Labour party, if not now, when? Those who excuse its silence say it’s keeping its powder dry. For what? An election held in the future, when effective opposition is even harder than it is today? Unless it fights these measures, by the time it decides to use its fabled powder, the battle may already have been lost. What about those doughty “freedom warriors”: the people who believe face masks, National Trust brochures and things students say represent an existential threat to our liberties? People such as Steve Baker, Nadine Dorries, Oliver Dowden, Toby Young, Julia Hartley-Brewer and Laurence Fox. So far, none of them, as far as I can tell, have railed against it. You could almost imagine that the only freedoms they value are their own. Opposition is left to a few peers in the House of Lords, the advocacy group Liberty, alternative news sites and self-organised protesters coming together under the Kill the Bill banner. There’s a demonstration in London this afternoon to coincide with the report stage of the bill in the Lords. The revolt within the establishment you might have expected, brave souls in the Tory party and the billionaire press, is shockingly absent. Those with the power and the platforms seem to have reached a tacit consensus: we’ll sit this one out. Johnson is the most dangerous prime minister to have presided over the UK in the democratic era. Electors are disarmed by his impression of bonhomie and bumbling, and imagine he’s in it for the bants. But if the history of the past 100 years tells us anything, it’s beware of the clowns. Again and again we have seen the warning signs: the bumbling is an act, a studied imitation of spontaneity and ineptitude. He will go to extraordinary lengths to grasp and maintain power. When he senses a threat to his position, he moves with brutal efficiency, as the 21 Tory MPs who were suspended for opposing a no-deal Brexit can testify. He has surrounded himself with people who, like dictators’ cronies the world over, appear to be as threatening as they are damaged. He feels unconstrained by rules, let alone by the mythical “gentleman’s agreement” that takes the place of a formal constitution in this country. He senses weakness like a shark smells blood, and knows that our political safeguards are extremely weak. With an 80-seat majority and much of the media in his pocket, he’s now exploiting the failings of our political system, with voter suppression measures, attacks on the Electoral Commission and judicial review, extensions of the Official Secrets Act and threats to the Human Rights Act. If we let this pass, and if one day there are documentaries that cover this moment, our descendants will be astonished. Not because the people who could have stopped this were terrified into inaction, as the opponents of other proto-dictatorships were. But because they couldn’t be bothered.

          "headline": "‘If you run, you will die’: fear stalks Nigerian state as jihadists gain foothold",
          "bodyText": "“They ordered everyone to come around, saying if you run, if you cry, you will die,” said Bala Pada, recalling the moment in April when jihadists rounded up people at a market in his home town of Kaure to witness the execution of two alleged vigilantes. Hundreds of jihadists have settled over the past year in Kaure and other remote communities in Niger state in Nigeria, according to displaced residents and local government officials. They began to arrive in November 2020, hoisting flags and declaring the communities under their control. “They said this is what will happen to anyone that tries to stop them,” Pada said from a classroom in the Central primary school in Gwada, where he, his family and about 400 others displaced by violence now live. “Everyone was made to watch it but no one was allowed to react at all or they would face the same fate as the vigilantes,” the 45-year-old said. “Then they sprayed them with bullets.” Fighters from competing Islamist terror groups linked to Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have gained a foothold across Niger state by easily displacing an often feeble government or security presence. The development has caused increasing concern in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, just over three hours by road from towns and villages where jihadist flags fly and other armed groups have settled. Residents and local officials have for years and with growing desperation raised the alarm about the domination of armed groups – called bandits – in much of Niger state. The arrival of jihadists in this often ungoverned space has made the situation more complicated, and even more dangerous. Many of the jihadists arrived from Nigeria’s north-east, where they were engaged in fighting with the Nigerian army. They have found a haven in and around the same mineral-rich forests of the north-west that provided a fertile breeding ground for bandit gangs. The militants in Niger state have terrorised communities by carrying out public executions, abducting young girls to be “wives”, forcibly recruiting young boys to be child soldiers, and decreeing that state schools close. Alarmed officials in the state have pleaded for military reinforcements. They say their warnings are being acknowledged at the federal level but go largely unheeded. “The problem is that insecurity is everywhere in the country,” said Suleiman Chukuba, the chairman of the Shiroro local government area. From his office in the state capital, Minna, he explained how Shiroro, one of the worst-affected areas in Niger state, had been left without adequate help. “We really need more manpower in the army, and better weapons,” Chukuba said, echoing sentiments expressed across the country that areas suffering violence have been abandoned by the central government. Swathes of Niger state were already being subjected to what was in effect an insurgency waged by heavily armed bandit gangs before the jihadists turned up. The bandit gangs are made up of various ethnic groups, but dominated by mostly young ethnic Fulanis. Many of the Fulani armed groups have emerged from historic and complex conflicts over land between largely Fulani herders and farmers from other ethnic groups. In recent years these conflicts have worsened dramatically, killing thousands and becoming the most pronounced of the many security threats facing Nigeria. The bandit groups have overpowered local police and army units, killing civilians and prolifically carrying out kidnaps for ransom – especially targeting school students – from the dense forests that span north-west Nigeria and stretch into the Sahel. The ransom money has bolstered the bandits’ capabilities, said Chukuba. “They have general purpose machine guns, they have AK47s, they have ammunition,” he said. “They are at times better armed than the army.” The bandit crisis created a vacuum of governance and security into which the jihadists have stepped. Twelve of Shiroro’s 15 wards have been overrun by armed groups, and jihadists are thought to be at large in at least five. Other local government areas in Niger state such as Rafi have been similarly affected. “Two weeks ago they [jihadists] went to Korebe,” Chukuba said of a ward in Shiroro. “They saw a girl less than 14 and they kidnapped her and took her to their camp in the forest. Then they came back to the parents, to the father, with their arms, and they said, ‘we want to marry her and we’re here to pay the dowry.’” In another incident, a seven-year-old boy was taken. “Again they went back to the parents and said, ‘don’t worry the boy is with us. We’re going to teach him the Islamic way of living’,” Chukuba said. “It’s a very desperate situation. They ‘[the jihadists] come to you and tell you ‘we have your child and they’re carrying weapons’. People are living in a state of fear.” Chukuba said 70% of Shiroro’s school are no longer operational either because of kidnappings by bandit groups or decrees from jihadists forbidding education. In some areas the jihadists are positioning themselves to locals as being able to offer a more reliable protection from banditry than the government. “What we’re seeing is them coming in and preaching to people that they are on their side,” Chukuba said. But in others, the jihadist and bandit causes have aligned. Gambo Isiaku, the headteacher of the Central primary school in Gwada, said school kidnappings were increasingly an area where alliances were being formed. “The bandits get what they want which is ransom money and so they kidnap the children, while Boko Haram get what they want which is an end to western education.” As the insecurity worsens, accounts of acts of terror have multiplied. According to Isiaku, people across Shiroro have reported armed groups and jihadists committing mass rapes of women and girls in front of their families. “It’s so bad, it’s hard to even imagine,” he said. In a briefing to journalists last week, a secretary to the Niger state governor said jihadists were setting up a caliphate in the state, and lamented that there were just 8,000 police officers trying to protect the state’s population of roughly 4 million people. In recent days the army has told people in several communities in Shiroro and other areas in Niger state to leave their homes before a possible impending military offensive. Yet in a largely impoverished state, where many people rely on their farmland for food and income, leaving means abandoning livelihoods. Pada now does odd manual labour jobs in the area close to the school to make ends meet. He was born and grew up in Kaure, but cannot return, he said. “We want to go back home but we don’t have a choice.” Chukuba described Shiroro as a peaceful place before the violence that has reshaped it. A day after explaining what had befallen residents in his jurisdiction, he learned his brother and other members of his family has been abducted by a bandit group. “They recently told all those living in the town to leave, but he was staying there because he didn’t want to abandon our farm,” he said over the telephone. “Inshallah [God willing], we will be able to rescue them.”"

          "bodyText": "To someone in a remote place, cut off by hostile weather, a friendly face in uniform might be a welcome sight, although not as welcome as the lights coming back on. About 300 armed forces personnel have been on manoeuvres in rural parts of north-east England and Scotland, checking on vulnerable people in the aftermath of Storm Arwen and, according to the Ministry of Defence, “providing reassurance”. In a more tyrannical regime that phrase, coupled with the image of soldiers going door to door, would have a sinister ring. In Britain it is uncontroversial, which is not necessarily a sign of healthy politics. Deployment of the military to bail out civil authorities should not be taboo, but nor should it be routine. In October, when petrol pumps ran dry, the army was brought in, ostensibly to drive tankers, but also to show panicking motorists that the government had things under control; “providing reassurance”. There are some peacetime jobs that only trained military personnel can do – bomb disposal, for example. Then there are episodes of turmoil when politicians need to show a flash of khaki to prove that they are still in charge. Military drivers were put on standby during the 2000 fuel protests. Troops stepped in to provide security for the 2012 Olympics when the private contractor fell short. Military involvement has long been a measure of severity in floods and other natural disasters. The pandemic has seen a huge increase in the use of what Whitehall calls Maca – military aid to the civil authorities. Soldiers have erected field hospitals, moved people and protective equipment around, provided logistics support for testing and vaccination programmes. Army medics have been on the clinical frontline. The scale of the Covid challenge has required something like wartime mobilisation and Britain is not the only country to have leaned on its armed forces. But there is a difference between occasional auxiliary action and playing backstop to a state that cannot cope with stress. The need for such a service speaks to some deeper malaise in the workings of government, which brings us to the evacuation of Kabul. Here the crisis was already military by nature, and the pressure to deliver was entirely on civilian authorities. They failed. The London side of the operation was “dysfunctional” and “chaotic”, according to testimony by a civil service whistleblower to a parliamentary inquiry. The scene in the Foreign Office, as depicted by Raphael Marshall, a former desk officer at the department, is one of institutional and individual failure at every level. Dominic Raab, then foreign secretary, now justice secretary, is portrayed as an indecisive control freak: fussing over the formatting of documents instead of engaging with their contents, and delaying action on cases of desperate Afghans seeking refuge from vengeful Taliban forces. Thousands of emails, representing matters of life and death, went unread in deserted offices as staff clocked off at end of their Friday shifts. The Taliban didn’t get the memo about not working weekends. To the extent that Downing Street took an interest in particular cases, the lucky evacuees appear to have been animals in the care of a rescue charity run by Paul “Pen” Farthing. Marshall testified that “considerable capacity” had to be allocated for Farthing’s cargo on instructions from the prime minister. No 10 denies that Boris Johnson made that call and Farthing rejects claims that his pet project diverted military resources. But safe passage was a precious, finite resource and arranging capacity for dogs was a distraction from rescuing people. Raab disputes Marshall’s account. He concedes that there are lessons to be learned “in hindsight” but does not specify what they might be, beyond his previously expressed regret at having tried to manage the crisis from a beach in Crete. His subsequent removal from the Foreign Office was punishment for having bungled the brief. More precisely, it was a rebuke for ineptitude on such a scale as to invite scrutiny of the prime minister’s role in the debacle. (Johnson, too, had been on holiday.) Raab’s offence was not incompetence, but failure to keep the tide of bad headlines away from the threshold of No 10. He is still in the cabinet, still deputy prime minister. Not all government failures are the fault of ministers. There is also a Conservative reading of Marshall’s testimony: the evacuation programme was inhibited by the volume of people working from home, and by a culture that valorised a “work-life balance” so much that, for some staff, entitlement to leisure trumped public service. The riposte would be that being short-staffed is more often a function of inadequate budgeting than deficient work ethic. The same arguments swirl around the government’s handling of the pandemic. There is a view from the right that finds fault in a rusty, over-privileged and antique civil service machine, unfit for 21st-century challenges. And there is the counter-claim from the left that austerity stripped the state of assets it needed to get the job done properly. Both sides can be right. An unreformed state bureaucracy might lack the agility to deal with a complex emergency, while underfunded services are easily overwhelmed. In both instances, inattentive and cowardly leadership makes the difference, turning complication into crisis. And it takes special arrogance and stupidity at the top to obstruct the flow of urgency lower down in the hierarchy. There are flaws in the British state that pre-date the current government and managerial problems that are common to all large organisations, private and public. But there is a particular moral flimsiness about the Johnson regime that takes administrative dysfunction to a new level. It is the pattern of unpreparedness and indecision, leading to reckless choices with terrible consequences, followed by a flight from responsibility. It is the effect of hypersensitivity to public demand that something be done, applied in the absence of an ethical core to dictate what that action should be. This was all eloquently expressed in the dereliction of duty over Afghanistan. By the time the crisis caught up with Raab and Johnson, the moment to grip it had already passed. There was no option of calling in the armed forces. They were already there, in Kabul, doing their job, which was not the scene back in Whitehall or Downing Street. This is what happens when government is led by people who seek the thrill of power without wanting the burden of office. The terrible price of that complacency is still being paid by Afghans who called to Britain for sanctuary and got no answer. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "The Proposition: Nick Cave’s savage outback western reveals ugly truths about Australia",
          "bodyText": "The second feature film written by the musician Nick Cave is a grisly, sweat-stained tale of outback violence and colonial oppression that has lost none of its power in the 16 years since its release. Directed by John Hillcoat, The Proposition is awash with striking scenery and ugly truths about Australia. After a fierce gunfight, outlaw Charlie Burns (Guy Pearce) and his brother Mike (Richard Wilson) are captured by Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone). Although both brothers are former members of the notorious Burns gang, Stanley’s real target is their sadistic older sibling Arthur (Danny Huston), who is wanted for the brutal murder of a local family. With no lead on Arthur, Stanley turns to more “inventive” methods, offering Charlie a proposition. He will release Charlie, while Mike will hang in nine days for the crimes of the Burns gang. But both will be pardoned if Charlie can locate and kill Arthur. Mike is naive and not able to mentally comprehend their situation, so Charlie feels he has no choice but to protect his younger brother and accept Stanley’s deal. Cave’s script presents a compelling dilemma for our antihero and a nuanced view of characters who don’t fit into pigeonholes of “good” or “bad”. In so doing, The Proposition is able to make a much bigger point about the realities of life during colonial rule in the 1880s. Stanley’s mandate is to “civilise” the country but we need only see him wearing a heavy woollen coat in 40C heat, sweat running down his face, to understand the absurdity of transposing a British way of life on to a land where it will not fit. Just like the fake snow his wife Martha (Emily Watson) orders for Christmas, it is all artifice. The captain views the country as something to be conquered. “Australia, what fresh hell is this?” he opines, while the Burns gang view nature as a salve, hiding out in remote caves and stopping to appreciate the beauty of a sunset … before embarking on a killing spree. The colonial settlers’ “civility” certainly doesn’t apply to treatment of the local Aboriginal people, who are exploited as servants or massacred in response to perceived injustices. Meanwhile, Martha is left to rattle around an empty house on her own lest she come to town to be objectified by Stanley’s men or patronised by town officials. Whether depicting horror or beauty, The Proposition is visually arresting. The violence is staged with wince-inducing authenticity, in stark contrast to the beauty of the cinematography, with languid views of dusky horizons and parched panoramas. The core cast – Pearce, Winstone, Huston and Watson – are exceptional, complemented by a supporting cast featuring John Hurt as a scene-stealing bounty hunter, David Wenham as a prim but odious town official and David Gulpilil as a tracker on the trail of the Burns gang. Tom E Lewis (Balang Lewis) – who compared the intensity of The Proposition to that of his acclaimed debut, The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith – is also noteworthy as gang member Two Bob. The Proposition was not Cave and Hillcoat’s first collaboration. They worked together on 1988’s dystopian prison drama Ghosts … of the Civil Dead as well as the soundtrack to Hillcoat’s second feature, To Have and to Hold, and the video for Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds’ Babe, I’m On Fire. The Proposition’s score is a collaboration between Cave and Warren Ellis and is as integral as any character. Raspy vocals and screeching strings provide the perfect sonic anxiety to the chases and violence, while melancholy violin and piano accompany shots of stunning horizons and characters awaiting inexorable confrontations. At heart The Proposition is a savage yet utterly compelling story. Its gritty, uniquely Australian take on the western deserves to be recognised as one of the genre’s best."

          "bodyText": "Icelandic director Valdimar Jóhannsson makes a coolly outrageous feature debut with this jawdropping horror-comedy of loneliness, co-written by Jóhannsson with the lyricist and Björk collaborator Sigurjón Birgir Sigurðsson, or Sjón. It is performed with unflinching commitment by its executive producer-star Noomi Rapace, who is first among equals in a great cast of humans, animals and various prosthetic and digital creature effects. Maria (Rapace) and Ingvar (Hilmir Snaer Guðnason) are an unhappy couple with a remote farm in Iceland: it gradually becomes clear they have lost their only child. The drama begins with a strange spirit-visitation in the barn that scares the animals: a ewe becomes pregnant with a bizarre animal-human hybrid and poor, stricken Maria (her name’s importance is left for us to digest) conceives a passionate attachment to this precious being, naming it Ada after her dead human daughter. As this sweet woolly little thing gets bigger and dressed up in the children’s clothes that this couple appear to have bought in advance for their lost human child, their situation as Iceland’s Unholy Family becomes ever more macabre, and even more so considering the complete calm and naturalness of their behaviour. It comes to a crisis of sorts when Ingvar’s dodgy brother Pétur (a failed pop star with some shady friends) shows up needing a place to stay, and the couple’s new houseguest is extremely freaked out by his hosts’ spawn of unnature. Intending some tough love, Pétur takes a rifle and leads trusting Ada by the hand out into the hills. But the ovine side of Ada’s family might have something to say about all this. We have to wait to get a good look at Ada and confront the full, horrible truth about what she represents, but Jóhannsson cleverly converts our horror into a stupefied comic bewilderment from the outset. We are not supposed to be scared. What is required of us is compassion and respect for Maria’s strange dignity and strength. It’s a great performance from Rapace. • Lamb is released on 10 December in cinemas."

          "headline": "School lockdowns risk more cases like Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, says Ofsted head",
          "bodyText": "The head of the Ofsted schools inspectorate has said England risks a repeat of cases such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, the six-year-old abused and murdered in his own home last year, if schools and social services are disrupted by future lockdowns. Asked if further school closures could result in similar cases, Amanda Spielman said: “Yes, schools closing clearly has had some significant risks for children around the reduction in quality of education but we know that there is a minority of children who sadly are safer in school than out of it. “And we have to recognise that by closing schools we make that minority less safe.” The chief inspector of schools also criticised the “hokey-cokey education” that children have endured during the pandemic, saying that nearly every child in England suffered as a result, including vulnerable children who “disappeared from teachers’ line of sight”. Launching Ofsted’s annual report for 2020-21, Spielman wrote: “Almost all children felt the impact of Covid-19 and the resulting restrictions to some extent. Many of the youngest children had their development and progress hampered, with some even regressing … In primary and secondary schools, children struggled with a hokey-cokey education: in the classroom, at home, separated in bubbles, isolating alone.” Ofsted’s report claims that the loss of education, disrupted routine, and lack of activities “led some children to develop physical and mental health problems. Loneliness, boredom and misery became endemic among the young.” It found that pressures on council care placements have grown during the pandemic, with long waiting lists and children being placed far from their families or in unregistered homes, as some children “became involved in criminal activity, including gang violence, and were at risk of child sexual exploitation”. Spielman would not be drawn on the number of children who have been made more vulnerable by the pandemic lockdowns, or on the length of time that will be needed for the education system in England to repair the damage. “In various surveys and testing programmes that have been done so far we’ve seen some encouraging signs. But I think we’ve also seen that it’s the children at the lower end of the spectrum, the ones who are the lower achievers, are the ones who’ve learned least through periods of remote learning and enclosed schools. “So it’s it’s very important that we stay very clearly focused on the ones who will need help, and who won’t simply recover through schools doing what they always do so well,” Spielman said. She said the suspension of Ofsted’s inspection visits for long periods since March 2020 had hampered its ability to investigate the workings of educational settings, including within prisons, or other social care. Prisoners were found to be unable to leave their cells to learn or take part in classes. “Many lost motivation and floundered, especially those with learning difficulties, low levels of education or limited English,” the report states. In response to criticism that Ofsted’s inspections are disrupting schools still affected by Covid, Spielman said the inspectors were sympathetic and that more than three-quarters of schools’ requests for an inspection deferral have been granted, especially at those with high levels of staff absence. Post-visit surveys collected by Ofsted found that 90% of schools said that the inspection would help them to improve, while complaints were running at levels similar to pre-pandemic inspections. “All the feedback that we collect says that our aim this term, to make sure that we genuinely take account of the Covid challenges for school, are landing about where they should,” Spielman said. But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said Ofsted needed to recognise that inspections remained disruptive for many schools. “We have asked the inspectorate to allow inspections to be deferred upon request to a later date, and while it has slightly softened its criteria for deferrals, it has not gone far enough in this respect,” Barton said."

          "headline": "Michele Brown was vaccinated - but had a suppressed immune system. Would better health advice have saved her?",
          "bodyText": "The feeling of relief was immense as 58-year-old Michele Brown returned home from the vaccine centre. Her husband, Terry, 61, had taken time off from his job as a supervisor at a heavy machinery factory to drive her to her second Covid-19 vaccination at a Gateshead community centre. In the car, Michele told her partner of 40 years that she felt like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. “She said: ‘At least we’ve got that done,’” Terry remembers. “‘We’ll be OK.’” It was 28 April 2021. Michele, who had rheumatoid arthritis, an underactive thyroid and diabetes, had spent the last year and a half shielding indoors, on government advice. She was careful. She had a Covid station set up on the breakfast counter: lateral flow tests, bottles of antibacterial gel and disposable face masks. When family came to visit, a mask-wearing Michele would banish them to the furthest corner of the living room. “We couldn’t kiss her,” remembers her daughter, Kim Brown, 41, who lives in Durham. “She would say: ‘You might have the coronies! I don’t want no coronies. You’re not giving me that crap.’” After her vaccinations, Michele relaxed a tiny bit. She let her family visit more often, and stopped wearing a mask indoors when they did. But she still wasn’t going out much: her rheumatoid arthritis made even brief excursions exhausting. Most of the time, Michele stayed home, chatting to Kim on the phone, watching TV and ordering endless packages online. By the time they arrived she rarely had a clue what was in them. When the news came on, Michele would sigh. “She’d see the numbers go up,” says Kim, “and say: ‘Those poor people. Those poor families.’” Michele’s family are mystified as to how she caught Covid – unless one of her rare visitors brought it into the house, or maybe it was when she went for a doctor’s appointment. It doesn’t really matter. When Michele became infected, it wrecked her body with brutal efficiency. Unknown to her, her immune system had been suppressed, most likely by the drugs she took to manage her arthritis, so her body had failed to mount a good response to the Covid-19 vaccine. In other words, the vaccine hadn’t worked for her. “I never heard anything like ‘immunocompromised’,” says Terry, bewildered and distraught. “We never did.” *** Michele was born in 1962, in the village of Stannington, Northumberland, the eldest of seven children. Her parents split up when she was an infant. Her father eventually won custody of Michele, but at her request, left her with her grandmother Manuel, who raised her. “She had a difficult childhood,” says Kim. “She swore her kids wouldn’t have the same childhood. And we didn’t. We had everything we wanted. Love. Affection. We didn’t want for anything.” Terry lived on the same cul-de-sac as Michele and Nana Manuel. It was the sort of street where everyone knew each other. The boys would play football and the girls would watch. Everything took place outdoors. He remembers the first time he noticed her romantically. She was 17, sitting on a wall outside her grandmother’s house. Dressed casually. No makeup, jeans. Terry was coming back from the pub. He noticed how lovely she was becoming. He tried to talk to her, but Manuel came out and shooed him away. They kept noticing each other in the pub. Eventually, Michele’s friend Brenda pushed them together. “She said: ‘Isn’t it about time you two went on a proper date?’” Terry recalls. “I thought, why would Michele want to date me? I was punching well above my weight.” Their first date was in February 1982; by March, they were a couple. Michele had already given birth to Kim by this point, although Kim’s father was not in the picture. (Michele and Terry had a son, Terence James, in 1988.) Back then, Michele was outgoing and carefree. She worked the cloakroom in a Newcastle nightclub with her best friend, Sid, but spent most of her time on the dancefloor instead. She dressed like a New Romantic and got her aunt to customise clothes she picked up in Oxfam. Her entire life, she loved music, even wearing headphones as she fell asleep. Her tastes were eclectic – everything from Slipknot to George Michael. “She had such a thing for George Michael,” says Kim. “We’d tell her he was gay, and she’d say: ‘So what! I’ll convert him.’” Michele worked in a factory, as a cleaner, and at a warehouse. She was clever, but unfulfilled. “If she’d applied herself when she was younger, she could have had a good career,” says Terry. “She was frustrated.” Michele was superb at general knowledge; people would sometimes call her, when they were on pub quizzes, to cheat. She also loved animals. Once, after visiting a zoo, she wrote the management a letter complaining that the cages were too small. In later life, she became obsessed with watching a family of gorillas in a Japanese zoo on YouTube. When Terry came home from work, she’d talk about what the gorillas were up to. Her health began to fail in her late 20s. She was diagnosed first with leukopenia, meaning that she had a low white blood cell count, and then with rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Because Terry was at work throughout the pandemic, as a key worker, Michele was sometimes lonely; she’d call Kim in the middle of the day and stay on the phone for four or five hours at a time. They were more like best friends than mother and daughter. “We’d talk about everything,” says Kim. “Stuff you talk to your friends about. She was dead funny.” Despite her health issues, Michele was the fierce, uncompromising matriarch of the family. “She was the gaffer,” says Kim. “Everything went through her.” Sometimes she could be blunt. “She had a short temper,” Kim says. “Everything was black and white. You couldn’t explain things to her. If she got a bee in her bonnet about something you’d have to wait until she calmed down.” But Michele had tremendous instincts, especially about people. “I used to ask her: ‘Have you studied black magic?’” says Terry. “She was really good at picking up on people. I’d always say to her: ‘Michele, you should give people a chance.’ And she’d say no, and further down the line she’d usually be proved right. It would fascinate me, how she knew that.” It is hard for Kim to accept that her mother – a woman with such vitality and life force – is dead. “She had such a strong character,” she says. “Her not being there, I can’t understand.” A few weeks after Michele died, Kim called her mobile. “It was only when the number didn’t connect,” Kim says, “that my heart sank, and I realised.” *** In England alone, the Covid-19 vaccine is estimated to have prevented up to 24.1m infections and 126,800 deaths. Two doses of the Pfizer or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine are respectively 96% and 92% effective against hospitalisation with the Delta variant. (The effectiveness of the vaccines in protecting against the Omicron variant is not yet known.) But although the Covid-19 vaccine is safe and highly effective, it cannot work on everyone. For some immunocompromised people, their bodies will not mount a good immune response to the vaccination, meaning they fail to produce the antibodies that should circulate in their blood and recognise the Covid-19 virus if they later become infected. For these people, life in post-lockdown Britain is full of risk and trepidation: they are not protected from Covid-19 by the immunity a vaccination would provide, and nor are they able to avoid the pandemic entirely, given that tens of thousands of new infections are being reported every single day. People may be immunosuppressed for one of three reasons. First, they have a genetic condition that means they have a primary problem with their immune system. Second, because they are afflicted with a disease that causes their immune system to be underpowered. Third, because they are taking medication to treat an underlying condition that suppresses their immune system. Michele most likely fitted into this final category. The medication she took to manage her arthritis, rituximab, is a known immunosuppressant. (She was taking other medicines to treat mental health problems and diabetes, but none of these are known to have the same effect.) “When you have rheumatoid arthritis,” explains the rheumatologist Dr Zachary Wallace of Massachusetts general hospital, “your immune system is basically overreacting. It’s recognising things that it shouldn’t think of as a danger, like its own joints, as a danger, and it is attacking them. That’s why we use medicines to suppress that process. But when we do that, the immune system doesn’t work as well at attacking viruses and other infections.” Wallace has been monitoring breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated patients with autoimmune conditions since early 2021. “People who receive rituximab appear to be particularly at risk,” he says. (Roche, which markets rituximab in Europe as MabThera, declined to comment.) In the UK, a research team led by Prof Iain McInnes of Glasgow University has been examining the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccination in people with compromised immune systems. Initial findings from the Octave study said that about 11% of immunocompromised people failed to generate any antibodies to Covid-19 vaccination, and a further 29% generated a suboptimal antibody response, meaning they failed to produce the same level of antibodies a healthy person would generate in response to vaccination. The study specifically identified rituximab as an immunosupressant. But Michele had no idea about any of this. She had never heard about immunosuppressant drugs or what impact they could have on Covid-19 vaccination. In late March 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care wrote to her, telling her that shielding would be paused from 1 April due to the fact that virus infection rates were low and nine out of 10 clinically extremely vulnerable people had been vaccinated. Although the letter stated that “no vaccine is 100% effective”, there was no mention made of the fact that immunocompromised people specifically might not be protected by the vaccine, and should consider extra measures to keep themselves safe. “There are some people,” says Vicky Foxcroft, the Labour MP for Lewisham Deptford and shadow minister for disabled people, “who were very aware that the vaccines might not work, and very scared. But for a lot of others, the comms from the government has been: everything is fine. Crack on. Do what you were doing.” Foxcroft is herself immunocompromised; like Michele, she has rheumatoid arthritis, and she has been advocating for immunocompromised people throughout the pandemic. “We’ve been an afterthought,” she says. “Probably because we’re only a small part of the population, and we’re inconvenient. But it’s still not acceptable.” Foxcroft tells me that she often hears from immunocompromised people who are being forced back to work by their employers. Although the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are currently encouraging employees to work from home where possible, that advice was cancelled in England on 19 July and has yet to be reinstated, despite the spread of the Omicron variant. “I’d like to see the guidance changed for employers,” Foxcroft says, “so that people are able to work from home if necessary.” To make matter worse, when shielding was paused on 1 April, immunocompromised people and others in vulnerable groups lost the financial support that helped them to remain at home. Foxcroft herself does not feel safe in the workplace. “I wish people would wear their masks in parliament,” she says. “But I try not to think about it. Because how else would I do my job?” *** Michele became ill on 6 July. She fainted on the way to the toilet and Terry had to carry her to bed. He called an ambulance but the wait time was four hours, and when the paramedics finally arrived and checked Michele over they said she was fine. The following day, Michele was confused. She kept trying to drink from a bottle of water without taking the lid off. Terry called for an ambulance, but they told him it would be a five-hour wait. He tried to drive Michele to the hospital himself, but she refused to get in the car – Michele notoriously hated hospitals and would often escape from them if forcibly admitted. By 9 July, Michele had stopped making sense. Terry asked her how she felt and she looked through him wordlessly. She couldn’t remember her date of birth. Terry called 111 and asked for an ambulance, and was told that it would take two hours. When the paramedics finally arrived they asked Michele who Terry was. “She just stared at me blankly,” he remembers. After she was admitted, a doctor from the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead called Terry. He told him that Michele was seriously ill and asked if doctors should attempt to resuscitate her if her heart or breathing stopped. He also told Terry that Michele had Covid. “I didn’t for one minute think she would die,” says Terry. “She was double vaccinated. As far as I was concerned she was poorly but not seriously ill.” Later, doctors told Terry that they had tested Michele, and found that she didn’t have any antibodies from the vaccine. “Freedom Day” – 19 July – came and went for the Brown family in a fug of grief. Michele was by now in intensive care. Terry wasn’t allowed in, due to the Covid visitor restrictions. He begged them to let him visit. “I said, ‘We’ve had freedom day. Thousands of people at Wembley, cheering the England football team on. And you’re saying I can’t sit with my wife, who is dying?’” Kim spoke to her mother on the phone, right before they put her on a ventilator. It was a disturbing phone call. Michele told Kim that she felt awful, and she was tired. Kim got the sense that she didn’t want to hang up. She could hear her mother struggling to breathe, and coughing. “I just knew,” Kim says. “I knew what was coming.” Doctors placed Michele on a ventilator, and dialysis, but it was no use. She died on 29 July. The hospital let the family visit Michele at the end. “It was horrific,” says Kim. “I held her hand, and I was kissing it. But I knew that she was gone.” The family decided to turn off Michele’s ventilator. “She’d been through enough,” says Kim. “She was bruised to bits, from where they took blood from her. We let her slip off.” The hardest thing for Terry was not being able to see Michele after he left the hospital. “It was a closed coffin because of Covid. That killed me.” He thought he would be able to see his wife again, to say goodbye. *** Stories of people who died of breakthrough infections – when a person becomes infected with Covid-19 after being vaccinated – are routine in online anti-vaxx or anti-lockdown communities. “Fully vaccinated man dies of Covid-19”, reads one post shared on an anti-vaxx Facebook group with 31,000 members. “The fully vaccinated die of Covid!” reads another post on a Facebook group with 6,500 members. “Will the mainstream media start recognising the facts of Covid vaccines – they are lethal?” When the vaccinated former US secretary of state Colin Powell died with Covid-19 last October, anti-vaxxers and vaccine-sceptics heralded his death as proof that the vaccine is ineffective. “Colin Powell died from Covid and he was fully vaccinated,” read one typical post. “So what’s the point of the vaccine?” (Powell had myeloma, a blood cancer that put him at greater risk from the virus.) “This narrative comes up again and again,” says Pippa Allen-Kinross of the factchecking organisation Full Fact, which has been examining online misinformation throughout the pandemic. “It’s really difficult, because we know the vaccine is not 100% effective. But we do know that it’s really effective, and makes a huge difference.” In reality, when 4.3 billion people worldwide have received a dose of the Covid vaccine, breakthrough infections are to be expected. In the period 2 January to 2 July 2021, 640 fully vaccinated people died of breakthrough infections in England, out of 51,281 deaths. Of those 640 deaths, 84 (13%) were in immunocompromised people. Unvaccinated people are currently estimated to be 32 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than fully vaccinated people, although experts have warned that there is uncertainty in this headline figure. “Deaths in vaccinated people have repeatedly been used to back up claims that the vaccines don’t work,” says the statistician Prof David Spiegelhalter of Cambridge University. “But when most vulnerable people have been vaccinated, and the vaccine is less than perfect, then it is inevitable that there will be deaths in vaccinated people, and indeed they have formed the majority of Covid deaths for months. This is basic maths.” He uses the example of seatbelts. “Most car occupants who die in crashes are wearing seatbelts, because nearly everyone is wearing a seat belt and they don’t provide full protection. This does not mean that seatbelts ‘don’t work’ – it just means they reduce risk.” Part of the problem, says Allen-Kinross, is that government data is so easy to misinterpret. “It’s very easy for people to use this data in a misleading way, to suggest that vaccines don’t work at all.” She uses the example of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which is one of the most-listened to podcasts in the US. On 12 October 2021, Rogan hosted American journalist Alex Berenson, who stated – incorrectly – that “people who are vaccinated with two doses are more likely to be infected with Sars-CoV-2 than people who are not vaccinated”. Full Fact subsequently debunked Berenson’s claims. But given that Rogan’s podcast has an estimated audience of 11 million an episode, these efforts, while a laudable endeavour, are likely to be seen by only a tiny percentage of the people who received the earlier misinformation. “This bad information,” says Allen-Kinross, “really ruins lives.” *** At the Brown home in Gateshead, everything is unchanged. Michele’s dressing gown still hangs on the back of the bedroom door. There are bottles of antibacterial gel on the worktop. “The whole house is Michele,” Terry says. “It’s her home. It will always be her home, as long as I’m breathing.” He is racked with guilt. “Why did I let this happen?” he asks. “I didn’t protect her.” Terry wishes he had known that her vaccinations didn’t work. “I keep thinking,” Terry says, through choked sobs, “that if I’d been aware, we’d have stayed in our bubble. We wouldn’t have allowed anyone to visit. We’d have stuck to the same regime we had at the start. That’s what I’m finding difficult. Because we’d done everything we were supposed to do. The vaccines were to us like a lifeboat in choppy seas.” There are probably other families in the same situation as Terry and Michele: unaware that the vaccines they rely on to keep them safe may, in fact, be ineffective. “Very often people don’t know how their medicines may affect them,” says Lara Wong of Clinically Vulnerable Families UK. “They don’t realise, which means they may not be taking all the steps they possibly can to protect themselves.” In September, the Department of Health and Social Care wrote to people on the shielding list, to inform them that shielding had officially ended. It tells the Guardian: “We announced an end to the shielding programme based on the success of the Covid-19 vaccination programme in reducing serious illness and death from Covid-19 and the emergence of proven treatments.” The letter to shielders advised: “If you are immunosuppressed and have any concerns about what this means for you, then please raise this with your specialist at your next routine appointment.” “I haven’t seen my specialist for months,” says Foxcroft, pointing out that there is an enormous post-pandemic backlog of non-urgent NHS care. “It’s impossible to get an appointment. And even if you do get advised to shield, there’s no government support available for shielders. So what do they do? Do they lose their job? What’s the score?” For immunocompromised people who are aware that their vaccines may not work, or work less well – life in a post-unlocking UK is full of anxiety and trepidation. “People say: ‘Why don’t they just hide away?’” says Wong. “But what they don’t realise is that a lot of the people have been. They’ve been at home for the last two years. If infection rates were lower, they could have a life as well. When we protect the most vulnerable, we protect everyone.” Booster jabs have gone some way to allaying their concerns: the initial findings from the Octave study, published in August 2021, were used to inform the government’s decision to offer at-risk groups, including immunocompromised people, booster vaccines in September. McInnes’s research team is now working on the Octave Duo study, to determine the effectiveness of booster vaccines in immunocompromised people. “The preliminary data,” says McInnes, “shows that a significant proportion of people are benefiting from a third inoculation, and we think it’s a good idea to further roll out this programme.” Last week, in response to Omicron, the government announced plans to offer severely immunosuppressed people a fourth dose of the vaccine as a booster. But Wong points out that many immunocompromised people will have children attending school. Until the advent of the Omicron variant in late November, the government did not ask pupils to wear masks in English schools. Even now, it is only strongly advised in communal areas, and the bubble system has been scrapped. Some parents have been threatened with prosecution for pulling their children out of school when case numbers are high. This month, Clinically Vulnerable Families UK wrote to the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, urging him to permit remote education for the children of clinically vulnerable households, rather than mandate such children return to in-school education. “There are light-touch measures we could put into place that would make things safer for everyone,” Wong says. “Hepa air filters in school, to clean the air; mask wearing to be strongly encouraged.” Some immunocompromised people have called for antibody testing to be routinely offered to those who request it, to see if the vaccine has been effective. “The problem is,” says Wallace, “these tests are difficult to interpret, because we don’t have all the information about what an adequate level of antibodies is yet.” Monoclonal antibody treatments, which are laboratory-made antibodies to help a person fight infection, may also be effective in treating people with low immunity. Wallace also urges his immunocompromised patients to “be cautious, wear masks in public, and avoid densely populated places that don’t have good ventilation. Only socialise with people they know are vaccinated and feeling well.” These immunocompromised people seem doomed to continue to live a half-life for the foreseeable future. And with the Omicron variant spreading throughout the UK, it seems likely that the wider public will be forced into the anxious wariness that has become the norm for immunocompromised people for nearly two years. They watch, and they wait, while the families of the 145,000 people who have died with Covid-19 in the UK mourn. And they pray they won’t be next."

Thanks for joining us, stay safe and keep up-to-date with all Covid developments here. Nightclubs in France will be ordered to close for four weeks from Friday to counter a Covid surge that has put hospitals under strain. New Covid restrictions are to be introduced in Norway after a recent increase in infections. Britain’s health minister said there is now community transmission of the Omicron variant across regions of England. The Czech government will order Covid-19 vaccinations for people working in hospitals and nursing homes as well as police officers, soldiers and some other professions and all citizens aged 60 and older. A new range of pandemic restrictions will be imposed in Poland this week. Italy tightened restrictions on people still not vaccinated, limiting their access to an array of places and services. Children in the Philippines’ capital Manila returned to school after a near two-year suspension. India’s cases of the Omicron variant rose to 21 over the weekend, officials said, while Nepal and Thailand detected their first cases. South Africa is preparing hospitals for more admissions, as the Omicron variant pushes the country into a fourth wave of infections. Austria’s general lockdown will end on 11 December for those who have been vaccinated. All private employers in New York City will have to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations for their workers. Combining a first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine with a second dose of either the Moderna or the Novavax jabs results in far higher levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cells compared with two doses of the AstraZeneca jab, a study has found. The finding has important implications for lower-income countries that have not yet completed their primary vaccination campaigns, as it suggests you do not need access to mRNA vaccines – and therefore ultra-cold storage facilities – to trigger an extremely potent Covid-19 vaccine response. The strongest T-cell response of all was generated by a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine followed by a dose of the Novavax vaccine – both of which can be stored in a standard refrigerator.

Nightclubs in France will be ordered to close for four weeks from Friday to counter a Covid surge that has put hospitals under strain, the prime minister said on Monday. “We will close the nightclubs for the next four weeks. This measure will apply from next Friday until the beginning of January,” Jean Castex, who emerged from quarantine last week after contracting the virus, said. “We have all had a tendency to lower our guard” in recent weeks, he added. “The situation demands an individual as well as a collective effort,” Castex said in a televised address. A raft of new measures will be coming into force according to a statement from the ministry of health. France has confirmed only 25 cases of the new Omicron variant but officials say the number could jump significantly in the coming weeks. On Sunday, the health ministry reported more than 42,000 cases in the previous 24 hours, and more than 11,000 patients in hospital - the highest number since August - with 2,000 in intensive care. Hello it’s Samantha Lock joining you as my colleague Jedidajah Otte takes a break. As I’m reporting to you from Sydney here are some Covid figures just released from Australia this morning. The state of New South Wales recorded 260 new Covid-19 cases and two deaths, while Victoria recorded 1,185 new Covid-19 cases and seven deaths over the past 24 hours. The Victorian ombudsman has also handed down her finding on the Victorian Covid-19 border permit system, describing it as ‘unjust’ and ‘inhumane’. The Queensland border is opening next Monday, with the state set to reach 80% double vaccination sometime this week. State premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told ABC that once the Queensland border is open, it’s open for good. Austria’s general lockdown will end on 11 December for those who have been vaccinated, health minister Wolfgang Mückstein said on Monday evening, but will continue for those who have not been inoculated against Covid-19. The president of intensive care physicians, Walter Hasibeder, expects that it will take another week until the number of Covid patients in intensive care units begins to drop. But the situation would remain critical until only 10% of the intensive care places are occupied by Covid patients, Hasibeder said. Currently, that figure stands at 30%. On Monday, Austria recorded 4,625 new infections and 48 deaths from the virus. A further 15 suspected cases of Omicron were also reported in Vienna on Monday, Der Standard newspaper reported. Brazil has recorded 4,385 new Covid-19 infections in the past 24 hours, as well as 108 further virus-related deaths, the health ministry said on Monday. The South American country has now registered 22,147,476 cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 615,744, according to ministry data, in the world’s third worst outbreak outside the US and India and its second deadliest. With 65% of the population fully vaccinated, the rolling 14-day average of Covid deaths has fallen to 211 per day, compared with a toll of almost 3,000 a day at the peak of the pandemic in April, Reuters reports. Healthcare disruptions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic led to malaria killing 69,000 more people in 2020 than in the previous year, but a worst-case scenario was averted, the World Health Organization said on Monday. In total, over 627,000 people globally – most of them babies in the poorest parts of Africa – were killed by malaria last year, compared with 558,000 in 2019, the WHO said in its annual malaria report. The number is far higher than the 224,000 people reported to have died from Covid in Africa since the start of the pandemic. About two-thirds of the additional malaria deaths in 2020 were due to coronavirus restrictions disrupting prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, the WHO said. But efforts to maintain health services in the face of the challenges meant Sub-Saharan Africa did not see the doubling of malaria deaths in 2020 that the WHO had warned was a possibility, Reuters reports. Instead, the number of deaths in the region rose 12% compared with 2019, according to WHO data. Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO’s global malaria programme, said: Thanks to urgent and strenuous efforts, we can claim that the world has succeeded in averting the worst-case scenario of malaria deaths. Experts hope the fight against malaria might gain considerable ground following the WHO’s recommendation in October that RTS,S, or Mosquirix – a vaccine developed by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline – should be widely given to children in Africa. The US Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) has urged Americans to avoid travel to France, Portugal, Tanzania and Jordan after their Covid-19 risk level was elevated to “very high”. The four countries have been added to a list now comprising 83 countries around the globe that Americans are advised to avoid travelling to. Since today, all air travellers, regardless of citizenship or vaccination status, have to show a negative pre-departure Covid-19 test taken the day before they board their flight to the US, after the CDC shortened the timeline for required testing for all international air travellers last week. Former UK prime minister Theresa May has urged the government to find ways for the population to learn to “live with Covid” rather than respond to new variants by “stopping and starting sectors of our economy”. May and other senior Conservative MPs on the backbenches questioned the government’s response to the Omicron variant in the House of Commons on Monday. May said: The early indications of Omicron are that it is more transmissible but potentially leads to less serious illness than other variants. I understand that would be the normal progress of a virus. Variants will continue to appear year after year. When is the government going to accept that learning to live with Covid, which we will all have to do, means we will almost certainly have an annual vaccine and that we cannot respond to new variants by stopping and starting sectors of our economy which leads to businesses going under and jobs being lost? Conservative former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers criticised the government’s decision to impose “new expensive requirements” for international travel, while former transport secretary Chris Grayling urged health secretary Sajid Javid to “face down the more conservative elements of the scientific community, do the right thing and keep the restrictions as minimal as possible”. Hello, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be at the helm of this blog for the next few hours. Feel free to get in touch with pertinent updates, tips or comments, you can reach me on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. The Omicron variant of coronavirus is now circulating within the community in the UK, according to the health secretary, Sajid Javid. He told MPs “multiple regions of England” were seeing cases not linked to international travel. But he added that none of the 336 people with a confirmed case of Omicron had been admitted to hospital. New Covid restrictions are to be introduced in Norway after a recent increase in infections, the country’s health minister has said. “These measures will be felt in our daily lives,” Ingvild Kjerkol said, adding that the new measures had become necessary because of a rise in infections and the uncertainty of the potential impact of Omicron. All private employers in New York City will have to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations for their workers, the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has announced. The vaccine mandate for private businesses will take effect on 27 December. De Blasio also announced an extension to the city’s Covid passports to all people aged over five years old. A sweeping vaccine mandate is to be imposed in the Czech Republic, with care workers, nurses, doctors, police and soldiers, and anyone else aged over 60, to be ordered to take a coronavirus vaccine. “Other countries are taking this path,” The health minister, Adam Vojtech, said. “It is a trend that will prevail across Europe.” A vaccine mandate for public sector workers in Slovenia was struck down as unconstitutional by the country’s highest court. “Such a condition is comparable with obligatory vaccination, which is something that first requires a change in the law on infectious diseases,” the constitutional court said of the mandate, which the government had aimed to impose on 1 October. A new package of pandemic restrictions will be imposed in Poland this week, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. “Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow at the latest, we will present a second (package) related to the Christmas situation, and as reaction to the virus’ Omicron mutation,” Morawiecki said. Vaccine mandates would be included, he said. An epidemiologist who has been a prominent voice of caution in handling the Covid pandemic has been appointed minister for health in Germany. Olaf Scholz, who is to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, picked Karl Lauterbach for the closely watched appointment, according to the US-based news agency the Associated Press. Croatia, Nepal, Russia and Argentina were among the countries reporting their first cases of Omicron. In Thailand a health official said on Monday that the country’s first suspected case of the new variant had been detected but authorities would withhold confirmation ahead of further test results. The variant has also been found in at least 16 US states. Nigerian high commissioner to the UK, Sarafa Tunji Isola, described a ban on travel between the two countries as “travel apartheid”. “We’re not dealing with an endemic situation, we are dealing with a pandemic situation, and what is expected is a global approach, not selective,” Isola said. “Omicron is classified as a mild variant – no hospitalisation, no death.” South Africa is preparing its hospitals for further admissions, as the Omicron variant pushes the country into a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections, the president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said in a statement on Monday. Ramaphosa said Omicron appeared to be dominating new infections in most provinces and urged more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. That’s it from me, Damien Gayle, for today. Twenty five cases of the Omicron variant have so far been identified in France, the health minister has said. Olivier Veran said 21 cases were imported from people returning from countries in southern Africa, and four were the result of local infection. The Omicron variant seems much more contagious than the Delta variant, he added. Veran also said that France is aiming to start offering Covid-19 vaccination to all children aged five to 11 from 20 December, provided health authorities give the go-ahead. None of the 336 people with a confirmed case of Omicron in the UK have been admitted to hospital, according to the health secretary. Conservative MP Sir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) asked Sajid Javid in the Commons: “How many of those who have tested positive in the UK are ill?” Sajid Javid said: “The number of confirmed cases in the UK is 336 - they are all by definition infected. He added: “Some may be asymptomatic, others will be feeling ill. None of them, so far, as far as I am aware, have been hospitalised.” Looks like it’s going to be a grim festive season for nightclubbers in France this year. I’ll bring you more on this as it comes in. The Omicron variant of coronavirus is now circulating within the community in the UK, according to the health secretary. Sajid Javid told MPs on Monday that “multiple regions of England” were seeing cases of the variant that were not linked to international travel. He could not guarantee the variant would not “knock us off our road to recovery”, as the “the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron”. Javid told the Commons there were now 261 confirmed Omicron cases in England, 71 in Scotland, and four in Wales. He said: We are learning more about this new variant all the time. Recent analysis from the UK Health Security Agency suggests that the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron variant than for the Delta variant, but we don’t yet have a complete picture of whether Omicron causes more severe disease or indeed how it interacts with the vaccines. We can’t say for certain at this point whether Omicron has the potential to knock us off our road to recovery. The UK government said that as of 9am on Monday, there had been a further 51,459 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases across the country, and a further 41 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 170,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. A sweeping vaccine mandate is to be imposed in the Czech Republic, with care workers, nurses, doctors, police and soldiers, and anyone else aged over 60, to be ordered to take a coronavirus vaccine. The health minister Adam Vojtech, who spoke to reporters via videolink from his own Covid self-isolation, said his ministry would issue a decree adding the Covid-19 shot to other compulsory vaccinations this week. “Other countries are taking this path,” Vojtech said. “It is a trend that will prevail across Europe.” Those who refuse would be barred from working in the selected professions, Reuters quoted him as saying. Vojtech said he would go ahead of the decree in spite of the likelihood that it will be curtailed by a new centre-right government which may take power as soon as next week. A senior member of the incoming coalition said on the weekend that the future cabinet would scrap the mandate for citizens over 60, but may uphold the obligation for selected professions. Only 59.6% of Czechs are vaccinated, compared to an EU average of 66.4%, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Early findings from studies carried out in the UK suggest that one in eight people hospitalised with Covid may have suffered heart damage, according to a report in the Telegraph. One study led by the University of Glasgow analysed a random sample of 161 recovering patients, 90% of whom had needed hospital treatment, scanning their hearts, lungs and kidneys a month or two after they had been discharged. “About one patient in eight had evidence of heart inflammation,” Colin Berry, a professor of cardiology, told the Telegraph. “That is a high incidence.” Berry stressed that the research had not yet been peer reviewed. A second study, at Oxford university, also found inflammation of organs in people who had needed hospital treatment for Covid. Dr Betty Raman, a British Heart Foundation clinical research fellow, used magnetic resonance imaging to study the brains, hearts, livers and kidneys of volunteers for post-hospitalisation studies. Raman’s study was ongoing, but she told the Telegraph a preliminary assessment of 58 patients had found “inflammation of multiple organs, the heart and vascular system in particular”. This is Damien Gayle back at the helm. In Australia, an alliance of legal services have urged the New South Wales government to to stop chasing people to pay Covid fines, saying have been issued incorrectly and have disproportionately hurt Indigenous Australians, homeless groups and people living with a disability, reports Christopher Knaus. A Thai health official said Monday that the country’s first suspected case of the new omicron variant had been detected but authorities would withhold confirmation ahead of further test results. Head of the department of medical sciences, Supakit Sirilak, said at a daily press briefing reported by Reuters that the “likely” case of the omicron variant had been identified in an American businessman who tested positive on 1 December after entering Thailand from Spain. “The analysis result confirms a 99.92% chance of it being the omicron variant. The ministry and private laboratories are now running parallel tests and we will know the result today. Initially, it is likely to be the first omicron case of Thailand,” Supakit said at the briefing. Nearly 70 nurses and doctors working in the intensive care unit at a Spanish hospital have tested positive for Covid-19 after attending a Christmas party, health authorities said on Monday. Reuters reports: Sixty-eight medics at the University Regional Hospital in Malaga had been diagnosed with the coronavirus, the Andalusian regional government said. Health authorities said they were investigating the source of the infection but added all 68 attended a Christmas party on 1 December at which 173 people were present. Another possible source of the infection could have been a large meal for hospital staff, authorities said. In the UK, 51,459 people tested positive for coronavirus on 5 December, according to official figures. This represents a 9% rise on last week. There were 41 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, a fall of 0.2%. Switzerland has released longer-term figures showing that there were 5,928 coronavirus-related hospital admissions between the start of its vaccination campaign in December 2020 and August 2021. German-language news source 20 Minuten reports that 14 deaths were recorded among those who were double vaccinated, and 437 among unvaccinated patients. Italy reported 92 coronavirus-related deaths on Monday against 43 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections fell to 9,503 from 15,021. Reuters reports: Italy has registered 134,287 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 5.12 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 5,879 on Monday, up from 5,597 a day earlier.

New Covid restrictions are to be introduced in Norway after a recent increase in infections, the country’s health minister has said. “Tomorrow, we will come up with a new measure because we have got a situation with a lot of infection with the Delta variant. In addition, we have the Omicron variant that spread quickly,” Ingvild Kjerkol told NRK, Norway’s public broadcaster, on Monday, according to The Local. “These measures will be felt in our daily lives,” she said. New and tighter pandemic restrictions are also expected to come into force in Poland this week. Another announcement by Bill de Blasio this morning, which we underplayed a little in our earlier post, is that all children aged over five will soon need vaccine passports to enter restaurants, theatres, museums or arcades in New York City. Speaking on MSNBC, de Blasio announced that from 14 December, children between five and 11 will need to have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine to enter a range of public locations in the city. It will be a serious impediment to many youngsters. Just 20% of people in that age group are vaccinated, Newsweek quoted de Blasio’s press secretary, Danielle Filson, as saying. The “Key to NYC” coronavirus vaccine passport programme began in August, with adults initially required to show proof of one dose of vaccine to enter a range of establishments. Under the new rules, anyone aged over 12 will now need to have have received two doses of coronavirus vaccine to be eligible for a pass. A vaccine mandate for public sector workers in Slovenia has been struck down as unconstitutional by the country’s highest court. “Such a condition is comparable with obligatory vaccination, which is something that first requires a change in the law on infectious diseases,” the constitutional court said, according to the national STA news agency. The government had wanted to impose the mandate from 1 October, but the court blocked enforcement of the rule until it had made its ruling. Government officials were not immediately available for comment, Reuters said. Slovenia has so far fully vaccinated some 55% of its two million inhabitants, below the European Union average. Slovenia had recorded a resurgence of daily Covid cases since October. But in recent days the the number of new daily infections has been falling. On Sunday, Slovenia reported 775 new cases, down from 1,116 on Saturday. All private employers in New York City will have to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations for their workers, the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has announced. The vaccine mandate for private businesses will take effect on 27 December. De Blasio said it is is aimed at preventing a spike in Covid infections during the holiday season and the colder months. “We in New York City have decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of Covid and the dangers it’s causing to all of us,” de Blasio said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe programme, according to the Associated Press. “All private-sector employers in New York City will be covered by this vaccine mandate as of 27 December.” The city already has vaccine mandates for hospital and nursing home workers and city employees including teachers, police officers and firefighters, as well as a separate mandate for employees of private and religious schools that was announced last week. De Blasio said he expects the new mandate to survive any legal challenges, despite a temporary block issued by federal courts on an attempt by the president, Joe Biden, to impose a similar mandate nationwide. Current New York City Covid-19 rules also include at least one vaccine dose for indoor restaurant dining, entertainment venues and fitness centres. Under new mandates for indoor dining, entertainment and gyms, two shots will be required for people over 12. One shot will be required for children aged five to 11, who are not covered by the current mandate, de Blasio said. A coronavirus lockdown in place in Slovakia should be extended by a week, the country’s health minister has said. The minister, who was not named by Reuters, reportedly said he would ask the country’s cabinet to approve the extension of the lockdown until 16 December. In the past few weeks Slovakia has endured one of the world’s worst waves of coronavirus pandemic. A lockdown shutting most shops and services was imposed on 25 November. A primary school in Scotland has closed for five days after a number of Covid cases among staff believed to be linked to the Omicron variant. Todholm Primary in Paisley, Renfrewshire, closed on Monday, after an undisclosed number of staff were identified as close contacts of people infected with the latest variant of the coronavirus. A spokesperson for Renfrewshire county council told the Daily Record: Todholm primary school will temporarily close tomorrow - Monday, December 6 for 5 days. This follows NHS Test and Protect contact tracing that requires members of the school community to self-isolate, including school staff. This is due to Covid-19 cases linked to the school confirmed as or likely to be the new Omicron variant. Due to the number of staff asked to self-isolate we have taken the decision to close the school and to switch to remote learning from Monday morning. The decision has been taken as we are unable to maintain appropriate staffing levels and is not a public health matter. Following identification of cases, a further risk assessment was carried out by public health and environmental health teams and all appropriate health and safety measures were found to be robust. Croatia has also reported its first cases of Omicron, joining Nepal, Russia and Argentina in confirming the new variant within their borders. The country’s public health agency said it had detected two cases. “We are not sure about the source of the infection as neither of those two people had travelled abroad. We believe they got infected at a business meeting at which both participated,” said Bernard Kaic, an epidemiologist. Guests from abroad had been present at the business meeting, he added. Disruptions in services led to tens of thousands more deaths from malaria in 2020, the World Health Organization has said. The UN health agency said Covid-19 had reversed progress against the mosquito-borne disease, which was already plateauing before the pandemic struck. But, it added, urgent action had averted a far worse outcome. According to the WHO’s latest World Malaria Report, there were an estimated 241m malaria cases worldwide in 2020 - 14m more than a year earlier. The estimated death toll from the disease rose 69,000, to 627,000. About two thirds of the additional deaths were linked to disruptions in the provision of malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic, the WHO said. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for about 95% of all malaria cases and 96% of all deaths. About 80% of deaths in the region were among children aged under five. But the agency stressed that the situation “could have been far worse”, pointing to its projection early in the pandemic that service disruptions could cause malaria deaths to double. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said: “Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, global gains against malaria had levelled off. “Thanks to the hard work of public health agencies in malaria-affected countries, the worst projections of COVID’s impact have not come to pass. Now, we need to harness that same energy and commitment to reverse the setbacks caused by the pandemic and step up the pace of progress against this disease.” Eighteen out of 19 Covid samples sequenced in Namibia have turned out to be the new Omicron variant, the country’s health ministry has said. The finding suggests the variant, first flagged by neighbouring South Africa and Botswana late last month and since labelled “of concern” by the World Health Organization, is also highly prevalent in the southern African country. The Omicron cases were detected predominantly in and around Windhoek, the capital. The region that recorded 536 out of 695 new infections countrywide in the first five days of December. The other non-Omicron sample sequenced among the 19 was the Delta strain. Scientists around the world are trying to establish the impact of the new variant on contagion, disease severity and vaccine resistance. “We must remain on guard while we wait for further investigation about this variant,” Namibia’s health ministry said in a statement, according to Reuters. A new package of pandemic restrictions will be imposed in Poland this week, the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. “Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow at the latest, we will present a second (package) related to the Christmas situation, and as reaction to the virus’ Omicron mutation because the situation is indeed not looking good … We have many deaths,” Morawiecki told a news conference, according to Reuters. “We will strengthen the vaccination mechanism, making it compulsory for some jobs. We are considering this and we will certainly discuss stronger restrictions in certain places for people who are not vaccinated.” Current pandemic restrictions in Poland include limits on the number of people allowed into public venues, such as restaurants, bars and shops, the wearing of masks in enclosed spaces, and curbs on travel to seven African countries – a recently introduced response to the emergence of the Omicron variant. The health ministry reported 13,250 new coronavirus infections on Monday and 25 Covid-related deaths, but numbers are usually lower after the weekend. So far, 54% of Poles are fully vaccinated, lower than the 66.4% average in the European Union. Coroners in England have said lessons must be learned from failings made by overstretched services that struggled to adapt during the Covid pandemic, as details of inquests into deaths only now emerge, write Guardian reporters Sarah Marsh and Pamela Duncan. At the height of the pandemic, everything from mental health and coastguard services to care homes had to quickly change how they operated, and coroners across England are highlighting failures made during this time through reports that identify avoidable deaths. They include a woman who missed out on vital mental healthcare because of Covid cancellations and a frail elderly woman who fell and died in a care home after she was put into self-isolation. These notices, known as reports to prevent future deaths, are issued in very rare cases when it is decided that if changes are not made another person could die. An epidemiologist who has been a prominent voice of caution in handling the Covid pandemic has been appointed minister for health in Germany. Olaf Scholz, who is to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor, picked Karl Lauterbach for the closely watched appointment, according to the US-based news agency the Associated Press. The agency described Lauterbach as a “media-savvy lawmaker who lacks executive experience but has been one of Germany’s most prominent voices urging caution and strict measures against Covid-19”. The appointment comes on the heels of tough new restrictions, at both state and federal levels, that largely target people who have chosen to remain unvaccinated. The German parliament is to also consider a general vaccine mandate. Asked about prospects for the Christmas period, Lauterbach said that “an important aim must be to bring the case numbers down so far that we can recommend travel without endangering people”. The deputy first minister of Scotland has said people should take a Covid test every time they want to leave the house. John Swinney said that is what he was doing to ensure the maximum level of protection for his household and the public at large. Swinney told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland programme: We want people to increase the frequency of the use of lateral flow tests, away from the two times per week to much more frequently when they are socialising and interacting with others. Personally, I am now doing a lateral flow test every day I am going out with the prospect of meeting other members of the public outside my household. I would encourage others to do exactly the same, because that gives me confidence I’m protecting my household and it gives me confidence I’m protecting other people. Ruptly, the Russian state-backed video news agency, has published some interesting footage of the anti-lockdown protests in Brussels that were broken up by police using teargas and water cannon. You can read more about what happened here in this news report. After nearly two years out of school, some children in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, began returning to classrooms on Monday, amid extensive infection control measures. The children, part of a trial at 28 schools in the capital region, were sat down at desks fitted with plastic screens, wearing face masks, Reuters reported. The government aims to reopen all schools in January, as it tries to return the country to normal after imposing some of the world’s toughest pandemic restrictions. A hundred schools in lower risk areas reopened last month. Precautions in the trial openings include capping class sizes at 15 pupils to avoid overcrowding. The Philippines, which has has recorded 2.84 million Covid-19 cases and 49,499 deaths in total, is one of the last countries to reopen schools. Daily infections have fallen sharply to below 1,000 since 24 November, from a peak of over 20,000 in September, paving the way for a wider economic reopening. This is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog for the rest of the day. Sarafa Tunji Isola, the Nigerian high commissioner to the UK, has said of the recentlty imposed travel ban that “the reaction in Nigeria is that of travel apartheid. We’re not dealing with an endemic situation, we are dealing with a pandemic situation, and what is expected is a global approach, not selective. Omicron is classified as a mild variant – no hospitalisation, no death. So the issue is quite different from the Delta variant.” UK government’s policing minister Kit Malthouse immediately hit back, and said describing measures imposed on numerous African nations as “travel apartheid” is “very unfortunate language”. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has denied scientists’ allegations that introducing travel restrictions to slow the spread of Omicron is like “shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted”. South Africa is preparing its hospitals for further admissions, as the Omicron variant pushes the country into a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections, President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement on Monday. Ramaphosa said Omicron appeared to be dominating new infections in most provinces and urged more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. A man was fined €400 for travelling by bus in Rome without a valid health pass as new measures against the unvaccinated started in Italy. The “super green pass” bars the unvaccinated from a host of social, cultural and sporting activities, including dining inside at bars and restaurants. The incoming government in Germany wants to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory from 16 March for people working in hospitals, nursing homes and other medical practices, according to a copy of draft legislation Nepal, Russia and Argentina were among countries detecting the Omicron variant for the first time. Argentina’s health ministry said there case was a fully vaccinated person who arrived on 30 November from South Africa via the US, and who had given a negative PCR test prior to travelling and another negative antigen test upon arrival in Buenos Aires. Argentina has today approved Russia’s one-dose Sputnik Light as a standalone vaccine and a booster shot. Cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant have risen to 21 in India over the weekend and people must step up for vaccination, officials said. A probable case of the Omicron variant has been identified in a crew member of a Norwegian cruise ship that reached New Orleans on Sunday. Dr Anthony Fauci said the threat to the US from the Omicron variant remained to be determined – but that signs from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, were encouraging. The Omicron variant has been found in at least 16 US states so far, with the number of cases “likely to rise”, Dr Rochelle Walensky, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Sunday. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert cautioned that while it was increasingly obvious that ‘this pandemic is not done with us’, the next one could be more contagious, more lethal, or both. She called for more funding for pandemic preparedness. Critical care consultant Dr Zudin Puthucheary said it could be five years before Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients “reach their normal lives again”. People with cold-like symptoms should work from home and avoid Christmas parties in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus, according to Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app. Prof Paul Hunter, from the school of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said there was concern that Omicron “is spreading rather more quickly than the Delta variant” and there were probably more than 1,000 cases in the UK at the moment. He said: “I think the early signs are that it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks or a month or so at least.” That is it from me, Martin Belam, today. I will be back bright and early tomorrow. Andrew Sparrow has our combined UK politics and Covid live blog. Damien Gayle will be here shortly to guide you through the rest of the day’s coronavirus developments from around the world. Argentina and Russia have joined the ranks of countries that are reporting they have detected their first cases of the Omicron variant. According to Reuters, Interfax cited consumer health regulator Rospotrebnadzor as saying that 10 people who returned to Russia from South Africa had tested positive for Covid-19. RIA said Omicron had been detected in two arrivals from South Africa. Argentina’s health ministry said their case is a 38-year-old resident of the western Argentine province of San Luis, who arrived on 30 November from South Africa on a flight via the US and has been in isolation since. The patient involved, who was fully vaccinated, had given a negative PCR test prior to travelling and another negative antigen test upon arrival in Buenos Aires, the ministry said. The person tested again after finding out colleagues at a work event in South Africa had tested positive for Covid. “The epidemiological objective currently is to contain and delay the possible community transmission of new variants of concern,” the ministry said. The patient was in close contact with four people, who are also in isolation but have no symptoms and their PCR tests have been negative, the ministry said. All will be subjected to another PCR test at the end of their isolation. Here’s that video clip of Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert delivering the 44th Richard Dimbleby lecture, and cautioned that while it was increasingly obvious that ‘this pandemic is not done with us’, the next one could be more contagious, more lethal, or both. She called for more funding for pandemic preparedness. Argentina has approved Russia’s one-dose Sputnik Light as a standalone vaccine and a booster shot, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said, citing Argentina’s health ministry. Argentina was one of the first countries to widely use Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine. Reuters quote the RDIF saying that a study in Argentina showed Sputnik Light was an “effective universal booster” when combined with vaccines produced by AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sinopharm and CanSino. A man was fined €400 for travelling by bus in Rome without a valid health pass as new measures against the unvaccinated kicked in on Monday. The 50-year-old reportedly told police that he was planning to get vaccinated against Covid-19 over the next few days. It was the first fine issued after the requirement for the “green pass”, which shows proof of immunisation, of having recovered from Covid-19 or testing negative within the previous 48 hours, was made mandatory when travelling on buses and underground trains across Italy. The measure was already in place for long-distance trains and domestic flights. Thousands of police officers are carrying out controls on public transport. The man was caught after getting off a bus in central Rome. Meanwhile, the “super green pass” also took effect on Monday and bars the unvaccinated from a host of social, cultural and sporting activities, including dining inside at bars and restaurants. The new rules, which were announced in late November, have led to a sharp increase in the number of bookings for first-time jabs. Andrew Sparrow has launched our UK politics and Covid live blog for the day. You can find that here. I’ll be continuing on this live blog with the latest global coronavirus news. A party of the sort that is alleged to have taken place inside Downing Street last December might not necessarily have broken the strict lockdown rules in place at the time, the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, has appeared to argue. Malthouse’s comments contradicted those made by Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, who conceded on Sunday that a “formal party” of the sort reported would have been contrary to the then-Covid-19 guidance. Malthouse also took a different view to Raab’s claim that the police “don’t normally look back and investigate things that have taken place a year ago”, saying it would be right for police to follow up any formal complaints about the event. Questions about the gathering on 18 December last year, when London was in the top level of Covid restrictions, dogged Malthouse throughout a round of media interviews on Monday, one intended to showcase a new government strategy on drugs. Read more here: Ministers at odds over Downing Street Christmas parties Critical care consultant Dr Zudin Puthucheary said it could be five years before Covid-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients “reach their normal lives again”. The member of the Intensive Care Society Council in the UK raised concerns that there are not enough staff to rehabilitate patients who are treated in ICUs. PA Media quotes him telling Sky News: “People who have chosen to be unvaccinated make up the vast majority of patients on the intensive care unit at the moment, and certainly most of our pregnant patients are unvaccinated. “These are the young people – the vast majority of them do survive, 60% of our patients are currently surviving. But that survival comes with a huge cost and that needs rehabilitation. We don’t have the staff, have the resources to rehabilitate these patients, and it may be up to five years before they reach their normal lives again. “But 40% of these people are dying, and they don’t need to die had they been vaccinated.” Asked about winter pressures on the NHS, he said: “Things aren’t great in hospitals right now. As we gear up for winter, we have intensive care units that are full, wards that are full and a dropping number of stuff.” Cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant have risen to 21 in India over the weekend and people must step up for vaccination, officials said. The western state of Rajasthan reported the most number of Omicron cases with nine, followed by eight in Maharashtra, two in Karnataka and one each in Gujarat and the capital, New Delhi. “The people of Delhi must get fully vaccinated, wear a mask and maintain social distancing,” its health minister Satyendar Jain said on Twitter. He said the city’s first Omicron patient was being treated at a state-run hospital. Some 94% of its adults had received at lease one dose, he added. Reuters note that the country has fully vaccinated 51% of its 944 million adults and given at least one dose to 85%. Tens of millions of people, however, are overdue for their second dose despite ample vaccine supplies, government data shows. India reported its first two Omicron cases in the southern state of Karnataka on Thursday, including in one person with no recent travel history. Most other cases have been in people who have recently come from abroad, but doctors said the mutated virus was already spreading in the local population as well. The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has denied scientists’ allegations that introducing travel restrictions to slow the spread of Omicron is like “shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted”. Visiting police in Merseyside, PA Media quote the Prime Minister telling reporters: No, I think what we’re doing is responding to the pandemic. We were the first country in the world to take decisive measures to tackle Omicron. We put about 10 countries automatically, immediately, on to the red list and we said that anybody coming from any country in the world would have to quarantine for a couple of days. We’re now going further and toughening those measures up as we see the spread of Omicron around the world. I don’t think we need to change the overall guidance and advice we’re giving about Omicron in this country. We’re still waiting to see exactly how dangerous it is, what sort of effect it has in terms of deaths and hospitalisations. People with cold-like symptoms should work from home and avoid Christmas parties in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus, according to Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app. The professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London told Times Radio the UK should be “much more open-minded about who we are testing” and “get more people to isolate at least for a few days with cold-like symptoms”. “At the moment, we’re estimating that somewhere between one and three and one in four colds are actually due to Covid,” he said. And so that’s quite a high rate of people that are currently not even bothered to get a lateral flow test, or getting a PCR test, going to parties and spreading it around. “So if that transfers to Omicron then we’re going to be compiling that problem much faster than we would need to.” PA Media quote him saying: “We want to tell people that if you don’t feel well that day, don’t go out, don’t go to work, work from home, because the start of that sniffle, the start of that sore throat, that headache could be a mild dose of Covid that is just breaking through your vaccine. “So I think everyone needs to be much more aware of a whole range of symptoms and not wait for the loss of smell or taste which may never come, not wait for fever, not wait for that persistent cough.” Nepal has detected its first two cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the health ministry has said. A 66-year-old foreigner, who had entered Nepal from a country with confirmed Omicron variant on 19 November, and another 71-year-old person who was in close contact with him tested positive for Omicron on Sunday, the ministry said in a statement. It did not identify their nationalities. “Both of them are in isolation and getting healthcare under the supervision of health workers,” the statement said. Sixty-six other people who had contacts with them were traced and all tested negative, it added. Gopal Sharma reports for Reuters from Kathmandu that Nepal recently banned travellers from eight African countries and Hong Kong over fears about the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. The UK government’s policing minister Kit Malthouse has immediately hit back about that, and said describing measures imposed on numerous African nations as “travel apartheid” is “very unfortunate language”. PA Media quote him telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It’s very unfortunate language to use. We understand the difficulties that’s created by these travel restrictions, but we’re trying to buy a little bit of time so that our scientists at Porton Down can work on the virus and assess how difficult it’s going to be for us to cope with as a country. Sarafa Tunji Isola, the Nigerian high commissioner to the UK, has had some strong words this morning about border closures over the Omicron variant. PA Media quotes him telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The reaction in Nigeria is that of travel apartheid. Because Nigeria is actually aligned with the position of the UN secretary general that the travel ban is apartheid, in the sense that we’re not dealing with an endemic situation, we are dealing with a pandemic situation, and what is expected is a global approach, not selective. Omicron is classified as a mild variant – no hospitalisation, no death. So the issue is quite different from the Delta variant. I mean, the position has to be taken based on scientific and empirical evidence. It is not a kind of panicky situation. Here is a reminder of England’s travel red list: Prof Paul Hunter, from the school of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said there was concern that Omicron “is spreading rather more quickly than the Delta variant” and there were probably more than 1,000 cases in the UK at the moment. He told BBC Breakfast it was not clear how evidence from South Africa would translate to the UK as we have a highly vaccinated population. PA Media quotes him saying: How it’s likely to spread in the UK still uncertain, but I think the early signs are that it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta and become the dominant variant probably within the next weeks or a month or so at least. The big remaining question is actually how harmful it is if you do get Covid with this Omicron variant, and that’s the question that we’re struggling to answer at the moment. He said travel restrictions would have a minor impact, adding that “one of the problems with travel restrictions like this is that it then de-motivates other countries to actually be open about their own situations for fear of what they would see as economic sanctions. So I think once the infection is spreading within a country, then border restrictions don’t really add anything. We’ve known that long before Covid. This has been knowledge that we’ve had for decades, if not centuries, to be honest.” Asked if the UK was closer to the start of the pandemic than the end, he said: “I wouldn’t necessarily agree totally with that. I think this virus is around, going to be around, forever. “The last time we had a big coronavirus outbreak we think was 130 years ago and that virus is still circulating, we get infected with it fairly regularly, every three to six years, and it basically just causes the common cold. “That is likely the way that this pandemic is going, so we will be repeatedly infected with Covid, we will be repeatedly infected with new variants but by and large, they’ll just be another cause of the common cold and at that point, we’ll stop worrying about it, but we’re not we’re not quite there yet.” One of the other things that UK policing minister Kit Malthouse was questioned about on Sky News this morning was travel restrictions and testing requirements to travel. He said: We have to recognise that all these things are impositions on people’s lives and lifestyles. They’re obviously an extra cost and they cause difficulty for the travel industry. Now we need to try and smooth that as much as possible, and be proportionate about our response. We’ve got family overseas. We’re going to be travelling at Christmas, where we will have done tests in and out, in and out both ways. And it is a total pain, especially if you’ve got kids, right? So we understand. So we have to be proportionate and make judgments at the right moment. That’s what we’ve done. And it feels to me as if in the face of the unknown of this virus at the moment, for the next few weeks, that’s where we need to be, We’re in a much better place than a lot of countries right now. The decisions we made in the summer are paying dividends. That booster programme is going really well, 20 million people now I think and rising. The government’s own figures show that of those in the population aged 12 and above, 88.8% have had a first dose of a vaccine, 80.9% two doses, and 35.2% have a had a third or booster jab. There have been 20.2m booster jabs administered. A quick snap from Reuters here that a man in his 30s who had been in Italy has tested positive for the Omicron variant in the third case to be found in Japan. Speaking at a news conference, chief cabinet secretary Hirokazu Matsuno provided no further details, not saying which country the traveller was coming from or giving his nationality. While doing the media round this morning, UK policing minister Kit Malthouse has been repeatedly asked about whether police should investigate the Christmas party that is alleged to have taken place at No 10 Downing Street last year while London was under tier three Covid restrictions which would have made such a gathering against the regulations. On Sky News, he said: No 10 are are reassuring everybody that all rules were complied with during that period, and I take that reassurance at face value. But no doubt if the police are alerted, they will have a look, and they’ll form a view, and we’ll all learn more about it in the days to come. My colleague Peter Walker has summed up the Malthouse response thus: Eric Berger writes for us that the Omicron variant brings fresh concern for US mental heath after ‘grim two years’: “Despite vaccinations, we still see that people are not back to pre-pandemic levels of wellbeing,” said Silvia Saccardo, a social scientist and co-author of a recent study on college students at the University of Pittsburgh students. “And they are not back to pre-pandemic levels of physical activity, which could have consequences as well, and this is quite worrisome, because if lifestyle habits and wellbeing don’t naturally rebound, it’s important to think about what to do, about interventions to help them.” Psychologists and others who study mental health attribute the high rates of anxiety and depression to continued worries about the virus, and lingering trauma from the worst parts of the pandemic. That is not unusual, said Sharon Hoover, co-director of the University of Maryland-based National Center for School Mental Health. For example, more than 18 months after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, 15% of youths exposed to the natural disaster continued to suffer from serious emotional disturbances, such as anxiety disorders, compared with a 4.2% national average, according to a study in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Like the twentysomethings Isaacs has seen, children and teens have also missed out on significant life events, Hoover said, and “that doesn’t get remedied overnight by reintroducing those things”. Read more of Eric Berger’s report here: Omicron brings fresh concern for US mental heath after ‘grim two years’ On Sky News this morning, UK policing minister Kit Malthouse has been asked several questions about Covid and the Omicron variant. One was whether given that there appear to so far have been no deaths or hospitalisations involving the new variant, was the UK government over-reacting. He said: We’re being proportionate and precautionary. Obviously we don’t know completely what this variant is going to do. We know it seems to be quite infectious, but we don’t know yet exactly how difficult it’s going to be for people’s bodies to cope with it. Research is ongoing. We’ve got world beating science, you know, world leading scientists who will be able to give us those answers over the next two or three weeks. In the meantime, what the Prime Minister has said said is, let’s be careful, right, let’s take it steady. Let’s make sure we’re masked in certain areas where we think there’s likely to be transmission. Let’s think about travel more carefully and make sure we do testing at the border to restrict the virus coming into buy us a bit more time. But fundamentally, let’s be proportionate and get on with our lives to some extent and try and have as merry a Christmas as we possibly can. So we’re learning as we go. Don’t forget Omicron is quite a way down the alphabet. That means between delta and now we’ve been through a number of variants that haven’t got very far. Let’s see where this one goes. On that last point the World Health Organization has identified five variants of concern: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron. A variant of concern, they say, has been demonstrated to be associated with one or more of the following changes at a degree of global public health significance: Increase in transmissibility or detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology; or Increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation; or Decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics. There are currently two other variants of interest – Lambda and Mu – which are being investigated for their potential to become a variant of concern. Nesrene Malik has filed her latest comment piece for us today, saying that Covid jingoism will not protect the west from the threat of Omicron: There is something farcical about a political decision-making complex that has learned nothing from the past two years – two years during which the UK has tried to minimise and assume, at almost every turn, that it could escape the fate of other countries. Two years during which a very particular strain of Anglo-American swagger has emerged – one that falsely believes that if we raise our walls high enough, stockpile our vaccines and establish travel apartheid, then the pandemic will be over for us, even if it continues to rage elsewhere. It does not seem to matter that during these two years, the worst tragedies did not happen abroad, but within our borders. They happened in our care homes, our hospitals, and in the wake of government indecisiveness over locking down (thrice) when it was clear that cases were rising. Imagine how many lives might have been saved had the UK government put the promised “protective ring” around care homes with the deftness and speed it red-listed and categorised other countries. But we are living in a state of inertia, where politicians continually fail to see that the problem is not that the virus and its variants make their way to the UK, but what happens when they do. Read more here: Nesrene Malik – Covid jingoism will not protect the west from the threat of Omicron Hello, it is Martin Belam here in London, taking over from Samantha Lock. Here’s an update on the latest Covid figures in the UK. Over the last seven days there have been 322,042 new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK. Cases have increased by 5.4% week-on-week. There have been 830 deaths recorded in the last week. Deaths have decreased by 2.1% week-on-week. Hospital admissions have decreased by 0.8% week-on-week. At the latest count on the UK government’s own dashboard, there were 7,373 people in hospital in total, of whom 895 are in ventilation beds. Kit Malthouse is the government minister doing the media round this morning. Initially he is being asked on Sky News about new plans for dealing with drugs in England and Wales. I’ll bring you any Covid lines that emerge if he gets asked about that. South Africa is preparing its hospitals for more admissions, as the Omicron variant pushes the country into a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections, President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement on Monday. Ramaphosa said that Omicron appeared to be dominating new infections in most provinces and urged more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “As the country heads into a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections, we are experiencing a rate of infections that we have not seen since the pandemic started,” he said, adding that over the last week, the number of daily infections has increased five-fold. While we do not yet know what impact the Omicron variant will have on hospital admissions, we have been preparing hospitals to admit more patients, and we are investigating how we can quickly secure medication for treating Covid-19. “We will soon be convening a meeting of the National Coronavirus Command Council to review the state of the pandemic. This will enable us to take whatever further measures are needed to keep people safe and healthy,” he added. If you’ve just joined us, here’s a rundown of all the top Covid developments: The incoming German government wants to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory from 16 March for people working in hospitals, nursing homes and other medical practices, according to a copy of draft legislation seen by Reuters on Sunday. Thailand has detected its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant in a US citizen, who had travelled to the country from Spain late last month, a health official said. South Korea reported another 4,325 confirmed Covid cases in the past 24 hours and a further 41 deaths. India reported an additional 8,306 new cases in the last 24 hours and a further 211 deaths. The nation’s active caseload currently stands at 98,416 and is the lowest reported in 552 days. South Africa reported a daily increase of 11,125 new cases on Sunday, a slight decrease in the number on previous days. New Zealand purchased 60,000 courses of Pfizer’s oral antiviral medication to treat early infections of Covid, subject to Medsafe approval, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced. A probable case of the Omicron variant has been identified in a crew member of a Norwegian Cruise ship that reached New Orleans on Sunday. Dr Anthony Fauci said the threat to the US from the Omicron variant remained to be determined – but that signs from South Africa, where the variant was first detected, were encouraging. The Omicron variant has been found in at least 16 US states so far, with the number of cases “likely to rise”, Dr Rochelle Walensky, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Sunday. Thailand has detected its first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant in a US citizen who had travelled to the country from Spain late last month, a health official said on Monday, Reuters reports. The confirmed case in the man, who had arrived on 29 November, makes Thailand the 47th country to have found the new variant, Opas Karnkawinpong, Director-General of the Department of Disease Control, told a news conference. “This first confirmed case of Omicron variant is a 35-year-old man who is a US citizen who lived in Spain for a year,” Opas said adding that the patient had mild symptom. Opas said health authorities were conducting further tests of people who had come into contact with the man, but said all contacts so far were low risk. Thailand banned travellers from eight African countries including Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe at the start of December amid concerns about the Omicron variant. Opas said authorities had also limited travel from other African countries and were monitoring for more potential cases among international travellers. A probable case of the Omicron variant has been identified in a crew member of a Norwegian Cruise ship that reached New Orleans on Sunday after detecting Covid-19 among some crew and guests, the Louisiana Department of Health said. The probable case was found among 10 people who tested positive for the virus on Saturday, the health agency said in a tweet on Sunday. Another seven cases have since been reported, it added, taking the total number of cases among passengers and crew of Norwegian Breakaway, a cruise ship owned by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd , to 17. “At this time, there have been no changes to scheduled future sailings on Norwegian Breakaway,” a spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement to Reuters. The cruise ship departed New Orleans on a week-long cruise on 28 November and had stops in Belize, Honduras and Mexico, the health agency said. “NCL has been adhering to appropriate quarantine and isolation protocols,” the department said in an earlier tweet. Australia’s travel ban to several southern African countries due to the outbreak of the Omicron variant has been labelled as discriminatory by a senior diplomat. South Africa’s high commissioner to Australia, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said the ban needed to be overturned due to large numbers of Omicron cases being detected in other continents and not just in parts of Africa. “We believe it is discrimination, because the only difference is these countries [on the travel ban list] are on the African continent,” he told ABC Radio on Monday. “The ban is unfair, there is no evidence the ban works, the World Health Organization confirms that.” The travel ban to nine southern African nations was announced in the wake of the Omicron variant being detected. It also led to a two-week delay to the entry of visa holders without a medical exemption, which is now set to take place from 15 December. The Omicron strain continues to cast a bit of a shadow over the financial markets with stocks in Asia struggling in Monday’s session thanks in part to concerns about the pandemic renewing itself. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.5% but Korea, Australia and Chinese blue-chip stocks were all in positive territory. The UK, European and US markets are expected to rise at the opening bell on Monday. Kyle Rodda, market analyst at IG in Melbourne, said on Monday that as Omicron cases spread to more countries “there’s no clear sense” on what it all means for the global the economy. He added: “However early indicators are that the strain is more virulent, vaccine resistant at least to some extent, but maybe a little milder than previous strains. Concerningly, it also seems to hit kids harder than any other variant. To what degree these things are true is practically unknown at the moment. But markets seem to be pricing in that it’s going to have a negative impact on global economic activity.” Hong Kong was down 1.2% partly because Evergrande, the troubled Chinese property giant hinted that it might not meet its latest default deadline, taking its shares down 11% on Monday. South Korea has just released its daily Covid numbers with another 4,325 confirmed coronavirus cases recorded in the past 24 hours. A further 41 deaths were also reported, taking the cumulative nationwide total to 3,893. Thailand has also reported 4,000 new coronavirus cases and 22 deaths on Monday, taking the nationwide tally to more than 2.1 million cases and 20,966 deaths since the pandemic began. More than 57% of people in Thailand have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, health ministry data showed. India has reported an additional 8,306 new Covid cases in the last 24 hours, according to recently released figures from the ministry of health. A further 211 deaths were also recorded. The nation’s active caseload currently stands at 98,416 and is the lowest reported in 552 days. On Sunday, Dr Mansukh Mandaviya, India’s minister for health, announced over 50% of the eligible population had been fully vaccinated. US president Joe Biden has announced that health insurers in the US must cover the cost of at-home Covid testing from next month. Private health insurers already cover the cost for PCR tests taken at a doctor’s office but will now cover tests taken at home, too. For those Americans not covered by private health insurance, free tests will be made available at other locations across the country. “The bottom line, this winter, you’ll be able to test for free in the comfort of your home and have some peace of mind,” Biden said. New Zealand has purchased 60,000 courses of Pfizer’s oral antiviral medication to treat early infections of Covid-19, subject to Medsafe approval, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced. “It’s a big step forward for the management of Covid-19 globally. That brings the suite of Covid medicine secured and managed by PHARMAC to six in total, three of which are already in use in our hospitals and the rest of which, subject to Medsafe approval, will arrive in New Zealand early in the new year,” Ardern said. The prime minister said alongside vaccinations, hospital treatments were already reducing the likelihood of people needing intensive care, with rates in Auckland dropping from 5.7% seen early in the pandemic to 3%. Health experts will provide a more extensive briefing at the end of the week about the treatments, Ardern said. The country reported 135 new cases of the Delta variant in the community on Monday, bringing the total in the current outbreak to 9,171. The nation’s eligible population - 12 years and older - is set to hit the 90% double-vaccinated goal by 15 December. Germany has reported an additional 27,836 daily Covid cases and 81 deaths, according to recently released figures from the Robert Koch Institute. The European nation is currently mulling compulsory vaccinations for some health care employees in order to curb the spread of the virus. Germany has recorded a cumulative total of 103,121 deaths and 6,185,961 confirmed coronavirus cases. The Johnson &amp; Johnson booster shot may work well for those who originally had a Pfizer vaccine, a recent study has found. Researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston studied 65 people who had received two shots of the Pfizer vaccine. Six months after the second dose, the researchers gave 24 of the volunteers a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine and gave 41 the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. Both vaccines boosted the number of Covid-fighting T-cells but the T-cell increase delivered by the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was twice as high as that of Pfizer’s, according to the research. Volunteers who received a third Pfizer dose saw their antibody levels jump after two weeks, and then decline by a quarter by the fourth week. The Johnson &amp; Johnson booster more than doubled antibody levels between the second and fourth weeks where Pfizer’s antibodies were still about 50% higher than Johnson &amp; Johnson’s. Both levels were well above the threshold scientists believe is needed for strong protection. The results differ from earlier studies, including a “mix and match” clinical trial organised by the National Institutes of Health that reported that all three authorised vaccines — from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson — caused antibody levels to rise when used as a booster, with Johnson &amp; Johnson’s shot providing a much smaller boost than the others. The difference between the two studies might be explained by the length of delay between shots, the New York Times suggests. In the NIH. trial, many of the volunteers got their booster shots after three or four months, versus the new study’s wait of six months. The Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine therefore seems to have benefited more from the longer wait. The study was funded in part by Johnson &amp; Johnson and has not yet been published in a scientific journal. The coronavirus pandemic is far from over and the next one could be even more lethal, the creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has said. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert cautioned that while it was increasingly obvious that “this pandemic is not done with us”, the next one could be worse. Delivering the 44th Richard Dimbleby lecture, due to be broadcast on the BBC on Monday, Gilbert said that despite the destructive nature of a two-year pandemic that had already infected more than 265 million people, the next one might be more contagious and claim even more lives. “This will not be the last time a virus threatens our lives and our livelihoods,” she said. “The truth is, the next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both.” Read the full story by our reporters Andrew Gregory and Jessica Elgot here. South Africa has reported a daily increase of 11,125 new Covid cases on Sunday, a slight decrease in number on previous days. Just one death in the country was reported over the last 24 hours, bringing the nationwide tally to 89,966. US Senator Bernie Sanders has called upon pharmaceutical companies to share their vaccines, describing the current global vaccine inequality as “obscene”. “This is obscene. Last week, 8 investors in Pfizer and Moderna became $10 billion richer as news about the Omicron variant spread,” Sanders tweeted on Sunday evening. “It’s time for these pharmaceutical companies to share their vaccines with the world and start controlling their greed. Enough is enough!” The global disparity in vaccination rates is evident in the map below. Health experts continue to call for action to tackle the crisis of vaccine inequality between rich and poor countries. Failure to vaccinate the world against coronavirus created the perfect breeding ground for the emergence of the Omicron variant and should serve as a wake-up call to wealthy nations, campaigners have said. Scientists and global health experts have called for action to tackle the crisis of vaccine inequality between rich and poor countries. The longer large parts of the world remained unvaccinated, they said, the more likely the virus was to mutate significantly. The emergence of such a variant threatens to derail efforts to end the pandemic. The World Health Organization says the heavily mutated Omicron variant is likely to spread internationally and poses a very high risk of infection surges that may have severe consequences in some places. Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAids and co-chair of the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a campaign group, said: Omicron is with us because we have failed to vaccinate the world. This should be a wake-up call. “Business as usual has led to huge profits for pharmaceutical firms, but many people left unvaccinated means that this virus continues to mutate. It is the definition of madness to keep doing the same thing and expect a different outcome. We need to press reset.” Read the fully story from our reporter Andrew Gregory here. Dr Anthony Fauci said on Sunday the threat to the US from the Omicron variant remained to be determined – but that signs from South Africa, where the variant emerged, were encouraging. “Clearly in South Africa Omicron has a transmission advantage,” Fauci told CNN’s State of the Union, “because … they were very much at a low level then they had almost a vertical spike upwards, which is almost exclusively Omicron. Thus far – though it’s too early to really make any definitive statements about it – it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it. “But we have really got to be careful before we make any determinations that [Omicron] is less severe or it really doesn’t cause any severe illness comparable to Delta. But, thus far, the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity. But, again, you got to hold judgment until we get more experience.” The incoming German government wants to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory from 16 March for people working in hospitals, nursing homes and other medical practices, according to a copy of draft legislation seen by Reuters on Sunday. The European nation is currently battling a surge in Covid infections as officials propose more drastic measures to curb the spread before Christmas. The Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats, which are set to form the new German government on Wednesday, are set to present the legislation to parliament in the coming week. The draft seen by Reuters said staff working in these areas would have to prove that they are vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 or present a medical certificate to show they cannot be vaccinated by 15 March. The draft legislation also grants permission for dentists, veterinarians and pharmacists to be allowed to give shots for a temporary period with the appropriate training. The proposed legislation extends until 15 February temporary measures that would allow Germany’s federal states to introduce more drastic lockdown measures if needed, the news agency reports. The Omicron variant has been found in at least 16 US states so far, with the number of cases “likely to rise”, Dr Rochelle Walensky, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Sunday. Walensky told ABC News: “We know we have several dozen cases and we’re following them closely. And we are every day hearing about more and more probable cases so that number is likely to rise.” California was the first US state to confirm the presence of the variant. Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin have also followed suit, according to a Reuters tally. Many of the cases were among fully vaccinated individuals with mild symptoms, although the booster shot status of some patients was not reported. The Delta variant continues to account for 99.9% of new Covid cases in the United States, Walensky added. Hello everyone, and welcome to today’s coronavirus live blog. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from around the world. Let’s dive right in. The Omicron variant has been found in at least 15 US states so far, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday. “We know we have several dozen cases and we’re following them closely. And we are every day hearing about more and more probable cases so that number is likely to rise,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told ABC News in an interview, adding that the Delta variant remains the majority in cases nationwide. Omicron has been detected in the Northeast, the South, the Great Plains and the West Coast. Wisconsin, Missouri and Louisiana are among the latest states to confirm cases. Germany’s incoming new government is set to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for workers of hospitals, nursing homes and other medical staff by 16 March, according to draft legislation seen by Reuters. The Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats, which are set to form the new German government on Wednesday, are set to present the legislation to parliament in the coming week. Here is a snapshot of the key developments: Protests in Brussels, Belgium, against government restrictions to suppress Covid turned violent on Sunday, with police firing teargas and water cannon at demonstrators who threw cobblestones and fireworks. There has been a “concerning” jump to 183 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in Denmark, local health authorities said. Five senior health officers in Jordan were sentenced to three years in prison on Sunday, for causing the deaths of ten Covid patients in March following an oxygen outage. Russia recorded 32,602 infections and 1,206 deaths. Poland confirmed 22,389 cases and 45 deaths. Italy reported 15,021 new Covid cases and 43 deaths on Sunday, 16% up from 12,927 on the same day last week. The UK detected 43,992 positive Covid infections in the past 24 hours, up 21% from 36,507 cases on Sunday last week. A further 54 deaths were reported. France recorded 42,252 new Covid infections in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said, a percentage change of 188% from the 14,646 cases recorded on Sunday three weeks ago. Singapore detected 552 Covid infections and 13 deaths on Sunday, taking the seven-day average to 971 cases a day. The UK’s NHS will be in a “very, very difficult position” if the Omicron variant were to lead to a surge in hospital admissions in the UK, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has warned. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible, but has a less than 1% chance of re-infection and typically results in “milder” disease, a South African researcher as said. Covid is not over and the next pandemic could be more lethal, the creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert has said. The World Health Organization continues to reject travel bans against southern African countries, with Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeting it is “disappointing” and “dismaying” to see bans on flights."

          "headline": "UK Covid: Javid tells MPs there are 336 Omicron cases in multiple regions – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has told MPs that there are now 336 confirmed Omicron cases in the UK and that there is there is “community transmission across multiple regions of England”. (See 5.34pm and 5.35pm.) Theresa May, the former prime minister, has joined the ranks of Conservative MPs expressing concern about the prospect of further Covid restrictions being introduced. (See 6.01pm.) Downing Street has denied that a party took place in Downing Street last December and said it was a “statement of fact” that no Covid rules were broken. (See 2pm.) For further coronavirus coverage, do read our global live blog. The Javid statement is now over. The Independent’s John Rentoul argued on Twitter earlier that MPs were missing an obvious line of attack. Asked by Labour’s Angela Eagle how much more he would be able to tell MPs in the update next week about the threat posed by Omicron, Javid said there would still be “many unanswered questions” at that point. He said: As each day goes by we are getting a little bit more information, but I do think by next week with the samples that have arrived at Porton Down and other labs across the world we will have more information. I will just caveat that by saying I can’t make any guarantee about how much information that we will have. I am sure there will still be many unanswered questions at that point. Andrew Bridgen (Con) said that he was glad to hear that no Omicron cases are in hospital (see 6.13pm) and that he thought Theresa May was right to say virus variants become more transmissible but less harmful. He said he hoped this meant all restrictions would be lifted next week. Javid replied: “Let’s wait and see what next week brings.” Dominic Cummings, the PM’s former chief adviser, who is now one of his fiercest critics, says that No 10 is now lying about the December party last year. He also suggests the government is being complacent about Omicron. Kate Osamor (Lab) says the Nigerial high commissioner has described his country’s inclusion on the red list as “travel apartheid”. She says Delta seems to lead to more serious illness, but European countries with high numbers of Delta cases are not on the red list. She urges the government to adopt an international approach, not a “discriminatory approach”. Javid says southern Africa is the epicentre of Omicron. He says at least 21 Omicron cases in the UK are linked to Nigeria. (See 5.43pm.) Sir Desmond Swayne (Con) asks how many of the infected cases are ill. Javid say, of the the 336 cases, some may be asymptomatic, some are ill, but none are in hospital, as far as he knows. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, says the travel industry has been “devastated” by uncertainty and constantly changing Covid rules. He asks what criteria will be used by ministers to decide when the latest rules should be lifted. Javid says next week’s update will be an important moment. Mark Harper (Con) asks for an assurance that MPs will be recalled during the Christmas recess if the government needs to implement further measures during the holiday period. Javid says people would expect the government to take action over the recess if it has to. He says he will take back to colleagues the point Harper makes about parliament being recalled. In the Commons Theresa May, the former prime minister, said it would be a mistake for the government to respond to every new variant by closing down the economy. The early indications of Omicron are that it is more transmissible but potentially leads to less serious illness than other variants. I understand that would be the normal progress of a virus. Variants will continue to appear year after year. When is the government going to accept that learning to live with Covid, which we will all have to do, means we will almost certainly have an annual vaccine and that we cannot respond to new variants by stopping and starting sectors of our economy which leads to businesses going under and jobs being lost? Javid replied: In terms of the severity of this, I think we shouldn’t jump to any conclusion, we just don’t have enough data. It is not going away ... for many, many years and perhaps it will lead to annual vaccinations, but we have to find ways to continue with life as normal. In response to Streeting’s point about the No 10 party, Javid said the rules of course apply to everyone. Wes Streeting, the new shadow health secretary, is responding for Labour. He says, like his predecessor, Jonathan Ashworth, he wants to adopt a constructive approach. He says he is glad the government has implemented the pre-flight tests that Labour was calling for. He asks what is being done to tackle vaccine hesitancy. He says sick pay should be more generous for people who have to isolate. And he ends with a reference to the No 10 party last December. People need to have confidence in people setting the rules. He says two residents in Ilford (Streeting is MP for Ilford North) were punished for holding an indoor gathering against lockdown rules on 18 December last year. “And rightly so,” Streeting says. So will the government come clean about what happened, or is it one rule for them, and one rule for everyone else? Javid says new analysis suggests that the gap between being infected and being infectious may be shorted for Omicron than it is for the Delta variant. We are learning more about this new variant all the time. Recent analysis from the UK Health Security Agency suggests that the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron variant than for the Delta variant, but we don’t yet have a complete picture of whether Omicron causes more severe disease or indeed how it interacts with the vaccines. We can’t say for certain at this point whether Omicron has the potential to knock us off our road to recovery. We are leaving nothing to chance. Our strategy is to buy ourselves times and to strengthen our defences while our world-leading scientists assess this new variant and what it means for our fight against Covid-19. He is now summing up the measures announced over the weekend. He says Nigeria has been added to the red list. He says at least 21 of the Omicron cases in England are linked to Nigeria. And he says there are strong travel links between Nigeria and South Africa. Analysis from UKHSA [Health Security Agency] shows that at least 21 Omicron cases in England alone are linked to travel from Nigeria, and there’s a strong indication that Omicron is present there. Nigeria also has very strong travel links with South Africa. He says more hotel rooms are being set aside for arrivals how have to go through hotel quarantine. I know that there has been a spike in demand for these facilities due to the rapid expansion of the red list and that some people have experienced issues returning home. However, we are ramping up this capacity as quickly as possible. We’ve already brought several new hotels on board in the past few days and we expect to double the number of rooms that are available this week. And because the gap between infection and infectiousness may be shorter with Omicron, pre-flight testing is being introduced for arrivals. He says these measures will be kept under review and MPs will get an update next week. And he confirms that the vaccination programme is being beefed up. Javid says the new figures mean there is “community transmission across multiple regions of England”. The Omicron variant is continuing to spread here and around the world. According to the latest data there are now 261 confirmed cases in England, 71 in Scotland and four in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases across the UK to 336. This includes cases with no links to international travel. So, we can conclude that there is now community transmission across multiple regions of England. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, is making a Commons statement on Covid. He says there are now 261 confirmed Omicron cases in England, 71 in Scotland, and four in Wales. That makes 336 in the UK in total, he says. The UK has recorded 51,459 new coronavirus cases, the goverment has disclosed on its dashboard. The total number of new cases over the past seven days is up 9.1% on the previous seven days. But hospital admissions and deaths are still, only just, on a downward trend week on week, by 0.8% and 0.2% respectively. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, has confirmed that a review will be set up to investigate how child protection failures contributed to the death of six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. In a statement to MPs, he said the “whole nation is distraught” at the “tragic and horrific” death of Arthur. He went on: “We across this house and across this country find it impossible to imagine how any adult could commit such evil acts against a child.” Zahawi said that the national child safeguarding practice review panel was set up in 2017 to investigate cases like this and that Annie Hudson, its chair, will “work with leaders in Solihull to deliver a single, national, independent review of Arthur’s death to identify what we must learn from this terrible case”. He went on: I look forward to the review’s recommendations in due course, because in any complex system it is important - imperative in my view - to investigate thoroughly to learn and improve the system. My mantra continues to be that sunlight is the best possible disinfectant – because if we are to improve services where they need improving, we must share data and evidence ... As the court heard, Arthur’s tragic death is a result of the cruelty of his father and his father’s partner. No government anywhere in the world can legislate for evil. But we will take action wherever we can to stop this happening again, because we must do more, and to do more I would like to end my statement with a plea to everyone in our country. Zahawi also said that, because so many agencies were involved in Arthur’s case, he had asked Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue services and HM Inspectorate of Probation to carry out a joint targeted area inspection, looking at how they cooperate in the Solihull area. At the weekend the governmen briefed the punitive aspects of the 10-year drugs strategy. Boris Johnson gave an interview to the Sun on Sunday, which led to a story about how he was planning to unleash “an all-out war on drugs”, and it was announced that class A drug users could lose their passports or driving licences under the proposals. But the Department for Health and Social Care and the Home Office have now published a joint news release about the strategy and it implies that drug treament is getting more priority than the crackdown on drugs gangs, at least if spending is used as a yardstick. It says £300m is being spent on action against criminal gangs, but that £780m is being invested in drug treatment. These sums are part of a total spend of £3bn on drug enforcement and treatment over the next three years. The government says the money will fund various measures including better drug treatment generally, more offender drug treatment services, more housing support for those at risk of sleeping rough and employment support for people with a drug or alcohol addiction. It also says the role of healh and justice partnership coordinators will be extended. It explains: The role of dedicated health and justice partnership co-ordinators, who liaise between prisons, probation and treatment providers, will be expanded to cover every region in England and Wales. This will mean services in prison and the community are better joined up and offenders’ treatment plans remain consistent, helping them to stay on track and break the cycle of reoffending once and for all. A pilot will trial a new approach to how the courts deal with offenders with a history of drug abuse, where they will be seen regularly by the same judge, who has the power to order a number of sanctions and incentives, such as mandatory drug testing. Currently only offenders who agree to undergo treatment programmes can be subjected to regular testing. The announcement has been welcomed by Dame Carol Black, who led the independent review of drugs policy. (See 3.18pm.) In a statement quoted in the government’s news release, she said she was delighted by this “very significant investment in drug treatment and recovery services”. Reform UK has announced a defection to it ahead of the North Shropshire byelection on Thursday week. It says Mark Whittle, a town councillor in Market Drayton and a member of the local Conservative association’s executive, has joined the party. In a statement, Whittle suggests he is switching because the Tory byelection candidate, Neil Shastri-Hurst, is not sufficiently local. Reform UK, the new name for what was the Brexit party, has made very little impact since the 2019 general election. But the Tories cannot ignore it completely. It is trying to outflank the party on the libertarian right, and at the Old Bexley and Sidcup byelection last week it picked up 6.6% of the vote. The Welsh government has strongly criticised the UK government’s nationality and borders bill, claiming it will “exacerbate inequity and harm communities”. In a written statement, the social justice minister Jane Hutt and counsel general Mick Antoniw said: We believe many of the provisions in the bill will breach international conventions, violate basic principles of justice and will place ultimately extreme and insurmountable conditions on people who seek our protection. The pair said the bill proposes a new two-tier system to create “group one” and “group two” refugees. They said: Group two refugees may be prohibited from accessing public funds; prevented from being reunited with their family in the UK, and restricted to just 30 months refuge in the UK pending further reviews of their circumstances. This will cause unforeseen and unequal impacts on the people arriving ... It will exacerbate destitution and increase exploitation of migrants and illegal working in our communities – increasing vulnerability among an already vulnerable population. Dame Carol Black, who conducted a two-part review of drugs policy for the government that reported in the summer, told Radio 4’s World at One that the government’s drugs strategy should focus more on treatment than on law enforcement. Asked which approach would make the bigger difference, she replied: I’m going to say treatment and recovery because as long as there’s demand, you will have supply. Drug dealers are very, very good at just moving their operation, of doing different things, they’re good businessmen. So I think if you really want to get to grips with drugs and crime, you’ve got to be able to offer people high quality treatment and recovery. We know from research that that stops criminal activity. We know that if it’s high-quality treatment, people stay in it and do better. And we have at the moment a broken service ... I also want there to be, obviously, activity by the Home Office. Of course I want that. But we’ve been doing that for years. And we’ve been doing rather inadequate treatment and recovery now for many years, and in some places, extremely poor. At least they deserve 50-50. The number of Omicron cases detected in Scotland has more than doubled over the weekend to 71, with a new cluster reported in the Highlands town of Nairn, west of Inverness. NHS Highland said the “significant” outbreak had emerged after an event at a Royal British Legion hall in the town last week. It refused to say how many cases were involved but five new cases were reported for the Highland area on Monday, taking its total to eight. The latest provisional figures for Scotland showed the outbreak in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with many linked to a Steps concert at the Hydro venue in Glasgow, had affected 27 people by 5pm yesterday, up from the 11 identified by Friday evening. The figures for NHS Lanarkshire had also jumped, from nine identified by Friday evening to 22 by late on Sunday. The data identifies Omicron cases confirmed by genomic sequencing, as health authorities in Scotland race to identity and track new cases, using advanced contact tracing where fresh clusters emerge. So far, confirmed Omicron cases are largely restricted to these NHS areas, with single cases also detected in Ayrshire and Arran, Fife, Lothian and Tayside. Two have been found in Grampian, and eight found in Forth Valley over the last four days. John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, urged people to take a lateral flow test every day if they planned to leave the house, as new rules allowing negative tests to be used to enter venues came into force. Until now, the official advice in Scotland was to take a LFT twice a week, but Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland he used one every day he expected to leave home. He said: We want people to increase the frequency of the use of lateral flow tests, away from the two times per week to much more frequently when they are socialising and interacting with others. He said ministers in Edinburgh were considering adding proof of a booster jab to be added to the vaccination passports, which could be reinstated as necessary to enter large venues in future. Booster jabs will be added to vaccination passports for international travel from 9 December, he said. According to PA Media, Boris Johnson joined police in Liverpool for morning raids in the Kirkdale and Anfield areas of the city as part of an investigation into county lines dealing. Two people - a 34-year-old woman and a 27-year-old man - were arrested and taken to police stations in Merseyside for questioning following the execution of two warrants, police confirmed. And here is a full summary of the Downing Street lobby briefing. The PM’s spokesman confirmed a report by the Times’s Henry Zeffman at the weekend saying the levelling up white paper has been delayed until next year. It has been due before Christmas. Alain Tolhurst from Politics Homes says he thinks that the document is ready, but that the “pitch rolling” process is not yet complete. The spokesman played down claims that the government wants to give itself powers to easily overturn judicial review decisions by the courts. (See 11.58am.) Asked about the claim, made in the Times splash today, the spokesman said he was “not aware of any plans” to do this. He also said the report was “not an accurate characterisation of the action we are taking” - although the story is specifically about what Boris Johnson reportedly wants to do, because he apparently thinks the action that is being taken (in a bill going through parliament) leaves too much power with the courts. The spokesman denied that a party took place in Downing Street last December and said it was a “statement of fact” that no Covid rules were broken. (See 1.03pm.) The spokesman welcomed the high court ruling this morning rejecting a challenge to Johnson’s decision not to sack Priti Patel over bullying allegations. The spokesman said: The judgment affirms that appointment and dismissal of ministers is not judiciable and that questions of interpretation of the code, which are inextricably linked with that, may not be judiciable either. The judgment accepts that most of the code would not be judiciable. The spokesman said it was “unacceptable” for testing firms to exploit customers who need to pay for Covid tests. Asked about reports that firms have misleading consumers online about their prices, the spokesman said: It’s clearly unacceptable for any private testing company to take advantage of holidaymakers. He also said that, on average, a two-day PCR test costs less than £45. The spokesman defended what was being done to reconnect homes that lost power as a result of Storm Arwen. Energy companies were taking “every step possible”, he claimed. He said: It is worth remembering that 99.8% of households have power [restored]. As of 8am today, there were 1,600 homes currently without power in the north-east - that’s a reduction of 2,425 since yesterday. So there have been significant improvements but we recognise that for those homes still left without power, they will expect, rightly, more to be done. We continue to check in incredibly regularly with the power companies to make sure they have all the support needed, and we are assured they are taking every step possible. Obviously there are significant challenges following the storm, which was unusually strong and caused damage in particularly remote areas. The government is planning to block suppliers from winning public contracts if they have a record of poor delivery, fraud or corruption, PA Media reports. PA says: The Cabinet Office said the proposals were part of “wide ranging changes” taking advantage of “new powers” facilitated by Brexit. It said that under current rules, suppliers can only be excluded if there has been a “significant breach of contract”. But it said a set of “simpler, clearer and more flexible” rules, to be introduced now the country has left the EU, would give the government “more discretion” to block those that have under-performed. It would also be possible to ban suppliers which have undertaken unethical practices, such as a lax approach to safety, or where there are national security or environmental concerns, the Cabinet Office said. Meanwhile, the government is planning to introduce competition into emergency buying, meaning it “doesn’t need to wholly rely on direct awards in times of crisis”. New measures on transparency would also be implemented, with procurement data published in a “standard, open format” which would be “accessible to anyone”, the Cabinet Office said. It added that a “simplified bidding process” would make it easier for small and medium-size businesses to win Government contracts. And it said “more weight” would be given to bids with “social value”, to help level up the country. The plans are outlined in the government’s consultation response to its Transforming Public Procurement green paper. The Downing Street lobby briefing has finished. It lasted longer than usual, partly because of another fruitless quest for clarification as to what did or did not happen at No 10 last December when staff had a boozy get-together. Here are the key points on topic. The PM’s spokesman denied that a party took place in Downing Street last December. He said: As press secretary set out on a number of occasions when questioned about this originally, there was not a party and Covid rules have been followed at all times. This is a slightly firmer line than we have had before. Downing Street has not denied reports, that first appeared in the Daily Mirror, that an event that would meet any conventional definition of a party (a large number of people drinking booze in the same room, until late in the evening, with games too, just before a holiday) took place just before Christmas in No 10 last year. (There was also a separate one in November.) At PMQs last week Johnson did not deny that a Christmas party took place, and in subsequent interviews he has never said there was no party. Initially No 10 did not deny that there had been a party either, but at one briefing last week the PM’s press secretary (the party political spokesperson) said that what happened was not a party, and today the official spokesman (the civil service one) adopted that. The spokesman said it was a “statement of fact” that no Covid rules were broken. Asked how he could be sure that no regulations were broken at the December event, and what had been done to establish that, the spokesman said: I don’t need to get into the positions we’ve taken. It is simply just a statement of fact. Asked how it could be a statement of fact when this had not been investigate, the spokesman said he would not get into internal matters, but that guidance had been followed at all times. The spokesman said Downing Street will be having a staff party this Christmas. Other government departments have cut back or cancelled big gatherings. I will post more from the lobby briefing shortly. There are three ministerial statements and one urgent question in the Commons this afternoon. Here is the running order, with approximate timings. 3.30pm: Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, responds to an urgent question about Storm Arwen. After 4pm: Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, makes a statement about child safeguarding and the death of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. After 5pm: Sajid Javid, the health secretary, makes a statement about Covid. After 6pm: Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, makes a statement about the 10-year drugs strategy. Amanda Pritchard, the NHS England chief executive, had her booster jab this morning. Afterwards she issued a statement saying: The booster jab was quick, easy and I now have extra protection against the virus ... When it’s your turn, please come forward - the vaccine will give you and your loved ones the protection I have received today. These are from Danny Shaw, the former BBC home affairs correspondent, on the 10-year drugs strategy announced by the government today. This morning the Times has splashed on a story (paywall) by Tom Newton Dunn and Jonathan Ames saying that Boris Johnson favours radical legislation to curtail the use of judicial review. They report: The prime minister has ordered Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, to toughen plans to reform judges’ powers to rule on the legality of ministerial decisions. An option drawn up by Raab and Suella Braverman, the attorney-general, that is liked by No 10 is for MPs to pass an annual “interpretation bill” to strike out findings from judicial reviews with which the government does not agree. Whitehall sources argue that the bills would reinforce the constitutional principle that parliament is sovereign over the unelected judiciary. The move has provoked uproar within the legal establishment, and Johnson was accused of trying to use his Commons majority to halt legitimate challenges. One senior QC said that the prime minister was secretly seeking “a more compliant judiciary”. The government has already introduced a judicial review and courts bill, which is close to completing its passage through the Commons. This was intended to implement a manifesto pledge to reform the judicial review so that “it is not used well into its passsage”. But Johnson reportedly believes this bill, which was drawn up by Robert Buckland, who was sacked as justice secretary in September, does not go far enough. Labour says the report shows minsters want the power “to ignore the courts altogether”. In a joint statement Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, said: After a week when No 10 has behaved as though they are above the law when it comes to Covid regulations, we are now told they want to grant themselves the right to ignore the courts altogether. From the bedroom tax to the bombing of Yemen, the judicial review process exists so the public can challenge the government and other public bodies when it suspects they have broken the law. Incredibly, the government plans to subvert that process by taking on even more arbitrary powers, and in future change the law to comply with their decisions, rather than change their decisions to comply with the law. This is nothing to do with the sovereignty of parliament, but all about the Henry VIII fantasies of a prime minister who thinks none of the rules the rest of us have to live by should ever be applied to him. The mention of Henry VIII refers to so-called Henry VIII powers, clauses in bills allowing ministers to use secondary legislation (easy to pass, and subject to little scrutiny) to rewrite primary legislation (bills that only become law after extensive votes and debates in parliament). Speaking to reporters this morning as he received his booster jab (see 9.47am and 11.11am), Keir Starmer blamed government cuts for contributing to the drug problem that ministers are trying to address with their strategy announced today. Asked about the plan, he said: We need to look at the plans in detail when we see them in detail. But there’s no doubt that the drug problem has got a lot worse in the last 10 years, particularly issues like drug-related deaths and the county lines, which are destroying lives. The question for the government is not just over the plans today but the money that they have taken out of the system – millions and millions of pounds have been taken out of the system over the years and that has caused a lot of the problems. So I want to see the plans, I want to see the strategy, I want the prime minister to take responsibility for the money that’s been taken out of criminal justice in the last 10 years that’s caused many of these problems. However, as Boris Johnson made it clear in his own clip for broadcasters this morning (see 10.52am), taking responsibility for all government cuts since 2010 is one thing he is definitely not prepared to do. His argument is that the government only took power in 2019. Keir Starmer has urged the government to do more to cut the price of the Covid tests that people arriving in the UK need to pay for. In an interview this morning, he welcomed the government’s decision to make pre-departure tests (PCR or lateral flow) compulsory, as Labour had been calling for. He said: I would have liked to see the government act more quickly. As ever, they are behind the curve. As soon as we saw the scientific evidence saying that (there) should be pre-departure tests, we called on the government to do this last week. The government delayed, as they always do. They’ve done it now, that’s a good thing. But the government needs to get ahead instead of being behind. On the costs of tests, Starmer said: I also want to see the government doing whatever it can to bring the price of these tests down because lots of people ... [are] getting really hammered by prices that can’t be justified. Boris Johnson has successfully fought off a high court challenge over his decision to back the home secretary after accusations she had bullied civil servants, my colleague Rajeev Syal reports. Tristan Kirk, the Evening Standards’ court correspondent, has posted an interesting thread on Twitter on the lockdown breaches from last winter that are being prosecuted in London. And here are the main points Boris Johnson made in his morning TV interview about the 10-year drugs plan Johnson claimed that his was the first government for a long time to take class A drugs use seriously. Asked about new evidence of cocaine use at the Houses of Parliament, Johnson said: This government is absolutely determined to fight drugs. I take the view that it’s a long time really since you’ve heard a government say that drugs, class A drugs, are bad, bad for society, bad for opportunity, bad kids growing up in this country. That’s my view. That sounded like a dig at Johnson’s old rival, David Cameron, whose campaign for the Tory leadership in 2005 was undermined by claims - which he did not deny - that he had used cocaine before becoming an MP. Johnson has admitted taking cocaine himself when he was a student, but he implied it happened just once, and his student use of cannabis seems to have been limited too. Recreational drug use is one vice that he has never seriously been accused of. Johnson would not accept responsibility for cuts to police and drugs programmes since 2010. When it was put to him that Labour was saying that police and drug treatment programmes had been cut by the government over many years, he claimed that was not right. He went on: Since this government came in, we’ve not only put 11,000 more police on the streets, as part of our commitment to put another 20,000 more, but we’re announcing another £300m to tackle county lines gangs. This answer was interesting because it illustrates Johnson’s unwillingness to defend the record of the Cameron and May governments. At the next election Labour will be attacking what has happened under the Tories since 2010, but Johnson will be adopting a ‘Year zero’ approach, arguing the clock only started in 2019. To be fair, he never served in Cameron’s government, and was out of parliament for most of the time it was in office, but he was foreign secretary in May’s government for two years. He said the strategy being announced today combined tougher action against county lines drugs gangs with more emphasis on rehabilitation. He said: We want everybody to be able to grow up in safer streets, everybody to have the right to have a safe community to grow up in and too many people have their lives blighted by these county lines gangs, so you’ve got to do two things at once. You’ve got to be tougher on the county lines gangs, you’ve got to be tougher on the criminals who are doing it, but you’ve also got to make sure that you find those 300,000 people and you help them. You can’t simply arrest them time after time and put them back into prison again and again - you’ve got to do rehab as well. Yesterday Prof Mark Woolhouse, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), told The Andrew Marr Show that the government’s announcement of pre-departure testing for people arriving in the UK had come too late. “I think that may be a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted,” he said. This morning Boris Johnson, in an interview on a visit with police in Merseyside, primarily to promote the 10-year drugs strategy, was asked about specifically about this comment. Johnson said he did not accept it. He went on: I think what we’re doing is responding to the pandemic. We were the first country in the world to take decisive measures to tackle Omicron. We put about 10 countries automatically, immediately, on to the red list and we said that anybody coming from any country in the world would have to quarantine for a couple of days. We’re now going further and toughening those measures up as we see the spread of Omicron around the world. I don’t think we need to change the overall guidance and advice we’re giving about Omicron in this country. We’re still waiting to see exactly how dangerous it is, what sort of effect it has in terms of deaths and hospitalisations. Asked whether he was certain there would be no new social restrictions before Christmas, Johnson said, as he has said before, that “this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas, with the possibly exception for the country lines drug gangs that we intend to roll up”. Keir Starmer had his booster jab this morning, Sky News reports. Good morning. Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, was on the airwaves for the government today, primarily to talk about the government’s new 10-year drugs strategy. But he also became the latest minister to face the interview challenge from hell - defending Downing Street’s threadbare and incoherent line on the No 10 Christmas parties last year that appeared to break lockdown rules. On BBC News Malthouse said that he was not sure whether there was a party. But that did not stop him saying, if it did happen, it did not break the rules. On Sky News Malthouse said he took the reassurance he had had from Downing Street “at face value” (an unusual formula - he could have just said he believed them). And then, on the Today programme, Malthouse said that factors like social distancing, and the size of the room, might have been factors in whether or not the party was legal - even though these were not exemptions allowed in the guidance. Malthouse also said that it was right for the police to investigate allegations about offences committed in the past - at the end of last week the Met said it did not routinely “retrospectively” investigate breaches of Covid rules - but he said it was for the police to decide what they did in this case. The Met is under pressure to investigate. The Green MP Caroline Lucas suggests Malhouse’s failure to offer a proper defence of Downing Street strengthens the case for an investigation. The SNP MP John Nicolson has also described Malthouse’s Today interview as “excruciating”. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: The high court gives its ruling in a case brought by the FDA, the senior civil servants’ union, challenging Boris Johnson’s decision to ignore the ruling that Priti Patel, the home secretary, broke the ministerial code by bullying civil servants. 11.30am: Downing Street holds its lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, takes questions in the Commons. He is also due to make a statement on an inquiry into the Arthur Labinjo-Hughes case. 3pm: Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, gives evidence to the Commons Scottish affairs committee. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"

          "bodyText": "More than 300 branches of the convenience store chain Spar in the north of England have been hit by a cyberattack, forcing many of them to close. The attack hit the company’s computer systems, causing a “total IT outage” that has prevented staff from taking card payments and locked them out of emails. Some branches of the chain, one of the few places to buy groceries in many remote communities, are accepting cash but the rest have been forced to close entirely. The IT outage first hit on Sunday and technicians worked through the night to try to fix the problems. According to the Twitter account of one Spar branch on Monday afternoon, there was “no time set to be back online”. “We apologise for the inconvenience this is causing our customers and we are working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation,” an official Twitter account for Spar in the north of England told shoppers. “It is currently impacting stores’ ability to process card payments meaning that a number of SPAR stores are currently closed to shoppers or only taking cash payments.” Distribution partner James Hall &amp; Company, which provides food to nearly 600 Spar sites across the north of England, has also been hit, and its website is down. Earlier this year, Tesco was hit by hackers, leaving thousands of frustrated shoppers unable to buy groceries online at Britain’s biggest supermarket. The attack took Tesco’s online systems out for two days, leaving shoppers unable to book deliveries or amend existing orders. Tesco receives 1.3m online orders every week. The National Cyber Security Centre, which monitors computer-based threats to the public and private sector, said it was aware of the attack."

          "bodyText": "After months of sadness and uncertainty, there is pure enchantment to be found in the year’s best children’s books. For picture-book lovers, Scissorella: The Paper Princess by Clare Helen Welsh, illustrated by Laura Barrett (Andersen), is an extra-special story full of delicate filigree art. Mill worker Lotte, scorned by her siblings, cuts elegant puppets out of paper, trusting hard work over happy endings – until she’s invited to a ball, and meets a prince who loves puppets too. In the luminous fairytale Frindleswylde by Natalia O’Hara, illustrated by Lauren O’Hara (Walker), a capricious winter spirit steals the light from Grandma’s lamp, and Cora must go to his icy kingdom to retrieve it – but will Frindleswylde freeze her heart first? Filled with pastel sweetness and frosty aquamarine light, this has a flavour of Hans Christian Andersen. There is rousing inspiration for all ages in Change Sings: A Children’s Anthem by Amanda Gorman, illustrated by Loren Long (Puffin), as a girl urges her community to action via small kindnesses and courageous words (“I can hear change humming / In its loudest, proudest song …”). Lyrical text from the presidential inaugural poet marries thrillingly with Long’s rich paintings. For five-plus, Once Upon a Tune: Stories from the Orchestra by James Mayhew (Otter-Barry) contains six absorbing tales, each the source of wonderful music, all brought to life by Mayhew’s compelling storytelling and exquisitely textured pictures. This gorgeous introduction to works such as Peer Gynt and Scheherazade explores musical context, and provides links to recommended recordings. Fact fans of seven-plus will adore Listified!: Britannica’s 300 Lists That Will Blow Your Mind by Andrew Pettie, illustrated by Andrés Lozano (Britannica), a treasury featuring the fastest dinosaurs, the cleverest dog breeds and the sneakiest spy gadgets (including a microphone disguised as an olive). Funny and thought-provoking, with pages full of enticingly blocky illustrations. In Every Leaf a Hallelujah by Ben Okri, illustrated by Diana Ejaita (Head of Zeus) and also for seven-plus readers, Mangoshi’s mother is ill, but there’s a flower in the forest that can save her – if Mangoshi can only find it … This meditative environmental fairytale conveys a sense of humanity’s deep reliance on the natural world. For eight-plus readers, Utterly Dark and the Face of the Deep by Philip Reeve (David Fickling) is a superbly weird tale of wonder, peril, tragedy and the thin places between worlds. Washed up on shore as a baby, Utterly Dark is adopted by the Watcher of Wildsea, who keeps a lookout for the strange, threatening forces of the sea. But when Utterly’s guardian is drowned, who will keep watch – and keep the island safe? There are more seaborne thrills for eight-to-12 years in The False Rose by Jakob Wegelius (translated by Peter Graves, Pushkin), as the gorilla hero of The Murderer’s Ape returns in a sequel as intricately illustrated and adventurous as her first appearance. Finding a rose-shaped necklace hidden aboard their beloved steamer, Sally Jones and The Chief are swept off on a voyage from Lisbon to Glasgow and even further afield, falling foul of a terrifying gang and a smuggler determined to own the mysterious pendant. Meanwhile, the acclaimed author of the Seeing Stone trilogy returns to the bloody, fertile ground of Arthurian legend in Arthur: The Always King by Kevin Crossley-Holland, illustrated by Chris Riddell (Walker). This spectacular collection of stories for 10-plus moves enthrallingly from Arthur’s boyhood to the trials of his kingship, betrayal and death; Riddell’s intoxicating illustrations, full of golden light, glinting mail and memorable gore, elevate it to the sublime. For 14-plus, Medusa by Jessie Burton, illustrated by Olivia Lomenech Gill (Bloomsbury), is utterly transporting. Violated and cursed, Medusa lives on a remote island with only her sisters, her dog and the snakes of her hair for company. When a handsome boy arrives on the shore, Medusa refuses to show her face – but as they exchange stories from either side of a great rock, friendship slowly flowers between them. How will Perseus react, though, to Medusa’s entire truth? This dynamic feminist retelling is illustrated with stunning, polychromatic power. Twenty years after Noughts and Crosses’s first publication, Malorie Blackman brings her unforgettable YA series to a tragic, triumphant close in Endgame (Penguin). In a world where black Crosses control most wealth and power, Britain’s first Nought prime minister is about to go on trial for the murder of gang lord Dan Jeavons. Sephy Hadley was also present when Jeavons was killed; now she’s under suspicion too, and her children are threatened. How will the weave of plotting and corruption unravel – and who will emerge unscathed? Finally, When Shadows Fall by Sita Brahmachari, illustrated by Natalie Sirett (Stripes), follows Kai, Orla and Zak, who love the wild green patch in the centre of the concrete sprawl they live in: it’s their den, their garden, their refuge. But when Kai suffers a great loss, he no longer wants his friends’ company – or to safeguard their secret place. A moving, hard-hitting journey for teens through grief and acceptance, interwoven with powerful illustration and viscerally vivid verse. • Browse all the featured books and save up to 15% at guardianbookshop.com.

          "headline": "Bob Dole: soldier, politician and Republican of the old school ",
          "bodyText": "In the Apennine mountains in 1945, Bob Dole was hit by fire from a German machine gun. Through sheer force of will, endless hours of strengthening, an experimental drug and the extraordinary kindness of a doctor who performed seven operations for free, Dole was able to rebuild his life. His right arm had limited motion. His left suffered numbness. It was painful to write. A signed note from Dole is a treasure. Beating the governor of Kansas to win a Senate seat in 1968, he rose to Republican leader. When Gerald Ford selected him as his running mate in 1976, his initial impression on Americans was a bit sharp: “Democrat wars” was the most famous line from his debate with Walter Mondale. But he recovered and spoke of “hard choices”, basically code for reducing the federal deficit. He called himself the “heartland candidate” and that was true. His speech accepting the nomination for president in 1996 was roundly criticised for its line about “a bridge to the past”. In response, Bill Clinton proposed a “bridge to the future”. But Dole had a point. That glance to history was essential: “Whenever we forget its singular presence, it gives us a lesson in grace and awe.” Few were quite sure where Clinton’s bridge was going – or when it might be completed. Dole offered a moral vision. “What is more important, wealth or honor? Only right conduct distinguishes a great nation from one that cannot rise above itself … All things flow from doing what is right.” This was sincerity, not sentiment. Rare indeed the politician who could say with integrity, “I do not need the presidency to make or refresh my soul. For greatness lies not in what office you hold, but on how honest you are in how you face adversity and in your willingness to stand fast in hard places.” His was an older Republicanism, one that said: “If there’s anyone who has mistakenly attached themselves to our party in the belief that we are not open to citizens of every race and religion, then let me remind you, tonight this hall belongs to the party of Lincoln. And the exits which are clearly marked are for you to walk out of as I stand this ground without compromise.” Ever the party loyalist, he called himself a “Trumper” but also “sort of Trumped out” – and he flatly rejected the lie of electoral fraud in 2020. His voice calls out in today’s deep troubles: “Is the principle of unity, so hard-fought and at the cost of so many lives, having been contested again and again in our history, and at such a terrible price, to be casually abandoned to the urge to divide?” In their debate, Clinton said, “I like Bob Dole. You can probably tell that.” Dole asked viewers to check his website, a first for presidential candidates. His wry humor and distance from hoopla struck a chord with some Gen X voters. Running against peace and prosperity is hard. Ross Perot’s second bid did not help. Yet Dole pressed on, loyal to the party and the ticket he led. Then he moved on. Losing “hasn’t been all bad”, he said. He did a commercial for Viagra – but only after he could vouch for it following prostate cancer. Addressing stigma was his life’s work. If speaking up could help, why not risk the jokes? He could happily discuss deficiency payments for farmers for hours – that’s what senators do – and to him that sort of thing mattered more than personal revelations. Referring to himself in the third person was mocked, but one knew where he stood. When he was introspective, one had the sense the past, of good people making a living on the unforgiving prairie, was never far away. There was an earthy honesty too often missing in politics today but popular when it appears: “Facts are better than dreams and good presidents and good candidates don’t run from the truth.” The charge of being an intellectual lightweight was unfair. Dole just didn’t agree with some of the new Republican intellectuals. The man whose father ran a creamery knew budgets had to be balanced, a lesson learned on the prairie, where “a man is very small, and if he thinks otherwise, he is wrong”. The Americans with Disabilities Act was his proudest accomplishment. Strongly committed to civil rights, he worked with former rival George McGovern to develop an international school lunch program and received the World Food Prize. A lion of the Senate, his cross-party friendship with Daniel Inouye, also grievously wounded in the second world war, is a telling reminder of what Washington once was. Dole may remind British readers somewhat of Denis Healey. As the Guardian wrote in its obituary of Healey, “it is rarely enough in politics to say: ‘I’m here if you want me.’ Always wanting to ‘do something rather than be something’, Healey was too busy to be a faction-fighter or plotter.” For Dole, “honorable compromise is no sin. It is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance”. It was said Dole wanted to be president in case decisions needed to be made – a reminder of another Kansan, Dwight Eisenhower. After all, he might have reasoned, the big issues were decided – democracy, decency, honour, economic opportunity, civil rights, a strong defense, support for allies – but the small decisions mattered too. Why not Bob Dole to make them honestly? The substance of those decisions would generally have been wise and, as with Eisenhower, likely bolder than expected. A Dole presidency would have reset the country for the new millennium: less talk, more action, less fluff, more substance. He carried a pen in his disabled right hand. As in 1945, he was always ready for work. John S Gardner is a writer. He was special assistant to George HW Bush and deputy assistant to George W Bush"

          "headline": "Congressman Jamie Raskin: ‘I’ll never forget the terrible sound of them trying to barrel into the chamber’",
          "bodyText": "He spent 5 January at a graveside service for his son, Tommy, who had taken his own life after years shadowed by depression. He spent 6 January under siege at the US Capitol as a mob of Donald Trump supporters staged a deadly insurrection. Nearly a year on, Jamie Raskin wonders whether he could have prevented either tragedy. “Just as I have blamed myself for missing cues that I might have picked up with Tommy, I blame myself for cues I missed relating to the violence as well,” says Raskin, carefully measuring each word. “I spent many, many sleepless nights in self-blame and self-prosecution over everything that had happened with Tommy and with the insurrection.” Raskin, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, took office in January 2017. Four years later, and a day after burying his 25-year-old son, he was at the US Capitol under coronavirus restrictions to help certify Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election. He witnessed the citadel of American democracy come under attack from a frenzied mob convinced by Trump’s “big lie” about vote rigging. “I heard this terrible sound that I’ll never forget of some people trying to barrel into the House chamber,” the 58-year-old recalls in a phone interview from his home in Takoma Park, Maryland. “I don’t know to this day exactly what kind of physical objects they were carrying, but they kept slamming up against the central door to the House of Representatives and so lots of people began to move over there to try to reinforce it. “But then Capitol police officers came running in with their guns drawn, telling all of us to get back, and they went up and guarded that door. There were people screaming and it was very chaotic. You could hear people yelling, ‘We want Trump!’ and ‘Hang Mike Pence!’” – a reference to the vice-president who ignored Trump’s pleas to overturn the election. Members of Congress were evacuated through the speaker’s lobby, tunnels and stairwells. “We would see members of the mob running by in different directions. It was like a zombie movie. Whenever we saw them, everybody would accelerate efforts to get away. An insurrection is a pretty intimate thing. These people were all over the place. It’s remarkable more people did not die.” Finally, they reached the safety of a committee room in a House office building. But Raskin’s daughter Tabitha, 23, and son-in-law, Hank, who had accompanied him to the Capitol that day, were trapped in the office of Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader. They barricaded themselves in with furniture and hid under Hoyer’s desk. “I was obviously very concerned,” says Raskin. “I was an emotional wreck anyway but I felt now intensely responsible for having brought them with me and put them in harm’s way. It had never occurred to me that the Capitol of the United States would not be secure.” Eventually the building was cleared by security forces and the family was reunited. “I hugged them and kissed them and I told Tabitha how sorry I was and I said it would not be like this the next time she came to the Capitol. That’s when she said, ‘I don’t want to come back to the Capitol again’. The immensity of these events just hit me at that point. They had fundamentally changed everything by unleashing this violence to support their political coup.” That night Congress returned to the building to complete the electoral college counts and confirm Biden as the next president. In a stunned nation, there were demands for Trump to face a reckoning over his role in inciting the riot. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, asked Raskin to become lead prosecutor. He says: “For me the trial was a kind of salvation because I was so deeply in shock and trauma about Tommy and what had just taken place in the Capitol. It was a time of great confusion. “If you remember back to 9/11 and what that was like, everyone walking around buffeted and dumbfounded, there was that feeling. But by becoming the lead impeachment manager, I quickly had to develop a focus on what needed to be done.” Previously a constitutional law professor, Raskin made a compelling case and was not afraid to display his anger, grief and vulnerability. A majority of senators voted to convict Trump but fell 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority required by the constitution. The ex-president was acquitted. But Raskin was not done. He is now a member of the House of Representatives select committee investigating the events of that day. It has been gathering documents and phone records and subpoenaing witnesses in an effort to produce the definitive account of an event that Raskin says was “as close to fascism as any of us wants to come in our lifetime”. The congressman, who has written a book to try to make sense of the 50 days that upended his life, says: “I would like to say that 6 January was the end of something but it feels much more to me like the beginning of something. “Ultimately, that’s up to us. We are definitely in a struggle over the future of democracy. Joe Biden is the right president to try to lead us out of this period of emotional devastation but at this point Donald Trump’s ‘big lie’ lives and his control over the Republican party is absolute. So we are still very much in the fight of our lives.” Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth, and the Trials of American Democracy by Jamie Raskin will be published by HarperCollins on 4 January"

          "bodyText": "I have a chastening photographic memento of my first trip to Provence, aged 21. I’m slouching against a wall in a back alley in Cannes, dressed in a striped matelot’s shirt, and holding a 16mm Bolex cine camera – the very picture of a nouvelle vague director. It isn’t clear what the camera is pointed at. I’d hired it to film flamingos on the Camargue saltmarshes, but got carried away by the Riviera’s glamorous ambience and took it to the beach, where I promptly dropped it in the sea. It felt like a parable about the insidious impact of tourism in the Mediterranean, a postscript to the process that had led to the naming of Nice’s seafront the Promenade des Anglais. Several decades later, my partner, Polly, and I fancied trying another kind of Provençal promenade. We were both seriously in thrall to the south of France and wanted to challenge our ageing bodies to 10 days’ sauntering in the remote heart of the region, far from the coastal hustle, among the limestone hills and lavender. We wouldn’t book anywhere to stay in advance, we’d carry everything we needed on our backs, and we’d aim for an inland area that looked encouragingly wild and barely populated. We set out from Nice at the very end of May, and wiggled our way west by train and bus to the melancholy village of Salernes, which we made our base for the next few days. In its one restaurant that evening, the owner explained that it was a deprived settlement, where most of the men worked in the local quarries. We walked from there to Villecroze, where there are troglodyte caves. We saw hoopoes and basked in the scent of Spanish broom. But the countryside was changing dramatically. There were building works everywhere: farms being converted, scrubland enclosed behind high walls. When I looked at an aerial photograph later, the most conspicuous feature was a dazzling blue pixellation of new swimming pools. The bourgeoisie were digging in and putting up their high-security gateways. And it wasn’t easy to get off the roads. The French have mixed views about land access and aren’t particularly interested in rambling. Beyond the Grandes Randonnées system, the concept of a public footpath is a debatable one. We happened to set out at a time when Provence (always politically bolshie) was having one of its periodic wrangles with the EU. We felt we were wandering into a familiar southern thicket, where there is respect for the commune, but not the European community, or anything smacking of meddling officialdom. France’s Blue series of Topographical Maps sits on the fence in this ancient ideological stand-off, so aren’t much help to a would-be rambler. They paint a perfectly accurate portrait of the countryside – as it might be seen from a satellite. Paths aren’t differentiated from hedges, nor public ways from private. So we blundered about for days, losing our way repeatedly as waymarks mysteriously ended and paths split, unremarked by the map, into three. It didn’t really matter. The sun shone and nightingales sang. At Sillans-la-Cascade, Polly had a dip in the pool below the waterfall and we heard the fluting of golden orioles. Then we glimpsed one, a female, coloured the same milky green as the limestone river. That afternoon we tramped back to Salernes across country. Stumbling out of a wood after fording a stream, we bumped into the only other walkers we met in 10 days. It turned out we’d strayed into the grounds of a retirement estate called Paradis. They were not much older than us, but called us “courageux”! We walked south to the tiny village of Montfort-sur-Argens, and fetched up at Le Chat Luthier, a B&amp;B run by Fabrice and Pierre. Their dining room is in a converted cave, fitted with a wall-to-wall aquarium, and there they served us a local supper which climaxed in a dessert of tomato ice and wild thyme sorbet. Fabrice told us of their difficulties in laying out balades (the lovely word for a leisurely stroll) round the village, as part of a green tourism initiative called La Provence Verte. There is no legal status for footpaths in France, and local landowners are suspicious of even informal designation, worried about walkers suing if they fall over on the rocky paths. The next day we tried following a walk from Fabrice’s map, but it petered out at a chain-link fence. We ignored it and found ourselves in a landscape of poignant, feral beauty, the flipside of the gentrification we’d seen earlier. Farming was retreating from this stretch of Provence, olive-growing losing to cheap fruit from China and North Africa, and the ancient terraces were being invaded by glorious aromatic tides of broom and cistus and rosemary. There were more singing nightingales and orioles, and swooping rollers – like crows but in gaudy shades of blue. These, for better or worse, will be the new cash crops of La Provence Verte. The walk east to Carcès wasn’t long, but across high ground in searing heat with full packs, was our hardest stretch. We scrumped cherries and peaches from yet more derelict orchards, and had to ask for water at the edge of the village. Carcès was an energising spot to hang out. Multitudes of swifts screamed around our room, bats poured out of the roofs when we explored the town that evening, and we learned the reason so many houses had bottles of water outside: in something close to sympathetic magic, they were meant to deter dogs from peeing against the doors. We cheated at this point and hired a car to drive the 30km to the Massif de Maures, a wild and remote mountain range inland from Saint-Tropez. The north of the forest is Provence’s badlands, an arid savannah of umbrella pines on pink granite bluffs. We explored it along a dried-up riverbed, through drifts of iris and wild tulip, with eagles and turquoise-and-ginger bee-eaters cruising above us. Further south, the forest was denser, a mix of cork oak and chestnut, and the paths were strafed by enormous, two-tailed pasha butterflies. We found managed chestnut orchards among the wild trees, where the trees had grafts from especially productive varieties. Chestnuts and chestnut flour – a common staple this far south – are one of the region’s chief exports. We spent our last two nights in the cosmopolitan town of Collobrières, in the middle of the Maures forest. It had the feel of a frontier town, with the market’s herb sellers barking in Occitan (which always sounds to me like French spoken by a Brummie) and chic Parisian second-homers and north Africans alike wandering the streets in gorgeous Provençal costume. At the tourist centre, we learned of another row brewing with Brussels, over control of the forest, which, the locals protested, they had looked after successfully for centuries and were extrêmement attached to. We felt they had a point, though the image of those advancing weekenders’ villas wouldn’t go away. We bought a bag of chestnut flour to take home and wished them well. We had walked through a Provence that is trying, like so many other places, to reconcile many new meanings for the countryside.

          "headline": "Scottish islanders launch Airbnb rival in fight against second homes crisis",
          "bodyText": "Rhoda Meek knows the power of Scottish islands working together. During the first lockdown she created a website for more than 360 businesses from Arran to Ulva to sell their wares while the pandemic prevented visitors. Now she and her neighbours have launched a holiday lettings website that aims to take on Airbnb and ensure that more of the islands’ tourism revenue stays local. “I was increasingly aware of the challenge posed by lack of affordable housing for islanders and the proliferation of short-term lets, and the difficult balance between the need for tourism and the damage that can be done,” explains Meek. IsleHoliday.com aims to ensure that more of the revenue generated by tourism in the islands stays local, with profits from the commission-based structure to be reinvested in small businesses, community and housing projects. On the east of Tiree, an island in the Inner Hebrides where Meek lives, she estimates that 40% of the houses sit empty during the winter: “It’s just not sustainable for keeping communities in fire fighters and care staff. We have to start somewhere.” But she is likewise a pragmatist: “It will take time to change that situation and involve action at a local and national government level. But, in the meantime, the letting market exists. “People have sunk money into houses then can’t afford to let them on a long-term basis. And with short-term lets now the money is leaving the islands, and often leaving the UK. Our goal is to use the current market to generate revenue which can be used to the benefit of our communities, particularly in relation to affordable housing and long-term rental options for residents.” Meek admits she was nervous about floating the idea, given how controversial the subject has become, but says that so far the idea has “struck a chord” with islanders. She has also sought input from housing groups across the islands, and from younger residents, “to make sure we’re not working at cross purposes”. On South Uist last month, for example, a house was for sale to islanders or first-time buyers only following a spike in second-home ownership as remote working during the pandemic made the islands an option for city-dwellers who were able to pay more. Yvonne Murray, originally from Lewis but now working in Worcestershire, is keen to sign up after buying a small cottage on Harris earlier this year. “I could see the property prices on the islands going up and up after lockdown, and as a first-time buyer, I didn’t want to miss the boat,” she explains. “As a young person, I want to live and work in the islands but until the internet connectivity is good enough it’s just not possible”. She currently uses Airbnb to rent out both her new property and her father’s house on Lewis – he moves out to a caravan behind the garage in peak summer season to supplement his pension. The new platform will be “totally invaluable”, Murray believes. “The commission is going back into the community and I’m behind any young upstart company challenging the big boys.” Last year, analysis by the Guardian showed that Airbnb has become so prevalent in Great Britain that some parts of the country now have one listing for every four properties, fuelling concern that the rapid expansion in short-term lets is out of control and depriving local residents of much-needed homes. Identifying hotspots in both rural areas and inner-city neighbourhoods, across England, Scotland and Wales, the analysis found the highest incidence of Airbnbs was in Edinburgh Old Town, where there were 29 active listings for every 100 properties, while the north-west of Skye had the second-highest concentration, at 25 listings per 100 properties. At the time, Airbnb responded that the findings are based on “unreliable scraped data and flawed methodology”. Responding to what many in the Highlands and islands frame as a crisis, last month the Scottish government set out legislation requiring all local authorities to establish a short-term lets licensing scheme by October 2022, after residents across Scotland raised significant concerns about the impact of short-term lets, including noise, antisocial behaviour and the impact on the supply on housing. And in July the Holyrood government pledged £43m to build affordable homes on the Western Isles amid fears of population decline. Whilst isleHoliday is a direct response to this, Meek also hopes that – by encouraging islander hosts – the new platform will shift the dynamic between locals and tourists. This aspiration comes after a series of flashpoints in recent years: thoughtless camper van traffic blocking and littering narrow rural roads, an influx of visitors who were not always mindful of local Covid concerns following lockdowns, and most recently furious islanders complaining about tourists taking up space on already over-stretched ferry services. “This allows us to start a dialogue with people coming to the islands, to send them information about passing places, phone signal, local charities before the arrive,” says Meek. It should make people think slightly differently about visiting: yes these are gorgeous places but they are also living, breathing communities.”"

          "bodyText": "Kazuo Ishiguro Author of Klara and the Sun (Faber) The beautiful, horrible world of Mariana Enriquez, as glimpsed in The Dangers of Smoking in Bed (Granta), with its disturbed adolescents, ghosts, decaying ghouls, the sad and angry homeless of modern Argentina, is the most exciting discovery I’ve made in fiction for some time. Horrifying in another way, Jonathan Calvert and George Arbuthnott’s Failures of State (Mudlark) is a brilliantly presented indictment of the UK’s fumbling attempt to meet the Covid challenge. Read alongside Jeremy Farrar’s more personal Spike: The Virus v The People (Profile) and Michael Lewis’s compelling The Premonition (Allen Lane), we see a disturbing common trait emerging in our country and others: the unwillingness to prioritise people’s lives over ideas and ingrained structures. Bernardine Evaristo Author of Manifesto: On Never Giving Up (Hamish Hamilton) I have been deeply impressed by recent books that invite us to reconsider aspects of British and global history, culture and identity beyond the often distorted, dishonest and pumped-up myth-making that has long prevailed. History is an interpretation of the past and these three books, each one powerfully persuasive and offering new ways of seeing, are in conversation with each other. Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain (Penguin) by Sathnam Sanghera, The New Age of Empire: How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World (Allen Lane) by Kehinde Andrews and Green Unpleasant Land: Creative Responses to Rural England’s Colonial Connections (Peepal Tree Press) by Corinne Fowler. Damon Galgut Author of The Promise (Chatto &amp; Windus) I seldom read books when they first appear, but there were two slim volumes that especially impressed me this year. Burntcoat (Faber) by Sarah Hall is in the vanguard of a new genre of pandemic/lockdown fiction: the connections between isolation and creation are laid bare in a disquieting dystopia of the not-quite-now. Small Things Like These (Faber) by Claire Keegan, on the other hand, casts its gaze backward, to Ireland in 1985; its balance of crystalline language and moral seriousness makes it profoundly moving. Wole Soyinka Author of Chronicles From the Land of the Happiest People on Earth (Bloomsbury) I sometimes suspect that I was actually found abandoned in a tree, adopted and raised as a family secret. Amos Tutuola, Gabriel García Márquez, DO Fagunwa, Shahrnush Parsipur and other exponents of tree anthropomorphism are perhaps the outsiders in the know. Now they are joined by Elif Shafak in The Island of Missing Trees (Viking) with her integrative literary sensibility, and the genre sprang back on its feet, tender and savage by turns in a Greco-Turkish-Cypriot historic setting. The rigorous questioning of nation and identity, given my incessant preoccupations, made it a truly therapeutic literary meal. Colm Tóibín Author of The Magician (Viking) I enjoyed Hugo Hamilton’s The Pages (Fourth Estate), narrated with verve and ingenuity by an actual book, a novel by Joseph Roth, which got saved from the Nazi bonfire and then taken on a picaresque journey across the Atlantic and back to Germany. I also enjoyed the social historian Patrick Joyce’s Going to My Father’s House (Verso), a haunting meditation on Ireland and England, war and migration, Derry and Manchester. I admired the originality of his observations and his tone of melancholy, calm wisdom. I love John McAuliffe’s Selected Poems (Gallery) for the way that ordinary things are rendered and rhythm handled so deftly and artfully. Rachel Kushner Author of The Hard Crowd: Essays 2000–2020 (Jonathan Cape) My generation is very much marked by Dennis Cooper’s George Miles cycle: in the 1990s, everyone read these books; I was awed by them. For many years, Dennis took a break from novels to focus on theatre and film. He’s back with I Wished (Soho Press), which is classic Dennis Cooper: intricate, funny, destabilising and totally unforeseen. Wolfgang Hilbig is apparently one of the most acclaimed German writers, but was new to me. I’ll confess I fell for the blurb on the back of The Interim (Two Lines Press): the great László Krasznahorkai calls him “an artist of immense stature”. As soon as I started reading, I had to agree. This novel, translated by Isabel Fargo Cole, is comic and terrifying and profound. Elif Shafak Author of The Island of Missing Trees (Viking) This year, reading Anita Sethi’s I Belong Here (Bloomsbury) was an unforgettable journey. Sethi wrote this book after being the victim of a horrible racist attack on a train from Liverpool to Newcastle. The genius of the author is how she takes the narrative of hatred and discrimination hurled at her and turns it upside down by “going back to where she is from” – the landscapes of the north. Through long walks in nature as she finds a true sense of belonging, connectivity, renewal and hope, so do we, her readers. I found it not only deeply moving but also quietly transformative. Another read that stayed with me this year has been Kerri ní Dochartaigh’s fabulous Thin Places (Canongate). Born in Derry, at the height of the Troubles, the author’s voice is piercingly honest, movingly heartfelt. There is so much soul and knowledge and compassion, it gave me shivers. Sarah Hall Author of Burntcoat (Faber) Sea State (Fourth Estate) by Tabitha Lasley completely took me by surprise. Part memoir, part investigation into oil-rig culture, part critique of gender and class dynamics, it’s incredibly compelling, often dark as the drilled-for product. Lasley infiltrates this masculine offshore industry, with its dangers, profit and comradeship. She also explores female loneliness and desire, accommodation of a male-designed world and the spaces where women hold power. Reissued this year with impassioned praise from fellow authors such as Marlon James, Patricia Lockwood and Max Porter, Mrs Caliban (Faber) by Rachel Ingalls is a work of true verve and imagination. Along with her suburban housewife and lab-tested reptilian lover, Ingalls deftly, wittily and rather incredibly liberates readers from the awfulness of convention to a state where weirdness and otherness are beautiful and right. Meg Mason Author of Sorrow and Bliss (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) After the joy of discovering that one of your favourite authors has a new book out can follow a peculiar kind of anxiety, because what if you don’t like it as much as the others? I needn’t have worried with Rachel Cusk’s Second Place (Faber). It is stunning, in all senses. Assembly (Hamish Hamilton) by Natasha Brown left me winded for how clever and sad and beautiful and spare it was. Truly the perfect novel. And I adored Ann Patchett’s new essay collection, These Precious Days (Bloomsbury), which I read in November and will end the year by listening to her read, as audio. Because it’s Ann Patchett, one time through isn’t enough. Caleb Azumah Nelson Author of Open Water (Viking) This year, I loved Transcendent Kingdom (Viking) by Yaa Gyasi, the story of a family of four who travel from Ghana to Alabama to make a new life for themselves. Through the course of the novel, the family’s history begins to unfold, illuminating stories that have gone unspoken for generations. It’s a brilliant novel, with not a word out of place. I also really enjoyed Vanessa Onwuemezi’s Dark Neighbourhood (Fitzcarraldo), a collection of short stories from an unforgettable, searing voice. They occupy a hallucinatory landscape, often veering into the surreal, and each pulses with an electric energy. Lauren Groff Author of Matrix (Heinemann) I have been in headlong love with Patricia Lockwood’s hilarious and subversive mind since her memoir Priestdaddy, but her first novel, No One Is Talking About This (Bloomsbury), sent me reeling. Everything about this book, from its structure to its prose to the way it hits a reader unawares in the second half, is testament to Lockwood’s wicked genius. Everyone Knows Your Mother Is a Witch (Fourth Estate) by Rivka Galchen flew a bit under the radar, but it is a wise meditation on the kind of hysterical scapegoating we see so often in the age of the internet, though based on a historical fact: that the mother of astronomer Johannes Kepler was once accused of witchcraft. I loved this book intensely when I read it this summer and have thought of it nearly every day through this strange autumn. I’ve been thinking deeply about anagogical literature recently and very few living writers write so achingly toward God as Kaveh Akbar. Real faith, Akbar writes in Pilgrim Bell (Chatto &amp; Windus), “passes first through the body/ like an arrow”; each of the poems in this collection finds its target. Chibundu Onuzo Author of Sankofa (Virago) My favourite nonfiction book published in 2021 was Otegha Uwagba’s We Need to Talk About Money (Fourth Estate). It’s a memoir that shows how money has affected every stage of Uwagba’s life, from growing up on a council estate, to winning a scholarship to a private school, to negotiating her salary when she entered the workforce. Uwagba is particularly nuanced about class and race. My favourite novel published in 2021 was Our Lady of the Nile (Daunt) by Scholastique Mukasonga. It’s set in the 1980s, in a Rwandan girls boarding school. It follows all the girlish intrigues, of who is the most popular, who is the prettiest, but this is no Malory Towers. Looming in the background is the coming genocide. Both playful and sinister, this is an excellent read. Olivia Laing Author of Everybody: A Book About Freedom (Picador) Anyone with a mother ought to read My Phantoms by Gwendoline Riley (Granta), a novelist of uncompromising brilliance. It mines the same narrow, dangerous territory as Beryl Bainbridge and Ivy Compton-Burnett: the dysfunctional family unit. Riley homes in on the failing relationship between a mother and daughter, anatomised by way of astonishingly precise dialogue, alongside angular, razor-sharp sentences that delineate an entire emotional landscape. Ouch and wow. There’s a similar marvel of ventriloquism in Adam Mars-Jones’s Batlava Lake (Fitzcarraldo), a story about war and soldiers delivered by the hopeless, weirdly endearing Barry, which builds to a blindsiding final paragraph. Sunjeev Sahota Author of China Room (Harvill Secker) Barbara Ehrenreich is an incisive diagnostician of societies and in Had I Known: Collected Essays (Granta) she is clear-eyed on the ways in which the American working class has been politically abandoned and culturally demonised. Much of the analysis applies to our own country. On the novel front, I could not recommend more strongly Gwendoline Riley’s My Phantoms (Granta): flinty, bracing, exquisite. Anthony Doerr Author of Cloud Cuckoo Land (Fourth Estate) In The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity (Allen Lane), David Graeber and David Wengrow offer an engrossing series of insights into how “the conventional narrative of human history is not only wrong, but quite needlessly dull”. They re-inject humanity into our distant forebears, suggesting that our prevailing story about human history – that not much innovation occurred in human societies until the invention of agriculture – is utterly wrong. I could have lived in the first hundred pages of Piranesi (Bloomsbury) by Susanna Clarke for ever. It’s a dream of a novel. Zorrie (Riverrun; published early next year) by Laird Hunt is a tender, glowing novel that is just as beautiful as Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead or Denis Johnson’s Train Dreams. Ferdinand Mount Author of Kiss Myself Goodbye: The Many Lives of Aunt Munca (Bloomsbury) These days, I seem to read mostly female novelists from the colder parts of North America. You can’t get much farther north than the Ontario of Mary Lawson’s icy, compelling stories of calamity and redemption. A Town Called Solace (Chatto) keeps you breathless with anxiety, then relief and finally even joy. I felt the same total engagement with Gill Hornby’s Miss Austen (Arrow). She reconstructs in beautifully simple detail the story of Jane Austen’s sister, Cassandra, and her struggle to protect Jane in life and death. It is also an unforgettable account of an unremembered life. Kehinde Andrews Author of The New Age of Empire (Allen Lane) David Harewood’s documentary Psychosis and Me was an eye-opener for his honesty in reflecting on his experiences in the mental health system. His book Maybe I Don’t Belong Here (Bluebird) is one of the most powerful testimonies to the impact of racism I have ever read. In a similar vein, Guilaine Kinouani’s Living While Black (Ebury) highlighted the severe problem of racism in the psychological professions that has hallmarked so much of our experiences in the UK, an unfortunate experience we have in common with our American cousins. I had been looking forward to learning more about one of the most important US civil rights activists Fannie Lou Hamer and Keisha Blain’s Until I Am Free (Beacon) did not disappoint. Ruth Ozeki Author of The Book of Form and Emptiness (Canongate) Double Blind (Harvill Secker) by Edward St Aubyn is about nature, science, rapacious capitalism, psychoanalysis and human folly, and it is both moving and so funny I had to stop every few pages to wipe tears from my eyes. Nobody’s Normal (WW Norton) by Roy Richard Grinker is a compassionate, well-researched chronicle of the historical stigmatisation of mental illness. Since “normal” is a social construct, why can’t we change it? I love how Katie Kitamura can channel a mind and in Intimacies (Vintage) it is the mind of an unnamed interpreter living in The Hague, interpreting for a former president on trial for war crimes. Monique Roffey Author of The Mermaid of Black Conch (Vintage) Still Life (Fourth Estate) by Sarah Winman gets my vote, not just for its mastery and sweep (Tuscany, the East End of London, war and beyond war, old gay ladies, young men) and the overarching theme of the power of love, but for its talking parrot as character, Claude. Claude gets some of the best lines. Also, Fortune (Peepal Tree Press), by Amanda Smyth, another historic novel, a clandestine love story set amid Trinidad’s early oil drilling years in the 1920s. I also loved English Pastoral: An Inheritance (Penguin) by James Rebanks, out in paperback this year. His family have farmed the same land for 600 years. We’ve lost so much, but Rebanks gives us solutions and myth-busts; a poignant and sad book we need in a time of climate emergency. Elizabeth Day Author of Magpie (Fourth Estate) My two favourite novels of the year were Sorrow and Bliss (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) by Meg Mason, for being hilarious, moving and utterly humane, and Damon Galgut’s The Promise (Chatto). The label “masterpiece” is far too liberally applied these days, but I did think Galgut’s book was deserving of it. In nonfiction, I enjoyed We Need to Talk About Money (Fourth Estate) by Otegha Uwagba, which challenged me to rethink my relationship with my finances and did so in a witty, intelligent and surprisingly touching way. John Boyne Author of The Echo Chamber (Doubleday) Kevin Power’s long-awaited second novel, White City (Scribner), was a triumph. There’s not enough humour in contemporary fiction but Power brought the laughs and the pathos to this account of a young Dubliner, reared with privilege, who gets involved in a dodgy land deal in the Balkans. In nonfiction, I was impressed by Helen Joyce’s Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality (Oneworld), a scholarly, compassionate and courageous examination of a subject that’s sparked an unhelpful civil war within the LGBTQ community. Unlike those of her online counterparts, Joyce’s arguments are well researched, soundly made and avoid the toxicity that mars so much conversation on this topic. Courttia Newland Author of A River Called Time (Canongate) Keeping the House (And Other Stories) by Tice Cin is a truly beautiful debut. A mistress of deftly sketched characters that become whole humans in a few lines, Cin tells stories of working-class, inner-city life steeped in truth, emotion and vulnerability. She is one of a new generation of writers who see the splendour of these streets and articulate it with great majesty. Jo Hamya’s Three Rooms (Vintage) is written in a classical style that’s no less incisive for its formality. From the first paragraph, I was hooked. Tension drips through every scene and Hamya depicts London so well. There’s quiet, raw power in this book and its author. Cathy Rentzenbrink Author of Everyone Is Still Alive (Phoenix) I like a novel to grab me and The Book of Form and Emptiness (Canongate) by Ruth Ozeki gave me very peculiar dreams for a long time, as though it did not want to release me to other things. I enjoyed the robust style of Empireland (Penguin) by Sathnam Sanghera, an illuminating examination of the “toxic cocktail of nostalgia and amnesia” that still hugely influences our life today. Erudite and reassuring, Four Thousand Weeks (Vintage) by Oliver Burkeman persuaded me to accept that my time on Earth is finite so I should therefore not fritter it away in overwork and overwhelm. SA Cosby Author of Razorblade Tears (Headline) Her Name Is Knight (Thomas &amp; Mercer) by Yasmin Angoe is a dazzling, suspenseful tale of international intrigue and revenge with a protagonist who is as deadly as she is beautiful. A feared assassin, Nena Knight soon finds her latest mission to be her most dangerous as it puts her life and her heart at risk. Arsenic and Adobo by Mia Manansala is a quirky, cosy mystery full of humour and heart with a clever heroine who is as talented in the kitchen as she is at a murder scene. A fantastic debut. The Heathens (Little, Brown) by Ace Atkins is pure, uncut, US southern noir with a modern social media twist. Few writers know the tortured soul of the south better than Atkins and he is at the top of his game here. Fintan O’Toole Author of We Don’t Know Ourselves: A Personal History of Ireland Since 1958 (Head of Zeus) Sally Rooney’s Beautiful World, Where Are You (Faber) has really stayed with me. For all its wit and style, it has a deep seriousness about the world. Rooney has an old-fashioned belief that the novel can be a place in which the question of how we should live is continually at play. Damon Galgut’s The Promise (Chatto) sustains the same moral purpose while being funny, angry and absurd all at once. Paul Muldoon had a remarkable year. His conversations with Paul McCartney for The Lyrics (Allen Lane) spark endlessly fascinating reflections on the relationship between life and creativity. And his new collection, Howdie-Skelp (Faber), is dazzling, moving, profound and playful. Jackie Kay Author of Bessie Smith (Faber) I loved Neil Bartlett’s Address Book (Inkandescent). It took me back to all the addresses I’ve lived in - the lesbian squat in Vauxhall, John le Carré’s house in Hampstead! Brilliantly written, interweaving seven different characters across various times, Bartlett’s precise storytelling pulled me in. I’m glad we have him. He is a pioneering chronicler of queer lives. Ian Duhig’s New and Selected Poems (Picador) is a must have, must read gathering of the best of his work. Always fascinating, Duhig is poetry’s best chronicler of both ordinary lives, strange lives. His eclectic and effervescent work draws on folklore and myth to tell the stories we never get to hear. Duhig is interested in everything. He makes his reader sit up and take stock. I was inspired by the beauty and the power of the fabulous collective 4 Brown Girls Who Write – their poetry reminds me of the strength and exhilaration of a collective voice. Beautifully produced by Rough Trade Books, each of the four poets produces a standalone pamphlet that comes to form part of an incredible whole. The perfect stocking pressie. I was touched by Michelle Zauner’s cathartic memoir about losing her mother, Crying in H Mart (Picador). Zauner writes about food, music, grief and love candidly, bravely. Chris Power Author of A Lonely Man (Faber) Two novels that stunned me this year involve characters overwhelmed by the force of another’s personality. The narrator of Gwendoline Riley’s My Phantoms (Granta) reckons with her parents, one dead, one ailing, who emerge as both spiteful and pitiable. Riley is an immensely talented writer whose sentences cut like knives and she doesn’t flinch when blade meets bone. Similarly dauntless, in Second Place (Faber), Rachel Cusk abandons the distinctive style of her Outline trilogy for a new voice. When M invites L, a painter she admires, to her remote coastal home, psychic combat ensues. It’s a profound book and a funny one, which hasn’t been mentioned enough. Megan Nolan Author of Acts of Desperation (Jonathan Cape) After the past few years, when even the most ignorant among us took to slinging around virology terms as though we knew what we were talking about, I’ve found myself drawn to accounts and oral histories of the Aids crisis. Let the Record Show (Farrar) by Sarah Schulman is profoundly moving, as most are, but also does the important work of reasserting the place of women and people of colour in the history of Act Up. Paul (Granta) by Daisy Lafarge is a mesmerising novel about a young woman’s trip to France and ensuing entanglement with a man whose grotesque secrets begin to surface. It moves at a pace it feels Lafarge invented herself. It’s enviably, coolly intelligent without ever becoming ironic or snide and just one more exposition of Lafarge’s many gifts following on from her poetry collection Life Without Air. Joshua Ferris Author of A Calling for Charlie Barnes (Viking) Three great pleasures for me this year came from reliable sources. Jo Ann Beard’s essays in Festival Days (Little, Brown) are some of her finest. Dana Spiotta’s novel Wayward (Virago) is razor-sharp on any number of things, above all the insoluble ravages of time. Then there were three writers new to me whose books were both reinvigorating and enlightening: Angélique Lalonde’s Glorious Frazzled Beings (Astoria), Miriam Toews’s Fight Night (Bloomsbury) and Casey Plett’s A Dream of a Woman (Arsenal Pulp Press). Lisa Taddeo Author of Animal (Bloomsbury) Magpie (Fourth Estate) by Elizabeth Day is that rare novel that moves and taunts like a thriller, but also envelops and comforts like Middlemarch. I didn’t want it to end, I wanted to read it in fancy bars for ever. As for The Right to Sex (Bloomsbury) by Amia Srinivasan, I cannot say enough about this book. How crucial. How brilliant. How absolutely gratifying to see a mind at work like Srinivisan’s, handling the profane and the erudite with equal clear, unflinching diamond prose. Sathnam Sanghera Author of Empireland (Viking) My novel of the year would be A Calling for Charlie Barnes (Viking) by Joshua Ferris, a hilarious skewering of the American Dream by the man who must be the funniest writer we have. I also really appreciated The Anarchy (Bloomsbury) by William Dalrymple, out in paperback this year, which does a great job explaining the East India Company, responsible, more than anything else, for Britain’s involvement in the subcontinent. And Imperial Nostalgia (Manchester University Press) by Peter Mitchell, which explains how the delusions of the Raj continue to shape our national psychology today. Joan Bakewell Author of The Tick of Two Clocks: A Tale of Moving On (Virago) The sensitivity of Susie Boyt’s story of family love, Loved and Missed (Little, Brown), wrings the heart: it shows tenderness to each, makes you care for all… a gentle masterpiece. The Promise (Chatto) by Damon Galgut is a remarkable tale of four generations of one South African family and of the country itself. Like his earlier books, which I have also enjoyed, it reveals him as a master of human complexity. No wonder it won the Booker. Mothering Sunday (Scribner) by Graham Swift was not published this year, I know, but was picked up by me at the secondhand stall of Didcot Parkway station. It’s now released as a film. Reading it, I discovered a total gem: not a word out of place, not a false sentiment. Can the film be as good?

          "headline": "PM repeats that Australians have ‘had a gutful of governments in their lives’ – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Here’s the main stories on Sunday, 5 December: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, again says he thinks Australians have had a “gutful of governments in their lives”, repeating the phrase he used last month when commenting about anti-lockdown protests in Victoria; The former Gardening Australia host Peter Cundall has died, aged 94; Omicron cases climb in NSW, but Victorian premier Daniel Andrews say he does not expect his government, or that of his NSW counterpart Dominic Perrottet, will tighten restrictions despite the new variant; Australian children aged five to 11 are set to receive the Pfizer Covid vaccine from mid-January after the TGA grants provisional approval; and Victoria records 980 cases, seven deaths; NSW records 286 locally acquired Covid-19 cases, one death; the ACT records six new cases; with no new cases in Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia (South Australia and Tasmania figures had not been updated). More reactions to the passing of Peter Cundall: Peter Cundall’s family have issued the following statement about his death: On Sun 5th of December 2021, Peter Cundall passed away peacefully after a short illness, surrounded by his family. Peter’s privacy, and the privacy of his family, is to be respected during this very sad time. Peter’s family does not wish to be contacted. While he was loved by many, as per Peter’s wishes, there will be a private cremation and no memorial services will be held. An obituary is to follow. Former ABC managing director Mark Scott has just posted this about the news of Peter Cundall’s passing: The ABC is reporting that Peter Cundall, the much-loved former host of Gardening Australia, died earlier today. Morrison was asked about doing two media events today, and whether the election campaign is already underway (he was on the track at the Bathurst 1000 earlier). He said he visited central NSW to see the flood damage and thank those who had volunteered, but noted: Someone else is campaigning and politicking back in the inner city, and we’re here out in central western New South Wales, listening carefully to the impact of these floods on their properties and on their futures. And it was great to be at Bathurst today, it wasn’t the first time I’ve been to Bathurst, it was great to be back at Bathurst, it was great to see everyone there, because that’s what we’ve been working towards. That’s what the premier and I particularly have been working towards. We’ve been working towards Australians getting their lives back. What we’re about is getting governments out of your lives, because I think Australians have had a gutful of governments in their lives in the past few years, and they’re looking forward to getting back in the driver’s seat, and I want to put Australians back in the driver’s seat. The “gutful” comments echo similar remarks Morrison made last month. Morrison on the Labor party’s $1.2bn proposal to fund skills training shortages in Tafes and universities: We already are putting that investment in, and you’ve got to remember it was Labor who ripped out $1.2bn out of school’s apprenticeships when they were in government, and they took 100,000 ... 100,000 apprenticeships out of work and out of the system, that’s their record. Labor is going to say a lot of things between now and the next election, they said they weren’t going to have a carbon tax last time, and they ended up putting one in. They saw electricity prices double on their watch, whereas under our government, electricity prices have been falling by over 3% on average every year over the last three years since I was elected at the last election. So you’ll hear a lot from Labor, there’ll be a lot of noise, but the only way you really understand what a Labor government will do is what they did last time they were in government. Morrison wraps it up fairly quickly. Standby and I’ll unpack all that a little more in a tic. Morrison also repeats his desire for “governments to get out of people’s lives”. Morrison is asked about the Labor party’s announcement today about an investment in skills training. He segues into talking about how Labor will make promises they may not keep, like the carbon tax. He also is asked whether it’s the start of the election campaign, given he has done two events today, and mentions someone else politicking in the “inner city”. Morrison is taking questions. He says partnerships with state governments will be very important when it comes to vaccinating 5-to 11-year-olds, given many of those children will attend schools. It is a tacit suggestion (as the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said earlier) that school-based vaccination programs could be how the rollout for this age group occurs. Perrottet says the “constructive relationship” between the state and federal government over the past couple of years demonstrates they will also be able to work together to overcome the flood damage. He went to his first Bathurst today (with Morrison), and says he was thrilled that the high vaccination rate had allowed the event to happen. Morrison says the rural economy has to fire, so he hopes locals can recover quickly. He says: They have to get back on the front foot to grow the food and fibre...that the central west is famous for. He says 2021 is in the rear-vision mirror, and his government is like the “drivers at Bathurst” looking through the front windscreen to a future after the pandemic. Morrison is talking about his two previous visits to the central west, which were because of the drought and bushfires, and now it’s floods. He and Perrottet are joined by the local member and former Nationals leader Michael McCormack. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, are speaking to the media in Forbes, where they have visited flood damaged areas. I’m finishing up for today, so I will once again hand over the blog to Nino Bucci! The Bureau of Meteorology says there will be no flight interruptions caused by the eruption of a volcano in Indonesia. The eruption of Mt Semeru, which has killed at least 13 people, could have also caused havoc with the aviation industry. But meteorologist Sarah Scully said that unless it erupted again, it was not expected volcanic ash would cause any flights to be suspended. She said: Luckily the areas had fairly widespread showers and a tropical thunderstorm, which has washed the atmosphere of volcanic ash. Unless there’s another eruption, and we’ll be keeping a close eye on it ... the danger has passed. The Age’s state political reporter, Sumeyya Ilanbey, is reporting that the Victorian Liberal party state conference has passed a motion calling for the party to adopt a program to train, retain and mentor women. This comes after state conference voted down a motion opposing any kind of gender or other diversity quotas. Clover Moore has released a video celebrating her all but certain reelection to a fifth term as Lord Mayor of Sydney. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd has weighed in on Sky News host Peta Credlin’s apology to the South Sudanese community over incorrect reports she made last year. Police investigating a fatal stabbing outside a Perth nightclub have charged two men over a second attack which happened shortly before, AAP reports. Homicide squad detectives say they have charged a 23-year-old Aveley man with inflicting grievous bodily harm in relation to a stabbing at Northbridge on November 27. A 20-year-old Marangaroo man will also face court accused of being an accessory after the fact to the offence. The pair were expected to appear on Sunday in Perth Magistrates Court. Police say the incident is linked to another stabbing that occurred a few minutes later in which a 28-year-old man died. An 18-year-old has been charged over that attack, which happened during a brawl near the Republic nightclub. The victim was treated at the scene but died in hospital, while a man in his 20s was also treated for non-fatal stab wounds. Police said at the time those involved in the fighting were members of the local African community who were known to each other. As the major parties move into campaign mode, Amy Remeikis broke down which electorates may decide the next election. Read the full article here: Labor has ruled out governing with the Greens should neither major party receive a clear majority at the next election, AAP reports: Opposition leader Anthony Albanese believes his party’s climate change policy is a practical example of how Labor can bring Australians together after next year’s election. In what was described as Labor’s unofficial campaign launch, Albanese delivered a speech to the party faithful in Sydney on Sunday under the banner “A better future”. “We can put the climate wars behind us,” he promised. Just hours earlier, deputy Labor leader Richard Marles ruled out doing a deal with the Greens to form government should the upcoming election fail to produce a clear majority for either of the big parties. Prime minister Scott Morrison dragged up the possibility of a Labor-Greens coalition after the opposition released its long-awaited climate change policy last week... “This is Scott Morrison lying again,” Marles told the Sky News Sunday Agenda program. “We are seeking government in our own right. We are not going to enter into a coalition with the Greens. We have been making that clear from day one.” A sweet story from New South Wales: locals gathered this afternoon at Kings Cross in Sydney today at a rally to save the Metro-Minerva theatre. But, as some attendees pointed out, in true Kings Cross fashion it was less like a rally and more like a show. Clover Moore told the Guardian that climate action would be a big focus for her fifth term in office, with the goal of hitting net zero emissions in Sydney city by 2035. She said that more work would also be done to make Sydney more bike-friendly. “The pop-up Covid bike lanes were about connecting up the bike networks that we have been building since 2008, and we are now working to make those permanent,” she said. “In this term we also want to link up the network in the City of Sydney with surrounding suburbs”, Moore said, adding that she would like to see a regional bike network too. Asked whether this would be her last term as mayor, Moore laughed, explaining that “I am always asked that question at election, and I always say I will think about that at the time”. Hello everyone, it’s Justine here back on the blog. Thanks again to the brilliant Nino Bucci for bringing us all the news over the last few hours. As we reported earlier, Clover Moore looks set to secure an unprecedented fifth term as lord mayor of the City of Sydney. Moore told the Guardian this afternoon that she is “very excited about the result and grateful for the support we have had from the community”. While Moore had secured around 43% of the vote as of Saturday night, this is down from 58% in the 2016 election. But Moore said she “doesn’t accept” that there was a significant swing against her. There was an increased field of candidates ... and so far it shows I have received around 44% of the vote, and my two closest rivals have 16%. Moore also noted that the iVote remote votes have not yet been counted, and “a lot of our supporters did an iVote”. She said she thought the outcome so far is a “resounding success” given the difficulties surrounding this election, including the fact that it was postponed twice due to Covid-19 and that the iVote platform was down for a number of hours on voting day. And here’s Justine Landis-Hanley back to take care of you for a bit. Happy Sunday! AAP report that Queensland authorities are warning of flash flooding in already inundated parts of the state, with storms and hail predicted. Heavy rainfall, hail and strong winds are forecast for Sunday in southern parts of the state that have already been flooded, QFES commissioner Greg Leach told reporters on Sunday. Any of that rainfall coming down today could result in flash flooding events. Authorities have conducted seven swift water rescues, including saving a stranded motorist in Cecil Plains, while the State Emergency Service has responded to 27 calls for help in the last 24 hours. The Macintyre River reached 10.43 metres at Goondiwindi in the state’s south-west on Saturday before starting to recede overnight, and was at about 10.27 metres Sunday morning. It’s the biggest flood in a decade for the town, but has not reached the 2011 flood peak of 10.64 metres. Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Andy Barnes said the Macintyre River would remain above the major flood level throughout Sunday and Monday. Emergency services are now turning their attention to the towns of Cecil Plains, Surat, Condamine and Talwood, with the Goondiwindi mayor warning some properties downstream of the town could be cut off for a month. Mayor Lawrence Springborg said residents downstream of Goondiwindi towards Mungindi, will likely be isolated for a month. Resilience is being cut off by floodwaters for two weeks or more than a month, and these people survive that. Our friends over at AAP report that the ACT has confirmed a second case of the Omicron variant, a close contact of the previous reported individual. ACT Health reported six new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, bringing its total active caseload to 110. Of these, six are in hospital, two of which are in intensive care. ACT Health said: ACT Health can confirm that, based on whole genome sequencing in ACT residents, there are now two cases of the Omicron variant. The second Omicron case is a close contact of the previously reported individual. The Bureau of Meteorology plan to provide an update later this afternoon on the eruption of Mount Semeru in Indonesia, and the possible impact on flights. We will bring you news about that as it comes in. You can read more about the eruption in East Java here: In the interests of being NEUTRAL (check the spelling on the flyer), I should also point out that the Guardian has published the odd typo in our 200 years. Melbourne Demons fans, who missed their side break a 57-year AFL premiership drought in September when the grand final was relocated to Perth because of the Delta outbreak in Victoria, have flocked to the MCG to watch a replay of the game and see the cup. Greens leader Adam Bandt has returned a negative Covid test, after a staff member tested positive earlier this week. The Greens said in a statement: Aside from the staff member who has tested positive, the test results that have been returned for staff members who were in Canberra last week are also negative. NSW Health have just sent out the daily Covid bulletin. It confirms earlier news about 286 new cases of Covid-19, with 15 of those linked to the Omicron variant. Results on “further likely cases” are due later today. A man in his 60s from south-eastern Sydney has died, taking the NSW toll to 632. The man was fully vaccinated and had underlying health conditions. There are currently 148 Covid cases admitted to hospital, with 26 people in intensive care, five of whom require ventilation. The vaccination rate has climbed to 92.8% of people aged 16 and over, with 77.2% of those aged 12 to 15 fully vaccinated. Omicron variant outbreaks have been linked to Regents Park Christian School, Sydney Indoor Climbing Gym Villawood, and St Peter Chanel Catholic Primary School in Regents Park. All travellers arriving in NSW who have been in South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini and Malawi during the 14-day period before their arrival in NSW must enter hotel quarantine for 14 days, irrespective of their vaccination status. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has finished speaking in Melbourne. Anthony Albanese has invited voters to draw a comparison with Scott Morrison in a speech ticking off some of his lowest moments as prime minister, including the statements “I don’t hold a hose” and “it’s not a race”. Albanese said: I also want to share with you the kind of prime minister I will be. To serve as prime minister of Australia is a rare privilege – but it is also a great responsibility. And that’s what I am determined to restore to our politics – a sense of responsibility, decency, and integrity. Of course, I can’t stand here today and promise you that I’ll get everything right. But I can promise you if I get something wrong – I’ll own up to it. I may not always be the smoothest talker – but I can promise you I’ll always tell it straight. I won’t run and hide from responsibility. I won’t go missing when the going gets tough. I think leadership is about facing up to problems and looking for solutions. Actually, I don’t think. I know. Andrews is being asked a few questions about his appearance on a somewhat obscure podcast. He says of the Victorian federal MPs (who he did not name) he criticised in the podcast because of how they responded to the pandemic that “some people are from Victoria but not for Victoria”. Anthony Albanese, speaking at a Labor rally, has argued the Morrison government has “nothing left to offer but scare campaigns” as it enters its “second decade”. Albanese has accused Morrison of choosing to “divide, to play politics, to pit Australians against each other” including “state against state”. Albanese on leadership: In tough times, every one of us has to hold a hose. On Morrison’s relationship with the truth, Albanese said: [He is] a prime minister who has no regard for what he said yesterday – so you should have no regard to what he says today. “The notion that we try and keep this out forever...that just doesn’t make sense,” Andrews says. He says he sympathises with Victorians who have family in South Australia and will no longer be able to see them for Christmas because of the Omicron restrictions. Andrews says on the tighter restrictions other states have brought in to tackle Omicron that he is not critical of these measures, but that Victoria will not take any steps to keep the variant out of the state. He said he was texting his NSW counterpart Dominic Perrottet yesterday and the pair agreed they would not be pursuing “Omicron zero”, given the high vaccination rates in the states, and the fact the variant appeared to be less serious. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, describes the TGA approval of Pfizer for children as an important next step. He says the state would be ready to roll the vaccines out in schools, if it aligned with the federal government’s approach. Anthony Albanese is addressing his first rally of the unofficial election campaign. The warm-up act was deputy leader, Richard Marles, who focused on two main attacks against the Coalition government: its long eight years in office; and Scott Morrison’s credibility. Marles used the words “lie” or “liar” dozens of times, criticising Morrison for “lying” about going to Hawaii, how he became prime minister, to world leaders (Emmanuel Macron) and “lying about lying”. Marles had a particular focus on the fact Morrison switched codes from rugby union to rugby league, and claimed he only picked up a Sharks scarf when he ran for Liberal preselection. Marles argued it was “dangerous” because a prime minister who is willing to “lie about who he is” will mislead Australians. The funding will allow 84,000 students to attend camps. “We’re really going to target those kids who were most impacted by the pandemic,” Merlino says. Victorian education minister James Merlino is pretty psyched. He says the package means 2022 will be the best school year ever. I still remember my year six camp. Andrews is up in Victoria. He is speaking about a $113m funding package for school camps. And $700,000 for swimming lessons. Which is fine I guess but perhaps a little anticlimactic? Sky News host Peta Credlin has issued a lengthy apology to Victoria’s South Sudanese community over comments she made linking them to a Covid-19 outbreak. Credlin apologised for claiming South Sudanese community members had spread infections last year during Ramadan dinners (the vast majority of South Sudanese are Christian) and that they did not speak English (Credlin clarifies during the apology that 84% of the community speak English at a very high level). She also said during the four-minute apology that the broadcaster was planning on working with the community on positive stories. Watch the apology here. That’s it from Palaszczuk (ABC has cut away). We’re still waiting for Victorian premier, Dan Andrews (he was due at 11am). Palaszczuk welcomes the announcement of Pfizer being made available for 5-11 year-old children, saying her niece is in that age group and has been pestering her about when she can get a jab. 78.1% of Queenslanders are now fully vaccinated, Palaszczuk says. In the meantime, here’s Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. No new community cases in the state today. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is running a little late. I’ll bring you updates once he shows. I’m handing the blog over to my brilliant colleague, Nino Bucci! He will be bringing you updates from Victorian premier Daniel Andrews’ press conference, which is expected to start in 10 minutes. There has been a lot of talk this morning about whether South Australia will close the state’s borders as the Omicron variant spreads in Australia. Our friends at AAP have the story: South Australian authorities are “extraordinarily concerned” about the presence of the Omicron Covid variant interstate, but will not make any immediate changes to the state’s borders. Premier Steven Marshall has instead indicated travellers from NSW, Victoria and the ACT could soon find themselves locked out of SA, only days after they were welcomed back for the first time in months. “It may become necessary. I hope it doesn’t,” he said in a press conference on Saturday, before SA reported five new cases. We would only do that if we wanted to make sure that we still enjoy a Christmas here in SA. This is a balancing act. Chief public health officer Prof Nicola Spurrier on Saturday morning recommended to the state’s Covid-19 directions committee that borders be shut. Clearly when you have something that is unknown, the lowest risk would be to try and keep it out for as long as possible. But instead the committee agreed to require all arrivals from NSW, Victoria and the ACT be tested upon arrival. They must isolate until a negative result is received – which currently takes about five hours, Marshall said – and be tested again on day six of their visit to SA. The new rules are in addition to a requirement for travellers from those parts of the country to present proof of a negative test undertaken up to 72 hours before their arrival. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews and deputy premier, James Merlino are expected make an announcement at 11am. We will be watching and bringing you updates as they happen. Federal health minister Greg Hunt said there are now 15 known cases of the Omicron variant in Australia. In a press conference announcing the Pfizer vaccine had received TGA approval for five to 11 year olds, Hunt said that the government is “reviewing daily and weekly travel restrictions” but that there are “no plans to change the current proposals”. Hunt said: But our message is very clear. Safety and medical advice first ... if the medical advice changes then we change the rules in accordance with that. Prof John Skerritt said that “early indications are that it provides a milder case of disease. Although usually there is a two-week lag to work out whether there are going to be cases of hospitalisation and severe disease. So that’s why the lead up here into Christmas and exercising caution is so important.” Skerritt added that the TGA is looking at how well vaccinations work against the Omicron variant. He reassured that, while we thought that we might need a new vaccine against the Delta variant, “the current vaccines held us in good stead”. Finally, Speers asked Frydenberg about the Jenkins inquiry into parliamentary culture handed down this week. Frydenberg said that “what Kate Jenkins said in this report was that there was a normalised culture of misconduct. That is completely unacceptable”. He added that the government will “be taking action on all the recommendations. We’re absolutely leaning into this”. Speers asked Frydenberg about that Liberal party is doing to ensure more women are elected to parliament, and whether the party should adopt a 50% target. There was a lot of back and forth, and Frydenberg pointed to the fact that the number one candidate on the Victorian Liberal party’s senate ballot is female. But the treasurer eventually admitted that “we’ve got to do more”. Speers asked Frydenberg about wages growth (or lack thereof). Speers: Wages have been relatively flat for the eight years you have been in government. Have you worked out why and how to fix it? Frydenberg: This is the key point. This is the key point, we saved more than 700,000 jobs. And as a result, unemployment now is at 5.2%, lower than when we came to government. Now, the way to get higher wages is to get a tighter labour market. We’re starting to see workforce shortages which will have some positive impact on wages ... we have the RBA forecasting, David, that unemployment will get down into the fours and sustainably be there, and we’ll be only the second time in the last 50 years that this has happened. So if you ask me, what has been the most significant economic achievement through this pandemic, it’s been saving jobs and getting the unemployment rate down, and avoiding the long-term unemployment we saw in Australia after the 80s and 90s recessions. Speers turned conversation to the government’s mid-year budget, asking Fryenberg whether the outlook for growth for the economy is stronger than at the last budget? Frydenberg: Well, yes. And I’m talking about for next year, obviously. We were hit by the Delta variant and it was something not forecast, have your two biggest states going into lockdown. But we have seen the OECD increase their economic outlook forAustralia. You have the RBA forecasting growth up to 5.5%. We’ll make those updates to our forecasts on MYEFO. Speers: You’ll be forecasting stronger growth? Frydenberg: We will be. Again that comes as a result of the fact that we now have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. The market is coming back strongly. We’ve seen 350,000 jobs since the start of September. Retail sales at the Black Friday sales was over $5bn. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg told David Speers on ABC Insiders this morning that he has spoken to South Australia premier Steven Marshall this morning and has been told that he is keeping his borders open, despite concerns around the Omicron variant in Australia. He’s taken that decision himself. He understands the importance of the economy of keeping those borders open. Let’s not forget, though, South Australia is the first non-Covid state to effectively reopen. So he’s watching it closely. As he should. Speers points out that members of the of the Australian industry group, the business council are backing Labor’s 43% emissions reductions target. Speers: Are you saying that business groups have got it wrong, Reputex have got it wrong, Liberal state governments have got it wrong, but you and Barnaby Joyce, and he’s the one who pushed you to your 2030 target, you’ve got it right? Frydenberg: We’ve got a 2050 goal as well. But we think we have got it right. Again, look at our track record. Emissions are down by more than 20% on 2005 levels. That’s ahead of Canada, that’s ahead of New Zealand, that’s ahead of the United States, a lot of other comparable countries. We have identified the new technologies, not tax, that we’re focusing on, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, low cost solar. Speers: You’re happy to say to your constituents in Kooyong, these groups are all wrong, and Barnaby Joyce and you are right. Frydenberg: We’ve got the right plan, we’re going to see emissions down by up to 35% by 2030, we’re committed to net zero by 2050, this is an important environmental but also economic objective. I spoke quite publicly by the need from an economic perspective... Speers: Let’s look at the plan [Labor] do have on the table. This modelling has been done by RepuTex, they also advised the government on its target. It found the policy would create 640,000 new jobs, lower electricity bills. Are you suggesting they’ve got that wrong? Frydenberg: What I’m suggesting is the Labor party is using the safeguards mechanism. When we put it in 2016, it was designed to safeguard the emissions reductions we were getting from the Emissions Reduction Fund, and not see a growth in the emissions coming out of the large industrial players. It wasn’t meant to be this stick to mandate, to push these industrial players to force them to reduce their emissions by a certain amount... I’m saying that Labor is using the safeguards mechanism in away that would punish, force these large industrial companies, some of the biggest companies in Australia, regardless of their growth, regardless of their plans for expanding their presence. Frydenberg tells Speers that the Coalition, if in opposition, would vote against Labor’s emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030. We’re not about to support Labor’s policy. We’ve got our own policy and that’s what we’re looking to implement. But reducing emissions is an absolute focus for our government. We have deployed $20bn, we’ve got a technology investment road map, we’re ahead of other comparable countries, don’t look at what Labor says, look at what Labor does. They gave us a carbon tax. ABC Insiders host David Speers starts by asking what Frydenberg thinks of Labor’s recently announced climate policies, which includes an emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030. Speers points out that “the business council, the Australian industry group, they both backed Labor’s policy. Has business got it wrong?” Frydenberg starts by talking about the government’s commitment to net zero by 2050, before responding to Labor’s policy: ... what Labor has announced is simply a reheat of the target they took to the 2019 election which Anthony Albanese said was an actual mistake. Now, Labor can’t be trusted, David, on this important economic transition. The last time they had a go at climate policy, we got a doubling in electricity prices, we lost one in eight Australian jobs. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg is speaking on ABC Insiders. Clover Moore is set to secure an unprecedented fifth term as lord mayor of the City of Sydney following New South Wales council elections on Saturday, AAP reports. Moore, an independent, will speak to reporters at 11am in Sydney. By late on Saturday night, she was sitting on 43% of first preference votes, well ahead of her two nearest competitors, fellow independent Yvonne Weldon and Labor’s Linda Scott, who were both on 16%. The early results suggested a swing against Moore of nearly 15% – but that’s compared to her landslide win in 2016 when she won almost 58% of the vote.Moore has four decades of public service under her belt, 17 of them as Sydney’s lord mayor. “We have been able to achieve so much but we have a lot more to do,” she said on Saturday night. Moore’s plans include a council goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2035, growing green spaces across the city, improving access to social and affordable housing, and repairing the CBD’s economy and council’s own coffers post-Covid. The race to become Sydney’s mayor was one of more than 120 council elections across the state on Saturday. It was an all-female field in the City of Sydney with many of Moore’s opponents arguing it was time for change at Town Hall. Moore was first elected as lord mayor in 2004 which was 16 years after she was elected to state parliament in 1988. She managed both responsibilities until 2012 when new legislation forced her to choose between the roles. Hunt is asked whether states, like Queensland, will hold off opening state borders until at least 80% of kids aged five to 11 are vaccinated given today’s announcement. Hunt: There is no reason for that. The Doherty modelling was set out very clearly on the 80% rates for double dosed across the country for 16 plus, and what we have seen now is that in terms of the 12 to 15-year-olds, we have now had an extra 1.8 million vaccinations over and above the Doherty modelling. The Doherty modelling was based on an 80% national rate for double dosed and didn’t include 12 to 15-year-olds. Prof Skerritt has also explained why it is important for children to get vaccinated against Covid-19. A bit over a fifth of all cases of Covid are actually in the under 12s. Indeed, some of the early data with Omicron suggests it may actually be higher for the Omicron variant ... While most kids to get fairly mild infection and only a limited number end up in ICU, is great, there are bigger impacts. Unfortunately about one in 3,000 of the kids who get Covid actually end up with this funny immunological condition called multi-system inflammatory condition. Those kids can end up being very sick for months. It is not the same as long Covid but it has some things in common, and it has a whole range of symptoms where the kid is just not well. That is one of the things we are protecting against by vaccinating children... We do know that kids often transmit the virus back to their families. About two-thirds do, and at a lower rate they also transmit the virus within the broader school context. Prof John Skerritt has spoken more about the Covid-19 vaccine that will be administered to children aged five to 11. Skerritt says that this age group will be given one-third of the dose given to other age groups and that “often with vaccines you can offer a smaller dose for younger children”. He says their vaccine dose will be in a vial with an orange lid, rather than the adult doses while are in vials with grey or purple lids. Skerritt turned to speak about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in children. It has extensively been clinically tested. It was tested in a trial of almost 2,500 children aged five to 11, and in the trial over 1,500 received vaccine. The response of the body, the immune response, was identical to that in young adults. More recently, there have actually been results published in one of the world’s top three medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine. In that journal the result showed that 91% vaccine efficacy. Efficacy is essentially the same in adults as it is in this group, so we are confident the performance. There were no safety signals, as we call them, no safety problems identified in those trials. The children had some of the same things that adults get, tiredness, sore arms, headache and so forth, but these tended to be brief and fairly short lived. We are confident in the safety of this. Federal health minister Greg Hunt has praised the millions of Australians who have come forward to be vaccinated against Covid-19. He says that over 39.6 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Australia. Currently, 92.8% of eligible Australians have received their first dose, and 88% are fully vaccinated. Since vaccines have been approved for 12-15 year olds, 76.7% of this age group have already received their first dose, and 67.8% are fully vaccinated. So Australian teenagers have stepped forward to be vaccinated. Hunt says that the TGA’s provisional approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children aged five to 11 is the first of four steps “focused on the safety and effectiveness of vaccinating children”. The second is the recommendation of Atagi. We are expecting that in the coming weeks. The third then is training in relation to the use of the Pfizer vaccine in paediatric cases or for children five to 11. And then finally it is the batch testing, which is done by the TGA. Our batch testing team, our TGA team, will be working right through Christmas, right through the new year and a provisional expectation at this stage is that we have been able to bring forward the commencement of the paediatric doses or the children’s doses to 10 January. Hunt: We announced today that the Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australia’s medical regulator, has approved access for five to 11-year-olds to the Pfizer vaccine. They have made a careful, thorough assessment, determined that it is safe and effective and that it is in the interests of children and Australians for children five to 11 to be vaccinated. Federal health minister Greg Hunt is speaking live from Canberra about the government’s plan to rollout Covid-19 vaccinations for children. Labor says it will fund up to 20,000 extra university places over 2022 and 2023, and provide access to 465,000 free Tafe places in nominated areas of skills shortages, if Anthony Albanese wins the next federal election. The new skills and higher education commitments, worth $1.2bn, will be unveiled by the Labor leader at a campaign-style rally in Sydney on Sunday. The Tafe initiative will cost $621m over the forward estimates, and the university commitment costs $481.7m. Read the full story here: Parliament House has been closed to the public after a staffer for Greens leader Adam Bandt reportedly tested positive for Covid-19. Bandt and the staffer were in Canberra for sitting week last week. The staffer tested positive for Covid-19 upon returning to Melbourne. A spokesperson for Bandt told ABC News that the Greens leader has “been tested and is isolating until he receives a result. He is fully vaccinated and not symptomatic”. The spokesperson added that other members of Bandt’s team have tested negative for Covid-19. It’s Justine Landis-Hanley here, bringing you the blog today, Sunday 5 December 2021. Let’s dive straight into some breaking news: The Therapeutic Goods Administration has provisionally approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11. The government will begin rolling out the vaccine to the approximately 2.3 million children in this age group from 10 January 2022, the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said in a statement this morning. The decision is subject to final considerations and recommendations from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi). Children aged five to 11 will be given one-third of the dose approved for those aged 12 and over. Their vaccine dose will be clearly differentiated with an orange cap."

          "bodyText": "Angry villagers who set fire to army vehicles are among more than a dozen civilians killed by soldiers in India’s remote north-east region along the border with Myanmar. An army officer said soldiers fired at a truck, killing six labourers returning home from work, after receiving intelligence about a movement of insurgents in the area. As villagers reacted by burning two army vehicles, the soldiers fired at them, killing seven more people, the officer said, adding that one soldier was also killed in the clash. Nagaland police officer Sandeep M Tamgadge told AFP that the situation in the district was “very tense right now”, with nine other civilians wounded in the second incident now being treated in local hospitals. Nagaland state’s top elected official, Neiphiu Rio, ordered a probe into the killings, which occurred on Saturday: “The unfortunate incident leading to the killing of civilians at Oting is highly condemnable.” Insurgents often cross into Myanmar after attacking Indian government forces in the remote area. Nyamtow Konyak, a local community leader, said those killed were coalminers returning home from work. India’s home minister Amit Shah expressed anguish over the “unfortunate incident” and said the state government would investigate the killings. The army officer said the soldiers had laid an ambush for a week following intelligence that insurgents were planning to attack soldiers in the area, 250 miles (400km) east of Gauhati, the capital of Assam state. “The cause of the unfortunate loss of lives is being investigated at the highest level and appropriate action will be taken as per the course of law,” a statement from the army said. There are dozens of ethnic insurgent groups in India’s remote north-east whose demands range from independent homelands to maximum autonomy within India. With Reuters and Associated Press"

          "headline": "‘Original archaeologists’: Arnhem Land traditional owners take charge of priceless rock art",
          "bodyText": "Traditional owners from western Arnhem Land say they are the “original archaeologists” of their country, and now they are taking action to preserve their priceless history on their own terms. “Many of the stories are still hidden away from non-Indigenous people who have learned very little about them,” Bininj traditional owner Conrad Maralngurra says. “They need to live with us for 10 or 20 years to get the whole meaning of cultural integrity.” This week, a group of Bininj traditional owners from the breathtaking stone country of western Arnhem Land travelled to Darwin to present a digital portrait of their country and culture focused around rock art to the annual conference of the Australian Archeological Association. Berribob Watson, of Manmoyi, and Maralngurra, of Mamadawerre, two small outstations on the Arnhem Land plateau about 300km east of Darwin, detailed the work of nearly 200 Bininj Aboriginal people and addressed the conference in English and Bininj Kunwok (dialects of western Arnhem Land). “We spoke to them as the original archeologists of our country,” Maralngurra says. “We have been writing it [history] down from the start, on the rock. Stories on that rock is the law, our heritage and gives people their rights.” Bininj are traditional occupants of western Arnhem Land, which borders Kakadu and Nitmiluk national parks in the west and south-west. The region’s Kombolgie sandstone has been carved by a cycle of wet and dry seasons over millennia and is one of the world’s most remote and inaccessible regions. Indigenous occupation goes back to the last ice age. Rich rock art is liberally scattered on the walls and ceilings of sandstone shelters. It is estimated there are three or four art sites for every 10 sq km of rocky terrain, potentially more than 40,000 sites. Most art is in or near areas where Bininj lived for thousands of years. While some sites are specific to men or women, most are communal. In the recent past, rock art research has been the domain of non-Indigenous anthropologists and archaeologists employed by tertiary institutions with government funding. Their findings, including interviews with traditional owners, photographs and artefacts taken from sites, often remained with institutions where they were archived. Rarely did the data come back to a community in any form other than a research paper or government document. However, Bininj have turned that model on its head. In 2010, Aboriginal elders from the Warddeken and Djelke IPAs established the Karrkad-Kandji Trust to seek alternative sources of funding for land management and cultural projects. The trust approaches Australian and international philanthropic organisations and individuals. The KKT established a $5m rock art project in Arnhem Land, the main contributor being the Ian Potter Foundation. Bininj hired their own support staff – Claudia Cialone and Chester Clarke – to live in their communities and coordinate a program to help Bininj locate, record, preserve and maintain sites and artwork. “We employed these people because we want them to help us preserve the stories through Balanda [European] ways. We also want to share the stories but we want to take control and have legal ownership of the knowledge. We want to maintain, preserve and protect it for the benefit of our own country and people,” Maralngurra says. The rock art program has an annual budget of $800,000 and employs more than 50 traditional owners and 100 Indigenous rangers, who spend much of their time travelling through remote areas to locate sites. Art is recorded by camera and video, and appropriate landholders are interviewed. The information is stored digitally for future generations. According to Claudia Cialone, Warddeken land management has built a unique rock art conservation team. “An academic paper is not enough to express Bininj passion and interest in rock art, so they decided to create their own narrative and take that to the world,” Cialone says. Maralngurra said the program is sparking interest all across western Arnhem Land and people in larger settlements, who have not been back to their traditional country, are clamouring to return. “Rock art is at the root of our society,” he said. “It is where we get the stories from. There is a lot of enthusiasm for people to go back and see where their story was established.” There are more than 125,000 known rock art sites in Australia, from the Torres Strait to Tasmania. Some contain grand, elevated galleries while others may hold a single, faded image on an out-of-the-way rock face or cave wall. Artistic styles include paintings, rock engravings (petroglyphs) and beeswax motifs and designs. Scientists believe some examples to be 30,000 years old. Rock art hotspots include Arnhem Land, the Kimberley and the Pilbara."

The new skills and higher education commitments, worth $1.2bn, will be unveiled by the Labor leader at a campaign-style rally in Sydney on Sunday. The Tafe initiative will cost $621m over the forward estimates, and the university commitment costs $481.7m. With federal parliament now finished for the year, and the election looming in the first half of next year, Labor has moved into campaign mode. Sunday’s skills package is Labor’s second major election policy announcement in two days. Labor unveiled its new climate change policy on Friday, which includes an emissions reduction target for 2030 of 43% and a commitment to boost the share of renewables in the national electricity market to 82%. Labor says providing free Tafe places in targeted areas will help rebuild the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, like hospitality and tourism, as well as meeting current and future needs in the care economy, including jobs in child care, aged care, disability care, nursing and community services. The funding will provide more than 465,000 free Tafe places, including 45,000 new places. The package also includes a $50m technology fund to improve IT facilities, workshops, laboratories and telehealth simulators. Labor will aim to prioritise the new funding for universities which are able to offer additional courses in national priority areas, such as clean energy, advanced manufacturing, health and education, or where there are skills shortages. The opposition says funding for additional university places will help the higher education sector recover from the pandemic. Universities did not have access to the wage subsidy jobkeeper, and the closure of the border meant institutions lost revenue from international students. Universities are estimated to have lost a total of 35,000 staff during the pandemic after government decisions effectively excluded them from the wage subsidy scheme. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Policy documents circulated in advance of Sunday’s rally say universities will receive funding over six years from 2021-22 for the additional 20,000 commencing university places across 2022 and 2023 in national priority areas. The additional funding will be allocated to universities based on the ability of institutions to offer additional places in areas of national priority and skills shortage; their programs to recruit underrepresented groups “like those who are the first in their family to go to university, and people in regional, remote and outer-suburban areas, and First Nations people”; and student demand. In a statement circulated ahead of the rally, Albanese said the skills and higher education program would address some of the cuts to vocational training and apprenticeships. “Today we have 85,000 fewer apprenticeships and traineeships compared to 2013,” the Labor leader said. “At the same time, it’s getting harder and more expensive to go to uni.” Albanese said the proportion of applicants who get an offer of a place at university “has fallen every year since the Liberal government slashed university funding – this year, the offer rate fell to its lowest level in years”. “This has happened in the face of the stark economic reality that nine out of 10 jobs of the future will require a VET qualification or a university degree.” Albanese said an intervention was necessary because one in four businesses were experiencing skills shortages and “at the same time there are two million Australians who are either looking for a job or want to work more hours”. Labor’s announcement follows a separate higher education commitment from the Morrison government. Under that proposal, unveiled by the prime minister during a speech to business leaders late last month, four “trailblazer” universities would receive a funding boost of more than $200m for research hubs to advance Australian manufacturing."

          "headline": "Penelope Jackson appeals against murder verdict claiming media footage ‘impeded’ fair trial",
          "bodyText": "A woman jailed for at least 18 years after being found guilty of murdering her husband is to appeal against her conviction on the grounds that video and audio evidence released into the public domain midway through her trial impeded her right to a fair hearing. Penelope Jackson, 66, was found guilty of murder in October at Bristol crown court after a jury of eight women and four men delivered a 10-2 majority verdict. The case attracted widespread publicity after a clip in which the retired accountant admitted stabbing David Jackson, 78, was circulated on news websites and social media platforms. Police bodycam footage showing the moment of Jackson’s arrest outside her home in Somerset was released after requests from the media and the permission of the trial judge. Jackson is captured on camera confessing: “I admit it all.” She appears calm as she tells officers: “He is on the kitchen floor” and repeatedly asks for her coat. She goes on to say: “I stabbed him. He’s an aggressive bully and nasty and I’ve had enough.” In addition, audio evidence was circulated of a 999 call Jackson made in which she admitted to an operator that she had stabbed her husband three times. Later in a statement she said she had been in a state of traumatised shock. Martin Winter, Jackson’s solicitor, said: “The release of the media and the interest it stirred up created an unfairness because it coincided with the beginning of her giving evidence.” Jackson admitted killing her husband but denied murder, claiming instead she suffered a “loss of control” after decades of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of the former army lieutenant colonel. The court heard how he had held a knife to his wife’s throat during a family barbecue and, on another occasion, threatened her with a poker after a row over a TV remote control. Winter said while the jury had seen the evidence of the confession prior to its dissemination, it had been viewed by jurors in the controlled arena of the trial. “The fear is that once the images go outside of the courtroom, the ability of the judge to advise a jury about that evidence is lost,” he explained. “Inevitably, it went further than the responsible news outlets and attracted a lot of commentary on social media. It was subject to mocking and mimicry and became the subject of memes and dark humour.” Clare Wade QC had sought to persuade the jury that Jackson had a loss of control – a partial defence to murder – after being pushed to the edge by her husband’s abuse. But sentencing Jackson to life with an 18-year minimum term, Judge Martin Picton told her: “I have no doubt you intended to kill your husband and it was premeditated murder. Your behaviour shows a shocking level of callousness.” Jane Monckton Smith, a criminologist specialising in domestic homicide, said: “I think the footage was very detrimental to her and I think it was misinterpreted.” She added: “The type of person that commits a domestic homicide is usually very manipulative and controlling, whether they are male or female – unless they are responding to abuse against themselves and then they fall into a different category. “In the footage, Penelope Jackson was not trying to manipulate what people thought. She was just in shock and telling the truth. There was no subterfuge but rather an honesty which, in my personal opinion, supports her story that she was abused.” Smith, a former police officer and professor of public protection at the University of Gloucestershire, said: “To somebody who doesn’t know about intimate partner homicides, that footage could come across as if she was heartless and cold. But when you understand how coercive control works and its impact on victims you can see she is in shock and not attempting to manipulate people’s ideas of what happened.” Jackson’s legal team had resisted the application to release the footage. Winter said: “We urged the court to delay the release of the material precisely because it can take on a life of its own. It was something around which people who didn’t want to bother themselves with the detail could watch and come to a conclusion about before widely publishing their opinions. “It becomes the subject of speculation and uninformed comment and the fear is the jury can be swayed by the commentary when it is that widespread.” The Crown Prosecution Service said it would not comment on a case once an appeal has been lodged. The Judicial Office does not comment on individual cases."

          "bodyText": "Olivia Rodrigo claimed the top two positions on Spotify’s most-streamed songs list in the UK this year, with just one surprise, given her ubiquity – that the Paramore-esque Good 4 U edged out Drivers License, which is an affront to advocates for the correct use of apostrophes. While other streaming services are available, it is Spotify that has the end-of-year list sewn up; as one internet wag wisely noted, it is the only service to show off about how much it is tracking you and make it seem like fun. A few years ago, Netflix posted a tweet that read: “To the 53 people who’ve watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: who hurt you?” At the time, it was controversial for being creepy and judgmental. Now, most of us not only shrug off big tech companies knowing what we’ve been doing and when, but help them to promote it. Spotify’s annual Unwrapped, a personalised animation that shows what subscribers have been listening to, arrives with the advent calendars. That’s about three weeks after everyone has put up their Christmas trees. I’ve always found the performative aspect of these lists a bit unsettling, like a teenager listening to music on phone speakers so that everyone knows about their love for rap music with lots of swearing in it. What I listen to is basically mortifying: There Are Worse Things I Could Do from the Grease soundtrack, on repeat, so I can sing along at top volume and daydream about an amateur production that would take a 39-year-old Rizzo (to be fair, Stockard Channing was 33 when she played her in the film). I know, in theory, that there is no such thing as a guilty pleasure, but is it dignified to shout about repeat-listening to Monster by Kanye in order to perfect the Nicki Minaj rap? This year, I have seen more memes about Spotify Unwrapped than actual lists; either everyone’s pandemic streaming was too exposing to be made public or people don’t see themselves reflected in it. Shared accounts, hacked accounts, the radio, the record player – all mean Spotify Unwrapped is a funhouse mirror, not quite what it says it is. And I am convinced, convinced, that it invents genres in order to encourage people to post “wtf is chamber psych lol random”. Or maybe the only thing that needs unwrapping is my tinfoil hat. Bryan Adams: snapping pit stops for Pirelli Rock star/photographer Bryan Adams has shot this year’s Pirelli calendar. Since 1964, the tyre company has been recruiting star photographers and famous people, usually women, to what has become a prestigious project. The theme of this year’s instalment is On the Road and it features a number of musicians, from Cher to St Vincent to Rita Ora, posed as if to “capture the life of an artist on tour”. The calendar used to be notoriously nudity-heavy, but the only topless shot I could see this year was Iggy Pop’s. In my days as a music journalist, I spent plenty of time “on the road” and was excited to see it reflected in Adams’s pictures. Perhaps Cher would be captured turning up at a remote services at midnight, only to find that everything except a lone WHSmith was closed and that it would be Monster Munch for dinner, again. Perhaps Rita Ora might be seen wondering if that sticky feeling on her skin, a mix of cheap, warm beer and drummer’s sweat, would ever go away? It’s not a spoiler to say that if this calendar were a road, it would be the M6 toll: clean, elite and full of rich people. Ellen White: joy all round, but the score’s not the goal As a relative newcomer to being a football fan, I was shocked to discover that winning 20-0 did not feel as good as I might have anticipated it would a few years ago. The statistics involved in England’s drubbing of Latvia in Tuesday’s World Cup qualifying match are, to use the technical term, a bit silly: four hat tricks, 85.6% possession for England, 31 shots on target and seven more goals than England’s previous best score of 13-0. Even the manager, Sarina Wiegman, suggested this might be an indication of the need for pre-qualifiers. “In every country you want to develop the women’s game but I don’t think it’s good that the scores now are so high,” she said. Amid all that, though, it was deservedly Ellen White’s evening. The Manchester City forward equalled Kelly Smith’s record of 46 goals for England in the sixth minute and had bettered it in the ninth. (Smith sent her a congratulatory message on Twitter: “So many nations now across the world fear playing against you,” she said.) White ended the match with a new record of 48 goals, putting her on a level with Gary Lineker and Harry Kane[Correct according to https://www.englandstats.com/player.php?pid=1207], behind only Bobby Charlton and Wayne Rooney. Cause for celebration, obviously, and on the pitch the joy was there for all to see, though off the pitch White’s humility was profound. “We move on and don’t mention it again,” she said. It’s clear now that smashing Rooney’s record is a possibility: at 32, you sense there are many more goals left in her yet, though don’t expect her to be shouting about it. • This article was amended on 4 December 2021.

          "bodyText": "On 14 March 2020, I left my home in the Orkney Islands to drive to Edinburgh international airport. I was due to travel to Germany for a research trip. Full of nervous anticipation, and making frantic last-minute preparations, I hadn’t paid as much attention to the coronavirus crisis as I might have, but events were developing so quickly across Europe, it was dawning on me that international travel might not be an option for much longer. By 5am, as I boarded the ferry, the radio bulletins seemed apocalyptic. On board, passengers sat separately, in their own private islands of paranoia. I wore a mask over my nose and mouth, and cleaned my armrests with a baby wipe soaked in Dettol. In the toilets, the ship pitching beneath my feet, I scrubbed my hands for 60 seconds and examined my own reflection. Grey, I thought. Anxious. Four hours later, I stopped in at my parents’ place near Inverness, where I ate some lunch and checked emails on my phone. I had a lot of them. “Don’t come,” one of my German contacts said, simply. Another had cancelled our meeting due to childcare problems; all schools had suddenly closed. A hotel regretfully informed me that it would not be able to honour my booking. My flight, however, was still scheduled to depart on time. Far above, thousands of planes were still pinballing around Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas. They crowded the airspace over London and Amsterdam and Paris, converging from all directions before spiralling down. They were launching over oceans with a cannonball momentum; weaving cleanly between each other in a mannered, balletic dance. Normally, planes are in constant motion, massing with the daylight but never truly ceasing, moving in predictable patterns like currents over the Earth – the invisible infrastructure of the world. Regular routes – these passageways and corridors and elevated motorways through the sky – have grown more crowded and important as air travel has increased in popularity over recent decades, more tightly stitched into the fabric of our lives and the global economy. Back in 2004, 2 billion passengers boarded flights over the course of a year. By 2019 that figure had more than doubled, to 4.5 billion. On an average day, 100,000 flights or more might take off; on 25 July 2019 – the busiest recorded day in aviation – there were 230,000. In 2020, passenger numbers were expected to rise yet again – until the Covid-19 pandemic brought the aviation industry to its knees. Suddenly, all around the world, people were watching the news, clutching their tickets, checking for updates and wondering what to do. Very soon, flights would be grounded on a scale never before seen. A year without flying – for many of us – forced major changes in the way we ran our business, family life, leisure time, and how we looked at the world. *** As I uncertainly considered my flight to Germany, 9,100 miles away, in Perth, Australia, Daria Kuznetsova and Andrew Rodger were making their own calculations. For an international couple, “home” is a complicated proposition. They’d been in Australia for nearly a month, introducing baby Alexander to Andrew’s family, and they had tickets booked to travel back to the UK, where they had both lived since they were students. Their tickets were valid, but something was holding them back. The Australian prime minister had just called on his countryfolk everywhere to come home. For Andrew, an Australian citizen, it felt difficult to disobey. And wouldn’t they, by returning to Europe, be flying into the eye of the storm? What about Daria’s family – her parents in Washington DC, her sister in Turkey, her brother in Moscow? What would they do? Who did they have? They debated for a few days. In Australia they felt safe. But when they thought about their cosy London flat, the mural on the living room wall, their baby’s cot, their books, they knew that was home. They decided to go. The airport was almost deserted, and felt unnerving. But the plane itself was packed. There wasn’t a spare seat; they had unwittingly booked themselves, months before, on to what would be one of the last flights out of Australia. The atmosphere was strained, Daria remembers. “There was a feeling that we had no idea what we were flying into. And it could be really bad.” It was a long flight: about 17 hours, direct. In the darkened cabin, Daria held Alexander over her shoulder and paced the aisles, jogging him to sleep. As she walked, she moved in and out of earshot of other passengers’ conversations. There were raised voices, determined plan-making, black humour. A few were genuinely panicked. Daria wasn’t frightened, not exactly, but it was certainly unsettling. She didn’t know at the time that it would be the last flight she would take for many months, that she would miss her sister’s wedding, would need to counsel her family through hard times over Zoom. She didn’t think to wonder how long it would be until they saw their families again. *** The final weeks of March 2020 saw a last mad scramble for flights before the departure boards went dark. For those working in the aviation industry, it was all hands on deck, as 1.3 million British nationals returned to the UK via commercial air routes. Those who didn’t, or couldn’t, or hadn’t appreciated the urgency, soon found themselves fighting over the remaining seats. Timetables were torn up as governments chartered planes to repatriate stranded citizens. According to the Foreign Office, 38,000 Britons were flown back on 186 flights, from 57 different countries and territories, a crisis response with “no postwar precedent in terms of scale, complexity and duration”. The Ministry of Defence was drafted in to help hundreds more in particularly far-flung locations, repatriating 90 scientists, support staff and construction workers from the British Antarctic Survey, among others. But after the panic, an eerie silence. Airports were slowing to a near halt. Most airlines cut capacity by 80 or 90%, parking their jets on off-ramps, taxiways, even runways. Satellite images from around the world showed their cruciform shapes bristling from every corner, or arranged in neat, herringbone designs, wingtip to wingtip, nose to tail. Others were offloaded into hibernation in remote desert “boneyards”, their engines filled with a preservative oil and bags of desiccant distributed through the empty cabins to guard against rust and mould. At one point, two-thirds of all the world’s planes were grounded. One British Airways pilot I spoke to – let’s call him John – suddenly found his schedule was bare. “Every month, we would get our roster as normal – all the flights we were expected to do – and steadily, as the month went on, every single one would be cancelled.” From 28 March onwards, he had 100 days without any flights. By the start of May, more than 80 countries had suspended flights in and out. Increasingly, there was nowhere left to fly. Pilots’ pay is tightly coupled to their workload; without payments for flight time and stopovers, John’s income was tumbling. Then he and his colleagues accepted a cut to basic pay, as part of efforts to stem job losses – though he had been at the company long enough to escape the axe himself, under BA’s last-in, first-out policy. Others in the industry were less fortunate. Some airlines, already under financial stress, buckled almost immediately in the chaos. Flybe collapsed overnight in early March after a Covid-related fall in bookings; Italian national airline Alitalia ceased operations in October. Overall, passenger numbers on international flights fell by 75.6% in 2020, compared with the previous 12 months, making it the worst year on record for the aviation industry. Those carriers that did survive had to think outside the box. Some retired older, trouble-ridden aircraft early, rather than fork out for their storage. Some, such as Icelandair, converted passenger jets into cargo planes by stripping out seats; Emirates chief Tim Clark said it had converted into “a mini UPS” to get by. Finnair left business class seats in place, with only a thin curtain separating them from where packages were piled high in place of the economy section. Many airlines slashed staff – across Europe, about 18,000 pilots’ jobs are thought to have been lost or are under threat, along with many tens of thousands of ground staff, cabin crew and airport workers. You can find those pilots online, posting wistful footage from past flights. One former Flybe pilot, posting to Twitter under the handle @pilot_ems, has pinned a video of her final landing as a sort of calling card for future employers (“a manually flown steep approach on a raw data ILS … I’m available immediately”). In the meantime, she sells flight-themed T-shirts and calendars online. It has been a major setback for new pilots, who have racked up tens of thousands of pounds of debt while training. Without regular flight or simulator time, these expensive credentials lapse within months. Regaining a “type rating” – which qualifies you to fly a particular aircraft, a Boeing 737 or an Airbus A320, say – might cost an out-of-work pilot £30,000 or more. Meanwhile, John thanked his lucky stars for being at the right company for the right amount of time, and for flying the right kind of aircraft. He refreshed his roster and waited. Every few weeks he returned to the simulator to fly virtual flights over virtual worlds, as he waited for the real world to change. *** Frankie Ward knows all about virtual worlds. The esports host presents arena events where gaming championships unfold live in front of 10-12,000 fans. She estimates that in 2019 she spent seven cumulative months away from home, “ping-ponging around the world”, never staying anywhere longer than a week. Berlin! Rio! Shanghai! Miami! Sydney! Her career was taking off, and travel was part of the package. Her line of work involves long hours – sometimes 16-hour days, on stage and in front of the camera. It’s a high-adrenaline, emotional experience, she tells me. “At the end of it all, you travel home, and you can’t really talk for a couple of days. It’s like being hit by a truck.” She was hosting the Intel Extreme Masters event in Katowice, Poland, when the bottom fell out – the 2020 final was played on 1 March in an empty 11,500-seat arena, after Polish authorities pulled its mass-event licence. (More than a million tuned in online.) After that, overnight, her work diary went blank. Though the esports industry should have been well placed to adapt to an online world, there were difficulties. Normally, in-person tournaments take place using a single local server. Domestic internet connections aren’t nearly as fast or as stable; at the top levels, a fraction of a second delay might be the deciding factor in the fight for a seven-figure prize pot. It is also, it turns out, much easier to cheat when all the players are working from home. But with tech-friendly organisers and an existing culture of watching gameplay in real time, thanks to the streaming platform Twitch, it took only a few months to get the show back on the road. Soon, international championships had returned, audiences boosted by an influx of traditional sports fans looking for a new fix. Frankie’s work schedule filled up again, but her world closed in around her – she went from travelling to five continents in a month to long days filming alone in a room in her house. She became proficient with green screens – nodding encouragingly into empty space, watching herself superimposed on to faraway rooms, with faraway people. She soon realised that it’s one thing to shrug off jet lag while flooded with adrenaline on a stage, and quite another to be working long days, in other timezones, from your spare room. She stayed awake until 5 or 6am, adapting her body clock to American or Asian schedules. It was hard. She missed sunlight. She missed her partner. “I’d made up a bed in a different room, because I didn’t want to wake him up.” In the end, she gave up the overnight events. On the internet, many things can be truly global. But, in the end, your body – your life – cannot. Finance is another sector that traditionally requires its workers to undertake a lot of international travel. I spoke to one senior executive at an investment company – a Briton, based in New York – who said that in her globetrotting line of work, she would travel long haul a minimum of twice a month, and often twice a week or more. Not long before the global shutdown, she travelled to Mexico City, São Paulo, San Francisco, Toronto and New York in the space of eight days. “One good thing was that I was travelling a lot to Europe, so I could tag on trips home to London,” she says. “I felt like I was having it all: being able to live in a different country but go home frequently, and not at my own expense.” Now, living abroad feels different. She can no longer drop in on her old life. She misses her parents, her sister, her friends. Work, too, is more difficult and less enjoyable. “For the first year of Covid, I was mainly seeing through deals that had started pre-Covid. So I had done a lot of the relationship building, and we could go seamlessly into the virtual version. Where it gets really tough is when you’re starting something new. It’s almost impossible to build a good relationship on a call. And because you don’t have that trust and familiarity, you’re probably more cautious and more indecisive than you would be in person.” Cultural factors play a role here, too: Brazilians, for example, like to do everything face to face. When we speak, she has just come off a four-hour conference call to Rio, for a deal in which the language and cultural barriers were exacerbated by being unable to interact with the other parties in person. Now that the hotel rooms, the starlit nights in São Paulo and the business-class lounge have been replaced by back-to-back video calls from 8am until 8pm, it’s a lot less fun. And it’s harder to find a few undisturbed hours for thinking, reading, strategising. It’s the same job, she says, but it doesn’t feel the same. *** For scientists conducting international research, the grounding of flights caused major problems. Crucial fieldwork in the world’s most remote places had to be indefinitely postponed, including long-running climatological studies that will suffer from an unprecedented year-long gap in the data at a point when the real-time study of changes to permafrost, ice sheets and tropical forests has never been more crucial. On one high-profile polar expedition, the $155m Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (Mosaic), about 90 scientists, technicians and crew members were stranded on board an icebreaker in the Arctic Ocean for two months, after Norwegian travel restrictions halted their planned resupply flights. In the end, they had to suspend data gathering for several weeks to sail south to meet ships in ice-free international waters. Restrictions to nonessential air travel also forced a year-long hiatus at the EastGRIP project in Greenland, an international facility where ice-core drilling offers vital insight into the Earth’s climatological history. Researchers there are looking for answers to increasingly urgent questions, as the Greenland ice sheet shrinks by an estimated 270bn tonnes a year. Planes themselves are also valuable sources of data: commercial airliners are major contributors of meteorological observations – constantly feeding temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed information to the World Meteorological Organisation as they cruise. Normally, planes from 43 different airlines provide about 800,000 observations a day – but this stream sputtered and nearly ran dry. Lufthansa’s contributions fell from 14,000 a month to just over 2,000; easyJet, which normally provides 16,000, sent none. (The UK was buffered from the worst of the impact, thanks to the Met Office’s network of automated weather stations.) For some, however, the shutdown in air transport has offered an opportunity for study. With populations in lockdown, transport restricted and industrial activity slowed, it has been a chance for climatologists and atmospheric scientists to check the accuracy of their models; they have been able to measure the impact of the unprecedented sudden change in carbon emissions, and in aerosols produced by the burning of fossil fuels, and see if it lines up with the effects they might have predicted. As one researcher said: “I don’t think we could have designed a better experiment for our atmosphere.” Perhaps counterintuitively, researchers found that lockdown had a slight warming effect in spring 2020: as air pollution dropped, so did the aerosols – particles in the atmosphere that reflect sunlight away from the planet. The impact was temporary – and tiny, an estimated 0.03C. It was, however, larger than the impact of lockdown-related drops in CO2 emissions, underlining how extraordinarily complex the task of climatological modelling is. Of course, when it comes to air travel and our carbon footprints, climatologists are as hopelessly conflicted as any of us. Indeed, one 2020 study found that climate scientists – especially professors – tended to fly more often than other researchers, mainly due to remote fieldwork and the number of overseas conferences discussing international responses to the climate crisis. One study calculated that a single gathering of the American Geophysical Union, attended by 28,000 scientists, clocked up 177m air miles. This averages at three tonnes of CO2 a scientist, about the weekly emissions of the city of Edinburgh. Recent estimates suggest the Cop26 summit in Glasgow was responsible for the release of about 102,500 tons of CO2, roughly equal to the annual emissions of more than 8,000 UK residents – with international flights thought to contribute 60% of the total. Time and again, people told me that the global grounding of flights had challenged their industry to rethink how their work might continue to function without expensive, time-consuming, carbon-emitting air travel. One humanitarian worker – separated from his wife and infant children for six months due to a combination of flight cancellations, border closures and visa problems – says air travel restrictions upended the normal power structure of the development sector, forcing organisations to give more agency to nationals of the country receiving the aid. The “constant turnover” of international staff slowed, too, allowing for stronger relationships and greater consistency. In corporate sectors, greater oversight of work-related travel has been introduced. Staff are asked to consider whether it’s completely necessary, marking a culture change in industries in which jumping on a plane used to be second nature. This could have a serious environmental impact, given that frequent-flying “super emitters” representing just 1% of the world’s population are responsible for half of aviation’s carbon footprint. Before Covid, demand for air travel had been increasing by just short of 6% a year since 2010; studies estimated that by 2050, aviation would account for about a quarter of all global carbon emissions. But since the pandemic, demand has been deeply affected, resulting in a 40% fall in related CO2 emissions, which are not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2025. Overall, Covid has thrown the challenge we face into sharp relief: in 2020, as travel bans and stay-at-home orders flickered in and out, during industrial slowdowns and the effective closure of business districts, global carbon emissions fell by an estimated 5.8%. This represents the largest decline since the second world war, but nevertheless falls short of the 7.6% cut believed necessary to prevent the planet from warming more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. And already we are returning to our carbon-guzzling ways. With jets roaring back into action, the hushed days of lockdowns feel like a distant dream for those living under busy flight paths. Harriet Grace, a careers coach and creative writing tutor, lives directly under Heathrow flight path 27R. It’s a lovely, leafy area, with Kew Gardens an easy stroll away, the Thames to the north, Richmond Park, with its herds of wild deer, just to the south. But the planes, she says, “are a blight”. They start flying over her house at three or four in the morning. It’s like living directly below a motorway – one that gets busier and busier as the summer heats up, just as you want to spend time outside. She remembers those early days of lockdown with a perverse fondness. At Heathrow, which normally sees about 600 landings a day, incoming flights fell to 60 or fewer. Though it was a frightening period – the struggle over food deliveries, not knowing whether to go out – she still recalls it as a sunlit time. No planes overhead. The roar of the South Circular road, too, had been muffled. It was, she says, “extraordinary, ethereal”. The sky emptied completely. And more than that: they knew it wasn’t going to start up again in just a moment’s time. They could, in other words, fully relax, for what felt like the first time in years. Outside – in the world, on the television, on the radio – all hell was breaking loose. But in the garden she found an uncharacteristic peace. She breathed in. Listened. She heard the birdsong, the wind through the trees. *** Recently, I took my first flight south since the pandemic. Lifting off from the archipelago where I live, I watched the sunlight glimmer off the sea with a pewter sheen. The frilled edges of the coastline spooled by below. Seeing all this, a whole country spread out below me, seemed to add a dimension to the way I understood the land and my place in it. As my gaze zoomed out, I felt my comprehension expand, too – my sense of being part, not only of the town I live in, but the country as a whole, even the world. A world that, for the first time in a long time, seemed accessible and therefore more real. Later, when we made our descent, I saw all London set out below me. The arch of Wembley and the cross-hatched streets, the meandering river. The plane spiralled down east over the city. I saw the nub of the Albert Hall, the sparkling cut-sapphire of a pond. There were train tracks striating the ground, long and thin like musculature, and the ribbing of the streets. Something fired inside me that I hadn’t felt in some time. I realised how my world had shrunk these past few months, how my identity had shifted. At the start of the first lockdown, many of us had that haunting sense that somehow we deserved all this. That we had been riding for a fall. That we had been too busy, too globe-trotting, too carefree, for too long. It’s hard to remember that sense of moral reckoning, now that many of us have spent so much time craving international travel, many for far more crucial and heartrending reasons than my own. The plane made what felt like a handbrake turn and swooped over Hammersmith Bridge, the whole city laid out just for me, and I thought: what a privilege it is to see the world from this perspective. I remembered John, the way he said he’d felt the first time he’d returned to the cockpit after so long: his job, he said, was really a treat. He’d missed it. Many of us, forced to make changes during the shutdown in global travel, adapted our lives. Research has shown that people felt they had rediscovered the value of family, of their local area, even the joys of sharing life at a distance, through virtual means. There have been silver linings to committing to being in one place. Frankie, the esports host, found time to renovate her house with her new husband, and is pregnant with their first child. She won’t be flying much for a while. The New York investment executive moved in with her partner; they bought a house together upstate. She’s not sure how her old globe-trotting habits could fit in with this new settled way of being. For many, being forcibly grounded has brought a sense of groundedness, too. The plane banks and turns into a low haze. Below me, I picture baby Alexander – now a toddler, taking his first steps. Harriet in her garden, hearing the roar of the engine. And a hundred thousand other people outside in the streets, who might look up at any moment and see my descent. • This article was amended on 4 December 2021 to remove some personal information."

          "bodyText": "“We made the film in seven days, shooting non-stop from six in the evening to six in the morning. It was hell. We were always tired. And the cast and crew were always picking on me because my brain would just go completely dead at 2am every day.” Japanese film-maker Junta Yamaguchi is talking about his first feature film, Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes, which was shot almost entirely inside a real cafe in Kyoto. “We couldn’t film anything during their opening hours.” But Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes isn’t your average small-scale indie film. It’s a nicely innovative time-travel yarn that asks: in our world of remote working and Zoom calls, what if the face staring back at us from our computer was a version of ourself two minutes in the future? It’s also the latest example of the nagamawashi (long-shot) film, the micro-genre currently putting no-budget Japanese cinema on the map after the success of One Cut of the Dead – the 2017 zombie horror-comedy that became an international cult sensation, grossing over $30m (£22m) worldwide from a $25,000 budget. Ostensibly filmed in a single continuous shot, Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes was made for JPY 3m, or just under £20,000 and follows Kato, an amateur musician who discovers that a live video stream on his PC is, in fact, being cast by a near-future version of himself from the cafe beneath his apartment. Kato and his friends bring the “time TV” downstairs to the cafe to face the monitor broadcasting the stream and pandemonium ensues, creating a Droste effect that multiplies the time vortex taking place. Yamaguchi is speaking from his home in Kyoto over Zoom (no disturbances to the space-time continuum on this occasion) and says that, like almost everyone involved in Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes, he is a member of Europe Kikaku, a Kyoto theatre group, and the cafe is a place they regularly visit. (Yamaguchi waves the menu: “Organic coffee, vegan hamburgers, and katsu curry and rice.”) Financial strictures meant Yamaguchi was the film’s cinematographer, camera operator and editor, as well as director. Yamaguchi says that Back to the Future was the group’s biggest influence, but it was the “intricate and precise long-take camerawork” from films like Birdman, 1917 and Alfred Hitchock’s 1948 real-time classic Rope that inspired Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes’ form. The limited technological setup was a creative choice as well as a financial one: Yamaguchi shows off a camera no bigger than a Tamagotchi. “You can get close to the cast – like, five centimetres away – and take a really good picture,” he says. The camera was strapped to the back of a smartphone, which was used as a handheld monitor so Yamaguchi could watch the footage back as he followed the actors. Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes premiered at Tollywood, a 46-seat micro-cinema in Tokyo that specialises in sci-fi and animation (“literally the size of my living room,” says Adam Torel, managing director of the film’s UK distributors, Third Window) and arrived in the middle of the pandemic: due to social distancing measures, there were only 12 seats available. But Japan’s state of emergency worked to the film’s advantage: with mainstream film production severely curtailed, it bagged a slot at Toho Cinemas, one of the biggest chains in Japan. Since then, Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes has gone global, picking up awards and nominations at festivals in Sitges, Brussels and Montreal. “Studio Ghibli are now our rivals,” says Yamaguchi. “I thought this was a niche, fun film, but it went worldwide. I never expected this to happen.” • Beyond the Infinite Two Minutes is out now on Blu-Ray."

          "headline": "Fair Work Commission rules BHP vaccine mandate unlawful due to lack of consultation",
          "bodyText": "The Fair Work Commission has ruled a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for all workers at BHP’s Mt Arthur coalmine was unlawful because the company did not consult adequately with its workers. Approximately 50 mine workers were stood down without pay last month after they were told they would be required to have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to enter the work site after 9 November, and that they would need to be fully vaccinated by 31 January next year. The dispute between management of the Mt Arthur open cut coalmine in NSW’s Hunter Valley and the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMMEU) was escalated to a hearing by the full bench of the Fair Work Commission in November. The commission’s president, Iain Ross, said in the ruling on Friday that the company’s vaccine mandate was not “a lawful or reasonable direction” mainly due to the mine management’s failure to consult with its employees about whether such a site access requirement was necessary. The company’s management is obliged to consult with employees over site access requirements under the Work Health and Safety Act. “We acknowledge that employers face a difficult task in managing the risks for their workers in such a dynamic environment [as the Covid-19 pandemic],” the ruling said. Without a public health order or a specific provision in an employment contract or legislation, the commission found, the legal basis for a vaccine mandate as a condition of entry to work premises could only come from “the implied contractual term that employees obey the lawful and reasonable directions of their employer”. BHP is the first Australian company to have its vaccine mandate overturned. There were a range of reasons that were in favour of the mandate, the ruling said, including the health and safety basis for the order and the company’s investment in vaccination arrangements for its employees, including the establishment of a vaccination hub. Had the company consulted with employees and been able to satisfy the commission that the mandate was “the outcome of a meaningful consultation process”, it would have had a strong case for a finding that it was a reasonable direction, the ruling said. In his additional remarks, Ross also said that directions by employers to their staff that are for health and safety purposes are likely to be lawful, provided the direction was reasonable, “because it falls within the scope of the employment and there is nothing illegal or unlawful about becoming vaccinated”. “The consultation deficiencies we have identified can be addressed by Mt Arthur consulting the employees in relation to the question of whether or not the site access requirement should be imposed at the mine. Any subsequent dispute will need to be determined having regard to the particular circumstances at the time,” the ruling said. The mine’s management was expected to be in a position to make a decision about whether a vaccination mandate was necessary as a site access requirement by the time Covid restrictions ease in NSW on 15 December at the latest, per the current NSW state government roadmap. The commission’s deputy president, Tony Saunders, had previously rejected an application from the CFMMEU for interim relief in which unvaccinated employees would be allowed on to the site to work while the matter was being heard, saying the risk of serious illness or death to others from contracting Covid-19 outweighed the inconvenience to those workers. Mine management agreed not to otherwise discipline employees on the basis of their noncompliance with the vaccination order until the commission had ruled on the matter. Approximately 1,000 people are employed at the mine under the company’s enterprise bargaining agreement, with another 1,000 working as contractors. All were subject to the mandate. BHP said in a statement at the time of making the mandate that it was “a necessary health and safety control to help protect our people, their families and communities – including remote Indigenous communities – while continuing to safely run our operations”. Peter Jordan, CFMEU Northern mining and NSW energy district president, said in a statement on Friday that BHP had been “arrogant” in making the mandate “without genuine workforce consultation or the backing of a public health order”. “The decision is a win for the rights of workers to be genuinely consulted about matters affecting them under state workplace health and safety laws,” Jordan said. “We will continue to work through the detail of this decision and represent the interests of our members – especially those who have been stood down without pay as a result of this unlawful direction.” A spokesperson for BHP said in a statement on Friday: “We note the decision from the Fair Work Commission, which acknowledges the risks presented by COVID-19 and has outlined that further consultation should occur. “The science is clear that vaccination saves lives. BHP supports widespread vaccination as the path forward for the Australian economy. We are assessing the implications of the decision and will work with the commission, our people and union representatives to ensure our workplace remains as safe as possible for our people, their families and the community.” Vaccination will remain a condition of entry at the Mt Arthur coal mine while the company undertakes the necessary consultation."

          "bodyText": "A school student in western Sydney is believed to be the first case of community transmission of the Omicron strain of Covid in Australia, as health authorities decide against shortening the interval period for booster shots. The student from Regents Park Christian School is the ninth confirmed Omicron case in New South Wales. The source of the infection is unclear, as the student has not travelled overseas recently and has no links to any returned travellers. On Friday, authorities confirmed two other Covid-positive students from the school were infected with the Omicron strain. Students in senior grades have already finished for the year, however contact tracers are investigating if the Omicron variant has spread further and could be circulating in the community. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said “it would appear that the case could well be an on-NSW-soil transmission”. “This is of concern to the extent that this is the first case that we know of that appears not to have had any travel history,” Hazzard said. And late Friday, the ACT confimired a case of the Omicron variant had been in the community. Health authorities were attempting to trace if the case was acquired in NSW as the individual had not been overseas. Amid concerns that Omicron could be spreading, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation determined that Australians will still have to wait six months after their second Covid vaccine dose to receive their booster. Australia’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said there was little evidence that bringing forward the booster shot would provide a greater level of protection against the new Omicron variant. “Is (Omicron) more severe? We don’t know yet. But at the moment, there is the evidence that it’s mild or the same,” he said. “I would stress that it’s very early days. It is only in the last few weeks this has been circulating in South Africa and elsewhere, and there is that delay from cases to hospitalisations and deaths.” Kelly added that even the hospitalisation numbers from patients with the Omicron variant being recorded in southern African countries was “not any more severe than previous”. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said “it is too early to draw a final conclusion”. Hunt said that while “it may be more transmissible … vaccines are likely, still, to have good protection”. There have been 10 confirmed cases of Omicron in Australia – nine in NSW and a 10th detected in the Northern Territory. Also on Friday, the Northern Territory recorded its first death from Covid-19, as police start an investigation into the border breach that ignited the current outbreak. The unvaccinated woman in her 70s from the Binjari Aboriginal community died about 11.30pm on Thursday in Royal Darwin hospital. “This is a very hard day,” the chief minister, Michel Gunner, said. “This is the news we never wanted to give. “While we are the last place in Australia to have one of our own succumb to Covid, it is very unlikely to be the last time we have to deliver such news.” • Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gunner said the woman was admitted to hospital on 20 November and had underlying health issues. There are 60 cases in the territory’s current outbreak. The majority are Indigenous Territorians. The fatality comes a day after the virus was detected in another remote community, with a 45-year-old man diagnosed in Lajamanu, 900km north-west of Alice Springs, near the Western Australia border. The outbreak started when an infected woman illegally entered the NT in late October. The 21-year-old lied on her border entry form before travelling from Cairns to Darwin after visiting Victoria, where she contracted the virus. She infected a man in Darwin before the virus spread to Katherine, then the Aboriginal communities of Robinson River (1,000km south-east of Darwin), Binjari and Lajamanu. Globally, more than 400 Omicron cases have been identified in 30 countries."

          "headline": "Australia’s 5G rollout: concern over ‘large disparity’ between cities and regions",
          "bodyText": "Australia’s three mobile network operators have made “significant investments” in infrastructure but the 5G rollout is focused on cities rather than regions, a new report has found. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has for the first time released a Mobile Infrastructure Report, which provides analysis on the change in Telstra, Singtel Optus and TPG Telecom coverage from 2018 to 2021. Anna Brakey, a commissioner at the ACCC, said one of the report’s main findings was that the rollout of 5G networks was occurring in cities first, while the focus in regional Australia remains updating 3G to 4G. Andrew Williams, the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network’s acting chief executive, said: “While we understand that there are financial reasons for their focus on the cities, it is still concerning to see the large disparity between new sites rolled out into major cities and those being built in regional and remote Australia. “We know there are still many communities in regional, rural and remote Australia who don’t have access to reliable mobile phone coverage.” Assoc Prof Mark Gregory of RMIT said the report itself was “positive” for regional communities because it is the first time such data has been available. “The data will support informed government policy and regulations,” he said. Gregory published a study this year that found that concrete data, rather than anecdotal evidence, was needed for regional Australia to get better mobile performance. The impetus behind releasing the data was to provide more transparency and accountability over operators’ investment in infrastructure, “particularly in regional Australia”, the ACCC report said. Brakey said: “We know many consumers in regional areas find it difficult to check what coverage is available in their area. Our own analysis shows that assessing geographic coverage with the network operators’ maps is difficult.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The ACCC’s commitment comes after Julian Leeser this year introduced a private member’s bill calling for greater accountability among telcos. The Australian Communications Consumer Action Network has also called for telecommunications to be recognised as an essential service. Both Leeser and Accan have underlined that regional communities are the worst affected. Brakey said the report meant consumers could see where networks have mobile infrastructure in place, which could translate into coverage maps. The report predicted the data could have implications for “specific geographic areas”, providing more transparency on how operators’ mobile infrastructure and coverage have changed over time, and more accountability over investment claims by operators in different locations. “It is really important that the ACCC has this additional information so that consumers can easily compare providers and the coverage experience they can expect,” Williams said. “Coverage maps from mobile providers can be difficult for people to understand as they focus on ‘predicted coverage’. Because different telcos use different assumptions when predicting whether you’ll have mobile coverage in your area, this has made it really hard to compare providers’ coverage claims.” Williams said the ACCC’s continued reporting on this data would help ensure consistency in the standard of coverage maps that the telcos provide in the future. Gregory believes of greatest relevance for regional and remote Australia is that the report provides the locations of the mobile infrastructure which will help with identifying black spots. “Third parties will be able to build a better understanding of what’s out there, and possibly they might even be able to use different predictive modelling to get a better understanding of where the coverage really is. It’s a great start.” Brakey said the ACCC expected the data would improve over time to become more consistent. Williams said: “Future versions of the report will play an important role in helping to track particular data about mobile networks, such as the future shutdown of the 3G network. This is of particular interest to people in regional areas.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

And energy debt in Australia is on the rise, as are spiders, mozzies, mice and mould. Labor is poised to unveil a new medium-term emissions reduction target and a suite of policy measures – including significant investments in new energy economy jobs – provided the package is given the green light by the shadow cabinet on Friday morning. Guardian Australia understands the shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has prepared options in a range between 35% and 45% for a new 2030 emissions reduction target, depending on the underpinning mechanisms and policy measures the shadow cabinet is prepared to adopt. Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin are to hold talks “in the near future” after their top diplomats made no apparent progress in Stockholm towards defusing a standoff over Ukraine, amid fears of a Russian invasion. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov opted not to make a joint appearance after trading threats during a 40-minute meeting whose short duration indicated there was little chance of a breakthrough. The US has threatened to deploy “high-impact economic measures” if a Russian buildup of an estimated 100,000 troops leads to a larger conflict with Ukraine. Moscow has said it feels threatened by Nato’s close relationship with Kyiv. A sharp rise in energy debt has prompted calls for intervention as Australian households struggle to keep the lights on. Despite falling energy prices more households are struggling to pay their bills, prompting increasing calls for the government to step in and help. Both the Australian Energy Regulator and the social services group Acoss are calling for an overhaul in how the debt is handled after a report from AER revealed there are 248,520 households across Australia struggling to pay.

Australia Natalie Baini, the former Liberal who will run as an independent in the Sydney seat of Reid, has blasted the culture of her former party, claiming her political career was thwarted after she raised concerns about the alleged conduct of a married Coalition minister she had been in a relationship with. The member for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, is facing questions about claims he made in his local newspaper that he had been successful in getting the Coalition to “upgrade” its 2030 emissions reduction target. Sharma rebuffed criticism from independent candidate Allegra Spender’s campaign that he had been ineffective in changing the Coalition’s climate policy. Underfunding of environmental initiatives by the Victorian government is pushing plants and animals across the state towards extinction, a state parliamentary inquiry has found.

Recommended reads In his latest novel, the award-winning crime novelist Garry Disher interrogates the cultural landscapes of power and misogyny within the coastal town of Swanage, a fictional locale nestled among the familiar back beaches of Dromana in Victoria. Contemporary attitudes towards male violence are pitted against the stereotypes of a small-town old boys’ club in this thought-provoking story that is complex and subtly woke. “There is a subtle sadness at the heart of The Way it Is Now – a suggestion that our stubborn inability to change is doing untold damage,” writes Bec Kavanagh. “Disher is, as always, a deft and compelling crime novelist, and he has crafted a provocative whodunnit that is grounded firmly in the current moment.” After 2020’s first lockdown, people bounced back. There was a buzz to getting back out again and reconnecting with people, a release of pent-up energy, and the commitment to beat the virus back and get to Covid zero. “Now … people are hollow-eyed, wrecked, a shell,” writes Brigid Delaney. “The fatigue is animal. Omicron, whatever – just run me over with a tractor.” We need a special type of rest, Delaney says.

          "headline": "Malcolm Molyneux obituary",
          "bodyText": "When Malcolm Molyneux, who has died aged 77, went to the Queen Elizabeth Central hospital in Blantyre as a consultant in 1974, he developed a keen sense of some of Malawi’s major health problems and the research needed to address them. None was more pressing than malaria, which at the time killed about 1 million people every year, mostly children in Africa. A decade later he moved on to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine at the University of Liverpool. With an American colleague, Dr Terrie Taylor, he raised funds from the Wellcome Trust and US National Institutes of Health to open a research ward adjacent to the children’s department in Blantyre, and began studying malaria there in 1990. Some of his earliest work was on cerebral malaria, the mysterious and often fatal coma that affects children infected with the malaria parasite. Malcolm identified factors associated with severe disease and developed a new score to assess severity. The Blantyre Coma score, as it became known, is still in use today; the original publication has been widely cited in later research papers. With a better definition of what cerebral malaria was, it became possible to investigate its cause and develop treatments. As the Malawi research programme grew, other major health problems were addressed, including chest, gastrointestinal and brain infections, as well as HIV; on a typical ward round in the late 1990s it seemed that every child was accompanied by a grandparent because the virus had wiped out a whole generation of parents. In the local language, Chichewa, Malcolm would always comfort, even if he could not cure. He played a critical role in the formation of the College of Medicine at the University of Malawi in 1991, by ensuring that research was considered a key element within it. In 1994 a formal research partnership was established between Liverpool and the College of Medicine, and Malcolm soon returned to Malawi to lead what ultimately became the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust (MLW) programme. In all he spent 30 years in Malawi. While his research focused on improving immediate patient care, he supported many others in their attempts to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease in order to arrive at new therapies, and encouraged the development of talented young clinicians and scientists. In addition to helping Malawian scientists, he supported young investigators from the UK and other high-income countries. He insisted that those with medical backgrounds should help with the clinical workload, as well as pursuing their research interests. Twice a year he returned to Liverpool to teach. His combination of laconic humour and natural story telling made him a memorable, if unconventional, lecturer. He would often abandon his slides and perch on a desk, arms folded, to chat informally about the subject. By the time he retired as director of MLW in 2007 there were more than 400 people working there, including both local and foreign clinicians and scientists. He continued living in Malawi until 2015, supporting and mentoring informally, and displaying limitless enthusiasm. Malcolm had himself started life in Africa. Born in the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), he was the son of missionary parents, Joyce (nee Gammon) and Colin Molyneux, and went to the Sakeji Mission school in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). After gaining a natural sciences and then a medical degree (1967) at Cambridge University, he completed his postgraduate clinical training in London. There he met Elizabeth Neech, and they married in 1969. As a medical student he had briefly visited Malawi, and after five years working in London returned there with Liz and their young family. Initially the couple worked as medical missionaries in a remote hospital. Although his faith remained important to him, Malcolm did not foist it on others. Liz went on to become professor of paediatrics at the College of Medicine, and in 2006 they were both appointed OBE. Malcolm edited several medical journals, and advised the Malawian government and World Health Organisation. In retirement he remained as active as ever, cycling from Land’s End to John O’Groats, with a climb of Ben Nevis along the way, a challenge taken up by others as The Length and Height of Britain; he then cycled to the island’s most northwest, western and eastern points. These ventures, which he managed despite having chronic leukaemia, raised thousands of pounds for the hospital in Malawi and other charities. He is survived by Liz, a daughter, three sons and 11 grandchildren. • Malcolm Edward Molyneux, medical researcher and director, born 20 November 1943; died 16 November 2021"

          "bodyText": "Military personnel have arrived in Aberdeenshire to assist with welfare checks on remote communities still affected by Storm Arwen, as Downing Street confirmed that across the UK about 19,500 homes remained without power six days after high winds caused damage and disruption. About 120 personnel will be deployed to 12 locations across Aberdeenshire, going door to door in communities that have lost power and water. Aberdeenshire council said that following a formal approach to the UK government, military personnel would be supporting “ongoing resilience efforts in the aftermath of Storm Arwen”. The deployment comes comes as wintry showers fell across the north and east of the UK, with more snow expected to hit Scotland on Friday before moving across towards the south-east. These snow flurries have added to the painstaking task of repairing overhead cables snapped by falling trees and branches. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks confirmed on Thursday that there were 3,100 homes without power in Aberdeenshire, Moray, Angus and Perthshire and that it was hoping to restore power to 1,500 homes by the end of the day. The power company has described the storm damage as a “once in a generation event”. For low voltage areas, including individual homes and groups of properties, the company said “extensive damage” had taken place, and it was hoping to restore power to homes by Friday. There are still pockets of disconnection in the Scottish Borders, where the council leader, Mark Rowley, said there had been a lack of communication from the power firm. In the north of England, about 11,000 Northern Powergrid and “fewer than 3,000” Electricity North West customers, mostly in Cumbria, are still without power, where residents have criticised both companies for “woeful” communications. The prime minister’s official spokesperson said on Thursday that a further 7,949 homes had had power restored since Wednesday – meaning 98% of the 950,000 homes originally affected now had electricity – and that he expected most homes to have power restored by the end of the week. “We are in hourly contact with network operators to reconnect power,” the spokesperson said. “We are working urgently to ensure welfare and shelter is provided to those households that need it.” On Wednesday afternoon, Scotland’s deputy first minister, John Swinney, confirmed the Bellwin scheme, which gives local councils financial support from the Scottish government to deal with emergency incidents, had been activated."

          "bodyText": "Western Australia is pitching itself to travellers as the “safest place” in the world from the Covid-19 pandemic, in a move that has frustrated expats stuck outside the state’s controlled border arrangements. Premier Mark McGowan said that WA’s position on controlling its border had been “vindicated … on health, social and economic grounds, over and over again”. He cited the emergence of the Omicron variant, which prompted the federal government to reintroduce quarantine for some international travellers, as further vindication of his closed border strategy. McGowan unveiled the $185m transition plan to reopen WA to the world at a state address on Wednesday. He said WA was now in the position to market itself internationally as the safest place from the Covid-19 pandemic. “The virtue of our careful and cautious approach, means Western Australia now has a new brand – of safety, stability and strength, and we will use that brand to market ourselves to the world,” he said. It follows the launch of a Christmas-themed local tourism campaign earlier this month, where tourism minister David Templeman rode a segway in a Christmas jumper and shook hands with a skydiving Santa as part of a push to encourage West Australians to book or buy vouchers for local tourism experiences to support the struggling industry. The premier has yet to give a date for opening the borders with other states in Australia or allowing international travel, saying that WA will be in a position to ease its border controls “in around a couple of months’ time” when the double dose vaccination rate hits 90%. That is tipped to be late January or early February. The transition plan makes allowances for borders opening up later than anticipated, but not earlier. Should an outbreak occur before the 90% target is reached, it says, WA would aim to eliminate the virus through lockdowns and other measures before opening up. At the moment, 76.2% of people aged 12 and over in the state have received two doses of a Covid vaccine. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The WA border is currently open to travellers from Queensland and Tasmania. People from South Australia and the Northern Territory are allowed to travel if they show their vaccine certificate and undergo 14 days self-quarantine, and approved people from NSW and the ACT – such as officials or those travelling on compassionate grounds – can enter the state if they are fully vaccinated and do 14-days self-quarantine. Victorians are not even allowed into WA on compassionate grounds. The state is classified as an extreme risk, meaning the only people allowed to travel are fully vaccinated MPs, diplomats, government officials or a limited list of specialists, and even they must show a negative PCR test within 72 hours of travel and undergo 14 days of hotel quarantine at their own expense. Once the 90% target is reached, the borders will only be open to vaccinated travellers who have completed a negative PCR test within 72 hours before travelling, and been tested again on arrival in the state. McGowan’s announcement of the transition plan was met by a mix of support from resident West Australians and frustration from those who are trying to return home. McGowan’s transition plan included a specific pitch to international investors. “If you’re in business, don’t you want to invest in the state that sensibly managed the pandemic and kept the economy operating?” he said. “If you’re a tourist, don’t you want to come to the safest destination, with a vaccination rate over 90% and the lowest levels of restrictions on venues and experiences? “If you’re the parent of a student, don’t you want them to study in a jurisdiction that’s safe and your child is less likely to catch a potentially deadly virus?” One rural healthcare worker told Guardian Australia they were concerned that WA was putting more effort into marketing itself to tourists and business than it was to shoring up regional hospitals against the inevitable arrival of Covid once the borders open up. The vaccine rate in regional areas, particularly in the Pilbara, is lagging behind Perth and the more densely populated and affluent south-west. Visitors are currently banned from most remote Aboriginal communities in WA due to low vaccine rates. McGowan said the government would roll out targeted vaccination campaigns to increase uptake in regional areas. A pop-up clinic will be held in Kalgoorlie this week, as well as pop-up clinics at supermarkets across Perth and regional areas."

          "headline": "‘The fear of this vaccine is real’: how Papua New Guinea’s Covid strategy went so wrong",
          "bodyText": "In mid-October Dr Clement Malau, a Harvard-educated public health specialist and former secretary of the Papua New Guinea health department, was alarmed to discover he had gone viral. Only he hadn’t. Someone had posted a 20-minute audio clip as a “speech from Dr Clement Malau regarding the vaccine”, the orator sliding between English and Tok Pisin – PNG Pidgin – to deliver an eloquent, tub-thumping rant against Covid-19. By the time Malau was alerted, the clip was super-spreading across Facebook and WhatsApp groups, propelled by high-profile PNG figures. It’s still there, feeding into anti-Covid and anti-vaccine zealotry. Access to social media remains relatively low in PNG – Pacific communications expert Dr Amanda Watson says there are only around 600,000 smartphones in circulation in a population of nearly 9 million, and most households aren’t online. But the online maelstrom is quickly broadcast into communities via the “coconut wireless”, or word of mouth. It fuels the distrust underwriting the nation’s disastrously low vaccination rate, with less than 4% of the adult population fully vaccinated despite the availability of jabs in all provinces. Meanwhile, a third wave of the pandemic overwhelms hospitals and overflows morgues. Malau tracked his impersonator, forwarding details to authorities. “And they have done nothing.” So he’s using Facebook to try to counteract the lies “all by myself”. He has acquired nearly 5,000 followers, many desperate for reliable information which they will, in turn, share with their wantoks (communities). With respect, empathy and lots of “God Bless PNG!”, he goes toe-to-toe with the angry and the fearful. Malau understands the landscape and the stakes all too well. He was director of PNG’s National Aids Council in the 1990s when many of his compatriots didn’t believe in HIV. His team had to devise clear, simple messaging that would resonate across a diverse nation of 800 languages and low literacy. While he encourages Covid-19 vaccination, and posed for cameras in Port Moresby when he got his first jab in May, Malau argues that jabs alone won’t cut it in PNG. “If we do not understand our own setting, we will be bulldozed down the track of just vaccine alone.” ‘Not a rational issue’ Echoing other medical and social science specialists who know PNG, Malau sees crippling failures in the messaging and strategy of the nation’s pandemic response. Confusion and distrust from the earliest days spiralled out of Australia’s shifts on AstraZeneca, which Papua New Guineans were told they must take even as younger Australians were told it wasn’t safe. The continuing failure to tailor pandemic campaigns to local conditions risked “a disaster if we don’t manage it properly”. Some say it’s already disastrous. The obstetrician Prof Glen Mola has spent 50 years in PNG trying to claw back staggeringly high maternal mortality rates, only to see them blow out five-fold at Port Moresby general hospital as the virus has struck pregnant women. The first casualty was just 18 years old, the latest 27. “I’ve never had to watch people die because they are just too exhausted to take the next breath.” PNG’s official pandemic death toll is 546, but a lack of data and testing means the true casualties are unclear. At Port Moresby hospital there were 40 or 50 Covid deaths a day in early November, dropping lately to around 10, but Mola wonders if people are not presenting “because the perception might be that if you go, you die”. Even as families mourn mounting casualties in their Facebook posts, “with all the vaccine phobia and people who have provoked this fear of vaccination … it’s getting worse”, Mola says. At home in the evenings, he hears anti-vaccine proselytisers spread the word across the surrounding settlements on loudspeakers. “The fear of this vaccine is real,” says Dr Fiona Hukula, a Port Moresby-based anthropologist with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. In Madang, on the other side of the country, the Divine Word University president, anthropologist and Catholic priest Dr Philip Gibbs has had countless conversations with staff and students trying to persuade them to get jabbed. “It’s an emotional issue, not a rational issue,” he says. “I got the impression that students here are more afraid of the vaccine than they are of catching the virus.” In the absence of clear, strategic information, dangerous rumours ignite. As cases surged and the highlands town of Goroka suffered a spike in deaths in October, high-profile locals were among those who lined up for their first jabs. But before immunity could kick in, several got Covid and died, Mola says. “And so then the deaths are blamed on the vaccine.” Social media has supercharged fears, but Hukula argues that it has been made worse by the absence of good, locally attuned information. “From the very beginning of the pandemic … we didn’t have a clear communications strategy.” The importance of the familiar Back in April 2020, as PNG recorded its second confirmed case of coronavirus, Hukula, Gibbs and their Australian colleague Dr Miranda Forsyth co-wrote an appeal to national and international health authorities to ensure that they recognised local contexts – social and cultural as well as practical considerations like access to soap and water and the feasibility of social distancing – in crafting pandemic messaging for the people of PNG. They warned: “The government and society at large needs to act fast to prevent the spread of fear that is a catalyst for violence and social unrest.” In PNG, “education/messaging about causes of sickness and death based on science alone are not sufficient to quell doubts about the root cause of harm and why it occurs and impacts some people and not others”. They also insisted that all information be translated not only into widely spoken Tok Pisin and Motu, but where possible into local vernacular. But 18 months on, other than a multilingual pamphlet written by Mola, which he’s lobbying authorities to circulate, there’s little evidence that has happened. “They’ve hardly put out any messages in Tok Pisin,” says Paul Barker, the director of the PNG thinktank the Institute of National Affairs. “They’ve got an army of Australian high-powered consultants around the Covid centre [in Port Moresby], but they’re not knowing how to communicate.” Other key planks of the response are similarly far short of the mark. Centralised vaccine hubs where people wait many hours “are not practical for people – for elderly, for mums with babies, the disabled”, Hukula says. Fearful people want the reassurance of familiar health workers from their local clinics. “They should have gone out to the markets, to explain to people clearly that this is a vaccine that’s going to help.” The Guardian sought comment from the department of health but received no response. Conspiracy theories and religion The lessons of local responses to epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis and, in 2018, the colossal operation to extinguish a potentially devastating polio outbreak – blamed on the breakdown of the health system and eroding childhood vaccination rates – are grounded in awareness campaigns enlisting trusted figures and targeting community leaders, in sending health workers and specialists deep into urban and rural communities to deliver programs. Hukula and her colleagues also drew insight and warnings from their years investigating attacks against individuals accused of sorcery and witchcraft, which have risen in some parts of PNG. There’s an enduring belief that bad magic, rather than disease or misadventure, is to blame for an untimely death. This has become entwined with Christian evangelical and Pentecostal beliefs. It was inevitable that coronavirus would be caught in that web. “In a society where we have those very firm beliefs, that misfortune can happen because of the supernatural, this just feeds really well into this whole [religious] narrative,” Hukula says, referring to widespread conspiracies that the vaccine causes infertility and death. Fear and faith dominate PNG Facebook discussions around Covid-19, according to a recent report by ABC International Development, analysing more than 100,000 posts and comments logged on popular public news pages in the six months to 30 September. Lately the conversation is preoccupied with false claims of long-term, debilitating side-effects from the jabs. “That fear is driving the vaccine hesitancy in a big way,” says research leader Vipul Khosla. In terms of faith, a strong thread of posts reflects what Barker hears from colleagues in his office who say they don’t need the vaccine because “Jesus Christ is my saviour”. But he and other experts caution that the influence of extremist social media posts can easily be exaggerated. An analysis of Covid commentary on one popular, public Western Province page on Facebook by two University of Melbourne anthropologists with decades of experience in PNG, Dr Monica Minnegal and Dr Peter Dwyer, found people were engaging with the material critically and selectively. “Most participants did not take either religious tropes or conspiracy theories as primary sources of comfort or explanation.” The forum had played a positive role in the health emergency, they said, arguing that better, cheaper internet access for people in remote regions would enhance the spread of crucial information and engagement with health programs. Lately the researchers have become concerned by the tenor of responses to “no jab, no job” policies and perceived mandates for vaccinations. Dwyer says: “They feel their autonomy is being assaulted, and they are much more concerned by that [than] they are by vaccination.” This is cultural, not a question of “silly beliefs”, says Minnegal. “It’s too easy to say social media is spreading misinformation. This is about a social movement.” The argument that social media has untapped useful potential is echoed by Watson, who says even townspeople with internet access struggle to find credible information. Meanwhile, they’re relied on to convey news to family and friends. “The vast majority of people live in rural villages where they don’t receive daily newspapers. In many places they don’t even have radio signal.” One theme in the ABC analysis is “a lot of discussion on the role churches should play in advocating for vaccine uptake”, says Dr Prashanth Pillay, who co-wrote the report. People are questioning whether they should be involved in the Covid discussion at all. “There’s the idea that the church is the place for biblical teachings, and it should not veer from that.” This plays out as the mainstream churches dial up their vaccine advocacy, with the Catholic cardinal Sir John Ribat declaring he put his trust in God and got vaccinated. For some this was comforting, says Gibbs, but others “say that vaccines are a sort of weakness, because it means that you don’t trust that God is going to protect you”. Martyn Namarong, a political activist and writer, has just spent weeks at the bedside of his mother in Port Moresby general hospital, where she’s being treated for Covid-19. The Christian apocalyptic views swirling around Covid are nothing new, Namarong says. Vaccine advocates need to tone down the noise rather than shout louder. “When it comes to people’s religious views, you cannot change them. It’s like telling PNG Christians that Buddhism might be a good idea – it’s not going to happen.” Covid campaigners “need to try to actually engage more … see us as human beings and friends as opposed to opponents on a particular issue”. And they must recognise the daily struggles of life in PNG. “Most people live a very cyclical existence. The view of time is you just wake up in the morning, you go to sleep, and the next day you wake up, everything’s new again. It’s about survival.” Like Malau, Namarong urges more regard for variables people can control – good diet, air quality. “So you’re not seen as just ‘vaccine, vaccine’. You are seen to address a public health issue as opposed to pushing out the vaccine agenda … Let’s co-opt some of the message from the people who have reservations.” Namarong says his mother is recovering. But describing what he’s observing in the hospital, and in the capital, he says: “It’s scary. That’s the word I would use. We can see the system is trying to adjust to cope, but it is just at the edge … one spike and everything collapses.”"

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has not denied that parties were held in Downing Street last winter despite the lockdown at the time, saying only that no Covid rules were broken. But Johnson has denied a report that his flagship pledge to build 40 new hospitals has been labelled as unachievable by an official watchdog - even though the health department has confirmed this is the case. Experts advising the government called last week for “early and robust actions” to limit the transmission of the Omicron Covid variant, minutes reveal. Jeremy Hunt, the former Tory health secretary, and Labour launched stinging attacks on the government as it unveiled long-awaited social care reform plans lacking significant new funding to resolve the current crisis. UK ministers should face charges of “misconduct in public office” over their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, an unofficial inquiry has said. Bosses of pubs, restaurants and hotels across the UK are warning they are already receiving cancellations of bookings for Christmas parties and events amid fears about the Omicron variant, just as hospitality businesses were hoping to welcome many customers during the crucial festive season. A doctor who was one of the first people in the world to become infected with the Omicron variant says he believes he caught the virus when he was in London for a major medical conference attended by more than 1,200 health professionals. People should not assume that Covid will evolve to become a milder disease, the senior epidemioligist Prof Neil Ferguson has warned, adding that the threat posed by the Omicron coronavirus variant will not be clear until the end of December. Heathrow has reopened a terminal dedicated to processing passengers flying into London from countries on the UK’s Covid red list. The parliamentary commissioner for standards has begun a formal investigation into Jacob Rees-Mogg after a complaint from Labour that he failed to declare that he received £6m in cheap loans from one of his companies. A man has been detained by armed police after breaching security to enter the grounds of the Houses of Parliament. David Lammy, the new shadow foreign secretary, has criticised Liz Truss for posing for a photograph on a tank while on a visit to Estonia yesterday. In an interview with Radio 4’s PM programme, he said: As I come into this brief, real concerns with Ukraine, Belarus, issues with China, Iran, I’ve got to say the photo ops are not where this is. So I was surprised to see Liz Truss attempting her best impression of Margaret Thatcher. I just think these are very serious times and one’s got to approach the job very seriously. That got the comment it did for very obvious reasons; that she took her time out, frankly, to evoke an image that seemed more to do with appealing to a small section of the Conservative party and not really the country. Lammy was referring to Truss’s ill-disguised leadership ambitions. According to the latest ConservativeHome survey of party members, Truss is rated more highly than any of her cabinet colleagues by Tory members, and she has held the top slot in this regular survey now for a year. Here is the Truss image from yesterday. And here is the iconic Thatcher picture that Truss seemed to be referencing. The BBC has spoken to someone who attended the party at Downing Street on 18 December reported by the Daily Mirror this morning. (See 9.30am.) According to the BBC, the source said “several dozen” people were there, food and drink were laid on, people played party games and the event went on until past midnight. Maroš Šefčovič, one of the European Commission vice-presidents, has told members of Northern Ireland’s legislative assembly (MLAs) that the UK should “reciprocate” the efforts made by the EU to compromise in the talks on the Northern Ireland protocol. Giving evidence to the assembly’s executive committee, Šefčovič said: Our proposal will deliver significant changes, they amount to a new model for the implementation of the protocol and can deliver a real difference for all people and businesses in Northern Ireland. We made an important move towards the UK with far-reaching proposals for solutions, we need the UK government to reciprocate this now, we have no time to lose, and what is most pressing is the need to ensure continued supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Commenting on the latest Omicron variant figures (see 3.38pm), Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has said he expects cases to go up. As I’ve said recently, we do expect cases to go up .... Our strategy is all about buying time, buying time so that we can assess it, but also [so] that we can build our defences and we’ve been really clear in the last few days, I think, that the best way to continue to defend ourselves is through our fantastic vaccine programme. These are from Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, the Labour thinktank, on the social care white paper. The latest edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast is out. As the PM contradicts his own scientists, Jessica Elgot and Gaby Hinsliff discuss the government’s response to the new Covid-19 Omicron variant. Plus: is Keir Starmer’s new shadow cabinet an election-winning Labour team? Starmer’s former director of communications Ben Nunn gives us his take in an exclusive first interview since he resigned last summer. The government wants schools in England to remain open right up until the end of term and has rejected union proposals for early closure before Christmas to act as a Covid circuit-breaker. Will Quince, minister for children and families, told MPs on the Commons education committee that individual schools and directors of public health would be monitoring the situation locally, but said the government plan was for schools to remain open. The NASUWT teachers’ union in Northern Ireland has suggested that schools close early in the run-up to the Christmas holidays because of a spiralling teacher shortage due to sickness and Covid-related absence. The committee heard that some schools in England have also been forced to send children home to study online because of staff absence. Quince insisted however: “The position of the government is we want all education settings open.” He also defended the introduction of masks in communal areas in schools as a precaution, after MPs questioned the efficacy of face coverings in school settings, their impact on education, and the fact that children were being asked to wear masks when office workers were not. Quince was also asked about school nativity plays which appear to have become central to backbench concerns about children enjoying a full school experience, and said any cancellations were “deeply regrettable”. He said: Unfortunately as MPs we very rarely get to go to our children’s but often get to see them online, but they are wonderful, wonderful things. But there will be some areas where there is a higher prevalence of transmission. The directors of public health guidance will say, ‘Look, actually, big gatherings probably isn’t the right thing to do.’ Or, ‘If you’ve got parents coming into school to watch a play, wearing a mask might be a sensible precautionary measure.’ So I think, ultimately, on balance, it comes down to trusting schools and headteachers and directors of public health. Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative chair of the Commons health committee, has described the white paper on adult social care published today (see 1.33pm) as a “disappointment”. In a statement issued on behalf of the committee, which is cross-party, but with a government majority, he says: This is a disappointment given the extent of the crisis in social care and the predicament of people whose quality of life is dependent on a solution being found. Providing an additional £1.7bn in funding over three years falls far short of the annual £7bn sum that our evidence found would be necessary to fix social care. The white paper states that it provides an ‘ambitious 10-year vision’, but it doesn’t acknowledge the scale of extra resource needed to realise that vision, based on the crisis the sector faces right now. The government deserves credit for grasping the nettle of social care reform, and no one can argue with the laudable aims of providing choice, quality and fair access. However, these plans represent three steps forward and two steps back. Though there is progress with a cap on care costs, it could have gone further. Failures in social care will continue to put pressure on our overstretched hospitals with patients who cannot be safely discharged exacerbating the winter crisis and thousands of people will not get the care they need because the carers do not exist. Organisations linked to employers, workers and users in the care sector have welcomed particular aspects of the white paper, and there is praise for the government for at least addressing the issue. But overall many of the comments released about the white paper echo what Hunt said about the contents being disappointing overall. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the white paper did not address the key problems. She said: Britain needs high-quality care and high-quality employment for those providing it. But the biggest problem for both care users and the burnt-out workforce is the staffing crisis caused by a generation of underfunding, fragmentation and privatisation. A credible plan for social care must transform the pay and conditions of the workforce. But the white paper fails to do that. And it has no answers for care workers who want to know when they will get a secure contract and a living wage. Helen Walker, the chief executive of Carers UK, said: We welcome the announcements of £25m to work with the sector to improve services to support unpaid carers, the £30m to help local areas innovate services, and £150m to drive adoption of technology across the sector. These all have potential to improve the experiences of unpaid carers. The proposals to encourage digital technology, improve data collection and sharing of data could all make carers’ lives easier. However, many unpaid carers tell us they are at breaking point, exhausted and on their knees after more than 18 months caring with little or no outside support right now. Seventy-two percent have not had a break at all from caring since the start of the pandemic. We are concerned that there is no substantial funding to enable carers to take the breaks they desperately need. Sally Warren, the director of policy at the King’s Fund, a health thinktank, said: The overall vision in the white paper is the right one and if delivered could significantly improve the experience of people receiving care and those who work in the sector. However, the steps outlined don’t go fast or far enough to achieve this vision and the funding allocated to deliver it is insufficient. In particular, although there are some welcome commitments on training and skills for staff, there is little to tackle poor workforce pay and conditions and high vacancy levels in the sector. Martin Tett, adult social care spokesperson for the County Councils Network, said: Proposals to digitalise social care, a greater emphasis on supported housing, policies on workforce recruitment, and a person-centred care service are what the County Councils Network has called for. However, while CCN supports many of today’s proposals, we remain concerned that the amount of funding committed so far falls short of the ambitions laid out. And Rachel Harrison, national officer at the GMB union, said: This is like groundhog day. Care workers have been waiting for the government’s plan for years – since before the last election. Now they’re being told they have to wait even longer for any substantial reforms. You don’t have to be Einstein to realise addressing pay for carers is the absolute number one priority to tackle the catastrophic understaffing crisis – a crisis which will only get worse. The Metropolitan police have issued this statement about the intruder at the Palace of Westminster earlier. (See 3.08pm.) The UK Health Security Agency says a further nine cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed in England. That takes the total to 22. And in Scotland one further case has been confirmed, taking the Scottish total to 10. UKHSA says: The individuals that have tested positive and their contacts are all isolating. Work is under way to identify any links to travel to southern Africa. We have now identified cases in the east Midlands, east of England, London, south-east and north-west. UKHSA is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to be infectious. Here is the list of local authority areas in England where the cases have been identified Barnet – 2 Bexley – 1 Brentwood – 1 Buckinghamshire – 1 Camden – 2 Haringey – 1 Lancaster – 1 Lewisham – 2 Liverpool – 1 Newham - 1 North Norfolk – 1 Nottingham – 1 South Cambridgeshire – 1 Sutton – 1 Three Rivers – 1 Wandsworth – 1 Westminster - 3 As reported earlier, at the post-PMQs lobby briefing the PM’s press secretary failed to deny that parties were held in Downing Street last Christmas. (See 2.35pm.) Adam Bienkov from Byline Times has the exchanges in their glory, for anyone interested in how these briefings actually function. Armed police have apprehended someone trying to get into the parliamentary estate without permission, the Times’ Matt Dathan reports. The journalist Alex Taylor has more on Le Canard enchaîné’s article about the Johnson/Macron relationship (see 2.40pm), with a helpful tip for anyone looking to improve their mastery of French vernacular insults. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, has promised to do everything possible to restore power to homes affected by Storm Arwen before Christmas, PA Media reports. PA says: Five days after what Kwarteng said was a storm unlike any other in 60 years, 30,000 homes are still without electricity. Speaking in the Commons he said weather events like Arwen could become more frequent due to climate change. On Friday night, winds reached almost 100mph in parts of northern England and Scotland, power lines were ripped down, tens of thousands of trees were uprooted and roads were blocked by debris. On Wednesday, thousands of people in County Durham remained without power and Conservative MP Richard Holden said a rural surgery in his North West Durham constituency had lost 10,000 worth of flu vaccines when its fridges cut out. Holden said some living in remote communities have been warned it could be a “very long time” before their electricity supply is fully restored. Kwarteng replied: “Being without power until Christmas is simply unacceptable, I’ll say that publicly, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure that that doesn’t happen. Clearly, Storm Arwen was an event the likes of which we haven’t seen for certainly 60 years since the record starts. “We have to be prepared for similarly extreme, difficult weather conditions in the future. We have to make sure that our system is resilient in that eventuality.” He said it was “unacceptable” that people were left waiting up to two hours to get through to a power cut emergency phone number over the weekend. Covid-related deaths in Scotland have risen slightly after a recent fall as National Records of Scotland registered 97 deaths over the week ending on Sunday 28 November, one more than the previous week. NRS, a government statistics agency, said that brought the total number of deaths in Scotland where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate to 12,127 since the pandemic began, including cases where Covid was suspected or probable. The latest increase in deaths, attributed to the more infectious Delta variant, saw weekly death data peak at 164 in late September before it plateaued at around 140 deaths per week during October. There are no known deaths in Scotland associated with the Omicron variant detected last month in South Africa. According to Le Canard enchaîné, which is often described as the French equivalent of Private Eye, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has described Boris Johnson in private as a clown. These are from the French journalist Pierre Briançon. Here are the main lines from the post-PMQs Downing Street lobby briefing. Downing Street defended its decision not to introduce pre-flight tests for UK arrivals, as proposed by Sage. (See 9.48am and 11.47am.) Asked if the government had ignored a recommendation from Sage, the PM’s spokesman said: At all times we take account of any clinical advice we receive, and then we need to make a balanced judgement on what is right. He said the government had “acted swiftly” to put new measures in place to protect against the Omicron variant of coronavirus “on a precautionary basis”. He added: “We’re confident this is the right approach. The PM’s press secretary said she did not “recognise” the account giving in the Daily Mirror of parties in Downing Street last winter. (See 9.30am.) “We don’t recognise this account, as we’ve said Covid rules have been followed at all times,” she said. But she would not say which parts of the report were inaccurate. “I’m not going to get into individual aspects of speculation,” she said. The spokesman said Boris Johnson and President Macron have a close working relationship. Asked about a comment from the former French ambassador, Sylvie Bermann, on Times Radio that relations have not been as bad since Waterloo, the spokesman said: The prime minister’s been asked about this on a number of occasions and has talked about his close relationship ... working relationship with President Macron. The spokesman said there was “nothing to suggest” children are worse affected by the Omicron variant. Asked about reports that reports from Tshwane in South Africa that children under the age of two accounted for about 10% of total hospital admissions with the variant, the spokesman said: We have seen those reports, but we have seen nothing to suggest ... there’s no hard evidence to suggest it disproportionately affects children in the way you suggest. Clearly, we will [be] monitoring all evidence very carefully. It’s important to stress that there is nothing to suggest it’s impacting on different age groups in a different way to (what) we see with other variants, and it’s also worth noting the different age profile characteristics of South Africa as well. Support for Scottish independence has hit a recent high of 55%, according to an Ipsos Mori poll for STV that contradicts a recent downturn in the yes vote. Ipsos Mori found that, counting only those certain to vote and excluding don’t know, the yes vote had a 10-point lead over no, at 45%. Most recent polls by other companies have put the no vote ahead, by between two to six points. Rather than the panels of voters polled over the internet used by most pollsters, Ipsos Mori uses telephone polling of random voters – a technique it regards as superior. It recorded a record yes vote of 58% last year (a figure not directly comparable with figures from other pollsters, because its methodology is different). Ipsos also registered the lowest satisfaction for Boris Johnson it has recorded for Scotland, putting it at 16%. With don’t knows at 4%, it found 80% of Scottish voters were dissatisfied with the prime minister’s performance. In April this year, with the Covid vaccination programme under way, Johnson had his best Ipsos rating in Scotland: 27% positive against 64% negative. The SNP vote rose by two points to 52%, but satisfaction with Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister fell, by four points to 58% (giving a net positive rating of 20 points), along with a 4.5-point fall for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. With his positive rate of 31%, Starmer had a negative net satisfaction rate of -16. Unlike a YouGov poll for the Times last week, which found only 13% of voters felt independence was a priority, eighth in its list, the Ipsos Mori survey found Scottish independence was the second most important topic, after healthcare and the NHS. Even so, its importance rating fell 13 points, to 27%, compared with April. Here is the PA Media report of the Johnson/Starmer exchanges at PMQs. Boris Johnson has denied his key hospital building programme is unachievable, as Labour revealed a “playbook” has been issued to ensure refurbishments are described as new hospitals. Keir Starmer accused Johnson at PMQs of breaking “yet another promise” on his hospital rebuilding programme. The Health Service Journal last month reported a government infrastructure watchdog has raised concerns about the lack of progress made to build 40 new hospitals by 2030. Starmer said: “The Cabinet Office and the Treasury have checked on the progress and it’s reported that they have reached a damning conclusion. They have concluded that the project needs a red flag because it is unachievable. Prime minister, is that true?” Johnson replied: “No. He plays politics and asks frivolous questions, we are getting on with the people’s priorities. We are helping to build another 40 new hospitals with an injection of £36bn of investments which that party voted against.” Starmer countered: “This is strange because the government hasn’t been denying the reports about the red flag and they haven’t done since, but now the prime minister does. There was obviously some confusion on these benches over whether the Cabinet Office and the Treasury think he is on course to break yet another promise, this time on new building of hospitals. If he is so confident in his answer, why doesn’t he publish the progress report in full and let us all see it?” Johnson maintained 40 hospitals are being built but Starmer said the PM lacked the confidence to publish the report, adding: “The more we look at this promise, the murkier it gets. I’ve got a document here sent by the Department of Health to the NHS. It’s called the ‘new hospital programme communications playbook’ - I kid you not. It offers advice to make it easier to talk about the programme. This guide instructs everybody to describe refurbishments and alterations on existing hospitals as new hospitals. We can all agree that refurbishments are a very good thing, but they’re not new hospitals. How many of the 40 are fix-up jobs on existing hospitals and how many are actually the new hospitals he promised?” Johnson replied: “You obviously don’t always go around building on greenfield sites, you rebuild hospitals and that’s what we’ve said for the last two-and-a-half years; it’s the biggest programme of hospital building this country ever undertaken.” Starmer joked: “No wonder so many Tory donors paid so much for that wallpaper last year, he probably told them he was building a new flat.” Concluding, Starmer highlighted “broken promises” from Johnson before adding: “He promised 40 new hospitals and even if you count the paint jobs, his own watchdog says he can’t deliver it. Isn’t this the truth, Mr Speaker, that any promises from this prime minister aren’t worth the manifesto paper they’re written on?” Johnson said Starmer “dribbles on irrelevantly about wallpaper and parties, playing politics”, adding: “They’re getting on with factional infighting, we are delivering for the people of this country.” Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, responded for Labour. “Is that it?”, she asked. She said the plan did not explain how the government would cut waiting lists for care, and she said it would not deliver extra care workers. Another 500,000 will be needed by the end of the decade, she said. A new website (one of the plans) would not do it, she said. She said Labour wanted a proper plan that would integrate health and social care. UPDATE: Kendall said: There are two central flaws in this government’s approach. Ministers have utterly failed to deal with the immediate pressures facing social care as we head into one of the most difficult winters on record and they have failed to set out the long-term vision and more fundamental reforms we need to deliver a care system fit for the future. Last week we learnt that a staggering 400,000 older and disabled people are now on council waiting lists for care, with 40,000 waiting more than a year. There are over 100,000 staff vacancies and turnover rates are soaring and, because of these shortages, 1.5 million hours of home care couldn’t be delivered between August and October alone, and half of all councils report care homes going bust or home care providers handing back contracts. Where was the long-term strategy to transform the pay, training, terms and conditions of care workers to deliver at least half a million additional care workers by 2030 just to meet growing demand? Gillian Keegan, the health minister, is making a statement on adult social care. She says a white paper is being published today. It is the product of years of work, she says. Social care workers deserve a system that works for them. But that has not always been the case, she says. Carers are not just underpaid, but under-appreciated. She says the government has published its plans for the health and social care levy. But there is more to do, and that is why the white paper sets out plan for the next three years. Here is an excerpt from the document summarising some of its main proposals. At least £300m to integrate housing into local health and care strategies, with a focus on increasing the range of new supported housing options available. This will provide choice of alternative housing and support options. At least £150m of additional funding to drive greater adoption of technology and achieve widespread digitisation across social care. Digital tools and technology can support independent living and improve the quality of care. At least £500m so the social care workforce have the right training and qualifications, and feel recognised and valued for their skills and commitment. We want the workforce to also have their wellbeing prioritised. A new practical support service to make minor repairs and changes in people’s homes to help people remain independent and safe in their home, alongside increasing the upper limit of the Disabilities Facilities Grant for home adaptations such as stairlifts, wet rooms and home technologies. Keir Starmer is starting to sound like an opposition leader who has finally found his target, and is concentrating his fire in the right place. Or, to adapt another violent metaphor, he has decided to keep punching the same bruise. For the third week in a row he has majored on broken promises. Two weeks ago it was broken promises to the north of England over rail. Last week it was broken promises over social care reform, and people no longer being at risk of having to sell their homes. And this week Starmer focused on the 40 new hospitals that are not new hospitals, but refurbishments that may not even happen anyway. (About time too, some might say. In a crowded field, “40 new hospitals” must be the most dishonest government boast yet.) It set Starmer up for a final question that was ideally crafted for the TV news. It’s the same old story from this prime minister, week in, week out defending the indefensible and broken promises. His mates were found to be corrupt, he tried to get them off the hook. Downing Street throws parties during lockdown, he says ‘not a problem’. He promised there’d be no tax rises, then he put up tax. He promised a rail revolution in the north, then he cancelled the trains. He promised no one would have to sell their home for care, then along came his working-class dementia tax. He promised 40 new hospitals and even if you count the paint jobs, his own watchdog says he can’t deliver it. Isn’t this the truth, Mr Speaker, that any promises from this prime minister aren’t worth the manifesto paper they’re written on? Boris Johnson has had a reputation for not delivering from the moment he entered Downing Street, but in the past the ‘broken promises’ line of attack against him by Labour has tended to bounce off. Perhaps that was because voters think all politicians break their promises. Perhaps it was because getting Brexit done inoculated him against this charge for a while. Or perhaps because people were just prepared to give him a bit more time. But now the charge is starting to stick, and it sounds like a line of argument with traction. Presumably Labour has tested it too with focus groups, and it is hard to believe Starmer would keep using it if he did not know it was having some effect. It is certainly the case that voters are starting to take a more sceptical view of Johnson than in the past. This is from the latest Ipsos MORI political pulse (pdf) out two days ago. The other interesting thing about Starmer’s strategy today was his decision to go heavily on the Daily Mirror splash. (See 9.30am.) The broadcasters seemed wary of touching this story this morning, but Starmer’s decision to pile in heavily, and - even more importantly - Johnson’s failure to deny that there was a party last December ought to give the story a leg up onto the news agenda. The government sources briefing the BBC this morning made a better effort at trying to argue that the story was untrue than Johnson did. But quite how damaging it will turn out to be remains to be seen. An on-the-record witness would be useful. Perhaps Dominic Cummings will be firing up his Substack service? Johnson managed to keep sounding confident, and Tory MPs cheered loudly, but he did not engage properly with Starmer’s questions and it was mostly bluster. His Captain Hindsight peroration is sounding ever more feeble (does even the most diehard Tory really think we would “still be in lockdown” under Labour?). And at one point Johnson said, according to PM, that Starmer “dribbles on irrelevantly about wallpaper and parties”. I heard it as “drivels on”, which it might just as well have been. But whether it was dribbles or drivels, it was quite a charge from the man who gets invited to the CBI and bangs on about Peppa Pig. Ian Byrne (Lab) asks about Hillsborough. Will the PM agree to ensure the tragedy is included in the national curriculum? Johnson says Byrne makes a powerful point. The government is committed to continuing engagement with the bereaved, he says. And he wants to ensure the lessons are not forgotten. He will ensure Byrne has a meeting with ministers so this is taken forward. Imran Hussain (Lab) says all people from BAME backgrounds are concerned that the government is coming for them, because the borders bill will make deportations easier. Johnson says that is shameful. He says Hussain should look at the make-up of the government front bench. He says the bill does not do what Hussain claims. Labour should support border controls, he says. Tom Randall (Con) asks if the government will help places like Gedling apply for money from the levelling up fund. Johnson says there will be another round of bidding next year. The government wants to help places like Gedling. Jessica Morden (Lab) says Wales has been left out for rail investment. Why should people trust the government to deliver on its promises? Johnson says Morden has failed to look at the plans in the union connectivity review. Christine Jardine (Lib Dem) asks the PM to support her clean air proposals. Johnson says the government is promoting electric cars, and he says its clean air strategy has been praised worldwide. David Jones (Con) asks if the PM is committed to ensuring Gibraltar stays British, and to keeping the European court of justice out of it. Johnson says he is committed to keeping it British, and he sees no role for the ECJ there. Colleen Fletcher (Lab) says cuts have left West Midlands police with real problems. They say they do not have the officers to investigate every crime. Johnson says the government is increasing the number of police officers. He promised an extra 20,000, and an extra 11,000 have already been recruited. He says they are more diverse too. Emma Hardy (Lab) asks why mesh-damaged women are not getting proper compensation. It is impossible to know the pain they are going through. Johnson says the Cumberlege report has been published. If there is more to do, he will look at it. Damian Collins (Con) asks if the PM agrees it is wrong that Facebook allows people smugglers to use its site. Johnson agrees. The online harms bill will allow that material to be taken down. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, says farmers are on the brink. They are about to see payments cut by 5% at least. The PM promised a new support system for farmers. But in the meantime farmers will go bankrupt. Will the PM stop cutting the old payments until the new system is in place? Johnson says he met representatives of the food and farming industry last night. He says every embassy now has an official backing food exports. Ian Blackford (SNP) says it is regrettable that MPs are having to talk again about the PM’s misconduct. Last Christmas the PM hosted a party that broke lockdown rules. He says he spoke to the Mirror newspaper, they are confirming their report [er - they would, they would not have published it otherwise], and they have legal advice saying the law may have been broken. It is one rule for him, one rule for everyone else. Johnson says Blackford should have mentioned Storm Arwen. Blackford says he did. He says Sage advice to PM called for tougher travel rules. That is what Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, advised too. Will the PM take this advice? Johnson says Blackford is “simply wrong” in what he has said about the steps taken by the government. He says this government was the first internationally to respond to Omicron. He says it put countries on the red list. He says the measures being taken are balanced and proporotionate. Andrew Rosindell (Con) says the government cannot deal with illegal migrants while still constrained by the Human Rights Act and the European convention on human rights. Johnson says the government is reviewing the human rights system. He says Labour should back the nationality and borders bill. Starmer says the new hospitals are just the latest example of Johnson not keeping a promise. Johnson accuses Starmer of drivelling on about parties and wallpaper. He says Labour are obsessed with factional infighting. He is getting on with governing. He says the government is cutting tax for low-paid families. He ends with the usual dig at Captain Hindsight. That is not true. The lowering of the universal credit taper will lead to poorer workers having higher take-home pay, but it is not a tax cut. Starmer quotes from government advice saying refurbishments should be called new hospitals. Refurbishments are a good thing, but they are not new hospitals. How many are genuinely new? Starmer seems to be referrring to this report. Johnson says you do not build on greenfield sites. Starmer challenges the PM to publish the report saying the building programme has been flagged as red. Johnson says there is record investment going into the NHS. Starmer points out that Johnson has not denied that there was a party. But he says no rules were broken. Both of those things cannot be true. Both of those things cannot be true. He says Tory MPs are not obeying the rules. As usual, it is one rule for them, one rule for us. He says a Treasury analysis says the PM’s plan for 40 new hospitals is unachievable. Is that right? No, claims Johnson. He claims he is helping to build another 40 hospitals, with investment worth £36bn. Starmer says the rules were clear. They say you could not have a work Christmas lunch or party. Why does the PM think it was OK to hold a boozy party? Johnson says he has commented on what happened 12 months ago. He says he wants to focus on this year. He summarises the latest guidance. He says he hopes Starmer has had his booster. Keir Starmer says he also wants to mark world Aids day. He says it is within our hands to end new transmissions of Aids within a decade. Was a Christmas party held in Downing Street on 18 December last year? Johnson says all guidance was followed. He says Starmer is holding his own party on 15 December, and has not invited Angela Rayner. Boris Johnson starts by saying he is wearing a purple tie because it is people with disabilities day on Friday. He says MPs’s thoughts are still with those affected by Storm Arwen. There will be a statement after PMQs, he says. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Here is the BBC report with more details of its story about Sage, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, saying pre-departure Covid tests for people arriving in the UK would be “valuable”. It is based on leaked minutes of a meeting held this Monday. Yvette Cooper, the new shadow home secretary, says that in ignoring this advice the government is being “totally irresponsible”. Last week a subgroup of Nervtag, the government’s new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group, met to consider the threat posed by the Omicron variant. As Sky News reports, Nervtag concluded that this could lead to a new wave of coronavirus hitting the UK that could overwhelm the NHS. A minute of the meeting says: If introduced into the UK, B.1.1.529 [Omicron[ would likely be capable of initiating a new wave of infections. We cannot exclude that this wave would be of a magnitude similar, or even larger, than previous waves. Although data on disease severity associated with B.1.1.529 are not yet available, a large wave of infections will be accompanied by a wave of severe cases and the subgroup cannot rule out that this may be sufficient to overwhelm NHS capacity. This is a marginally starker expression of the risk that ministers and government advisers have been talking about in public since the Omicron threat emerged at the end of last week. According to the minute, which is available on the Nervtag website here, the subgroup said the government should improve early detection of Omicron and intensify the vaccine booster campaign. Both of these things are happening. Nervtag also called for “early and robust actions to prevent introduction and onward transmission”. The government has re-introduced PCR tests at day 2 for arrivals into the UK, mandated mask wearing in shops and on public transport in England, and ordered close contacts of Omicron cases to isolate for up to 10 days, but whether these responses are “robust” enough for the Nervtag advisers is not clear from the minute. There will be two statements in the Commons after PMQs, the parliamentary authorities have announced. At 12.30pm Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, will make a statement on Storm Arwen. And at around 1.30pm Gillian Keegan, the care minister, will make a statement giving further details of the government’s plans for social care. The People’s Covid Inquiry, which was set up by the campaigning group Keep Our NHS Public and which took evidence in a series of public evidence sessions earlier this year, has this morning published its final report (pdf). It is called “Misconduct in Public Office”, and one of its conclusions is that the pandemic involved “serious governance failures” by the UK government that “contributed to tens of thousands of avoidable deaths and suffering” and that this amounts to misconduct in public office. The inquiry was chaired by Michael Mansfield QC. In his introduction to the report, Mansfield says that the government has a legal duty to protect public health and that, because a pandemic was anticipated, and because Whitehall had even planned for one, the government should have been prepared. He says: The government should, therefore, have been well prepared for the eventuality that presented itself at the end of 2019. The NHS and social care infrastructure should not have been neglected and run down; effective in-date personal protective equipment should have been readily stored and accessible; track and trace provision should have been anticipated as vital to basic public health measures; extra NHS hospital space carefully planned; an adequate NHS trained staffing complement at the ready; quarantine conditions and support sorted; strict border controls and isolation facilities programmed in advance. None of this is hindsight, as we make clear. This People’s Covid Inquiry report is unequivocal – dismal failure in the face of manifestly obvious risks. And he says that, once Covid arrived in the UK, Boris Johnson and the government failed to respond properly. There was no consistent, comprehensive and coordinated plan of public health strategy. What leapt off the press conference page was the dilatory initial response; the absence of any effective track and trace system; the sheer waste of taxpayers’ money ploughed into the pockets of private cronies; the contradictory messaging; the abject failure to provide PPE; the albatross of Nightingale hospitals; the lack of trained staff; the failure to utilise NHS primary care facilities; the misrepresentations about care home ringed protection; the parlous state of the NHS in the first place. Above all is the utter distrust of the public and the disrespect for the frontline workers, who, once the claps and saucepan fanfares had abated, were offered a 1%, below-inflation, pay rise for their life-endangered troubles. As my colleague Rowena Mason reports, in his morning interviews Sajid Javid, the health secretary, also hinted that demands for GPs to return to face-to-face appointments could be dropped to let them do more vaccinating. In his interviews Javid also suggested that people might want to take lateral flow tests before attending Christmas celebrations. Asked on Sky News if people should take a Covid test before going to a Christmas party, he replied: “I would.” Later he told the Today programme: If you are invited to a Christmas party, there’s quite a few people there, maybe you want to take an LFT [lateral flow test] before you go. Go to the party, but just be cautious. Asked if he would wear a mask if he was at a party, Javid said: It depends if I am walking around or sitting down. It depends if I’m eating. People just need to make a decision based on the guidance. This is what the government guidance for England says about taking lateral flow tests ahead of going to crowded events. You are at higher risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 in crowded and enclosed spaces, where there are more people who might be infectious and where there is limited fresh air. You may wish to take a rapid lateral flow test if it is expected that there will be a period of high risk that day. This includes spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces, or before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illness if they get Covid-19. In Scotland government advice is tougher. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has advised Scots to take a lateral flow test every time they leave home to meet up with friends. According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, there has been a leak of a document from the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) saying that its members think pre-departure tests for people coming to the UK would be valuable and that PCR tests for arrivals would be more use at day 5 or day 8, instead of at day 2 (where they are now required, under a rule announced at the weekend). This is almost certain to come up at PMQs. The new shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, and the new shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, have been loudly calling for pre-departure testing since they took up their new roles on Monday night. And the SNP government in Scotland and the Labour government in Wales have both said the PCR testing at day 2 for arrivals is not enough, and the arrivals should have to isolate until they have done a PCR test at day 8. Good morning. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, was doing the morning interview round this morning and, although mostly he was asked about the expansion of the booster programme announced last night, he also faced questions over new reports about Downing Street breaking Covid rules last year. We’ve had a steady stream of such stories during the pandemic, some more consequential than others, and the latest is by Pippa Crerar in the Daily Mirror, who says Boris Johnson and his Downing Street staff “have been accused of breaking Covid rules by attending parties at No 10 in the run-up to last Christmas”. Crerar reports: The prime minister gave a speech at a packed leaving do for a top aide last November when the country was in the grip of its second lockdown. Then just days before Christmas, with London in tier 3 restrictions, members of his top team held their own festive bash in Downing Street. Officials knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa while the rest of the country was forced to stay at home. Around “40 or 50” people were said to have been crammed “cheek by jowl” into a medium-sized room in No 10 for each of the two events. “It was a Covid nightmare,” one source claimed. The Mirror quotes from the lawyer Adam Wagner, who says that if there was an unofficial Christmas party on 18 December, it probably broke the rules. The paper also says that, when it put the story to No 10, Downing Street did not dispute that the gatherings took place, but claimed no rules were broken. Asked about the story on the Today programme, Javid – who only became health secretary because Matt Hancock resigned after breaking Covid restrictions – replied: Whatever would have happened at No 10 throughout the pandemic, I’m absolutely certain all the rules around the pandemic would have been followed. Obviously I can’t tell you what’s going on on a daily basis in any building. But what I can tell, if it’s government, and especially No 10, is that all the rules would have been followed at all times. Javid also told the interviewer, Mishal Husain, not to assume that the news report was accurate. But when asked if the report was definitely inaccurate, he just said: “I can tell you all rules would have been followed at all times.” Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS publishes a report on the characteristics of people getting Covid. 10am: Leading lawyers give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about rape prosecution rates. 10am: The People’s Covid Inquiry publishes a report based on the hearings it held earlier this year. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Keir Starmer at PMQs. 2.15pm: Sir Tom Scholar, permanent secretary at the Treasury, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 3pm: Tom Pursglove, a Home Office minister, gives evidence to the joint committee on human rights about the nationality and borders bill. 4pm: Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, discusses the Northern Ireland protocol at a Public Policy Projects event. 4.30pm: Maroš Šefčovič , vice-president of the European Commission, gives evidence to MLAs about the Northern Ireland protocol. I will be covering UK Covid developments here, as well as non-Covid politics, but for global Covid developments, do read our global live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"

Kwasi Kwarteng said the majority of those people will have power restored “in the next day or two”, although he conceded some in remote locations may have to wait much longer. Paying tribute to the three people who died in the storm, the business secretary said the exceptionally strong winds of almost 100mph had damaged power lines and required an enormous restoration effort by engineers. The most severely affected areas are the Wear valley, surrounding Eastgate and north Northumberland, the north Peak District and the south Lakes in northern England, and Aberdeen and Perth in Scotland. Urging those still without electricity to call 105, the minister conceded that the emergency power cut phone number did face initial pressure with unacceptable delays in the wake of Storm Arwen over the weekend, with reports of people having to wait up to two hours to get through. “Clearly Storm Arwen was an event the likes of which we haven’t seen for certainly 60 years since the record starts. We have to be prepared for similarly extreme, difficult weather conditions in the future. We have to make sure that our system is resilient in that eventuality,” the business secretary told the House of Commons. He was responding to questions from the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, who said: “Faced with the climate crisis, extreme weather events will sadly become all the more common in the future. We cannot be this vulnerable in the future. There is real concern that some lessons haven’t been learned and on this occasion we must face up to those lessons and learn them.” It will be at least the end of the week – seven days after the devastating storm first hit – before electricity is restored to some people, the Energy Networks Association (ENA) has said. Engineers have reconnected 97% of homes affected by the power cuts, with the majority of those still affected living in remote locations where access for crews is difficult, according to the ENA. Welfare centres and hot food have been provided, with the energy network companies working in partnership with local resilience forums, emergency services, local authorities and the British Red Cross. Chris Burchell, the managing director of Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, apologised to customers. He said the impact of the storm had caused “catastrophic damage to the electricity network across the north-east of Scotland and is the most significant event we have ever had to deal with in the area in a generation”. The storm’s gale force winds also brought down thousands of trees, including irreplaceable specimens, according to the National Trust. The conservation charity said the full extent of the damage was still being assessed but was likely to cost at least £3m to repair. More than 50 trees were uprooted at the trust’s Bodnant Garden in north Wales, including a 51-metre tall coast redwood, as well as many hybrid rhododendrons that are unique to the property. Storm Arwen is also thought to have blown a rare sea turtle 5,000 miles off course, after it was discovered on a beach in north Wales. A couple from Holywell were walking their dog on Talacre beach in Flintshire on Sunday when they discovered the motionless creature. Marine experts identified the turtle as an Atlantic ridley, one of the most endangered species of sea turtle, which generally live off the Gulf of Mexico. The couple revived the turtle, which was suffering from cold-water shock, and transferred it to Anglesey Sea Zoo where it will spend the next few months recuperating before being released back into its natural habitat."

          "headline": "Regional Australian media outlets granted millions in federal support still slashed journalist numbers ",
          "bodyText": "Some regional Australian publishers that won multimillion-dollar government grants designed to protect local journalism jobs sacked staff and closed newsrooms before the ink was dry on their grant agreements. Guardian Australia can also reveal that the government conducted a federal seat analysis of the Public Interest News Gathering (Ping) grants to determine which seats would benefit from the $50m program. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, did not respond to questions about the analysis. Documents obtained under freedom of information suggest the government’s rhetoric about the importance of the Ping grants to regional media companies to maintain or increase employment was not matched by reality. The grants were announced in June 2020 in response to the crisis in regional media brought on by the pandemic. Hundreds of small regional newspapers had been suspended and regional television was warning of mass job losses in their newsrooms. At the time Fletcher described local papers as the “lifeblood” of many towns and said the government was providing support because Covid-19 had triggered “catastrophic drops in advertising revenue leading to many newspapers suspending operations and threatening the sustainability of regional broadcasters”. But the FOI documents reveal a number of recipients had their grants reduced before the first payments were made, and two of the three regional networks announced plans to dramatically reduce bureaus and services within months of receiving the funds. The documents show Australian Community Media, whose parent company is Rural Press, was awarded $10m but shaved back the frequency of publication of many of its mastheads, making some digital only and folding others, despite Fletcher’s claim that the grants were designed to return suspended rural publications to print. News Corp decided not to take any grants and pursued a strategy to take many of its regional newspapers digital. The government has not explained why a federal seat analysis was relevant when determining which businesses got part of the $50m handout, but the Ping grants overwhelmingly benefited National and Liberal seats. Because of the limited nature of the FOI request, it is not possible to say whether outlets in Labor seats missed out. Money comes in, staff kicked out The Ping grants used funds from a previously unspent program designed to support regional media and were designed to get publishers to either restart newspapers or keep producing local news bulletins for TV and radio. The scheme focused on maintaining capacity for “public interest news-gathering” which was defined as news directly relevant to the local communities served by the regional outlet. “Public interest journalism is critical to keeping communities informed,” Fletcher said. “Ping will provide direct support for the continued provision of local and regional journalism, which has never been more important than in recent times when communities across Australia need access to trusted sources of news and information. “Through this program the government is providing $20m for television, $18m for publishing and $12m for radio, with funds to flow from July.” The FOI documents show that many of the key conditions for eligibility were not developed until after the grants were announced. One email, soon after Fletcher announced the program on 29 June, shows the department’s bureaucrats pondering the definition of “a journalist” under the grants program. There was no requirement to maintain the quality of the service. Another internal department note shows the conditions were so flexible that recipients only had to account for the number of journalists employed, not their seniority, so employers “could drop high profile journo and replace with a cadet”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There were also overlapping tests for compliance, such as maintaining headcount and maintaining outlets. These soon became a problem as grant recipients continued to cut staff and services. The documents show that in some cases the government paid out 90% of the grants upfront and withheld only 10% to ensure performance, with the result that there were few consequences for recipients that continued to shed staff. Neither the media companies nor the government responded to questions about the penalties, if any, for shedding staff and cutting services. But the documents reveal there were no restrictions on shedding staff immediately after the grant period ended. ‘Exceptional circumstances’ invoked Although many small independent media companies received assistance, the lion’s share by value – more than $40m – went to major television, radio and print outlets. Those who received $500,000 or more included Nine Entertainment ($4.2m), Win ($4m), Southern Cross Austereo ($10m), Prime ($4m), Seven Queensland, ($1.8m). There were also some large recipients in print, notably Australian Community Newspapers, which received $10m, and Seven West Media, publisher of the West Australian. Nine Entertainment and Southern Cross Austereo (SCA) each applied for Ping grants to help fund their jointly operated regional television network. Nine owns a TV network which operates stations in Newcastle and the New South Wales Northern Rivers region and at that time also operated several newsrooms under its affiliation agreement with SCA, during which it provided an hour-long regional news bulletin in Queensland, southern NSW and Victoria, with Nine taking a share of the revenue in return for running the newsrooms. The documents show that almost immediately after applying for Ping funds, Nine had to revise its application when it cut the regional news bulletins to 30 minutes and reduced staff. This decision, announced in July 2020, led to a dozen job losses. The documents show that the department reduced Nine’s grant, but do not say by how much. Nine eventually received $4.03m in September 2020. This was on top of the $15m it received in JobKeeper during 2019-20 and 2020-21. Its disclosure to the ASX shows it has since chosen to return $8.8m of JobKeeper voluntarily. By March 2021, there was more bad news for journalists in the Nine/SCA regional newsrooms. Nine announced on 1 July 2021 it was moving back to an affiliation with Win, and as a consequence was axing the three SCA statewide television news bulletins in regional Queensland, Victoria and NSW. The change in affiliation meant that 15 new regional newsrooms it created with SCA closed. More than 60 staff in regional newsrooms lost their jobs. On 6 May the department wrote: “Just wondering if you were able to provide any further clarification on the affiliation agreement and impacts on the Ping agreement?” Nine confirmed it would not be providing news bulletins in southern NSW, regional Queensland and regional Victoria, as Win had its own news service in those areas. It said it was looking to redeploy staff or transfer them to Win. “Nine can ensure that compliance with the conditions under the grant agreement will continue as it has until July 1 2021.” Nine then invoked the “exceptional circumstances” clause in its grant deed. “Given Win’s own significant commitment to regional news and employment of local journalists, it does not require Nine to provide a regional news service, comparable to that provided to Southern Cross. This combination of events is an exceptional circumstance which justifies the change in our journalist numbers from 1 July 2021.” “Nine’s stipulated use of the funding was to support its owned operations in Northern NSW and Darwin, and it has used the funding for those purposes, to continue providing news services in those locations and to expand the number of staff employed in Darwin. Nine intends to maintain that increased level of employment after expiry of the Ping funding in September. This demonstrates that the purpose of the Ping program has been satisfied, where it is within Nine’s control to do so.” The department accepted Nine’s argument and has not sought return of any funds. A spokesperson for Nine said the grant in relation to the SCA newsrooms was provided to SCA, not Nine, and that its Ping grant was used to support its operations in the NSW Northern Rivers and Darwin, which is counted as regional newsroom. SCA received $10.2m in Ping grants. The freedom of information documents revealed no correspondence with SCA about the announcement in March 2021 and it appears no one was penalised for the job shedding. SCA also announced a restructuring of its radio network in August 2020, resulting in the loss of 38 jobs. The FOI request did not include information on radio operations. SCA told Guardian Australia it received $10.27m, which was evenly split among its 78 regional radio stations and its regional television network. “Since applying for the Ping grant in July 2020, SCA has increased its full time regional journalism workforce from 47 to 58 and our total regional journalism workforce from 62 to 69,” SCA chief executive, Grant Blackley, said. The money was spent on paying journalists and sales staff, buying equipment, and technology licensing and support costs. “The grant funds enabled ongoing local delivery of audio news services across SCA’s regional footprint despite local area lockdowns, and team member absences due to Covid test/case exposure isolation periods,” Blackley said. “The funds also enabled regional journalists to up-skill in digital audio ranging from best practice podcast creation to education on digital audio analytics. As a result, SCA has launched Local News daily podcasts in 17 regions … five Local Sport News weekly podcasts and 33 Local’s Guides podcasts offering weekly local event and community information.” SCA said it replaced the bulletins produced by Nine with 130 news updates each weekday. “These updates provide relevant local content into 16 regional markets across the country including NSW, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Northern Territory. A team of 12 people produce the material which equates to 175 minutes of content Monday to Friday. This material is generated by SCA team members across the country and collated in SCA’s Hobart-based news hub.” A windfall for Win Regional journalists at Win, Nine’s new affiliate, have also faced job losses. In May 2021 Win announced cuts to its regional television services, despite receiving $4.46m in Ping grants. In July Win dropped nine local TV bulletins, the biggest drop the television sector has seen since the beginning of the Australian Newsroom Mapping Project in January 2019. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance estimates up to 20 journalists and camera operators lost their jobs that month. But Win and the department say there was no breach during the grant period. The department withheld from Guardian Australia all documents relating to its discussions with Win, saying: “There has been no confirmation that they reduced staff, bulletins or mastheads at the commencement or during the PING grant period.” Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called on Win at the time to hand the money back because the funds were granted to keep journalists in jobs and newsrooms operating. “The Morrison government should be making sure recipients uphold the intent of the program and do the right thing with taxpayer money,” Hanson-Young said. “Minister Fletcher needs to be asking Win to return the millions it has received.” The department told Guardian Australia discussions with Win had indicated there were no changes to services and staff which would affect the grant period. “The department accepted Win’s six-monthly and final acquittal reports, which showed Win had met the requirements under their funding agreement,” officials said. “Any changes made by WIN following the completion of their PING Grant is a commercial decision for WIN.” Prime, the Seven network’s regional affiliate, has not publicly indicated any job losses that would affect its grant of $4.7m. However, the documents show Seven Network Queensland faced questions about staff reductions between the announcement of Ping and when it signed the agreement in September 2020 which resulted in its grant being pruned to $1.87m. The documents reveal several email exchanges with the then-general manager for regional Queensland, Ben Roberts-Smith, about whether there had been further job losses. But the documents do not reveal how many jobs were ultimately lost. Seven Queensland explained the discrepancies by saying it was hard to keep staff in Queensland because they often left for the city for career advancement. Fletcher has defended the operation of the Ping scheme. A spokesperson for the minister said: “Among the conditions attached to the grants was the maintenance of the activity for which they were awarded. If any of those activities were withdrawn, then the grant was adjusted. “The $50m PING program provided vital support for media outlets in regional and remote areas of Australia at a time of unprecedented challenges. This well-targeted program made an important contribution to sustaining public interest journalism through the pandemic.” The chief executive of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Paul Murphy, said the union was uncertain how many jobs were lost. “Any support for public interest journalism is welcome,” he said. “The problem is the design of the support and the government doesn’t listen to our or the communities’ concerns. At the moment the government money doesn’t guarantee outcomes for the community, it only seems to deliver to private companies.”"

          "headline": "‘I was part of the Beatles’ act’: Mike McCartney’s best photograph",
          "bodyText": "I didn’t intend to pick up a camera. I’d been practising on drums that had fallen off the back of a lorry into our house on Forthlin Road, Liverpool. But when I was 13, I broke my arm at scout camp, so Pete Best got the job in our kid’s group. That’s when I started taking photos on the family box camera. It was fortuitous, though, because if I had become the Beatles’ drummer, we’d probably have gone the Oasis route. I would go everywhere with the Beatles. I was part of the act. It’s like if Rembrandt’s kid brother was in the corner with a pad and paper, sketching his older brother. I was lucky – you couldn’t have had a better group to practise on, could you? When it comes to Paul’s extraordinary band, this is one of my favourite photos. It was taken in the dressing room at the Tower Ballroom, New Brighton, in ’61 or ’62. It had gone from holding ballroom dances into rock’n’roll, so while our kid was on the bill experimenting with his music, I was doing the same with photography. In those days, the Beatles were supporting people like Joe Brown, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard. Can you imagine? Those gigs were extraordinary, absolute magic. I’d be shooting from the ballroom balcony and the bouncers would sometimes throw the drunks off on to the floor below! They’d just played the show when I took this photo backstage in the dressing room. They’ve been in their leathers and they’ve come offstage. That’s why John’s hair is all slicked back. That’s not Brylcreem – it’s sweat. I’d taken a more serious photograph before this one. It wasn’t hard to direct them. I’d say to John: “If you want to be bigger than Elvis, do what the photographer tells you.” Then I told them: “Now let’s have a daft one. Do whatever you like.” Silly things made them laugh. The dafter the better. You’ve got to remember that scousers are weird. We’re surrealists without even knowing it. The face that John, on the left, is pulling reminds me of Marcel Marceau. Have you ever seen John Lennon look like that before? I remember, just before my mum would take a photo of my dad, he would put his tongue out. It’s the same sense of humour as you’ve got in this photo. I call our kid “Rambo Paul” in this photo, because his look reminds me of Stallone. I think Pete was doing one of the silly voices from The Goon Show. Then there’s nipple-shooting George. I have no idea why he’s pointing at Paul’s nipple. And we can’t ask him now. The most important thing this photograph communicates is joy. It’s all about the fun, the camaraderie. They were totally relaxed in each other’s company and bounced off each other. All this business about the Beatles’ arguments – we all have arguments, for Christ’s sake. This photograph is a much stronger reflection of the reality. I certainly didn’t get the sense back then that I was looking at the most important band in history. Over the years, with Beatlemania, there’s been this concept of them being as famous as Beethoven and Rembrandt … not quite Jesus, we won’t go down that route again! But this picture shows what the Beatles were like as human beings, which was four working-class Liverpool lads. The idea of global fame, being billionaires … anything like that, it wasn’t just remote, it felt impossible. That period in Liverpool could be hard. It was after the war, the bottom had dropped out of the cotton business and our mum had died, so her wages as a midwife health visitor had gone. Dad was just on his own, bringing up two lads on £10 a week. Even so, it was an extraordinary time. David Puttnam once wrote in a foreword to one of my books: “What I like about Mike’s photos is that he captures a period in time. You see the back-combed hair, the winkle-pickers, the false brick wallpaper …” That’s why my new book, Early Liverpool, is important, because it tells you what life was like back then. Not just the Beatles, but all the other artistic sides of Liverpool – comedy, poetry, pop art. The whole place was bouncing. Mike McCartney’s CV Born: Liverpool, 1944. Trained: “I got on the 86 bus, went up to the library, took out all the books on photography, and learned photography in the back bedroom of Forthlin Road.” Influences: “Henri Cartier-Bresson, Bill Brandt, surrealism, Mum and Dad.” High point: “Writing The Scaffold’s Thank U Very Much and its Top 4 success – liked by prime minister Harold Wilson and the queen mum. Lily the Pink getting to No 1. The National Portrait Gallery buying 11 of my pics, and also exhibiting in the Smithsonian, Washington DC.” Low point: “Realising that selling Catholic Bibles was not the career for me. The devil got me!” Top tip: “Only do it if you love it and never, ever give up – which you can’t when you love it.” Early Liverpool is available now through Genesis Publications, with the collector copy priced at £295.

          "headline": "TechScape: Netflix and the future of tech employee activism",
          "bodyText": "Two former Netflix employees who criticised comedian Dave Chappelle for comments directed at the trans community in The Closer, a special for the streaming service, have dropped labour complaints related to Netflix’s response to the saga, they announced this week. The decision brings a close to the most recent chapter of activism at the company and one of the more visible tech industry walkouts in the last few months. But the momentum of internal organising, particularly around social justice issues, has been building for years. “We are seeing a wave of [employee walkouts],” said Jess Kutch, executive director of the Solidarity Fund, which raises money to support employees engaged in workplace organising (including at Netflix). In October 2021 alone there were several walkouts in Silicon Valley in addition to the movement at Netflix, including at grocery delivery platform Instacart. And in November, Amazon workers in at least 20 countries staged a strike to demand the company pay higher wages and allow them to join unions. The groundwork for this particular brand and scale of internal activism was laid in 2018 when more than 20,000 Google employees walked out in response to news the company had given a $90m severance package to an executive forced to step down over sexual misconduct allegations (which he has denied). While strikes are often focused on wages and working conditions, increasingly workers are taking aim at company ethics and demanding more diversity, progressive policies, and commitments to LGBTQ rights. And they are waging their battles in a public forum, experts say, eschewing the internal pressure campaigns blue collar tech workers have historically relied on. “There have been isolated examples of this kind of thing for years, but employees are increasingly using the leverage of their labor to stand up for diversity and equity,” said Anastasia Christman, senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. Here are some more key examples of worker actions within the growing wave of tech activism in recent years. Meta The most prominent and highly-visible recent example of employee activism comes via Frances Haugen, a former Facebook data engineer turned whistleblower who shared thousands of documents with the Wall Street Journal and Congress revealing the company knew of its negative public health impacts and refused to address them. While Haugen became the face of internal dissent at the company, unrest has been roiling beneath the surface for years. In June 2020, hundreds of employees staged a walkout to protest against the company’s content moderation policies relating to former president Donald Trump. More recently, Facebook content moderators – who are contracted by employment firm Accenture – staged a mobile billboard targeting the company’s CEO Julie Sweet. The plight of those workers has been covered extensively, with many saying they suffer from PTSD and other mental health problems from poor working conditions and lack of support surrounding the sensitive content they view. From our own Alex Hern: A group of current and former contractors who worked for years at the social network’s Berlin-based moderation centres has reported witnessing colleagues become “addicted” to graphic content and hoarding ever more extreme examples for a personal collection. They also said others were pushed towards the far right by the amount of hate speech and fake news they read every day. They describe being ground down by the volume of the work, numbed by the graphic violence, nudity and bullying they have to view for eight hours a day, working nights and weekends, for “practically minimum pay”. Google Google’s worker walkouts in 2018 over alleged sexual assault set the stage for other activism in the industry, but it was not the first time employees spoke out against company policies, and actions have grown since then. Also in 2018, Google discontinued its work on Project Dragonfly, a partnership with China, after protests over government censorship concerns. Social justice-related demands continued in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, during which Google employees demanded the company halt partnerships with police. Amazon As the second-largest employer in the United States, the working conditions of Amazon’s more than 1m warehouse employees has become the subject of close scrutiny. In 2021 one vocal warehouse worker was fired for speaking out against what he called unsafe working conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the company saw a massive unionisation effort in Alabama. Meanwhile, white collar workers have organised to demand the company halt partnerships with police and improve its policies relating to climate change and the environment. Apple Known for its secretive corporate culture, Apple has remained largely unscathed by the rise in employee activism in recent years. But it recently entered the fray when employees criticised the company’s remote work policies, with a Slack channel called #remote-work-advocacy rising to more than 2,800 members. From an excellent piece in the Verge, Zoe Schiffer writes: The Apple value that underpins all of this, elevating the secrecy concerns from an issue of potential lost revenue to one of core company DNA, is “surprise and delight.” It’s the idea that Apple products should catch the public unaware, giving them something they want before they even know they want it. But the secrecy has bled over into other parts of Apple’s culture, too. Although the company specifically says that its policies “should not be interpreted as restricting your right to speak freely about your wages, hours, or working conditions,” the reality is that there’s a strong expectation that internal problems should be kept internal. But all that is changing, she reports. In May 2021, a group of female employees organised in response to the company’s hiring of an employee who had in the past written a book with misogynistic descriptions of women. Another group of employees later wrote a letter to CEO Tim Cook asking him to publicly support Palestine. Apple has not taken the rise in employee activism lightly, and fired an employee in October who was critical of the company’s handling of workplace misconduct allegations and who supported a movement to share personal experiences of discrimination and other labor violations at the company.

Intensive agriculture combined with major coal production has put huge pressure on water resources and sucked the earth dry, leaving the city of Taiyuan, with a population of 5 million, and the surrounding area suffering some of the highest subsidence rates in the world. Pipelines, roads, bridges and railways need constant repairs, and gaping cracks in buildings have resulted in entire communities having to be rehoused. Since 2003, the Chinese government has been trying to solve this problem by diverting surplus water from the Yellow River. Now satellite measurements, published in Remote Sensing of Environment, reveal that this mammoth feat of engineering – taking 1.2bn cubic metres of water every year – has partially solved the problem, with diverted water rehydrating underground pores and reversing the sinking trend. But it hasn’t worked everywhere: the pore spaces in clay-rich areas cannot be fully reopened. And even where it has worked, the bounce-back is limited. The biggest successes have been in regions where water diversion has been combined with water conservation, tree planting and modernising irrigation techniques. Other water-stressed and subsidence-prone parts of the world, including the Iranian central plateau, the US high plains and north-west India will do well to learn from the Chinese experience."

          "bodyText": "Northern Territory Police have arrested three people who escaped from Darwin’s Howard Springs Covid-19 facility earlier this morning. All three tested negative for Covid on Tuesday and have now been taken into custody. Earlier, police said the trio allegedly jumped the fence at the Centre for National Resilience just before 4.40am. “Police and staff at the Centre for National Resilience are currently confirming the absconder’s identities prior to releasing further information,” police said. Howard Springs is a large, open-air facility that is being used to quarantine Australians returning from overseas. It is also housing a number of residents from Katherine and surrounding areas, where an outbreak of Covid-19 erupted last month. The alleged escape comes a day after a returned traveller tested positive for the Omicron variant in the facility and the territory continues to fight Covid outbreaks in remote communities. The NT health minister, Natasha Fyles, confirmed on Tuesday that a man in his 30s had been diagnosed with the new variant. He arrived in Darwin on a repatriation flight from South Africa last week and his positive virus result was confirmed on Friday. “I can confirm today that the genomic sequencing has shown that the man does have the Omicron variant of Covid-19,” Fyles said. “So [it is] the first case for the Northern Territory.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The territory recorded no new cases overnight . “We have negative wastewater results right across Katherine, which is very pleasing, including Bicentennial Road which … we’ve been closely watching,” Fyles said. As of Tuesday, there were 58 cases of Covid-19 in the NT. International arrivals on repatriation flights are required to quarantine at Howard Springs for 14 days. Travellers who arrive on standard international flights into Darwin airport are permitted to quarantine for seven days at their homes or another suitable location. A 27-year-old man allegedly absconded from quarantine last week before being found on Darwin’s main strip."

          "bodyText": "The television industry has a problem with the way it treats women. According to a survey by Film + TV Charity, 39% of female employees have experienced sexual harassment at work, while 67% have experienced bullying. Bectu, the union that supports TV and film workers, found that two-thirds of those who had experienced abuse did not report it for fear of being blacklisted. Other studies have reported mothers being prevented from working due to childcare issues, and a serious female under-representation in leadership positions, despite Ofcom finding that women make up around 45% of TV roles. The Guardian has spoken to a number of female TV insiders to hear what it’s really like. The producer I was at a wrap party, which is usually the best of TV fun. By this point, I hadn’t got to know a lot of the channel or the higher bosses and one of the most senior people essentially put his hand up my skirt on my way to the loo. I turned around and said: “What the fuck are you doing?” He went: “Well, there’s not much you can do about it,” laughed and walked off. I told a colleague and he said: “Watch out for him. I’ve heard he’s touched up interns and stuff.” I was horrified. I think I was quite lucky; I have heard of other people having had similar experiences that have gone further than that. He’s been my boss since then. If I did report him, it would get back to him because he’s one of the people who would have to deal with it. I would be terrified if he found out it was me. I do think there’s movement there, though. I also find that there’s a lot more opportunities for BAME people – I see more and more job posts specifically aiming for people of colour. I do think that, whether it’s quotas or whether it’s just generally monitoring diversity, it is working. The assistant producer/director I was sexually harassed by a commissioner from the age of 23 to 26-ish. He would take me out for drinks under the guise of networking. He’d go out and buy me bottles of wine and get me drunk. He’d tell me I was attractive and ask if I had a boyfriend. He’s married with kids. He recommended me to a talent manager at a company, and I ended up getting a job off the back of that chat. I bumped into [the commissioner] and told him, and he was like: “Ah, so I got you this job. You need to come out for a drink with me, then.” There was a sense of “I don’t want to ruffle his feathers because he’s powerful”. He had picked a place near my house. After the pub shut, he was like: “Why don’t we get a cup of tea at yours?” And I was like: “OK, well, if it’s a cup of tea, that’s fine.” I have flatmates as well so I felt safe. We went back to mine, were sitting in the living room, chatting on opposite sofas and then at one point he just lunged at me across the room. Like, he fell on my body. It was very strange, and then he sort of started wrestling me. He bit me on my arm and left marks. After that, I massively distanced myself. But I kept getting texts from him, saying: “Why haven’t I seen you?” It was very stressful – even talking about it now makes me feel sickened and disgusted. He was a good contact, and you always hear that TV’s about networking, right? The writer My friend worked on this show where the presenter was famously handsy. I went along to the wrap party, which was in a bar, and she spent all night sticking to me like glue, because [the presenter] kept chasing her into the bathroom and trying to grope her. She was laughing at the time but now, when we look back, we think – that was not fucking funny. Everybody knew it was going on. There’s a male-led management culture that becomes a lads-on-tour vibe. I was once working on a show where they cast an actor because – according to the joke being made in the room in front of me – the producer was like: “She’s shit, but I want to fuck her. You know?” It just speaks to their fundamental lack of respect for women. I also met with a producer, who is now quite prominent in [a broadcaster]. I was pitching ideas and he said: “Where’s your shoes and handbags show?” I said: “What?” He replied: “You’re giving me all this stuff about assassins and aliens and you’re a 21-year-old woman … where’s your Sex and the City? Where’s your shoes and handbags show? You know, like, shows that are going to appeal to people like you?” The reality TV producer I come from a working-class background so it wasn’t an easy route into TV. I was training as a multi-camera director on a reality TV show when I got pregnant with my first child. I was able to job share when my daughter was born, so after the birth I went back to a shared contract, which was great. [The reality show] was only on for four months every year so I went back to a few different companies. A lot of the time as a mum you end up in the edit suite making programmes, because it’s more office-based. I thought I could just job share – but nobody would entertain it. Nobody would do it. There are no part-time jobs in television and I couldn’t work full time. My phone didn’t ring that year. Literally, not a single phone call or email – nothing. Because most people knew that I had a baby. Things are changing slightly with certain roles, but you can’t really progress. You can’t talk openly about kids. When I started, people wouldn’t put maternity leave on their CVs. Meetings are often arranged at times that are awful for mums to go to. It’s much better now – remote working was never offered or even considered in television before, and it has been a game-changer – but there’s still a long, long way to go. You can’t manage long hours when you’ve got children. But you’ve got half a chance if you can work from home, so that is a massive, massive shift. The assistant producer/director I was working as a researcher and in order to get promoted to an assistant producer you have to have camera experience. So I was trying to get camera experience and [this cameraman] was being really kind on set, letting me play with the camera. At the time, I was 23 and everyone else was 40 plus and male. The cameraman and I had been talking earlier about how the hotel was really cold. Later that evening, I was in my room – he was next door – and it was quite late. I think it was midnight. I didn’t even know he had my number, but he texted me, like: “I found a way to turn the heating up. Do you want me to help you?” I remember at the time knowing there was no way I could show that text to my executive producer, because it was so by the book. But because of the dynamic we’d had that day and the fact that he was next door, it felt incredibly flirtatious. I didn’t reply, then he texted again with a question mark. It made me feel very frightened. I stopped bantering with him, which meant I didn’t touch the camera at any point during the rest of our shoot. I didn’t get the experience I needed to progress my career, because I was frightened he would think I was flirting with him. That’s the problem of being a woman in TV. All these relationships are friendly. You do need to be charming to progress. But how can you be charming as a young woman with a bunch of men, and not be perceived as being flirtatious?"

          "bodyText": "Maybe you don’t go to Iranian cinema for nail-biting action and suspense. But that’s what you are given in this arresting portmanteau film, the Golden Bear winner at last year’s Berlin film festival. It is written and directed by film-maker and democracy campaigner Mohammad Rasoulof, who has repeatedly been victimised by the Iranian government for his dissident “propaganda” – most recently, in 2020, with a one-year prison sentence and two-year ban on film-making. As with Rasoulof’s fellow Iranian director Jafar Panahi, a ban of this sort can be finessed, by playing on the government’s strange pedantry and hypocrisy. If the film is technically registered to someone else and shown outside Iran at international film festivals where its appearance boosts Iran’s cultural prestige, the authorities appear to let it slide, though persist with harassment. There Is No Evil consists of four short stories – with twists and ingeniously concealed interconnections – on the topic of the death penalty and how it is poisoning the country’s soul. Hundreds of people are executed a year in Iran, including children. Execution of the condemned criminal is the job of civilian functionaries but also widely carried out by soldiers doing compulsory national service. In the first section, entitled There Is No Evil, the secret horror of the death penalty is the unacknowledged elephant in the room. Heshmat (Ehsan Mirhosseini), is a dull salaryman, who is shown living his ordinary life after the working day is done: picking his daughter up from school, dealing with his mother-in-law, taking the family out for pizza. It all seems blameless and bland until the working life resumes the next day. The second part, entitled She Said: “You Can Do It”, is where we get the thriller-style tension. Pouya (Kaveh Ahangar) is a young national service conscript horrified at the realisation that he must kill a condemned man. It is his job to accompany the prisoner from the cell to the gallows where he must kick the stool away. Does he have the nerve to turn his own weapon on his fellow soldiers? In the third, Birthday, Javad (Ahangar) is a national-service conscript taking advantage of the extra-long leave given to those who have done their execution duty, to travel to the country and propose to his girlfriend on her birthday, only to discover a hidden horror for which he is responsible. In the fourth section, Kiss Me, a musical cue discreetly hints at a relation with a story that has gone before: a middle-aged couple living in a remote, mountainous part of Iran play host to their sophisticated niece who has been living in Germany. There is great technique in the storytelling, and Rasoulof’s outrage and nausea at the state-sanctioned murder gives the film passion. • There Is No Evil is in cinemas from 3 December."

          "bodyText": "Desperate families in flood-ravaged villages in South Sudan are spending hours searching for water lilies to eat after another summer of intense rainfall worsened an already dire situation. People have no food and no land to cultivate after three years of floods. Fields are submerged in last year’s flood water and higher ground is overcrowded with hungry people, in what is quickly becoming a humanitarian crisis. Fangak, one of the worst affected of the 31 counties devastated by the floods, continues to lose ground to the rising water. But the communities displaced along the banks of the White Nile River have nowhere to go to escape the high waters. Nyanyang Tong, 39, on her way to the Action Against Hunger centre with her one-year-old son, Mamuch Gatkuoth, in Paguir “We have been chased out of our home by the flood water and now we’re heading to Old Fangak to look for a place to sleep tonight … [but] I don’t know any other place where we can go after tonight. If so, we will make a small grass island and sleep above the water,” says Nyadut Gatkuoth, a woman migrating with her relatives to the central market area in Old Fangak, one of the few areas on higher ground. A cow eats the remains of a collapsed roof. Cattle often become ill after eating grass in standing water Last year people left behind their collapsed mud homes and slept in the open under trees and in abandoned school buildings, but this year many of these areas have also been flooded. An estimated 1.7 million people are displaced within South Sudan, and migration has increased this year, with people reporting being forced to seek higher ground at least twice in the past few months. Others have given up and crossed the border into Sudan. The UN says that more than 780,000 people have been affected by flooding so far, and this number is expected to rise in the coming months. In counties like Fangak the number of people affected by the floods was expected to jump from 75% to nearly 100% by the end of October, according to Action Against Hunger. Meanwhile the country as a whole has 8 million people in need, says the UN. People have not been able to cultivate the land in many areas since 2020. Many of those who lost this year’s harvest also lost their livestock to diseases caused by the animals grazing on flooded fields. Without the milk and meat traditionally provided by cattle to fill the gaps in times of need people are scrambling to find wild food. In the absence of fishing nets or canoes, entire families are dependant on collecting water lilies by the dozen to grind into a small day’s meal. A shortage of fishing nets and canoes means entire families now depend on collecting water lilies, which they grind up to make a small daily meal “We are not used to collecting water lilies but the flood water forces us to. We can spend close to five hours looking for them in the water,” says Bol Kek, a mother of seven children living on the higher ground of Paguir, “[but] when you eat water lilies it feels like you didn’t eat at all.” Families wade through crocodile-infested waters for hours searching for water lily bulbs to eat The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods, according to scientists in the region. Water lilies and fish are not sustainable food sources in the long term because access to wild foods will be reduced in the rainy season, especially for poor households without canoes, once again triggering acute food insecurity. Though efforts have been made in preparation for this year’s floods, humanitarian food distribution has been hampered by insufficient funding. Distributions have been delayed and food rations cut to prioritise those who need it the most, at the cost of other communities. An estimated 2.5 million people are facing severe food insecurity and more than 100,000 are considered close to famine. ‘These water lilies that we eat don’t have nutrients. We eat them because we need to fill our stomach, but soon after you eat them you will start feeling hungry again,’ says Nyawech Giel, 53 Nyadiang Gak, a mother who migrated to higher ground in the hopes of cultivating this year, says: “We used to plant maize and sorghum at the same time, so when the maize was finished we could harvest the sorghum. Now it is time to harvest sorghum but we couldn’t even plant it … I planted maize next to my home but when the second flood came it destroyed it and I didn’t even get to harvest it … Now we are hungry.” ‘Before these two floods I had a kitchen garden that put food on the table, and I was also able to send my children to school in Old Fangak. But because of these floods they can’t go because I don’t have anything to support them with,’ says Nyadiang Gak More communities are now cut off by the floods, while travelling to other areas comes at the risk of attacks or food supplies being looted. The increase in violence against humanitarian workers that led to four deaths this year coincides with food prices soaring. In September 2020, the price for 3.5kg of sorghum powder, a staple food of the country, was approximately 800 South Sudanese pounds (about £4.50) but this year it has increased 60% to 1,300 SSP. The trend is likely to continue, with South Sudan’s economy expected to contract by 4% in 2021, according to the World Bank. South Sudan is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate breakdown, according to the Global Climate Index. Food insecurity, conflict, diminished human rights and financial problems aggravated by Covid-19 have eroded its capacity to cope with recurring extreme weather events such as flooding. The heavy rainfall that caused three consecutive floods will only get worse in South Sudan and the wider region if global temperatures continue to rise, a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted. Volunteers fight to push back flood waters, including from a football pitch, where it’s hoped food aid could be delivered Scientists currently working on the floods in Fangak county point out that the disproportionate severity of the floods is not only caused by rainfall as evidenced by the unusual flooding in January 2021 that happened outside of the rainy season. Though floods occur each year during the rainy season from May to October, scientists say that the recent flooding in Fangak county has been exceptional in terms of intensity, geographic extent and duration. The leading theory on the cause of the flooding, with the caveat of an absence of data before 1980 and the lack of a larger-scale assessment involving neighbouring countries, is that upstream water saturated local swamps, which have likely absorbed water in previous years. In the remote towns and villages of the most affected states, life is dire. Old Fangak has no electricity, while parts of the town have no potable water. Dirty water has contaminated the boreholes and sits in paths with sewage. People cook with the same flood water in which children play and animals graze. ‘Pushing this mud out of the house is painful on my knees,’ says Par Both, 34, from Paguir “It is a real struggle being here with this water. There is a lot of disease around. This child and I both have a cough, and all of this because of the water,” says David Deng, who is blind and being led through the flood water by his granddaughter, Angelina, in Old Fangak. Since last year entire villages have disappeared underwater. In their place float small islands made of dry grass, where dozens of people sleep in the open. Cases of snake bites have risen dramatically. David Deng, who is blind, navigates his way through the floods with the help of his nine-year-old granddaughter, Angelina Nyagok Children are constantly being pushed farther away from schools because of the encroaching water. In many remote areas of the country children have been without education for two years due to the pandemic and the floods. Where homes still stand, communities flush water out every hour and repair mud dykes that break almost daily. Nyapini Yiel, a mother of two children who lost her home two weeks ago, voices the plight of the communities living on the frontline of the climate crisis. “I’m tired of building dykes all the time and flushing water out all the time … so when it broke that night I couldn’t do anything because it was dark and my children and I were alone at home, so we just went back to sleep. We slept on top of the bed even while the water was coming inside the house.” Nyapini Yiel, 23, lies in her bed, surrounded by flood water • This article was amended on 6 December 2021 to clarify that only parts of Old Fangak are without potable water, rather than the whole town as an earlier version said.
