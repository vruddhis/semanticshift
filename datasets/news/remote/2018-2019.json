          "headline": "The missing 99%: why can't we find the vast majority of ocean plastic?",
          "bodyText": "Every year, 8m tons of plastic enters the ocean. Images of common household waste swirling in vast garbage patches in the open sea, or tangled up with whales and seabirds, have turned plastic pollution into one of the most popular environmental issues in the world. But for at least a decade, the biggest question among scientists who study marine plastic hasn’t been why plastic in the ocean is so abundant, but why it isn’t. What scientists can see and measure, in the garbage patches and on beaches, accounts for only a tiny fraction of the total plastic entering the water. So where is the other 99% of ocean plastic? Unsettling answers have recently begun to emerge. What we commonly see accumulating at the sea surface is “less than the tip of the iceberg, maybe a half of 1% of the total,” says Erik Van Sebille, an oceanographer at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. “I often joke that being an ocean plastic scientist should be an easy job, because you can always find a bit wherever you look,” says Van Sebille. But, he adds, the reality is that our maps of the ocean essentially end at the surface, and solid numbers on how much plastic is in any one location are lacking. It is becoming apparent that plastic ends up in huge quantities in the deepest parts of the ocean, buried in sediment on the seafloor, and caught like clouds of dust deep in the water column. Perhaps most frighteningly, says Helge Niemann, a biogeochemist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, it could fragment into such small pieces that it can barely be detected. At this point it becomes, Niemann says, “more like a chemical dissolved in the water than floating in it”. The 276 miles of coastline that runs from the narrow mouth of San Francisco Bay, past the open water of Monterey Bay to the scenic mountains and redwood forests of Big Sur, is the land border of America’s largest National Marine Sanctuary. To anyone visiting the beaches near Santa Cruz or driving the coastal highways, it appears remarkably unspoiled. That is not the whole story. For the past two years, scientists from the nearby Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute have been using customised remote-control submersibles to take samples of the near-invisible plastic drifting far below the surface. “Just because you don’t see it, doesn’t mean it isn’t there” says Anela Choy, a professor of oceanography at the University of California San Diego, and the lead researcher on the project. Below what she calls the “skin surface” of the ocean, the submersibles carefully filter seawater and take a snapshot of what’s in it. Her team found that at a depth of 200m, there were nearly 15 bits of plastic in every liter of water, similar to the amount found at the surface of the so-called garbage patches. The remote samplers were still finding plastic at their maximum depth of 1km. But it is just the start of the hunt. “After two to three years of work the honest truth is we have only one set of samples from one portion of the world’s entire ocean,” she says. The group’s work is among the first to count the exact amount of plastic below the ocean surface, and to show that plastic waste is abundant at lower depths. Scientists have speculated about this for years. Richard Thomson, the oceanologist who first coined the term “microplastic” in 2004 to describe difficult-to-capture bits under 2mm in length, has suggested that large amounts could be found in the deep ocean and sea floor. And a 2017 paper from Van Sebille’s group predicted that, based on the amount of plastic entering the ocean and the potential ways it is known to sink, 196m tons of plastic may have settled from the surface into the deep ocean since 1950. The next steps are to show where the plastic comes from, and to ascertain how it moves from the surface, where it is relatively easy to both find and track, to the depths. The conventional view is that it is very hard to track ocean microplastic back to its source. But even very small bits of plastic don’t necessarily look the same. By examining how laser light scatters when it hits different bits of plastic, researchers can create a fingerprint. The plastic found in Monterey Bay, for example, didn’t resemble the plastics used in local fishing equipment, but was mostly Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polymer used in disposable packing, indicating it probably came from land. How plastic descends to the deep ocean is, for the most part, a mystery. Because of its low density, most commercial plastic floats. It needs help to get below the surface. Plastic can become attached to ocean detritus that sinks, or fragment under the sun or waves, or find its way into something’s stomach. Choy’s team identified two kinds of animals, red crabs and translucent, filter-feeding creatures called giant larvaceans, which consume plastic and moving it to deeper water – either by eating it near the surface and expelling it lower down, or in the case of the larvaceans, in a layer of mucous they periodically discard and let sink. This sort of unwitting animal transit has been observed in many species. A 2011 study examining plastic in fish in the north Pacific Ocean estimated that they ingested around 12,000 tons a year. In a later paper Van Sebille’s group noted that if the number held across the entire ocean, 100,000 tons of plastic could be inside animals at any one time. The search for the missing maritime plastic has opened new frontiers of research. A decade ago the discovery of microplastics sparked a radical shift in the conception of plastic pollution. Scientists revealed the existence of billions of pieces of plastic almost too small to see, definitely too small to catch, and easily eaten by the tiniest sea creature. Now they are making startling new discoveries about the extent of plastic pollution. On a cool, gray June day in London, Alexandra Ter Halle, a researcher with Paul Sabatier University, in France, was on a sailboat just below Tower Bridge taking samples of water from the Thames. It was the crew’s first stop on a tour of 10 European estuaries, and the other scientists on board were doing familiar work, counting microplastic particles with microscopes, and characterising the bacteria in the samples. Ter Halle’s samples, though, would have to wait until she was back at her university, where she has specialized equipment for the detection of nanoplastistics – plastics that have broken down to sizes below a thousandth of a millimeter, smaller than a single cell. Two years ago her group was the first to detect these particles in seawater. Ter Halle employs techniques similar to those used by forensic scientists to detect chemicals at crime scenes: the samples are ignited into a gas, bombarded with electrons, and separated across an electric field to measure their weight and charge. They can’t be conventionally seen, only detected. Nanoplastic research is still in its infancy. But laboratory tests show that unlike microplastics, nanoplastics are small enough to accumulate within the bloodstreams and cell membranes of a range of organisms, even passing the blood-brain barrier in a test on Japanese medaka fish, and cause various toxic effects, including neurological damage, and reproductive abnormalities. “This question of where is all the plastic in the sea … For 40 years we sought out plastic we could see. Now we reach the nanoscale, which is very particular, very reactive, and we have to begin again,” says Ter Halle. The huge amounts of plastic on the ocean surface were what originally sparked public and scientific interest in the plastic problem. In this way, they acted like a buoy, pointing the way to something much larger beneath the surface. The deep ocean is, as Choy puts it, “the world’s largest habitat”. We’re just beginning the accounting of how much of our plastic has ended up there. • This article was amended on 2 January 2020 to set out the full name of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute."

          "headline": "Two dead in Cobargo as New South Wales and Victoria face bushfire threat – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "We are going to wind up the blog for now. Catastrophic conditions saw a horrendous day in Victoria and NSW. You can read a full wrap of the day’s events here. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner says it is the worst fire season on record in the state. Another two people are dead in NSW. A 63-year-old man and his 29-year-old son were found dead at their property near Cobargo. A woman told police her husband and son had stayed to fight the fires. Four people are missing in Victoria and a 72-year-old man is missing at Belowra in NSW. People on the south coast of NSW from Nowra to Moruya have been warned they will lose all telecommunications tonight, including landlines, mobiles and internet. This includes hospitals. The Australian Defence Force is sending military air and sea assets to Victoria to assist with evacuations. There are significant property losses across both states but the impact won’t be known until assessors can access the fire grounds. Thousands of people were forced to shelter on a jetty, waterfront, in the water and on boats and sand bars in Mallacoota, as a firefront bore down on the East Gippsland town early this morning. Terrifying scenes saw glowing red skies and pitch darkness at mid-morning. Towns across the East Gippsland region remain cut off even after the fire danger has passed, with roads, electricity and other services cut. A southerly change swept up the NSW coast late on Tuesday, moderating some fires but bringing strong gusty winds and little to no rain. Scott Morrison has extended the payments for volunteer firefighters to Queensland, and says other states are welcome to join. Fires are continuing to create their own thunderstorms, bringing lightning that is sparking new fires. More details were released about the death of the 28-year-old firefighter, Samuel McPaul, with veteran firefighters saying “freakish” conditions had to be seen to be believed, with a fire tornado picking up and flipping the eight-tonne truck. Several fires are under investigation by police in both Victoria and NSW. From the NSW police: The Public Information and Inquiry Centre (PIIC) has been opened to assist members of the public in relation to bushfire information for the south coast areas. The telephone number to call is 1800 227 228. Members of the public are reminded to delay all non-essential travel in fire-affected areas to assist emergency services. Information specifically relating to the bushfires can be obtained by contacting the Bush Fire Information Line on 1800 679 737. A very quick reversal on that Sydney Morning Herald story – David Elliott is coming home. Better late than never, hey. Fires in NSW are being downgraded. The Greystanes and Charmhaven fires are now at watch and act level. There are still five emergency-level fires burning in the south. The Charmhaven fire on the NSW Central Coast is reportedly being investigated by police. Police have also released a statement about the two deaths reported earlier today. They have not released the names of the two men. Police have confirmed two men have died and a third is still unaccounted for in bushfires impacting the state’s south coast. A 63-year-old man and his 29-year-old son are believed to have died overnight (Monday 30 December 2019), on their property at Wandella, about 10km north-west of Cobargo. A woman has told police she’d left the property the previous evening, but her husband and son stayed behind to defend the home and farm equipment. She returned this morning and discovered their bodies. A 72-year-old man is unaccounted for at Belowra, about 50km north-west of Cobargo. “Why do we even have an emergency services minister if he is not going to be here in an emergency?” The Sydney Morning Herald is quoting a few anonymous members of the NSW government, reacting to news that the state’s emergency services minister, David Elliott, is not cutting short his European holiday despite what the fire commissioner says is the worst season the state has ever seen, and despite saying he would come back if the situation demanded it. Elliott’s decision to go on holidays was criticised in the wake of the nationwide criticism the prime minister faced for taking his family off to Hawaii (while his office told reporters he hadn’t). Morrison apologised and came back early, but according to the SMH, Elliott has more to do in London. Elliott has said he’s receiving regular briefings from the RFS, and the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said today the buck stops with her and she feels completely supported. There are horrifying photos coming out of Sarsfield, just north-east of Bairnsdale in Victoria. Up to 20 houses are lost in the community. Calla Wahlquist spoke to a number of evacuees today, taking shelter in Bairnsdale. From the hill behind the makeshift campground, evacuees could see the ridges surrounding Nicholson and Sarsfield burning. Power on the NSW south coast is likely to be out for 24 hours. Authorities earlier warned that all telecommunications (landlines, mobiles and internet) would be lost tonight. “Energy and utilities have advised that due to the bushfires all power has been lost from South Nowra to Moruya and potentially beyond,” NSW police said. “Power is unlikely to be restored for at least 24 hours. The power outage also affects communication lines and therefore some landlines are not operating which means internet is also affected. Additionally, communication towers have been affected impacting mobile services. “Energy companies are working with RFS to gain access to safely restore services although until it is safe for workers to enter affected areas this will be delayed as they are currently impacted by bushfires.” From the federal minister for natural disaster and emergency management, David Littleproud: Payments of $1000 per adult and $400 per child are now available to those worst-hit by the bushfires in the local government areas of Kangaroo Island and Mount Barker. Assistance is being provided through the Australia Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP). “This is for people whose home has been severely damaged or destroyed, who’ve been seriously injured or who’ve lost a family member,” Littleproud said. “This will help to cover the immediate needs of those worst hit, and help them get through the coming days. “We will make further assistance available to these communities if it is needed. “It’s going to take time for life to return to normal and we’ll be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these communities until they’re back on their feet. “People can call the Department of Human Services to check their eligibility.” An emergency warning has been issued this afternoon for a fire in Tasmania. “There is a bushfire at North East of Tower Hill,” the TFS says. “The fire will put North East of Tower Hill at very high risk. This fire will be uncontrollable. Burning embers, falling on North East of Tower Hill will threaten your home before the main fire.” Louis Boyle-Bryant is at the community centre in Mallacoota, which went through a pretty devastating and traumatic experience overnight and today. Thousands of people evacuated to the waterfront, onto boats in the lake, and to the community centre as the large, out-of-control fire bore down on the town. While the fire has passed, the community is still isolated. A short time ago the people sheltered there received a briefing from emergency services, who said that the immediate threat was over. Boyle-Bryant said the authorities told them there was still a residual risk from burning trees and houses, and recommended against people going to check on their homes. “But some folks have gone to check anyway, if they can get past fire lines,” he said. “Most of the campground only sustained minor damage so a lot of people from the wharf have gone back to their tents/caravans. “I’ll stay in the community centre again tonight. Bit shaken and don’t want to set up tents again.” Marine wind warnings for the rest of today: Gale warning for the following areas: Sydney closed waters, Hunter coast, Sydney coast and Illawarra coast Strong wind warning for the following areas: Byron coast, Coffs coast, Macquarie coast, Batemans coast and Eden coast Wind warnings for tomorrow: Strong wind warning for the following areas: Coffs coast, Macquarie coast, Hunter coast and Sydney coast In the last hour or so the strong southerly change has crossed the Currowan fireground on the NSW south coast. This emergency-level fire is burning between Nowra in the north, Braidwood in the west, and Batemans Bay in the south. There has been a significant increase in fire activity south of the Kings Highway to the west of Nelligen, the RFS says. The fire merged with the Tianjara fire in the Morton national park to the south-west of Nowra, and the Charleys Forest fire has grown along its western flank. Devastating scenes inside the fireground at Mogo where several buildings have burned down, including houses and the Aboriginal Land Council. All telecommunications – mobile and landline phones and internet – will be lost between Nowra and Moruya tonight, NSW police have just warned. This will also affect hospitals in the area. The federal government has agreed to supply military vessels to Victoria for evacuations in coastal communities where people are trapped. The ADF will send Black Hawks, Chinooks, fixed wing aircraft and navy vessels for firefighting support and evacuation. “We’ve got fires burning from the Queensland border all the way down to the Victorian border, across the great dividing range,” says Fitzsimmons. There have been multiple challenges, he says, noting that today conditions didn’t allow for the flying of some aerial support craft. “We are expecting a return to more hot dangerous and difficult conditions … and we can expect some fairly widespread severe fire danger ratings.” He notes the dry landscape, the “moisture depleted” landscape, in a state which is “100% drought-affected”. There’s been a significant number of pyroconvective activity and the tragic consequences of that. “We have seen now confirmed eight civilian fatalities, three firefighter fatalities, and we have grave concerns for another civilian down in the southeast of NSW,” he says. “We have seen over 900 homes destroyed and over 3.6m hectares of country burnt so far this season. We have still months to go of summer. Absolutely, this is up to be one of the worst, if not the worst fire season we have experienced here in NSW.” RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons is giving an update from its Sydney headquarters. Here are the main points: There are more than 100 fires burning in the state, more than half uncontained: 2,200 firefighters are in the field. The southerly change is currently at Nowra and is expected in the Sydney basin between 6pm and 7pm. Ahead of that, the WNW winds are up to about 70 km/h, but the southerly is also bringing damaging gusts up to 80km, although it will lose strength as it moves up the coast. That cold front is halving temperatures in some areas. Batemans Bay and other areas – particularly adjacent to the coast – are seeing some moderation once the change goes through, but the southern ranges are not benefiting from it. Along the coastal strip from Nowra towards Bega, “there’s communities all the way along there that are exposed and vulnerable” as well as inland, across the Snowy Mountains plains there are a number of problematic fires, and into the west and south at the cross-border Green Valley fire. The Green Valley fire is expected to move into the Kosciuszko national park. The Charmhaven fire is burning east-northeasterly, and is spreading towards more populated areas in the Woongarrah area. Fire crews are hoping to get it under control overnight. There are significant power challenges and disruptions to utilities in fire affected areas. There are dangerous trees and fires burning on both sides of multiple arterial roads. The RFS received about 68 applications for fire ban exemptions (including the Sydney NYE fireworks). They said yes to about 30. The Charmhaven fire on the NSW Central Coast is a new one today. It’s an emergency level blaze and has destroyed at least 83 hectares already. Crews are on the scene working to protect property and people in Mona, Arizona and Allinga Hiawatha Road, were earlier told to take shelter because it is too late to leave. The Bureau of Meteorology says thunderstorms could make the NSW bushfire situation even worse, adding to soaring temperatures and gusty winds, AAP reports. Thunderstorms forecast to develop in NSW could make an already dangerous bushfire situation even worse, the bureau says. Bureau of Meteorology NSW state manager Jane Golding says the state is experiencing heatwave conditions on Tuesday with soaring temperatures, gusty winds and smoke pollution in many areas. Thunderstorms could exacerbate the situation later on if lightning strikes spark new fires, Golding told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. “Over the course of today we are expecting general thunderstorms to develop – they are going to cause a few problems around the fire grounds,” she said. Lightning strikes sparked more than a dozen blazes in Victoria’s alpine region on Tuesday while thunderstorms have started spot fires in Tasmania. A southerly change sweeping up the NSW coast would drop temperatures in the evening, with bushfire conditions forecast to ease on Wednesday, according to the bureau. “In much of the state we are expecting markedly cooler conditions tomorrow,” Golding said. “But up in the northwest we are still expecting really warm temperatures and increased fire dangers.” In the Aboriginal community of Lake Tyers, about 35 people chose to stay on country when they came under threat from the East Gippsland fires, NITV reports. “We’re a small community of 250 Aboriginal people, 46 houses out there. There’s roughly 35 community [members] who have stayed,” traditional owner Kerry Tregonning said. “Most of them were born out here, they have no transport, some of them are hooked up to oxygen, there’s a lot of little things.” There is an endless stream of jaw-dropping photos and videos on social media today. An eerie darkness has settled over the New South Wales south coast town of Huskisson, as bushfires in the surrounding areas close in around the town. By 3pm the town was entirely covered by a thick haze that made it feel more like 8pm. Beaches that usually at this time of day would be crowded with tourists are abandoned, and at the main pub in town people watched nervously as ash fell from the sky and the last sunlight disappeared behind the smoky haze. Many people have already left, but at about lunchtime authorities closed the Princes Highway and the Rural Fire Service sent text messages warning visitors to seek shelter as the fire arrived. Suffice to say New Year’s Eve plans have taken a hit. The fireworks had already been cancelled, but when we drove past the beach where the celebrations are usually held about 20 minutes ago it was completely empty. At the apartment where I’m staying we’re all gathered around the air purifier and watching the rolling updates on ABC 24. In NSW there are eight emergency level fires and nine watch and act level fires. Seven of the emergency fires are in the south of the state, and one is on the Central Coast at Charmhaven. In Victoria there are eight emergency warnings, all in the East Gippsland region except for one east of Albury (which has come from over the border in NSW where it is referred to by a different name) Throughout the afternoon and evening we’ll do our best to bring you the latest on all of them. Journalist and author Melissa Pouliot is in Wallagoot, near Tathra, living through her third “too close for comfort” experience with bushfires in a decade. “We are packed, well prepared and informed,” she tweeted. After the March 2018 fires in Tathra, she organised the Book Love for Tathra appeal to return books to the 70 local families who lost their homes and home libraries in that fire. She says she was “also part of the black Saturday fires. I was living just out of Horsham, one kilometre from where that fire started, which destroyed Horsham golf club and surrounding houses”. This is Helen Davidson taking over the blog for the rest of the day. The RACV says ongoing mobile coverage issues are affecting callouts for RACV emegency roadside assistance. This applies to Mallacoota, Bairnsdale, Orbost, Lakes Entrance, Bruthen and Corryong. Members needing emergency assistance should contact 000. The prime minister Scott Morrison has just announced the payments for volunteer firefighters will be extended to Queensland. It matches the payments offered to NSW last week. Morrison says it’s available to any state that asks for it. In that press conference, Victorian emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp also went into more detail about what the defence force would do to help. One of their jobs will be to undertake “initial impact assessments” throughout East Gippsland. That will help the CFA count the cost and damage of the fires. “We expect those additional Australian defence force people to be on the ground tomorrow working with our Metropolitan Fire Brigade,” he said. Another role is still under discussion, but the ADF could help support isolated communities, with new airplanes and helicopters brought in. “We’ve formalised two requests through Emergency Management Australia to the Australian defence force,” Crisp said. “”We’ve also been working through what some first support from the ADF could look like. “We will continue to work through that with the ADF and they’ve assured us they’ll provide whatever support they can”. It has been pointed out that the NSW emergency services minister, David Elliott, announced on Friday he would be going on holiday to Europe. He promised he would receive two briefings a day, and would return should the bushfire situation “demand it”. At a press conference on Tuesday, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, deflected questions about the minister’s whereabouts. “At the end of the day, the buck stops with me,” she said. “I’m the premier.” Berejiklian noted the acting minister, the prisons minister Anthony Roberts, was with her. “I feel completely supported,” she said. Elliott announced his holiday shortly after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, apologised for flying out to Hawaii during the bushfire crisis. Morrison subsequently returned home early. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, returned from holiday yesterday as fires burned out of control in the state’s east. Two people were confirmed dead at Cobargo – believed to be father and son – and grave fears are held for a third west of Narooma. On Tuesday, Berejilkian would not be drawn on Elliott’s role. “I ask everybody to focus on what’s important – protecting life and property.” Guardian Australia has contacted Elliott’s office. CFA chief officer Steve Warrington has some “relatively good news” for Mallacoota. “The wind change has gone through and the major fire front has now bypassed that town,” he says. “I understand there was a public cheer down at the jetty when that was announced. So that is good news for us. “But having said that, there are still active fires in that area and they’re still actively extinguishing houses that have burnt down on the outskirts of Mallacoota.” He also adds that the town now remains isolated, which is a concern. It’s a similar state in Corryong – the main fire front has passed but the town is still isolated and ringed by fire. Victoria’s emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is speaking now. He confirms that there are at least 43 buildings destroyed in East Gippsland. That’s 19 structures at Sarsfield, and 24 structures at Buchan. That counting was done by helicopter, and there will be more confirmed destroyed properties to come. “Because this has been done by the air, it’s difficult at times to determine whether it’s actually a house or a large shed or an outbuilding,” Crisp says. “We still have a dynamic and dangerous fire condition. We still have eight emergency warnings in the state. “To demonstrate how dynamic it still is, there’s been a band of lightning come through the state in recent times. And we’ve got about 12-15 new fires that have started in the Jamieson/Halcourt area.” Berejiklian says she supports Sydney’s fireworks going ahead tonight. She acknowledges the “mixed feelings” on the issue, but says “on balance I understand the decision to proceed, and on balance I support that decision”. “I think no matter where you are, up and down the coast, inland or in the larger cities, including Sydney, all our thoughts are with the people who are suffering.” The fireworks “don’t take away from our empathy for people who are doing it tough”. On those earlier reports by Sky News that NSW transport minister Andrew Constance was missing, Berejiklian says it was a communication issue. The ABC later contacted Constance by phone and confirmed he was OK. “Unfortunately, for many people in southern New South Wales, telecommunications is an issue at the moment there,” Berejiklian said. “There are a number of phone towers damaged. There are a number of people who don’t have phone reception. “Because of the damage to phone towers and also lack of reception in some of the remote communities, it is difficult to contact everybody at this time.” RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons also spoke and said there will be a “heavy toll” in terms of property damage. “We need to brace ourselves for a considerable number of properties, a considerable number of homes that are likely to have been damaged and or destroyed right across these eight emergency warning fire areas, given the extraordinary nature of the fire behaviour and fire spread today.” Police found the two men deceased in a house in the west of Cobargo, says NSW police deputy commissioner Gary Worboys. The two men were residents of the town, and were father and son. They are still trying to access a house west of Narooma, where a man is missing. “Unfortunately we think the news in that house will not be good either,” Worboys says. An elderly man was reported to police as living in that house. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now and has confirmed that two people have died in Cobargo. “It’s been confirmed today that there are two deceased persons in Cobargo,” she said. “The police have confirmed that. A third person is missing with grave concerns for their safety, west of Narooma. Our message is please follow instructions.” Our photo editor, Jessica Hromas, has put together this composite showing the main street of Cobargo, before and after the fires. Earlier today, there were grave fears for the Mogo Zoo in NSW, only a few kilometres from the out-of-control fires that are currently destroying homes in Batemans Bay. None of the animals had time to be evacuated, and the zoo has Australia’s largest collection of primates, as well as lions, tigers and zebras. Just now zoo director Chad Staples has said all the animals are safe. Those that were small enough – monkeys and red pandas – were scooped up and taken inside. “Right now in my house there’s animals of all description in all the different rooms,” Staples told the ABC. “Due to the amazing staff here, and a well executed plan, no one is hurt. Not a single animal lost.” “What we did with the dangerous animals – lions, tigers, orangutans – is we encouraged them to the night den, kept them calm, like nothing was happening, and we were able to protect them at that site. “The only animals we saw any signs of stress are the giraffe and zebra at a couple of points.” And the conditions are also easing. “We were putting fires out on site, a couple of hours ago it felt like armageddon,” said Staples. “But right now we feel like we have got a reprieve, the wind changed and we were able to get on top of it.” Former journalist Peter Logue and former diplomat Zena Armstrong were at home at Coolagolite outside Cobargo early this morning, “dithering about what to do” according to Logue. “Then we got a phone call from a local farmer, a long term resident, at about 4.30am and he just said ‘Get out now’, so we left, and as we went outside the red glow was right behind the house, that was the fire that came over the back of us and swept through into Cobargo.” Their children and a guest found a way to drive through to Canberra. Logue and Armstrong drove to the coast to Bermagui to help defend the home of Armstrong’s mother and step father. “The RFS and the police were driving around the streets of Bermagui with a loud speaker saying ‘evacuate now, evacuate now’. It was dark like night time and raining burning embers and leaves. “We evacuated the oldies down to the beach, and then we went back to try to prepare the house...but then the weather changed, the fire started its own weather system, it went from hot wind to really cold, and it started raining..and in the end the fire front didn’t eventuate.” Logue spoke to Guardian Australia from Bermagui beach where the RFS had just given a briefing at the surf life savers’ club. “The whole south coast water treatment system is down so we have to boil water, Woolworths is packed with people buying water and emergency supplies, the cafes are all closed because they’ve run out of food, and there’s only one way out to Narooma, but you can’t get any further than there.” Logue and Armstrong don’t know if there home is still standing. The fire has destroyed much of Cobargo and two residents are missing, in what could be “potential fatalities” according to RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Both Logue and Armstrong are musicians, organisers of the Cobargo folk festival. They have saved their musical instruments, half a dozen bottles of Clonakilla and a bottle of good Irish whisky. “We are staying here for now,” Logue said. “It looks like a refugee camp down here at the beach, a yuppie refugee camp, with horse floats and people staying in their cars.” And quite shocking footage of a shopping centre filled with flames in Batemans Bay. Rapid escalation of the Currowan fire near Sussex Inlet in NSW. ABC reporter Selby Stewart said observers “had to flee” as a spot fire “became an inferno in minutes”. Albanese has also criticised the City of Sydney’s fireworks scheduled tonight. “I understand how important the fireworks are for their economy, but I just think at a time like this – I’m not in a position to judge – but I think that it’s really problematic that it’s going ahead. That’s a decision for others.” When asked about Labor’s support for coal, he says “now is not the time to answer questions like that”. Asked when the time is, Albanese says “I have been talking about climate change ... The truth is that simplistic slogans won’t solve this ... we need to respond to climate change with serious policy, not with slogans.” The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, is speaking now from the Woodford folk festival, where he is about to give a speech paying tribute to Bob Hawke. He has paid tribute to Samuel McPaul, the volunteer firefighter who died last night, and says the fire is a national crisis that “requires a national response from the government”. “We are seeing in the very least dozens, but perhaps hundreds of homes lost... This fire does not respect state boundaries. And I again say this is a national issue. This is a national emergency. And it requires a national response from the government.” Albanese adds that people need to listen to the warnings of their local fire authority. “It’s a reminder of how important the ABC is and the role that it plays in keeping Australians safe,” he says. Reports of homes lost in Batemans Bay, NSW. Up north, closer to Nowra, residents near Sussex Inlet are evacuating towards the NSW coast, as fires are attacking the Princes Highway in both north and south directions. Meanwhile, back in Victoria: Photos coming in of houses now on fire in Mallacoota. Despite some speculation in the last few minutes, the NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, is not missing in the fires. Just 10 minutes ago, Sky News tweeted that Constance was “unaccounted for” in the NSW fires. But the ABC in Canberra then confirmed they had just spoken to the minister. Reporter Jordan Hayne said: “I just spoke with Andrew Constance, he is not interested in speaking to the media, but confirmed he is ok for now at least.” Here’s the scene in Cobargo, NSW, where the main street has been ravaged by fire and two people are missing. On ABC Radio Gippsland we’ve just heard from a local man, Graham. “We saw a big burst of very big flames in Shady Gully,” he said. “As I speak to you I’m looking across Coull’s Inlet and there are big flames… and they would be impacting houses… Oh wow, that’s not good at all.” Graham was looking across the centre of town, and said the people on the jetty would be able to see what he’s seeing. In Tasmania, there are fears that homes have been lost in fires that flared to emergency level yesterday and continue today. The temperature hit 40C in the state on Monday, and the Pelham fire, 50km north of Hobart, reached emergency. Today cooler conditions allowed firefighters to bring it under control. “Seventy per cent of the fire ground has been assessed. We’ve got some structural losses,” the TFS chief officer, Chris Arnol, said. “We’re not sure if any homes have been lost. It could be sheds, it could be homes, we don’t know. Access is difficult with that fire, with smoke conditions and some power infrastructure down.” Arnol said a “significant” number of structures in the area had been saved. Dry lightning sparked both fires, with the Bureau of Meteorology recording more than 400 ground strikes. Kate Bruton and her family experienced how unsafe it was at Swan Reach first-hand. They were staying with Bruton’s mother at Cabbage Tree for Christmas but decided to evacuate yesterday when they saw the columns of smoke from the Barmouth Spur and W Tree fires. “We stopped at Orbost first and Orbost was full at the evacuation centre, and it was the same at Lakes Entrance,” Bruton said. It looked like “armageddon,” she said. “I have been in bushfires all my life... it was unimaginable.” They were advised to drive on to Bairnsdale but got stuck when the Princes Highway closed both ahead and behind them at Swan Reach. The closure was not reported on the VicEmergency or VicTraffic app until after they were stuck. They parked the caravan near a river and watched embers fall around them, but luckily the road opened and they made it to Bairnsdale. Everyone at the park had been friendly and helping each other, Bruton said. “As horrible as this is, it is nice.” Hundreds of people, both locals and tourists, evacuated from Lakes Entrance spent the night at Howitt Park. It is not an official evacuation point, but many locals told Guardian Australia they were not sure where the official evacuation centre was. Cars were parked bumper to bumper overnight but most had gone by midday, with people taking advantage of the brief window in which the Princes Highway was open to get back to their homes. Among those who remain are Kelly Lane and her 10-year-old son, Connor. They left their home in Swan Reach, which is just over halfway between Lakes Entrance and Bairnsdale, late yesterday when their fire advice went from a watch and act to an emergency alert. The call to leave came from a local man who was driving down the street in his tractor bellowing at residents to evacuate. Lane bought a tent this morning – they didn’t have time last night and another evacuee said Kmart had sold out of tents – and plan to stay at Howitt Park again tonight. “It is still unsafe around my place,” Lane said. This photo from Mallacoota is being widely shared on social media. Taken by a resident, it shows a family out on a boat escaping the fire, in the middle of the day. And read this fuller report on the situation in Mallacoota from Helen Davidson. People reported hearing gas bottles explode as the fire front reached the town, and the sound of sirens telling people to get in the water. The CFA incident controller Ben Rankin has just been on ABC Radio in East Gippsland. He says that fire is moving around to Orbost, and that in Mallacoota there “have been quite a number of houses impacted”. “It is not a day to relax at all,” Rankin said. “It is a day to adhere to the warnings that are coming out.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, confirmed on Tuesday morning he had requested Australian Defence Force assistance as fires burned throughout the state’s east, threatening homes and lives. He said he had spoken by text message with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to discuss additional support, such as the use of the navy to help provide food, water and power to isolated communities. “We’ve made some requests to the (Australian Defence Force) for their support, both in terms of making damage assessments but also some of these isolated communities can be accessed by sea,” he said. “We have a range of plans in place ourselves but there may be ways the ADF can support us.” He added: “There’s a prospect of whatever ADF support that can be provided we’ll be happy to use it. And we’re having detailed discussions with ADF to discuss how to best use their resources.” Asked what form the additional military assistance might take and whether naval supply ships might be involved, Andrews said: “That type of thing. I wouldn’t be specific to the point of ruling anything out. “There’s some choppers for instance, they’ve got some aircraft that are bigger. They’ve got a range of things that they can support us with.” Victoria has also asked for 70 firefighters from Canada and the United States, Andrews confirmed. Matt Manning is out on a boat, 3km from Mallacoota, waiting out the fires. He tells me there are about 30 boats out there with him, his partner, their two friends, and his dog. Most of them are locals. “I packed the boat and prepared the boat yesterday morning. I left it tied up in the water ready to bail, and we sat it out – we were camping in the foreshore camp park. We sat it out hour by hour, and about one o’clock decided to go down to the boat until we decided to bail out to the lake. “The glow in the sky was just unreal. We decided to pull the pin at about three o’clock. We’re pretty safe here, hopefully we don’t get any hot embers. There’s a lot of debris and ash but so far there’s no hot embers. Winds about 30-40 knots coming from the south. “I’ve got two mates who stayed at the camp park, they didn’t want to come with us. They said they’re fine, they’re country boys and have fought a few fires. I spoke to them about 10 minutes ago, and they’re fine. A few tents have gone up.” Barry Wear, who is camped in a caravan outside the Bairnsdale relief centre, has just heard some good news. He lives at Sarsfield, one of the communities that Daniel Andrews confirmed was hardest hit by the bushfires. About 20 houses have been lost, Wear says. But, as of this morning, his house is not one of them. “I was sure last night that I had lost my house but this morning a neighbour knocked on my door and said my house was safe,” he said. “I don’t know how. My house, which is cedar, and my shed with all my tools in it are still standing, but my garage – well it’s really a machinery shed – which is metal, that melted.” Wear lives on High Street in Sarsfield and said he had been told by those who remained that all the houses on their street were safe. Others were not so lucky. Heggars Road was heavily impacted, he says. Wear said he would not return home until it was safe. Fires are still burning around the town. “I just brought the essentials with me,” he says, which includes two dogs and three guitars. “I have enough food in the fridge and two casks of wine. Well, one – I finished one last night.” Along with thousands of other Canberrans, I am holidaying on the NSW south coast – as I have done ever year since I can remember. At 6am I was woken by a text to evacuate. We fled south to Moruya, with nearby Mogo – perhaps 5km from the sea – alight. We had been warned that today would be bad, but the overnight fire spread exceeded the worst estimations. The otherwise sleepy town of Moruya was soon bustling with locals and holidaymakers, dazed and concerned as we saw the giant smoke front head in our direction. People were glued to their phones, constantly refreshing the live fire map, wondering if their house was burning while we were stranded in the car parks, green spaces and the public pool of Moruya, helpless. As the sky became darker the mood soured; at one point we could see flames speed down a ridge in the distance. But amid the gloom, there were bright spots of humanity. The pool gave out ice creams, a local Thai restaurant cooked free meals. Strangers swapped anecdotes and the latest information. For decades, Canberrans and locals have made happy summer memories on the south coast. Now we are stuck in a nightmare. Apocalyptic scenes in Batemans Bay on the NSW south coast. Residents huddled on the beach similar to Mallacoota in Victoria. Fitzsimmons also says that fires are stretching all the way from Nowra to the Victorian border. And the southerly change coming will make things worse, spreading fires – previously heading east – in a northerly direction. This poses “an additional threat” to populations, he says. The scope of these fires is huge. “Anywhere from Nowra down to the Victorian border, right out to places like Tumut and Tumbarumba, across the ranges – we’re seeing aggressive and dangerous fire behaviour,” Fitzsimmons says. This is Naaman Zhou taking over the blog from Luke Henriques-Gomes, who has done some incredible work today. In that press conference, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, also confirmed there was “significant impact, damage and destruction” on the NSW south coast, including schools hit by fire. “We’re seeing fire impacting onto communities, people’s homes and other infrastructure,” he said, in towns like Cobargo, Broulee, Mogo and Fishermans Paradise. “We’ve had reports of schools impacted. We’ve had reports of businesses and some of the small town centres being impacted by these fires.” Shane Fitzsimmons is asked if this is the worst bushfire season on record for New South Wales. He replies: “Yes. Absolutely.” Fitzsimmons says there are three people unaccounted for on the south coast. That is two people at Cobargo and one at Belowra. These are “potential fatalities” and it is believed that these people were “impacted by the fire”. It is not yet safe to access the scene and so authorities cannot provide more information. Fitzsimmons says NSW authorities have no plans for evacuations by water at this stage but they are watching the situation. Some updates from people on the ground in Mallacoota. And this was posted a little earlier – and it involves a lot of swearing. From the Victorian premier’s press conference earlier. Fitzsimmons says there is a fire burning right across the Princes Highway towards Batemans Bay. We have been seeing some very concerning images coming out of that popular holiday spot. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, is addressing the media. There are eight fires burning at emergency level right now, he says. The most impacted areas, according to reports, are Cobargo, Broulee to Mogo and Fishermans Paradise. More from the Cobargo area. Meanwhile, in NSW, there are some concerning images from Bateman’s Bay. Here is what we know so far. 16 fires are burning at emergency level across Australia, eight in Victoria and eight in NSW, with the entire East Gippsland region under an emergency alert. One firefighter has died overnight, and others injured, in a “freakish weather event” near Albury, described as a “fire tornado” that overturned a 10-tonne truck on flat, stable ground. In Victoria, four people are missing, and premier Daniel Andrews said authorities “have real fears for their safety”. 4,000 residents have been evacuated from the town of Mallacoota and are sheltering on the foreshore, as the firefront hit properties this morning. Photos taken from 9am showed the sky pitch black. Victoria’s emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp, confirmed “significant property losses across all of East Gippsland”. 5,700 homes are without power in East Gippsland, and more than 200,000ha have been burned. 200 new fires started on Monday, and 60 new fires started from midnight until now. These conditions were worse than predicted, and the bureau of meteorology will be updating its forecast to be worse than originally thought. In NSW, residents of Cobargo were evacuated as the firefront reached the town and impacted homes. People in bushfire prone areas between Batemans Bay and Bega, and also the south coast town of Tathra, have also been told to evacuate. Robert Jackson, and his mother and sister, left his 15-acre farm at Bumberrah late Monday after repeated calls from friends and family telling him to get out. “Eventually I thought: fine! I’m leaving! You can stop calling me. “With him he brought five chickens, two kittens, an adult cat, three Jack Russell terriers, and two cattle dogs. The whole group camped out together across two Land Rovers and a small tent outside the Bairnsdale relief centre. Hundreds of people spent the night inside. “The chickens seem to be happy, they are still laying eggs,” he said.As of 11am, they have laid three legs.” He has heard from neighbours that the fire, which significantly impacted Bumberrah, skipped over their place. He plans to return once the road is open. While the focus today has been on the emergencies in Victoria and NSW, there is also a fire threat in Tasmania, where firefighters worked through the night to protect about 20 properties. This video was posted on Facebook about 11am. Taken by a resident and sent to their neighbour who has posted it online. Crisp says there have been 200,000ha burnt or burning across East Gippsland. Separately, it’s been reported there are about 20,000 homes without power in Victoria. Crisp says there wasn’t an evacuation order for Mallacoota (while other towns were evacuated over Sunday and Monday). They couldn’t move out of the town because of fires in the west, and to the north-east in NSW. Andrews says the Victorian government has requested assistance from 70 fire fighters from the US and Canada. Andrews says he has asked the prime minister for assistance from the defence force this morning. The two spoke via text message today. Warrington is asked what will happen to those who did not evacuate to the foreshore at Mallacoota. He says people in the town were briefed and knew that they were to move to the beach when sirens sounded. That occurred at 8am. Fire crews will not be sent to isolated communities, he says. Those that did not move to the beach were “taking their chances”. There are homes being lost in and around Mallacoota “as we speak”. A number of homes have been lost in Mallacoota, but the town is still under attack, CFA chief officer Steve Warrington says. The town is “pitch black” but three strike teams are standing side by side to protect those who have evacuated to the beach front. “It is quite scary in that community. The community right now is under threat but we will hold our line and they will be safe and protected.” The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews says there are four people in the state who are unaccounted for. “And of course we have fears for their safety,” he says. Crisp says there has been “significant property” losses across East Gippsland. He names towns including Sarsfield, Buchan and Gelantipy. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews says there are four people in the state who are unaccounted for. “And of course we have fears for their safety,” he says. He declines to say where but notes they were in active fire environments. Crisp turns to Mallacoota, which is he says is facing an ember attack right now. He confirms there are 4,000 people on the beach who are being protected by firefighters there. Crisp pays respect to NSW RFS volunteer Samuel McPaul, who died yesterday. He says in the north-east of Victoria, there have been property losses in at a town near Kooriyong. Kooriyong is being impacted by the fire which ran 30km last night. The Victorian emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is addressing media. He says there were 200 new fires yesterday, and 60 new fires that started after midnight. More than 200 horses spent the night in Bairnsdale saleyards last night while their worried owners camped at the nearby evacuation centre or found other places to lay their swags in town. Melanie McCann and her 15-year-old daughter Gabrielle spent the night on the floor of her workplace in town while fire threatened their property at Nicholson. They moved three horses into the saleyards at 11.30am on Monday and helped a neighbour move theirs. They learned from that same neighbour this morning that their house had been spared. “We came into town ourselves about 4.30pm and my husband came in at 6pm ... no point putting anyone in danger if they don’t need to be. The saleyards have been providing free board, and in some cases feed, for displaced stock for several days. Some horses have come from as far away as Omeo. There are cattle, goats, sheep, and even a watchful maremma in the yards. Johanna Toohey moved four of her horses off her property just north of Bairnsdale, in the path of the Barmouth Spur Fire, on Saturday. They came to the saleyards on Sunday. She spent the night on the floor of a rental property she owns in Bairnsdale, which just happened to be vacant. “There was no furniture, no power, but it was somewhere to be safe.” An irate sheep, which she also brought into town along with her dog and cats, spent the night bellowing in the backyard. She returned to get them at 4.30pm, when the column of smoke was looming over the town, then turned the sprinklers on and left. She packed so quickly that she had to make a late-night trip to Kmart to buy underwear. “My home is safe,” she said. “I have got no water left because I used it all ... there is not a drop of water in the house. This photo was posted about an hour ago at Cobargo in the Bega Valley, NSW. There are now seven emergency warnings in place in NSW and eight in Victoria. Samuel McPaul’s colleagues have paid tribute to a “beautiful young man” who loved “putting the community first”. McPaul, who leaves behind a wife and child due in May, was a skilled mechanic and avid basketballer, who worked as a coach for local kids. “He did everything for the right reasons,” an RFS spokesman said. “His mother Christine is a wonderful woman who raised him and raised a really good son there. “He gave a lot of his time to basketball in the area. He was a representative player for Wagga and was actually, at the time, undertaking a fair bit of training and coaching for the kids. Basically, he was putting the community first and what we saw yesterday was just a very unfortunate price to pay for putting the community first.” “He had a degree in biology or zoology, and then decided to take his hand to being a mechanic,” his RFS colleagues said. “He was a very good mechanic that worked for one of our service providers in Culcairn. And it’s a sad day, when you think about it, Sam probably serviced one of those trucks that he was on and it would have been in good order. “It is a sad thing for the community, the community of Culcairn, Holbrook and even the greater community.” Two emergency warnings issued in NSW over the past half hour. Firefighters in Albury have provided more details on the tragic loss of Samuel McPaul, the volunteer firefighter and soon-to-be father, who died last night. An RFS spokesman said the truck was hit by a “freakish weather event that had to be seen to be believed”, best described as a “fire tornado”. McPaul and his crew were sent to a fire in the upper Murray, started by a lightning strike, that grew so large it created its own weather system, known as a pyrocumulonimbus. “That cloud became very unstable,” the spokesman said. “It had a height of around about 8,000 metres and unfortunately, it appears to have collapsed during yesterday’s deteriorating weather, causing erratic fire behaviour and erratic winds at the foot of the fire in all directions. “We had a crew working in a paddock that were trying to muster up some cattle that were caught in the corner of the paddock. They were only 50 metres from a gate that they entered and they were on flat ground with very low fuel. “The crew decided to move away from that area and, quite unexpectedly, very suddenly, they experienced extreme winds, and what could only be described as a fire tornado, that lifted the back of the truck, fully inverted it and landed it on its roof, trapping three people, three crew that is, and unfortunately, one of them fatally.” The conditions were so “freakish”, that veteran firefighters couldn’t believe what they had seen, the spokesman said. “Sam was a 28-year-old firefighter ... He was trained and doing everything right on the day when something went wrong and it’s just incredibly unfortunate what happened. “The driver was a veteran captain of 35 years-plus experience and after speaking with him in hospital last night, he said the ground he was on was safe. “He thought he was in the right spot, and just this freakish weather event, that would have to be seen to be believed, and even then other veteran firefighters don’t believe what they saw, engulfed that vehicle with flame, and strong winds and literally picked up an 8-tonne truck and flipped it over.” Updates from Mallacoota. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has issued this statement on the death of 28-year-old volunteer firefighter Samuel McPaul. Last night we tragically lost another volunteer firefighter, in terrible circumstances in Jingellic, New South Wales. Sam McPaul was a brave firefighter and a member of the Morven Rural Fire Brigade. In one of the cruellest developments, Sam and his wife Megan are due to have their first baby next year. I cannot imagine the terrible sense of loss and grief that Sam’s family are now feeling. I have spoken to Megan to extend my deepest sympathies and our love and support at this terrible time and express that same sentiment on behalf of the entire country. Sam McPaul was the best of us. This is devastating news and I also extend my sincere condolences to his entire family, friends and fellow brigade members. It is an unimaginable loss and one felt by the entire country. A further three firefighters were injured in the same incident, one severely. Our thoughts are with these brave firefighters and their families in this difficult time. We wish those in hospital a fast and full recovery. The firefighters were working on the Green Valley, Talmalmo Fire, approximately 70km east of Albury when extreme winds flipped their truck and a second vehicle. They were doing what thousands of other volunteer firefighters are doing around Australia, and have been doing for months – selflessly and bravely protecting their local communities. For that, the nation is incredibly grateful. The devastating impact of these terrible bushfires is continuing. This week, [there are] fires in South Australia and Tasmania, brutal fires in Victoria and, of course, the fires rolling on in New South Wales, many at emergency levels. As these fires continue to rage, the response continues to be run and well-led at a state level. We will continue to provide every support to those state firefighting agencies through the Commonwealth. In particular, through the support of the Australian Defence Force. These are well-resourced, well-coordinated, well-responded to fires. I thank all of those who are directly involved out there on the fire grounds and the teams supporting them behind the scenes. This will continue to be a significant effort in the days and the weeks ahead and I fear, in the months to come. We are expecting more difficult news out of New South Wales and Victoria today as the assessments are undertaken of the terrible fires from yesterday and last night. I am closely monitoring the situation in all states and I am receiving regular daily briefing on all emerging issues. I am also in regular contact with the premiers and fire authorities. I have seen the impact and devastation of these fires first hand, but I have also seen communities pulling together and caring for each other with a remarkable spirit. This is the Australian way. We have stood up and responded to these terrible disasters before and we have come through the other side. We will rebuild and we will stay strong. I urge all Australians to continue to listen to the warnings from the authorities and take care. To those fighting these fires; please be safe, and continue to pull together in this difficult time. Your country is behind you every step of the way. And others are taking shelter on the beach on the NSW South Coast. At 11am, the Victoria premier, Daniel Andrews, will address the media with emergency services officials. It was reported yesterday evening that Andrews returned from holiday due to the fires. Mark tells ABC Gippsland there is about 5,000 down at the main boat ramp and community centre. The town was pitch black but half the sky is now red. The line is crackling. There are ambulances and fire brigades patrolling the area. “The car park is just completely chockers with vehicles.” Winterson says she knows that her house won’t survive. “I’ve just accepted that.” She earlier ABC Gippsland her home was right in the centre of the fire path. She now says there is now zero visibility and glowing embers. “It’s starting to look like fireworks night.” She says her brick building of the radio studio is fairly new. “It has a metal roof. The only wood is withinthe internal structure. We have double glazing on the studio windows. And we will be keeping all internal doors shut. We’ve got as much chance, really, as anybody else at the moment and now the ember attack is really starting to... It’s starting to look like fireworks night.” Francesca Winterson, who is a presenter on a local radio station in Mallacoota, is speaking on ABC News now. “We’ve been broadcasting for 48 hours without a break and we’re all very tired,” she says. “Now we are here in the station and I’m just watching my town burn.” “I’m now seeing live ash burning down the main street and landing into the dry.” She is asked if she needs to leave the call. “I can’t go anywhere.” I have been speaking with Kelly, who is on the beach at Mallacoota. She says there are about 20 boats around her. The family beside her has a nine-month-old baby. “It’s dark and gloomy with burning embers seen out here in the past hour,” she said. “We can see flashing lights towards Mallacoota but no visible flames as yet. It’s strange how we got here at four yesterday afternoon and it was stinking hot and now it’s bloody cold. “That has caught a lot of people out by not having the right clothing. We [came] out in our little boat with my wife and two boys and three dogs. Luckily for us we have a big swag so we are out of the weather slightly. There is a new emergency warning in place for Cabbage Tree Creek. This Emergency Warning is being issued for Cabbage Tree Creek and Brodribb River and surrounds, Bellbird Creek, Bete Bolong, Cape Conran, Corringle, Jarrahmond, Manorina, Marlo, Murrungowar, Newmerella, Nurran, Orbost, Simpsons Creek, Tabbara, Waygara. This bushfire is approximately 4km from Cabbage Tree Creek heading in a North Easterly direction, the fire front is halfway between Brodribb River and Cabbage Tree. The fire is about to cross the Princes Highway. This bushfire could impact Cabbage Tree any time within the next 30 minutes. Ash and embers are falling in nearby communities which can potentially start spot fires. The Princes Highway is closed between Bairnsdale and Genoa. The wind has shifted to a south-westerly direction. This fire is threatening homes and lives. The Orbost Cricket Club in Nicholson Street has been set up as an assembly area for those in nearby communities who wish to gather within the township if you do not have any safer options. Further to the caller to ABC Gippsland who confirmed homes lost in Sarsfield, there have been images coming out of that town. In Mallacoota, 4,000 residents have been evacuated to the foreshore as they wait for the fire to hit. Some locals have told ABC Radio that the town is already being impacted. Others are sheltering at the community centre. Those in the town have reported that it is pitch black, aside from flashing lights. They have reported sirens are blaring. Across East Gippsland, there are 5,700 homes without power. In the Blue Mountains. On ABC Radio Gippsland, Joe says he has driven through Sarsfield, north of Lakes Entrance, and near Bruthen. The power and phone lines are down in Bruthen. He says: “I was just shocked with what I saw. There seems to be quite a few houses burned. There were still ... trees and hay sheds on fire. “I was just feeling relieved for myself but in total shock for the people who’ve suffered losses [of property]. If there have been no serious injuries or deaths that’s just a miracle.” Really frightening updates from Mallacoota. People in Mallacoota have been providing updates on Twitter. Authorities have updated the emergency warning for Mallacoota. It says: This Emergency Warning is being issued for Mallacoota, Gipsy Point, Karbeethong, Tamboon, Club Terrace, Combienbar and surrounds. There are currently two bushfires that are not yet under control. One fire is currently travelling from Wingan River in an easterly direction towards Karbeethong with spotting ahead of the fire. The fire front is predicted to impact the Mallacoota township within the next 30 minutes. The second fire is travelling from Goongerah in a south-easterly direction towards Chandlers Creek Ash and embers are falling ahead of the main fires, which may cause spot fires. Nationals MP Darren Chester, who represents Gippsland, says he just got off the phone with a friend in the fire-threatened town of Mallacoota. He tells the ABC: “I was talking to a mate in Mallacoota, he says it’s like midnight there, it’s pitch black. They have a lot of smoke. They have embers falling. “At this stage he was saying to me that they are burnt leaves, not direct embers in terms of likely to start new fires, but they’re in the firing line, so to speak, and along the south coast there’s more issues.” A few more points from Shane Fitzsimmons’ press briefing. 100 fires are burning in NSW, including five at emergency level, concentrated in southern NSW. The fires were “extraordinary” overnight, exceeding predictions. BoM will update forecast to be worse than original prediction. The full quote from Shane Fitzsimmons earlier: Our hearts are breaking for Sam’s family, for his colleagues in the region and the entire southern border team, but right across the firefighting and emergency services family. To lose one of our own in such extraordinary circumstances is tragic and tragic is an understatement. Fitzsimmons gives more details on the accident yesterday. He says crews at the scene described the winds that tipped McPaul’s truck as a “fire tornado”, which resulted in “cyclonic winds” that moved across the fire ground and lifted up a 10 tonne fire truck and flipped it on the roof. Those inside were trapped, and McPaul was killed in the process. “I have to pay my respects and admiration to Sam’s fellow crew and those that stayed behind,” Fitzsimmons said. “They weren’t leaving Sam there until police and, of course, the local fire and rescue crew, who so professionally and with respect and dignity worked with police to ensure Sam got out of the vehicle wreckage and was transported away from that fire scene.” Fitzsimmons says three other volunteers were injured. Two have been released from hospital, but a third is at the Prince Alfred Hospital in Melbourne with serious injuries, including burns. Shane Fitzsimmons, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, confirms the man killed at Albury yesterday is 28-year-old Samuel McPaul. Fitzsimmons says McPaul, of Holbrook, was “well respected and admired throughout the local community and in his local brigade”. He leaves behind his wife, Megan, who is pregnant with their first child, due 4 May. The couple married 18 months ago. “Our hearts are breaking for Sam’s family,” Fitzsimmons says. Turning her attention to the current fire threat, the premier says the South Coast and southern NSW is “under heavy threat” today. She notes there are five fires at emergency level this early in the day. “There will be road closures in southern NewSouth Wales due to the fires,” she says. “We need everybody to act as responsibly as possible, as cautiously as possible, and please don’t think you’re the expert. Take the experts’ advice. We don’t want anyone to get in harm’s way. Your actions may unintentionally harm so many others. That’s the last thing we want to see today.” The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now to the media. She extends her condolences to the NSW RFS volunteer who died in a truck accident at Albury-Wodonga yesterday. Three others were injured, she says. The premier says the RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons spent the night supporting the family of the volunteer who was killed. Also within the past hour, an alert was issued for Bendoc, Bonang, Cabanandra, Club Terrace, Combienbar, Deddick Valley, Delegate River, Dellicknora, Errinundra, Goongerah, Haydens Bog, Nurran, Roaring Camp, Tubbut, Yalmy. This relates to the bushfire west of Goongerah and south-west of Bonang, which is not yet under control. There are reports of active fire in multiple locations in the Goongerah Valley. Fire activity is erratic and unpredictable. This fire is threatening homes and lives. Reports of ember attack have been reported in the township of Goongerah. The south-westerly wind change is not expected until early Tuesday morning which will push the fire in a north-easterly direction. Let’s drill down into some of those emergency warnings in Victoria that I mentioned earlier. At 7:14am, an emergency warning was issued for Bruthen and surrounds. There is a bushfire at Bruthen and surrounds that is out of control. The fire has created a large smoke column and is dropping embers and creating spot fires. The fire has been burning overnight burning in a southerly direction towards Swan Reach. This fire is threatening homes and lives. There is a south-westerly wind change has occurred and is likely to drive fires in a north-easterly direction. Bruthen, Bullumwall, Swan Reach and Fairhope are under a high level of threat. Metung is not threatened to the same level at this point. The incident controller of the Gippsland fires said he could not confirm whether lives or property had been lost in massive fires that burned through East Gippsland overnight, because it was so hot they had to ground their infra-red tracking plane. And he said the beachside town of Mallacoota, where 4,000 tourists and locals are on the foreshore being protected by firefighters, is expected to be hit by fire this morning. Chris Eagle, from the department of environment, land, water and planning, said the fires grew about 60% in size overnight. On Monday afternoon, the three largest fires — Barmouth Spur near Bruthen, W Tree, and the Cann River fire — were estimated to be 200,000ha in size. “There’s a lot of fire, a lot of activity,” Eagle told ABC radio in Gippsland on Tuesday morning. “There’s going to be impacts to residents just because of the sheer size.” Asked if that meant he could not say whether there had been a loss of property or lives, Eagle said: “No, not as yet.” He said he had reports the fire had directly impacted on the towns of Bruthen and Orbost. The Princes Highway was closed from Bairnsdale to Genoa, east of Mallacoota, on Monday night, but on Tuesday morning the stretch between Lakes Entrance and Bairnsdale was opened to allow tourists to leave. All of East Gippsland remains under an emergency alert this morning, except Bairnsdale which is under a watch and act. There are currently 13 emergency warnings in place across Victoria and New South Wales. These maps below will give you a sense of where those fires are burning. We’re currently waiting for the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to address media. That’s coming up in the next few minutes. I mentioned the town of Mallacoota is bracing to be impacted by fire. There are terrifying photos coming out of the area. Meanwhile, residents in Albury-Wodonga are mourning the loss of a 28-year-old volunteer fire fighter who was killed when his fire truck rolled in strong winds yesterday evening. The Rural Fire Service Superintendent Pat Westwood will give more details at 10am today. Crisp said authorities are focused on a fire that is about to reach the coastal town of Mallacoota in East Gippsland. Residents were told the fire was likely to hit the township around daybreak. “We have three strike teams in Mallacoota looking after 4,000 people on the beach as the fire goes into that town,” he said. “We are concerned about isolated communities and to get an appreciation about other losses we will put up helicopters, reconnaissance flight. A whole lot of planning has happened over night. We thought this was the scenario.” Victoria’s emergency services commissioner Andrew Crisp has just appeared on ABC News. Crisp said he could not give specific details about the number of homes lost in Victoria. But he confirms that in East Gippsland “multiple properties across a number of locations” have been lost. He does not want to give more details until authorities are certain to avoid misleading people. Good morning. I’m Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for joining our coverage of the ongoing bushfire threat across the country. We should learn this morning about the scale of the properties lost across Victoria, as fires bear down on communities in the state’s east, and on the New South Wales south coast. We already know that a volunteer firefighter lost their life at Albury yesterday after their truck rolled. We’ll be with you throughout the day."

          "bodyText": "Technology is changing our lives for the better; yet it’s also exposing us to organised crime, online scammers and hackers – and whole industries built around monetising our personal data. But you don’t have to be resigned to cyber-victimhood. Give yourself, and your devices, a security update for 2020 and start fighting back. Random and unique passwords A study carried out by the Ponemon Institute found that 51% of individuals in the UK reuse an average of five passwords across different sites and services. “This makes your accounts far easier to hack,” says Nic Sarginson, senior solutions engineer at security firm Yubico. “By gaining access to one account an attacker could quite easily crack another.” It’s the cyber-equivalent of having one key that unlocks your front door, your office, your car and the bank for good measure, and then keeping a spare under the doormat. “Every year billions of credentials such as email addresses, passwords and personal information are shared and traded online by cybercriminals,” says Dr Richard Gold, director of security engineering at Digital Shadows. You can see if any of yours have been compromised already by going to haveibeenpwned.com. If you think coming up with a unique, long and random, complex password that you can remember for every account you use is impossible, you’d be right. Unless you use a password-manager app, such as LastPass or 1Password, which will not only generate the passwords for each site, but also store them securely and then automatically use the right ones when you need to log in. All you need to remember is the master password to unlock the app, and most will let you use your fingerprint on a smartphone instead of entering this every time. Smartphone self-destruct Yes, seriously. Your smartphone is a treasure trove of data, and while your passwords are likely to be safe from prying eyes (your password manager will keep them encrypted), what about your email, social media apps, contacts etc? Criminals can use these to change passwords, take account control away from you, and commit fraud in your name or simply steal directly from you. “Most people do not set any lock code on their devices,” warns Fennel Aurora, security adviser at F-Secure. A long password is most secure. Even if you’ve set up a fingerprint scan to unlock your phone, it will ask for your pin or password after a few unsuccessful attempts. A thief can try to guess your pin (and 0000 is still a common option) or obvious password. Smartphones can be configured to automatically perform a factory reset, wiping all your data, after a certain number of incorrect unlock attempts. For Android check Settings/Security &amp; Location/Screen lock, and on iPhones, Settings/Face ID &amp; passcode/Erase data. Secure your dumb ‘smart’ speakers While you may have read about smart speakers being at risk from hackers with maliciously crafted audio tracks or lasers (yes, seriously), in the real world there are more pressing security and privacy issues to consider. The account holder can see any requests that have been made of the device; worth remembering when using one at a friend’s house. To prevent this, tell Alexa to “delete what I just said”, and Google Assistant to “delete my last conversation”. That’s assuming they have enabled the “delete by voice” option in the account settings, of course – which,. as a courtesy to your friends and family, I’d recommend doing for your smart speakers. While in the account settings, you can also delete past recordings for good measure. Using the “voice match” function for Google Assistant can prevent your personal results being available to anyone but you, and possibly Jon Culshaw. If you have enabled purchasing and have one-click payments “on” for your Amazon account, you can set a spoken pin to stop others shopping on your behalf and at your cost. Become a cyber-liar If there’s one thing hackers really don’t like, it’s a liar. Especially if the fibs relate to those security questions sites ask you to answer as an identification method should you need to reset a forgotten password. “Most of the answers to security questions like these are easily acquired by hackers,” Tom Lysemose Hansen, founder of mobile app security vendor Promon, explains, “using simple trial-and-error methods based on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and even Wikipedia data, which give away much of our personal and family details.” Indeed, it’s incredible, and incredibly worrying, what a simple Google search can uncover. Instead of being honest about your mother’s maiden name, your place of birth, where you went to school or what you called your first pet, lie like a politician at election time. Of course, remembering fibs is harder than remembering the truth, and as with passwords, it’s best to avoid reusing the same ones for every site. Password manager apps can help, as they have a secure notes entry for every login. Stop using SMS-based 2FA Two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds something you have to the something you know (your username and password) during login, is a must-have. This builds a second wall for the cybercriminal to climb if they have nabbed your password from somewhere. Use either an authenticator app such as Authy or Google Authenticator, or a hardware token like a YubiKey. Don’t use 2FA that sends codes by text message, as this can provide a ladder to climb that second wall with. “If your phone is stolen, the thief can put your sim in another phone and request an SMS code for resetting the password to all your accounts,” warns Cesar Cerrudo, chief technology officer at security research company IOActive. Setting a pin on your sim card is recommended, but that won’t help if someone cons your network provider into transferring your number to their device, a scam known as sim-swapping. “SMS-based 2FA is vulnerable to sim-swap attacks,” says Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech.com, “but if it’s the only option, it’s better than no 2FA at all.” Stay secure when away from home There has been much coverage of “juice jacking” of late. This involves a cybercriminal using altered USB charging ports in airports, train stations and hotels to infect your device with malware. You can carry a USB charger that plugs into a power socket or invest in a power-only USB charging cable to prevent this. A more widespread problem is that of free wireless internet access. “Criminals can exploit public wifi to steal your personal information, such as emails, photos, passwords, private documents and bank details,” Oz Alashe, CEO of CybSafe, says. Using a virtual private network (VPN) is recommended to reduce the risk. A VPN app creates an encrypted “tunnel” between your device and a remote server, protecting your data from snooping hackers. If you’re using your phone to check your bank balance or pay bills on the train or in the coffee shop, a VPN provides “a safety blanket that will help keep your data out of the wrong hands”, Matt Lock, technical director at Varonis, says."

          "bodyText": "A decade ago a ride-hailing service called UberCab launched in Silicon Valley. Since then the rebranded Uber has burned through $10bn. It has never made a profit. The business model relies on shareholders to subsidise cheap rides so that the company can squeeze out rivals and establish a monopoly. Uber’s success is that 90 million people now use it in 700 cities around the world. After it floated on the stock market, its two founders became billionaires. While the owners of Uber have become immensely wealthy, the people who drive its cars have paid a heavy price. Unions say that Uber drivers in the UK earn an average of £5 an hour, well below the legal minimum wage of £8.21 for employees aged over 25. They can work up to 30 hours a week before breaking even. Hundreds went on strike in May to protest against poor pay and conditions. Across Britain, gig work – part of a casualised, precarious and on-call jobs market – is growing at a giddy rate. The sector has more than doubled in size since 2016 and now accounts for 4.7 million workers. In part this is due to new technology: people are using apps on their mobile phones to sell their labour. The core business model relies on near-instant recourse to a large pool of on-demand workers looking for their next gig. Uncertain work is becoming the norm, with the result that unemployment statistics look better than the way Britons feel. It is an environment of overwork, marked by intense bursts of exhaustion. One gig-economy firm even tried to market burnout as a lifestyle by claiming its workers were “doers” for whom “sleep deprivation is [their] drug of choice”. Nothing can disguise the fact that the gig economy’s rise has been accompanied by a fall in the fortunes of working households – which now comprise 58% of those below the official poverty line; the figure was 37% in 1995. In a seminal paper, Alex Wood and other researchers at Oxford University found that half of the gig work in the UK is in our streets, supplying food or couriering parcels or offering taxi rides. Cherrypicking workers The other half of gig work is remote – providing digital services, such as data entry and programming, on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer and Fiverr, which act as auction houses for human labour, where people place a bid to do the work on offer. Those in richer nations can find themselves undercut by those in poorer places. In 2017 US freelancers using Upwork netted $27m – only a little more than those in India. Many of the world’s biggest firms use these apps to outsource work to lower costs. Microwork, where tasks are broken down, is dominated by Amazon’s Mechanical Turk division. Two-thirds of its US workers earn less than the federal minimum wage. The office faces a future like that of the factory floor in the 1980s, when work was shipped abroad to save money and boost profits. In his book Humans as a Service, the Oxford academic Jeremias Prassl says the gig economy’s problems – for workers and markets – are driven by firms “presenting themselves as mere intermediaries rather than powerful service providers … [to] shift nearly all of their business risk and cost onto others”. The simplest illustration of this is Uber’s claim that its drivers are not employees – at a stroke this potentially avoids VAT liabilities of £1.5bn. That sort of cash could have been used to pay towards a health service dealing with the fallout from insecure jobs with unpredictable shifts. A landmark study tracking people who lost their jobs in the recession of 2010 found that those who ended up with poor-quality work – with low pay, low autonomy, and high insecurity – had higher chronic stress levels than those who had remained unemployed. Consumer rights are being rewritten – often to the customer’s detriment. People using popular takeaway apps such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo can order from thousands of restaurants without being aware of their poor hygiene ratings. Such practices undermine the trust needed for the market economy to function smoothly. Hidden beneath the claims of autonomy is the fact that the platforms exercise firm control over most aspects of how, and to what standard, work is done. The technology can monitor whether a freelancer is working for the whole time billed. It can detect whether a gig-economy driver brakes too hard. Too many low rankings might see a worker kicked off a platform. Productivity becomes the way to measure human value. Firms can cherrypick workers – usually those without children or in good health. What happens to those who have lives that don’t match the gig economy’s demands? Commercialising spare time In the gig economy, employees are no longer protected by a legal system that was designed for a different age. At present there are three categories of employment status in the UK: employee, worker and independent contractor. Only the first category is entitled to full employment rights, including redundancy payments, parental leave, and protection against unfair dismissal. The second category ought to have their minimum wage and trade union rights protected, as well as paid holiday entitlement. However, gig-economy firms assume their hires to be self-employed contractors, and fight trade unions such as the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) who claim otherwise. In almost every case those in the gig economy have proved that they are in fact workers. It is absurd that judges must protect such labour from forced self-employment. Britain does have labour laws, but they are not fully applied. This allows gig firms to fight claims individually and then just pay off the worker who wins in court without applying the ruling to the wider workforce. The Conservative government offers only cosmetic changes to the rules governing the gig economy. It would be better to regulate platforms properly. For example, the IWGB suggests that Uber’s licence to operate in London could be made conditional on respecting drivers’ employment rights. It ought to be possible for workers to have flexible work without denying them basic rights. Businesses can only compete fairly if employment rules are equally applied and consistently enforced. On a deeper level, the gig economy is erasing what was for many the traditional goal of working: to buy free time. Instead we are being seduced and coerced into thinking that it is good to commercialise our leisure time and possessions. Time to spare? Exchange it for cash by delivering pizza. Your apartment free for a week? Rent it out for extra cash. This will not make us happy. We ought to work and have careers that enable us to focus on our relationships and have soul-enriching pastimes. It cannot be socially good to consider leisure time as a lost commercial opportunity. Unless we can turn away from such thinking, we shall see ourselves acting less like humans and more like companies. • This article was amended on 14 December 2021 to correct some references to employees, workers and independent contractors in line with legal definitions."

          "bodyText": "Greyhound Tom Hanks stars in – and, more intriguingly, scripts – this second world war gangbuster about a naval commander crossing the Atlantic pursued by a fleet of U-boats. The film’s release has been pushed back more than a year already, but that’s presumably to maximise Hanks’s awards chances for this and the Mister Rogers biopic, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood. Elisabeth Shue plays his wife; Stephen Graham co-stars. News of the World Except that Hanks also has this coming up. Six months separate the scheduled releases, but this looks, in many ways, the more obvious silverware shoo-in. Hanks plays Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a travelling newspaper reader who must take an orphaned girl (newcomer Helena Zengel) across the country to live with her remaining living relatives in the aftermath of the US civil war. A fictional period cross-generational road movie isn’t obvious Paul Greengrass fodder, which makes this all the more appealing. Wendy A strikingly belated second film from Benh Zeitlin, whose Beasts of the Southern Wild was Oscar nominated eight years ago, this is a magic-realist spin on Peter Pan, about a young girl “lost on a mysterious island where time and ageing have become unglued”. Shot on Monserrat, this was co-scripted by Zeitlin’s sister, Eliza. Untitled Lila Neugebauer project Following standout support in Widows and If Beale Street Could Talk (plus an unsplashy cameo in Joker), Brian Tyree Henry finally gets a key lead. Jennifer Lawrence co-stars. This is the story of a soldier who suffers a traumatic brain injury in Afghanistan, then struggles to readjust to life back home. The director has worked, until now, exclusively in theatre. The Boys in the Band Mart Crowley’s iconic birthday-party play is brought back to the big screen, this time with the (all-gay) cast of a 2018 Broadway revival, headed by Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto and Matt Bomer. Supernova Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci play a long-term couple touring the north of England in an RV in Harry Macqueen’s second film following his 2014 debut Hinterland. Tucci’s character has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s two years prior to the action, so we’re stockpiling tissues for this one. James Dreyfus makes a welcome return to the screen in the supporting cast. Untitled Paul Thomas Anderson project This likely won’t be ready in time, as it only shoots this spring, but at a push you could be looking at a Christmas 2020 premiere for Paul Thomas Anderson’s first film since The Phantom Thread. No cast has yet been attached, but we’re getting big Boogie Nights energy from the premise, about a high school student, who is also a successful child actor, in 1970s San Fernando Valley. The Souvenir: Part 2 The relationship of Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) and her ghastly, charming lover (Tom Burke) is over. What happens next in the life of Joanna Hogg’s alter ego? And will Tilda Swinton play herself (she knew Hogg at the time, in the early 80s) as well as Julie’s mum? The Souvenir was one of 2019’s cinematic highlights; this looks set to repeat the trick in 2020. Downhill Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus star as a couple whose marriage falters after a misstep on his part during their family skiing holiday. Anyone who has seen Force Majeure, on which this is based, might be slightly alarmed by the prospect of Ferrell in that key scene, but this is still a tempting prospect. Jesse Armstrong has co-scripted alongside directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (the men behind the underrated The Way Way Back, also about a nightmarish vacation). The Father Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman make repeat Oscar bids as an ailing patriarch felled by dementia and his struggling daughter in the big-screen transfer for Florian Zeller’s multi-award-winning play. Four very capable hands in front of the camera; the only alarm bell is that Zeller also directs, in his cinematic debut. Four Good Days Colman’s shock runner-up at last year’s Oscars, Glenn Close, stars in this gruelling drama about a daughter (Mila Kunis) helping her mother through substance abuse recovery. Rodrigo Garcia (Albert Nobbs) directs. Make Up Claire Oakley’s buzzy, low-budget debut is set on a remote Cornish holiday park; a young woman develops a dangerous obsession after suspecting her boyfriend has been unfaithful. The Last Thing He Wanted Mudbound director Dee Rees tackles the Joan Didion memoir about a Washington Post reporter (Anne Hathaway) who quits her job to care for her father (Willem Dafoe) and inherits his position as an arms dealer for the US government in Central America. Ben Affleck co-stars. Rocks Sarah Gavron’s docudrama set on a London estate has already earned rave reviews from Toronto and London film festivals; it finally winds up getting a release in April. Falling Viggo Mortensen’s directorial debut (he also wrote and starsin the film) is about a conservative father (Lance Henriksen) who moves from his rural farm to live with his gay son (Mortensen) and his family in LA. Laura Linney co-stars and David Cronenberg plays a proctologist, naturally. Herself The Iron Lady and Mamma Mia! director Phyllida Lloyd takes two of the stars of the Donmar’s all-female Shakespeare trilogy she helped direct – Harriet Walter and Clare Dunne – and puts them in the story of a young mother who escapes her abusive boyfriend and takes on a broken housing system."

Fen skating, Cambridgeshire – 9 January 2010 14mm lens, 1/1250th f9 ISO 320 The start of the decade brought freezing temperatures across Britain.

I discovered that for the first time since 1997 organised skating races were being held on a flooded field in the Fens. Luckily for me it was a beautiful day and produced scenes that reminded me of a Bruegel painting. It was hard to believe I was in the heart of England. The event hasn’t happened since.

Wherever you look there are pictures to be had both on the course and off. I spotted these two ladies and waited, hoping they would react in some way or another. Luckily for me but unluckily for horse and rider, a horse careered through the railings. Fortunately, everyone emerged unscathed. Track Cycling World Cup, Manchester – 20 February 2011 190mm lens, 1/4th f16 ISO 200 Team pursuit qualifying lasts for more than an hour with teams competing against the clock one at a time. Not exactly thrilling stuff but it meant I had plenty of time to play with slow shutter speeds and lighting. I placed a strobe on the inside of the track and worked on different combinations of slow shutter speed and either keeping the camera still as the cyclists passed or reverse panning. I don’t often get the opportunity to experiment like this during a top event; it was a chance to create virtually my own little studio and have some fun. Swansea mascot, Emirates Stadium – 10 September 2011 500mm lens, 1/1000th f5.6 ISO 800 As the Swansea team gathered for their huddle before kick-off, their young mascot looked disgruntled to be left out. It’s highly unusual to get a sweet, soft picture such as this at a high-profile Premier League match. I remember it was far better than any of the action pictures I took that game. Didier Drogba, Champions League final, Munich – 19 May 2012 500mm lens, 1/800 f4, ISO 2500 In the middle of the penalty shootout, Chelsea were trailing. The players looked dejected except Didier Drogba, who had rescued his side with a late equaliser in normal time. He started to pray. Maybe this paid off as Bayern Munich missed two penalties, leaving Drogba to score the winning spot-kick. Penalty shootouts are great for pictures but very hard to photograph as you need cameras pointing in various places at the same time. There are so many decisions to make quickly and, with such high stakes, you don’t want to make the wrong choice. Chris Hoy, men’s keirin final, London Olympics – 7 August 2012 420mm lens, 1/800th f4, ISO 2000 This was the day Chris Hoy beat Steve Redgrave’s record to become Britain’s greatest Olympian in terms of gold medals. So I wanted to illustrate this by going tight on his face and the beautiful medal. It was imperative to get a dark background that showed off the medal to its best. He is such a gentleman that after posing for the photos he thanked us all. Not many top sportsmen do that. Mo Farah, men’s 5,000m final, London Olympics – 11 August 2012 200mm lens, 1/800 f5, ISO 1600 When setting up for the final session of athletics in the main stadium, I knew the story of the night would be if Mo Farah completed the historic double of 10,000m and 5,000m victories. I managed to bag a decent spot for a tight shot of him crossing the line, so I set up a remote camera with a wider angle designed specifically to include a lot of the crowd. As the race was run at 7.30pm I knew there would be plenty of daylight to light up the stands. I was trying to create a frame that wasn’t just about an individual winning. More I wanted a feeling of national jubilation, a united Britain, celebrating the wonderful achievements of a Somali immigrant. I look back at this frame now and wonder how times have changed. Ellie Simmonds, women’s S6 400m freestyle final, London Paralympics – 1 September 2012 500mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 2500 Just after finishing her race and realising she had won, Ellie Simmonds started to sob. She had been in a titanic battle with the American Victoria Arlen, definitely the best race I saw at the Aquatics Centre that summer. The then teenager was one of the faces of the London Paralympics and endured enormous pressure after being so successful in Beijing four years earlier. The Kop spells it out, Liverpool v Manchester United – 23 September 2012 58mm lens, 1/500 f5, ISO 640 In September that year, the Hillsborough Independent Panel revealed for the first the full scale of the establishment cover-up of the 1989 disaster. Liverpool’s following home game was against Manchester United. Just before kick-off the Kop formed a mosaic. I stood right next to the goal so I could shoot straight into the Kop as the players lined up to start. Sir Alex Ferguson, The Hawthorns – 9 May 2013 640mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 400 Sir Alex Ferguson gestures to Manchester United’s fans immediately after the 5-5 draw at West Brom – his final match before retiring. I wanted to get in very close to his face, so I put a 1.4x converter on my 500mm lens. I should have known Fergie wouldn’t shed a tear, he is far too hard for that. But I liked this determined and strong final pose as his players applauded behind him. Unfortunately for me this day will also be remembered for the local steward who placed himself in front of Ferguson as he bowed on the pitch thus ruining it for the mass of photographers. He then went on to shake the United manager’s hand. You can imagine the earful we gave that steward afterwards. Andy Murray, men’s singles final, Wimbledon – 7 July 2013 300mm lens, 1/1000 f5.6, ISO 400 Early that day I was interviewed by Wimbledon TV and asked how I would react if Andy Murray won. I said I didn’t quite know and didn’t really want to know; I tried to block it out of my mind by saying Novak Djokovic would be victorious. This was me trying to take my own emotions out of the final. So that afternoon, when my prediction was proved decisively wrong, I reverted to auto-pilot, using my experience of covering nearly 20 finals there. This is one of my favourites – the expression on his face, picked out by the sunlight as he finally gets his hands on the famous trophy, a mixture of relief, joy and possibly disbelief. I look back at this and think that day was really something special. England win the Ashes, Durham – 12 August 2013 82mm lens, 1/800 f6.3, ISO 400 Australian batsman Peter Siddle lobs a catch straight to Jimmy Anderson at mid-off to give England the match and victory in the series. A few minutes earlier I was positioned straight on to the wicket at ground level where most of the other photographers were, when the most gorgeous evening light broke through threatening storm clouds. The view at Durham, over the pitch and across to Lumley Castle, is one of the best in cricket so I took a gamble and moved into the stands. As the final wicket fell I got this picture. My next frame was completely blocked by the arms of celebrating spectators. Luis Suárez advert, Copacabana Beach, Brazil – 25 June 2014 50mm lens, 1/200 f2.8, ISO 1250 It was the day after the infamous Suárez bite in the Uruguay v Italy World Cup match. So as the controversy started to engulf the tournament, I headed back to a strange advert I had noticed a couple of weeks earlier, hopeful that something may be happening there. I wasn’t disappointed; it was great fun seeing fans from all over the world posing in different ways. I shot the pictures and filed them quickly. The response on social media to that simple gallery was amazing. Apparently it was even trending on Twitter in Paris. Men’s squash final, Glasgow Commonwealth Games – 28 July 2014 44mm lens, 1/1600 f3.5, ISO 5000 I managed to blag a shooting position right ‘by the tin’ shooting low down through the glass wall. As the final went on, I shifted position from the forehand side to the backhand. I realised by putting my lens right up against a glass-supporting strut in front of me I could achieve an amazing reflection. It wasn’t like a mirror, which is opaque, as you could also see through it. All I had to do was wait for the action to occur in exactly the right spot. I have been accused of tampering with this image in Photoshop. I admit it’s hard to work out but I swear it hasn’t been altered. Firstly, I am not allowed by my editorial code to do that but I’m also rubbish at Photoshop and don’t posses the necessary skills. Also this final was tight on deadline which meant I had to file immediately after the match, giving me no time for any retouching. Men’s 10,000m final, Glasgow Commonwealth Games – 1 August 2014 70mm lens, 1/2000 f5, ISO 200 It was a golden, sunlit evening in Glasgow, a rare occurrence that I had to make the most of. For a couple of hours I walked around the stadium, working on angles, trying to find the best spots to shoot the lengthening shadows. Luckily the 10,000m final was at exactly the right time. The light was perfect for only a few laps before the sun disappeared behind the back of the stands. Michael Kacer, Invictus Games, Lee Valley Athletics Centre – 11 September 2014 102mm lens, 1/1600 f2.8, ISO 500 When I headed off to the first day of the inaugural Invictus Games, I wasn’t sure what to make of it. But when I saw this veteran with one arm missing, a scar down the side of his face and distinctive contact lenses, I knew I could get a striking image. Lying down behind the shot put circle enabled me to shoot up and use the cloudy sky as a clean background. I also had the lens wide open to throw all the focus on to that amazing, determined face. Rafael Nadal’s sweat drops, Wimbledon – 3o June 2015 700mm lens, 1/1250 f5.6, ISO 400 Rafael Nadal was struggling to beat a low-ranked opponent during an early round on the No 1 Court. It was the hottest day of the year and I had noticed at the change of ends how the sweat was pouring off him while reaching down to pick up a drink by his chair. By putting a converter on my lens I could get in really tight to his face, isolating the drops. Japan v South Africa, Rugby World Cup, Brighton – 19 September 2015 500mm lens 1/1250 f4.5 ISO 2500 Like everyone else that day, I was expecting an easy Springbok victory. The ground at Brighton was very cramped and, as Japan had many photographers there, I was quite happy to plump for a position shooting South Africa attack for both halves. I just couldn’t believe it, watching the winning try from the other end of the pitch. Luckily getting this picture helped soothe the disappointment of not being in the right place in the final minute. Carnage at the Chair, Grand National, Aintree – 9 April 2016 70mm lens 1/5000 f4 ISO 2000 I have a well-rehearsed plan at the Grand National – one that gives me as many angles and viewpoints as possible. Part of this strategy involves putting a couple of remote cameras at the largest fence on the course. That year I had a camera placed either side of the landing area. It was a filthy day, which meant the ground was soft and the horses were tiring. Luckily one of the remotes captured the moment Nina Carberry flew off her horse Sir Des Champs. For 25 years I had photographed the Chair during the Grand National, hoping one day my perseverance would pay off, and that day it did: this frame won best sports picture at the World Press Photo awards. West Ham v Manchester United, the final goal at the Boleyn Ground – 10 May 2016 24mm lens 1/100 f8 ISO 2500 From my position, low down and by the dug-outs, I knew I wouldn’t have a good angle to achieve an historic reminder of the final game. So I managed to get permission to clamp a remote camera high up on the scaffolding supporting the temporary TV studio. Here I could see it all – the ground, the pitch, the players, the lights, the fans. It was a huge stroke of luck for me that the final and winning goal, scored by West Ham’s Winston Reid, happened at the right end. As I always try to say to myself: “If you don’t try you never get.” Wales v England, Euro 2016 match, Lens – 16 June 2016 200mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 1000 This made me laugh. Seeing a solitary England fan, dressed proudly in his replica kit from the early 90s, marooned amongst a sea of proud, scarlet-clad Welshmen. I just wish I’d seen his reaction when England scored their winning goal. England may have been victorious that day but they departed the tournament in disgrace losing to Iceland, while Wales went on to the dizzy heights of the semi-finals. Serena Williams, women’s singles final, Wimbledon – 9 July 2016 300mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 640 Without doubt my favourite woman to photograph. I have found it very difficult to pick out my best image of Serena from the last decade. Eventually I plumped on this one, her beating Angelique Kerber in the Wimbledon final of 2016. I wanted a picture that demonstrated her power, strength and determination. On Centre Court some photographers have fantastic seats, low down and very close to the action. When Serena doesn’t hold back like this you can really feel the force. Men’s synchro diving final, Rio Olympics – 8 August 2016 70mm lens 1/8000 f6.3 ISO 200 This is Britain’s Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow competing outside at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre. Above the top board I noticed a load of scaffolding and metal poles. It looked really messy, almost as if the divers were jumping off a building site. Poor planning and a lack of money meant many venues had a half-finished feel to them. The weather that day was a bit overcast with the sun struggling to break through. I wanted a bit of colour to this picture so I tweaked the colour balance of my camera to warm it up and give this smoggy feel. Great Britain v China, men’s team fencing, Rio Olympics – 12 August 2016 120mm lens 1/2000 f4.5 ISO 3200 (double exposure) Olympic fencing is one of my favourite events to cover. It is theatrically and dramatically lit which means photographers can have a lot of fun experimenting with exposures and shutter-speeds. Also it’s not one of the high-profile events where the pressure is on not to miss a vital moment. I managed to work out how I could combine in the camera two frames in a striking multiple exposure. The colours of the different pistes, allied with the contrasting angles, created an image that reminded me of the Union Jack. It was just a matter of time and practice before finally getting the fencers in the right place. Women’s beam final, Rio Olympics – 15 August 2016 44mm lens 1/2000 f4 ISO 3200 The diminutive Fan Yilin from China competes on the beam during the apparatus finals in Rio. She is only 4ft 10in tall so I deliberately shot this image with a wider view to emphasise her tiny frame especially when leaping high. Gymnastics is one of those sports I rarely get to photograph, so it’s refreshing to work on something different. Infrared image of Wimbledon – 10 July 2017 24mm lens 1/1000 f9 ISO 400 I had seen images taken with infrared cameras by landscape photographers and had noticed how it rendered colours, especially greens, in a unique fashion. Knowing Wimbledon was a sea of greens, I thought it might be interesting to see what could happen. I also wanted to show a place that is so familiar in a very different, almost surreal way. I got a normal Canon 7D camera which had the sensor adapted to read only infrared light and then produced a gallery of images taken around the grounds during the fortnight. In this image of Court Two, the eventual women’s champion Garbiñe Muguruza is volleying against Angelique Kerber. Nafi Thiam, World Athletics Championships, London – 5 August 2017 400mm lens 1/4000 f4 ISO 400 The Belgian Olympic heptathlon champion, Nafi Thiam, was a model of consistency, easily winning her competition at the world championships. Her long braided hair makes for great pictures, but it’s especially graphic in the high jump. For me it was just a case of getting the background clean and waiting for the sun to come out so as to light up her face and hair perfectly. Usain Bolt’s agony in his final race, London – 11 August 2017 400mm lens 1/1600 f3.5 ISO 4000 It was Usain Bolt’s final race before retirement and everyone expected him to go out in a blaze of glory. I was tracking him as he sprinted down the home straight when suddenly he pulled up with an injury. It was a sad end for such a huge global superstar, an athlete who has provided so many amazing moments for me as well as the sporting public. José Mourinho, Stamford Bridge – 20 October 2018 560mm lens 1/5000 f4 ISO 800 Recently I wrote an article welcoming back José after being appointed Spurs manager. In it I mentioned this picture and how one of my Twitter followers compared it to the Caravaggio painting The Taking of Christ. That tweet went a bit crazy for a while. I thought that bizarre enough but this month the tale had another quirky twist. Again on Twitter I was told this picture, or rather Caravaggio’s, was a perfect example of the Fibonacci spiral. He was a famous 12th century Italian mathematician who invented the Fibonacci sequence which stated each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This applied to art is an expression of the Rule of Thirds – a principle that gives a more appealing flow to an image. What makes this even stranger is the person telling me about Fibonacci was Carol Decker, the lead singer of the 80s pop group T’Pau! England win the Cricket World Cup, Lord’s – 14 July 2019 600mm lens 1/1600 f5.6 ISO 800 More than five months later and I still can’t believe what I witnessed that day at Lord’s. Compiling this decade review has given me the chance to revisit some wonderful moments – but nothing compares to this. For sheer sporting drama it takes the gold medal. England beating New Zealand to win the World Cup off the very last ball of a super over, with the teams tied after 50 overs each. I remember taking a deep breath before that final ball, trying to get my heart rate down, and then just trusting my instincts. Fortunately the run-out happened at the right end for me and I managed to get it. South Africa lift the Rugby World Cup, Yokohama – 2 November 2019 400mm lens 1/1600 f4 ISO 3200 This was a day of mixed emotions for me. For obvious reasons I had wanted England to win the final but I always try to put personal feelings aside when I’m shooting a game – it’s my job to be a neutral observer. The key picture, as it so often is, was the trophy lift. This one had far greater significance. Siya Kolisi, the first black player to captain his country, raising the Webb Ellis Cup aloft. For many years rugby was the sport of the white minority, with black players banned from playing under the apartheid regime. Kolisi had been born into extreme poverty but here he was lifting the trophy up and becoming an inspiration, a beacon of hope for a troubled country."

          "headline": "How a decade of disillusion gave way to people power",
          "bodyText": "As I write, immense protests are taking place in India against the new anti-Muslim law and Hong Kong activists, who have been protesting for their own rights for months, stand in solidarity with the Uighur people being persecuted on the other side of China. The decade will end in protest. But who can look back a decade when a week in Trump time is like a century, and hardly anyone can remember the overstuffed chaos of the month before, let alone 2017, to say nothing of the remote era before he was president? Seriously, people keep forgetting what came before, which is why they fail to recognise patterns, consequences and the real power of movements. For instance, the wave of feminism called #MeToo is often treated as a sudden eruption out of nowhere when in fact it came out of a very specific somewhere: a ferocious upsurge of global feminism over the past decade that had been spawning news, protests, hashtags and action about feminism before #MeToo in 2017. That upsurge was itself the culmination of feminist analysis and action for decades before. All that happened in October of 2017 was that movie stars got involved. But my real fear is that the 2010s will, like the 1980s, be misremembered through oversimplification. People dismissively say the 1980s were “Reagan”, as though several billion people on several continents were one reactionary old white man in America. Ronald Reagan was horrible, and his regime launched the reversal of decades of progress towards economic equality and security in the United States. But beyond and all around, the 1980s saw remarkable activism with immediate consequences – the overthrow of the Marcos regime in the Philippines through people power in 1986, the overthrow of the South Korean military dictatorship in 1987, the toppling of the whole eastern bloc of Soviet states in 1989, the beginning of the end of the apartheid era in South Africa (and powerful but unsuccessful uprisings in Burma and China). But a lot of groundwork was also laid for what was to come, with feminism, Aids activism and queer rights organising, and the beginning of a profound shift toward recognising racial and social issues in the environmental movement. Even deeper than that was the evolution of new, inclusive, less hierarchical, nonviolent organising strategies that rejected some of the failed tactics and principles of past activism and have been important ingredients in movements ever since. So one could dismiss this decade as the rise of Donald J Trump and authoritarians around the world (and yes, there have been plenty of them, from the Philippines to Hungary). But there have also been plenty of moves in the opposite direction. If protests had a slow start in the teens, they woke up fast with the Arab spring in January of 2011, one of the most powerful waves of anti-authoritarianism the world has ever seen. Regimes toppled in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, with protests spreading from Sudan to Iraq. Of course the Syrian version turned into the long nightmare of civil war, and many of the nations involved in the Arab spring did not end up better in any simple way. But the protests made clear that even dictators backed by armies are not invulnerable, that ordinary people together sometimes have extraordinary power, that the longing for democracy is powerful in the Islamic world and that history is sometimes written by the vanquished when they cease to be vanquished. In October of the same year came Occupy Wall Street. The feminist upheaval has been global, with significant eruptions in Chile, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Kenya and beyond in this decade. And Occupy was influenced by the Arab spring and anti-capitalist movements in Greece and elsewhere. And eventually outposts of Occupy were established in cities from Kyoto to Auckland to small towns in Alaska. The climate movement grew in power, reach and sophistication, often led by indigenous people, from the Arctic to Ecuador to the South Pacific and beyond. It became a powerful force that needs to grow yet more so in the next year and needs to win in the next decade. But what has been more important than any single movement in this decade is disillusionment – and I mean that in the positive sense: of letting go of illusions. Black Lives Matter, founded in 2013, and other anti-racist movements around the world shattered the sense that racism was over and linear progress was trustworthy and inevitable. Feminism went deeper into the nature of oppression and rose higher in its demands for equality. Same-sex marriage came into law in Argentina, Mexico, Iceland and Portugal in 2010, followed by many other countries including Britain and the US later in the decade. And the question of what equality meant for LGBTQ people also went deeper. So did questions about how gender is constructed and deconstructed as trans rights grew in visibility. What lay underneath all this disillusionment was a readiness to question foundations that had been portrayed as fixed, inevitable, unquestionable – whether that foundation was gender norms, heterosexuality, patriarchy, white supremacy, the age of fossil fuels or capitalism. To see beyond what we had seen before, or to change the “we” whose perceptions define the real, the important and the possible. With this came a capacity to understand more complex, subtle and hidden forms of oppression, and to think – encapsulated in that beautifully valuable word, contributed in 1989 by law scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw intersectionally – about how multiple identities overlap (and thus do multiple forms of oppression or privilege). The decade began in the wake of global economic collapse, and Occupy Wall Street was one of the reactions to the sheer greed, destructiveness and shortsightedness of the financial system. That the current economic arrangements don’t work for ordinary people has also prompted protests that don’t fit into a left framework. These included the gilets jaunes protests in France, the people who voted for Trump in the belief that he was an economic populist and the British voters who said yes to Brexit because they felt the system didn’t work for them. A surprising late-in-the-decade form of resistance has arisen among the employees at Facebook, Amazon and Google, protesting aspects of their corporations’ amorality. Employees at all three walked out as part of the September climate strike. The climate movement is inevitably an anti-capitalist movement. That capitalism is the best or only way to do things was, in the triumphalism after the collapse of the Soviet Union, affirmed again and again. That mood fell apart in the wake of episode after episode of corruption, destruction and failure – and the rise of a young generation ready to rethink the alternatives and, often, embrace versions of socialism. The nonviolent strategist George Lakey argues that polarisation brings clarity and a volatility that makes positive change more possible. We have the polarisation and the disillusionment, and with perspective about how we got here and when we won, we can claim the possibilities in the decade to come. • Rebecca Solnit is an author and journalist.

          "bodyText": "The year that is just coming to an end was the nearly year. There was nearly a global recession. There was nearly a full-blown trade war between the US and China. And Britain nearly left the European Union. In the event, none of things happened and 2019 will go down in history as one of those that are soon forgotten. Unless, of course, it proves to be like 1913, one of those when – in retrospect, at least – it is possible to see the signs of a perfect storm brewing. All the elements that might constitute an almighty downpour in 2020 were visible as the old year drew to an end, with December witnessing four events that will help to shape the coming 12 months. The first of these, chronologically at least, was the neutering of the World Trade Organization as a body that can settle disputes between its member states. The WTO’s appellate body needs to have three judges in post in order to function, but in early December found itself down to just one because the US has refused to sanction replacements when existing judges come to the end of their terms. This may sound arcane, but it is a body blow to the multilateral trading system. The second event was the UK general election, which resulted in a convincing victory for Boris Johnson’s Conservative party. Until 12 December, the question of whether Brexit would actually go ahead remained in doubt. That is no longer the case. The UK will leave the EU on 31 January 2020, and the government says it is confident that it can conclude a trade deal with Brussels before the end of the year. That looks to be an extremely tight – some would say impossibly ambitious – timetable, with bags of potential for problems at a time when neither the UK nor the eurozone economies looks especially healthy. Event number three was the lack of any significant progress at the COP25 climate change meeting in Madrid, a failure that was brought into sharp relief by the ongoing heatwave in Australia, which has seen temperatures hit record levels. The final piece of big news as 2019 drew to a close was the strength of financial markets. Global bourses were boosted by the first signs of a de-escalation in the trade dispute between the US and China, and by the knowledge that the world’s leading central banks have absolutely no intention of raising interest rates any time soon. Central bank governors such as Mark Carney at the Bank of England and Christine Lagarde at the European Central Bank have been telling banks, pension funds and insurance companies that they need to take account of the risks posed by climate change: for now the markets are far more focused on when Donald Trump and Xi Jinping will sign a phase-one trade agreement. The benign view of 2020 goes as follows. After a rocky patch in 2019, global growth is starting to pick up and will continue to be supported by loose monetary policy. Trump will kick off his re-election campaign by announcing a trade deal with China and share prices will keep going up. Alternatively, 2020 is the year when the chickens start coming home to roost. Financial markets work out that the trade war between Washington and Beijing is going to be long and bitter. Central banks prove to have limited ammunition when growth starts to disappoint. Negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal turns out to be much tougher than Johnson expects. Evidence of the worsening climate emergency continues to mount. The crisis at the WTO becomes symbolic of a backlash against globalisation. It would be folly to assume that all will turn out well next year. The world could be heading for economic, financial and environment crises. Rarely has it looked less well-equipped to cope. Retailers need to think outside the Boxing Day sales Whither the Boxing Day sales? The era of 24-hour online shopping means the traditional 26 December spree is no longer the fierce scrum over discounted coats and boots it once was. This year, crowds were some 9% smaller than in 2018, according to retail analyst Springboard – a disappointing showing not helped by heavy rain soaking parts of the country. But if retailers want to blame anyone for Boxing Day looking shop-soiled, they should look no further than themselves. Sales are not the gold dust they once were; indeed, some struggling fashion chains have been running promotions since the autumn. The diehards were still queuing at dawn on Thursday morning, outside Next of all places, but that is because the chain’s anti-discounting stance makes its sale actually worth getting out of bed for. For shoppers, the imported US phenomenon of Black Friday, which predominantly plays out online rather than in-store, is the latest thing. This year, the late-November promotional blitz appears to have pulled forward spending that would traditionally have taken place in December, leaving consumers with less money in hand now. Shops can open for long hours in the run-up to Christmas. The frenzied buildup is hard for staff, many of whom earn the minimum wage, and the stress takes its toll on family life. In a poll by trade union Usdaw, three-quarters of shopworkers said they ended up spending too little time with their loved ones. The old retail playbooks are dead, so perhaps a new decade requires fresh thinking. Social media chatter suggests members of the public are sympathetic to stores remaining closed on Boxing Day, for instance. So maybe retail managers should listen and give their staff a well-deserved day off. Rail passengers deserve better Only the distractions of elections, Brexit and Christmas, allied with rock-bottom expectations, can have saved the rail industry from more ignominious headlines. On at least four franchises – Northern, TransPennine, South Western, West Midlands – punctuality has plummeted and disruption has become a daily norm. Rail leaders professed to have learned the lessons of 2018’s chaotic timetable change, but similar failings have been apparent again: in the West Midlands since this May’s timetable overhaul, and across the north, where new trains were supposed to underpin a new December timetable. Throw strikes on South Western into the mix and passenger misery is all but complete – awaiting only a further above-inflation fare rise to take effect on Thursday. Paralysis in Whitehall, which has been largely devoted to ameliorating the self-inflicted pain of Brexit, is obviously not unique to transport. But rail has had its own particular alibi for inaction: the Williams review, inspiring a 15-month bout of navel-gazing, contemplating its own implosion. Even the most fervent advocates of privatisation now accept that the current franchise system isn’t working. The big question is whether what comes after franchises will be any better. Former BA boss Keith Williams has noted, before the publication of his review, the importance of accountability. As mayors call for train operators to be penalised for shoddy service, those firms – though far from blameless – can justly point to delayed infrastructure works and consequent problems with rolling stock and crew training – not to mention franchise specifications that made strikes inevitable. On-the-ground problems will not be solved by a remote restructuring. But an overarching body running an integrated railway, removed from ministers or lawyers, will encourage straight talking about where the problems lie – and how they can be best resolved before passengers lose faith entirely."

          "bodyText": "The Anangu traditional owners of Uluru receive only a quarter of the millions of dollars in entry fees paid by tourists who visit the national park. But they have made that 25% go far. At Mutitjulu, the small Pitjantjatjara community on the “other” side of Uluru, the community saved for years to build and run a swimming pool. The Tjurpinytjaku pool officially opened in 2013 and clocked up about 6,700 visits last season in a community of only 350. The pool is a safe and healthy place for kids to play, brings relief from extreme temperatures and helps reduce skin and respiratory infections. The “Yes pool, yes school” program helped boost class attendance rates and it is also a haven for the elderly and mobility impaired, with a electric hoist for easy access to the water. Each year the traditional owners of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park allocate some of their rent income to community development projects in communities across the region where the park’s traditional owners live. Last year Anangu at Mutitjulu approved just under $1m for three projects. The main one was to keep the pool going for another four years. Running a public pool is expensive in the suburbs, let alone in a remote location in central Australia where water is a precious resource. But the joy it brings is clear. Building an inma (dance) ground in the area in front of the pool at Mutitjulu will be a significant project for 2020. The rent money also supported dialysis patients across the region. Traditional owners invested just over $500,000 in a project run by the Purple House dialysis clinic. The park’s broader traditional owner group approved $997,820 for five projects over two years. Ara Irritja is a three-year project to put computers in eight communities and train Anangu to collect and preserve history, culture, stories and language. It will also fund primary and secondary education opportunities for young people, as well as bush culture camps, a new cool room for the remote community of Imanpa, and restoring the church at Pukaja (Ernabella). Traditional owners have decided these projects are important. Across the region Uluru traditional owners are paying to upgrade cemeteries, building fences and finding and marking graves. Two months on from the historic closure of the climb at Uluru, the traditional owners say they are happy that new tourism opportunities will be open to visitors. “Uluru and Kata Tjuta are surrounded by beautiful places, by many homelands and so much Tjukurpa. We want to take people into this beautiful country,” a traditional owner and chairman of the Central Land Council, Sammy Wilson, said. “More and more people are coming on tours to learn from us Anangu. I enjoy people asking about and wanting to learn about our country.” Parks Australia, which runs the Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park, has foreshadowed an increase in visitor fees to the park from November 2020. The fee has not gone up in 16 years. A spokesperson for the council, which helps traditional owners manage their rent money through its community development program, says any increase in money received by Anangu either from higher gate fees or an increased share of the gate fees “will help to support more Anangu initiatives”."

          "bodyText": "A dramatic ending to Sportwatch tonight. They rarely fail to deliver, the Sydney Smashes, and it’s the Sixers who emerge, pretty in pink, against the Thunder. A blistering start had the Thunder in command, before a run of wickets saw the previously undefeated side pull up a little short total-wise, posting just 149, despite another Ferguson half-century. The Sixers in contrast started slowly, before Dan Hughes and Moises Henriques got things moving. Their respective departures left it all to be done - before enter Tom Curran. 12 off his first three deliveries faced to set up a blockbuster super over finish. He then turned round and got it done with the ball as well - seeing the Sixers home by just one run, despite Alex Hales late heroics. A thriller in Sydney. 34,000+ going home happy. Even those in green couldn’t fault that game for drama. And that’s Sportwatch! They’ve been in their share of super overs throughout the Big Bash, but they don’t win too many, the Sixers. They have this time though! And it’s a hugely relieved Moises Henriques chatting post-game. “We almost batted ourselves out of the contest, but thanks to TC (Curran) - five out of six yorkers at the death, that’s why they pay him the big bucks.” It’s the final ball, and Curran jams it in full and wide. Hales gets bat on it and it races away, but he can only get four. They’ve won it at the death, in a super over - the Sydney Sixers. Take a bow, Tom Curran - he’s done it with the bat, and now he’s done it with the ball! 2/16 beats 0/15. Hales brave with 11* off 3. But the early singles proving too costly. Big Bash Super Over: Thunder 0/11 (0.5), Khawaja 4*, Hales 7* And it is the experienced Usman Khawaja who gets the nod from the Thunder, to open with Hales at the other end. Curran waits at the top of his mark, ball in hand. First delivery. Khawaja shuffles across and thumps through cover for two. The opener tries the ramp, but they only get one. What can Hales come up with. Curran jams in at the toes - they push for two, but Hales slips, and they only get one! Four off the first three balls. It’s not enough. Thirteen off three needed. Blockhole again - and Khawaja can only manage one! It’s two sixes or game over. And Hales duly delivers the first! Curran gets it up there, but it’s just on the volley, and he crashes it back over the Englishman’s head for six!! And while we wait for the deliberations from both sides, how’s this from the late fixture of the W-League: So - another conference. Who to bowl? Who to bat? Sixers put up Tom Curran once again. But who will face him? Perhaps the skipper Ferguson puts himself in, with the master-blaster Hales? Big Bash Super Over: Sixers 1/16 (1), Henriques 14*, Hughes 1* Can you believe that! First ball, there’s a feather edge and Curran is gone, caught behind!! In comes Dan Hughes. The most auspicious of starts for the Thunder - and the man who single-handedly got the Sixers back in the contest goes for a duck. It’s a wide second up, before a single from Hughes. Here’s Henriques - and first ball is a ramp for four! He then gets two. And next ball - it’s a reverse-ramp six!! He catches the back of the bat, and it’s flown for six. Did he mean that?! Almost certainly not. It was Maxwell-esque! Morris shakes his head and offers a wry smile. The Sixers close it with a wild scamper. Add in overthrows - and they’ve got themselves to 16. My, oh my. What a dramatic end to this Sydney Smash! They rarely fail. Now Callum Ferguson has to decide who will bowl the super over. He confers with Usman Khawaja. The bowling coach Shane Bond gathers his quicks to talk tactics. After 20 overs a piece, it all comes down to these six balls each. Who bats for the Sixers - presumably Curran and Henriques? It’s Chris Morris with the ball for the Thunder - and Curran and Henriques with the bat for the Sixers. Big Bash: Sixers 7/149 (20), Dwarshuis 2*, Curran 35 It’s Tremain with the last over - first ball, and Curran thumps it for six!! They need 10 off five - but the next one is a dot, Curran plays and misses. Good bowling from Tremain who gets it in the blockhole, but they scramble for two, with all the fielders deep. Eight off three needed. Dwarshuis runs like the wind, they get two again. Then Curran jams out an attempted yorker - and it races to the boundary!! Two more off the last ball needed. Curran sweeps it - they race for two, but they don’t make it back!! Ties are scored. We are going to a super over. Big Bash: Sixers 6/134 (19), Dwarshuis 2*, Curran 20* Curran smashes the first ball to the boundary. Morris slams in an ugly one, Curran gets it on the toe of the bat, and Ferguson climbs for the catch - but it trickles out of the hand! That could have been spectacular. Big let off for the Sixers. Dwarshuis swings at a few, but he’s not the man the Sixers want on strike at this stage, as he trickles through for one. An LBW appeal on Curran - not out! Morris bowls well at the death, at Curran gets just the one off the last. Was that the over that wins it for the Thunder? 16 needed to win the Sydney Smash in front of 34,000. Big Bash: Sixers 6/127 (18), Dwarshuis 1*, Curran 14* In comes the left-handed Dwarshuis, and he gets off the mark with a single. Good delivery from Sams cramps Curran in the crease, but they scurry for two. It’s a lovely slower ball wide for a crucial dot ball, and then just a single. Great death bowling - just five off it, but the crucial wicket of Henriques as well. 23 from 12 the runs needed now. Big Bash: Wicket! Sixers 6/122 (17.1), Henriques 44 Henriques looks to go after Sams first ball - but he holes out! It’s a tricky catch in the deep as Ferguson almost loses it in the lights. What a terrific catch in the context - and the skipper goes! What a response from the Thunder. Big Bash: Sixers 5/122 (17), Henriques 41*, Curran 12* Wicket! Edwards looks to go big, but he holes out in the deep. A fine catch from Chris Green, who picks that one out of the lines. Edwards goes for 17. Did the batsmen cross? The umpires say no, and send Henriques to the non-strikers end. Morris lobs a floater outside off and Curran crashes that for four. Then he clips it off his toes for four! A touch of inside edge - that’s very hard on the bowler. And then he smashes him through cover! 12 off three balls - has Tom Curran just turned this contest?! 28 off 18 the equation now. Big Bash: Sixers 4/108 (16), Henriques 40*, Edwards 17* Henriques looks to go after Cook, but he can’t get hold of him cleanly. A big miss off a full toss, before a brace of dot balls late in the over. He finishes with figures of 1/18 off four, Cook. Throw in that first over wicket and that’s a terrific contribution from the spinner. The equation moves to 41 off 24. They need a big over here, the Sixers. Big Bash: Sixers 4/104 (15), Henriques 36*, Edwards 16* So, WinViz had the Thunder at 60% likely winners - I’m not sure it’s that clear cut, especially with Henriques still lurking with intent. Edwards slashes one through cover for four, but it’s singles everywhere else. The skipper tries the lap-shot on the last ball, but he retains the strike. Big Bash: Sixers 4/89 (13), Henriques 31*, Edwards 6* Let’s stay with the Sydney Smash now for the remainder of Sportwatch, as we get to the business end of this one. This is some scratchy stuff from the Sixers, as Henriques calls the tactical timeout with his young colleague, Edwards. 61 off 42 is the equation. Still very gettable, but you’d imagine if the Thunder can get Henriques this could get very interesting, very quickly. Big Bash: Wicket! Sixers 4/72 (10), Henriques 21*, Silk 2 And could that be decisive?! That’s terrific fielding from Green - Silk hits it nicely looking to roll for two, but the fielder flies in from the rope and hits the stumps clean - and he’s run out! The skipper’s still there, but Dan Hughes’ nothing play against the spinner has turned this contest right around. They only need about 80 off the final ten overs - it’s still very gettable, but not if the wickets keep falling! Big Bash: Sixers 2/57 (8), Hughes 36*, Henriques 10* Morris picks up the opener Philippe for what feels a sluggish 11 off 17, bringing the skipper to the crease. Dan Hughes at the other end looking very tidy though - no sixes but six fours as he strikes at over 150. It’s been a controlled innings so far - can he be the man for the Sixers? 90 + 5 min: Jay O’Shea twists and turns and works a cross into the box - but it’s headed over. Thurgate again sprints clear - he’s one-on-one, but this time Young makes up the ground and gets there first. There’s the whistle, and in a game both sides desperately needed to win, neither has. A-League - 90 + 3 min: And now at the other end, it’s Moss saving from the former Jet O’Donovan. It was a tepid encounter early on, but this has really come alive - what a dramatic last 5-10 minutes we’ve seen! Brisbane with back-to-back corners, can they capitalise here? A-League - 89 min: This is great pressure from Newcastle. Petratos wins a corner after superb energy. Miller recycles a ball back into the box and Ben Kantarovski rises highest - he fires a header goalwards.. but the giant paw of Young keeps it out! That’s a superb save from the Brisbane ‘keeper! A-League - Goal! Newcastle Jets 1-1 Brisbane Roar (Inman) 87 min: And right on cue, that’s a belter from Brisbane! He swivels on the edge of the box, Brad Inman, and swings the right boot through it sweetly, and that fires past Moss and down off the crossbar. They’re back level - we’ve got a blockbuster finish in Newcastle all of a sudden! A-League - 86 min: Matt Miller does well in defence as Inman again looked the X-factor for the Roar. They have to be careful not to drop too deep and invite Brisbane back into the contest. Big Bash: Sixers 1/22 (4), Philippe 9*, Hughes 13* It’s hardly the blistering start we saw from the Thunder, but it’s steady enough stuff from the Sixers after that disappointing first over. Hughes finds the boundary off Tremain and looks to be the one to make things happening here for the cross-town rivals. A-League - 79 min: It’s an error at the back and Thurgate is clean through one-on-one with the Roar ‘keeper Young. Who saves! It’s a strong hand from the experienced custodian, but you have to say the youngster’s butchered that. They should have clinched it there, the Jets! A-League - 73 min: And finally, the face on the bench everyone was expecting, as former fan favourite, Roy “the boy” O’Donovan comes on for Brisbane Roar. A few boos from the crowd, Amadi-Holloway trots to the sideline. Didn’t he write some chapters in the famous blue and red of Newcastle, the well-travelled Irishman. The home fans will be hoping he doesn’t have another narrative handy today. Big Bash: Wicket! Sixers 1/2 (1), Kerr 0, Philippe 1* A dream first over from Jono Cook who dismisses the opener Kerr for a duck, after three consecutive dot balls. As run chases go, it’s not the most auspicious of starts for the Sixers, but there’s still plenty of balls to face and not an insurmountable total to run down. A-League - 68 min: Topor-Stanley with a key near-post intervention after second-half substitute Inman does well down the left. Amadi-Holloway can’t quite find the finish, but credit the experienced defender there. A-League - 60 min: The onus is on the Roar to make the running, but they have to be careful not to leave themselves overcommitted and exposed on the counter. They’ve grown into the game, Newcastle. To the delight of their home fans no doubt. A-League - 53 min: We’re back on in Newcastle, where Petratos has flashed a dangerous effort past the post. A bit of niggle creeping into the contest as the home fans get frustrated by some shirt pull fouls. Roar have lost their captain Aldred to injury, which doesn’t help their plight. The youngster Izaack Powell comes on. Big Bash - End of Innings: Thunder 8/149 (20), Ferguson 52, Nair 11* Ferguson smashes one over the rope, first ball from Abbott - and that brings up his personal milestone of 50. A few singles before Ferguson is caught! But it’s a no ball! At least he’s off strike from a Sixers perspective. Nair is caught on the rope - but its the free hit. An almost comedic finish as Nair ramps back over the ‘keeper for four, before he completely misses the last ball and runs out his captain! And if you’re a Roar fan feeling a little down and out, spare a thought for Chesterfield over in the UK. They’ve just recorded their lowest home attendance since 1936 and are staring down the barrel of ANOTHER relegation. Oh mis días. A-League: Newcastle Jets 1-0 Brisbane Roar - half-time 45 min: There’s the whistle. It’s not been the best we’ve seen from the Jets this season, but they hold the all-important lead in this battle of the cellar dwellers. Three points will see the Jets jump above both the Roar and the Mariners, but if it stays like this a sixth loss in ten games could really put Brisbane in all sorts of trouble, at the turning point of the season. Big Bash: 6/114 (16), Ferguson 30*, Sams 0* That’s the end of a terrific spell from Lloyd Pope - the ginger-haired spinner finishes with 3/23 off 4, including 10 dot balls. Take that bad ball to Ross that flew for six away and he’d be stoked with those figures. Gilks for a duck, Morris for one and Green for one. He’s really ripped through the Thunder middle order. Big few overs for the skipper Ferguson - can he salvage this innings? A-League - 42 min: A big few minutes in the scene of Newcastle’s season - they need to hold on here and go into the sheds ahead. The Roar skipper Tom Aldred rises well to a setpiece, and they’ve only just scrambled, the Jets! A nervy moment there. Big Bash: Wicket! Thunder 4/110 (14.2), Ross 26, Ferguson 28* Ross picks the slower ball from Curran and whack - that flies over the rope! That’s the 50 partnership between these two - they’ve done the steady work, now to accelerate. Ross looks to go big again, but he’s got that one horribly wrong. It’s a fine catch straight down the ground by Sean Abbott - and the English quick Curran gets the last laugh! A-League: Goal! Newcastle Jets 1-0 Brisbane Roar (Petratos) 32 min: It’s a basic play, and the Roar have been badly caught out! A long ball to the far post where Hoffman had ghosted in. Young saved his initial shot but he could do nothing about the follow-up from Petratos! He haunts his former club, once again! A-League - 30 min: The Jets just threatening to come into this contest, as Thurgate tries to weave his way through a crowded Roar penalty area. With their back five Brisbane are a tough side to break down early on - and given the stakes in this one, it’s unsurprisingly defences on top across the first half hour. Big Bash: Thunder 3/85 (12), Ferguson 19*, Ross 16* They go nearly 50 balls without reaching the rope, but it’s a strong ending to that Pope over. Ross with a towering six to make it 14 off it. One of these two needs to go, and needs to go soon, if Thunder are going to put on a game-commanding lead. And a lovely yearender from Suzanne Wrack on a momentous year in women’s sport. Some terrific pics here, and from an Australian and WAFL perspective, great to see our very own Tayla Harris feature: A-League - 16 min: It’s the visitors Brisbane still on the front foot in Newcastle, dominating the possession and territory early on. They’ve had over two-thirds of both so far - Robbie Fowler will be impressed, but he’d dearly love them to be on top on the scoreboard as well. And some NBL action for y’all - where there’s been a big message fired in the top-of-the-table clash: Perth have overcome a fourth-quarter blitz from Casper Ware to claim a dramatic 98-85 victory over Sydney in their top-of-the-table NBL blockbuster. The Kings were down by five points entering the final quarter on Saturday evening when Ware erupted with four long-range bombs to steal the lead. However, Wildcats star Bryce Cotton, who scored a season-high 34 points, showed nerves of steel to produce some timely buckets and ice the win. Ware, who also hit a season-high 33 points, and Cotton traded clutch shots in an electric final period for the 11,569 Qudos Bank Arena crowd. Big Bash: Thunder 3/60 (9), Ferguson 8*, Ross 1* Gilks goes very cheaply off the spinner Pope, and suddenly the run rate has really slowed down here. A big knock needed from the skipper Ferguson - he calls a “tactical time out”, after his side went from 0/48 to 3/54 in quick succession. A-League - 10 min: A first glimpse at Brisbane’s youngster Mirza Muratovic who makes his A-League debut for the Roar today - relegating the hugely experienced Roy O’Donovan to the bench. He twists and turns well and fashions a shot, but it’s well saved by Glen Moss between the sticks. Some news for our yachting aficionados here on Sportwatch: Defending Sydney to Hobart handicap winner Alive has crossed the line behind the five supermaxis as the race for overall honours heats up. The 66-foot boat finished about 2.15pm on Saturday, around seven hours after Comanche won line honours for the third time. While the vast majority of the 154 remaining fleet was still at sea, Alive on Saturday evening was second on the leaderboard in the race for the Tattersall Cup, the prize awarded to the leading overall boat. But her corrected time might be beaten by NSW yacht Ichi Ban, which is slated to finish before midnight along with about 13 other boats. Matt Allen, skipper of Ichi Ban - the 2017 Tattersall Cup winner which came fifth last year - told AAP prior to the race it was a tough field. “There’s about 15 really good 50-footers and so you’ve got to beat that whole pack to have any chance of winning this race,” he said. A-League - 5 min: Brisbane with some early sustained pressure as they win back-to-back corners. Gillesphey rises, but he can’t get a clean header at it. Newcastle block successive shots before looking to counter through Angus Thurgate. Big Bash: Wicket! Thunder 2/50 (6.1), Hales 32* And that’s two on the spin - it’s the first ball of Curran’s second over that does the damage, as Hales flicks one aimless straight down the throat of Edwards. With two new batsmen at the crease could this be a crucial lull in momentum for the Thunder? That bright start has evaporated very quickly. A-League - kick off! 1 min: And we’re underway in Newcastle: 11th hosting 10th. An absolutely crucial game in the respective seasons of the Jets and the Roar. Big Bash: Wicket! Thunder 1/48 (5.1), Khawaja 16 First ball post-powerplay and what a key wicket that could be! The left-hander goes, and the competition’s golden hat wearer strikes! In comes the in-form Callum Ferguson - no doubt still fuming from the smoke-effected draw last weekend. They’re not out of the woods by any means, the Sixers, but this could be a key over in proceedings. And here’s your A-League starting line ups, where Roar coach Robbie Fowler has made some pretty huge selection calls. Here’s the home side, Newcastle: And here’s that new-look Brisbane XI: Big Bash: Thunder 0/40 (4), Hales 29*, Khawaja 10* Khawaja with a huge hoick over the boundary to join the early explosion from his opening partner. Five fours and a six from Alex Hales to put the bowlers Ben Dwarshuis and Jackson Bird under some heat. Tom Curran to come in and try and stem the bleeding - it’s a steady opening here for the Thunder. And here’s the wrap on a thrilling day three from the Boxing Day Test - on another day on which Pat Cummins reminded the world why he’s the top-rated quick in world cricket: Now, we are underway in Sydney in the Big Bash, where the Thunder have won the toss and elected to bat first in the Sixers-Thunders showdown. I’ll have the updates from that one as soon as they unfold. And, there will be more A-League action as it’s 11th hosting 10th in the battle of the cellar dwellers. Huge game for Newcastle Jets and Brisbane Roar. 90 + 5 min: And there is the final whistle. It’s emphatic in the end for the visitors, who pick up a rare win in Victoria and regain their position in the A-League’s top six. Well worth it for their three points, the Phoenix - can they kick on and ruffle some feathers up the competition’s leaderboard? VAR - no goal! Western United 1-3 Wellington 90 + 5 min: Ugh. And the video men have ruled it out. Gary Hooper started his run from about 3mm offside, allegedly. We’ll never really know because it’s an imprecise science. And a very good goal has been chalked off. Hasn’t it improved football? Got to love VAR. Goal! Western United 1-4 Wellington Phoenix (Hooper) 90 + 4 min: And there is more late goal drama - but it’s the visitors again! It’s a seemingly harmless long ball, but Hooper doesn’t give up on it. Kurto comes but doesn’t claim, and it’s a terrific header from the former Premier League star. Goal! Western United 1-3 Wellington Phoenix (Diamanti) 90 min: No mistake from the veteran Italian Alessandro Diamanti who lashes home an unstoppable effort. Marinovic guesses the right way, but he can’t get a hand on the ball as it nestles into the bottom right-hand corner. And is there a lifeline, however remote, for the home side? 88 min: Penalty! And just as they would have been thinking about a clean sheet it’s a brain explosion from the skipper Steven Taylor who outstretches a hand along the ground and gives away the most obvious of penalties! Entirely needless, you’d have to say - Marinovic was every chance to save the shot! 84 min: Heavy clatter between Durante and Ball, and the former Nix captain gets into a heated war of words with the new Phoenix coach. They never worked together in Durante’s 11 seasons with the clubs, but some real feeling there. Frustration perhaps on the legendary Wellington captain’s part. Goal! Western United 0-3 Wellington Phoenix (Davila) 80 min: And there’s the coup de grâce from the visitors. The points well and truly secured and their prodigious Mexican, Ulises Davila finishes his eighth of the season. Calmly done, and that’s good night to the side from Melbourne’s West, playing in Western Victoria. 76 min: A fresh headache for the homeside - on comes Phoenix’s marquee signing, Gary Hooper, who is still seeking to build match fitness after a late arrival and ankle injury. If they can get some regular minutes into the prolific former Norwich and Celtic man they could be a real threat come the end of the season, Wellington. 72 min: Burgess looks to pull the trigger for Western, but he loops his effort harmlessly wide. They haven’t created anything of note for Berisha up front, and with midfielders blazing away from deeper it’s not likely to test a keeper of Marinovic’s quality. 68 min: Dario Jertec goes in the book and it’s a fair freekick opportunity for the Nix, perhaps a little too far out for the shot. They play short and look to Arsenal their way through a tight defence, and it nearly ends with an opportunity at the back post for Liberato Cacace. 63 min: A sumptuous freekick delivery from Diamanti - he finds Pierias at the far post with a looping ball, but the youngster completely fluffs his lines. They’re cutting deflated figures on the Western United bench, after a 10-15 minute patch in which they thought they’d draw level - only to go further behind. 60 min: Concern here for Western United’s centre back Aaron Calver - they’ve already lost fellow CB Brendan Hamill to a suspected serious knee injury, let’s hope this isn’t a big setback for the young defender. He hobbles to the side line, and it sees Dario Jertec come on, and a possible formation shuffle for Rudan’s side. Goal! Western United 0-2 Wellington (McCowatt) 55 min: Hello! And having weathered a patch of pressure, it’s the Nix who have hit against the run of play. How often do you see that in football? It’s terrific work from Reno Piscopo who feeds the young Kiwi star Callum McCowatt, who swivels well and fires a shot across Filip Kurto. What a sucker punch! 53 min: Devlin and Diamanti continue their scrap in midfield. That’s exactly why you want players with the vast experience of the Italian in the league - what an experience for a talented young Australian midfielder like Cameron Devlin to test his skills against the 17-cap Azzurri? 48 min: Ooh, that’s another terrific intervention from the All Whites No 1 - he denied Dylan Pierias brilliantly to start the first half, now he’s somehow kept out Scott McDonald! Should the former Socceroo have hit the net there? It was a great back stick opportunity, after fine work down the right. This is Western’s best period of the match - can they capitalise? A-League: Second half! Western United 0-1 Wellington Phoenix 45 min: And we’re back, and it’s the veteran Italian Alessandro Diamanti who flashes an early warning shot goalwards, but can’t quite force a save from New Zealand’s number one Stefan Marinovic. And speaking of cricket, the day’s play in the trans-Tasman Test has just finished across the state in Melbourne - here’s our Sportwatch comrade Jonathan Howcroft’s take on play: Interesting developments in the Wagner v Smith battle, which may have some clues for bowlers worldwide, on a day on which Australia remained very much in charge. Afternoon all! Häid Jõule / Merry Christmas to all you and yours - I trust this finds you well, during this festive season. Football and cricket are the flavours of the day, so we’ll stay will Western United v Phoenix. A really intriguing game this - they’re on a potentially seven-game unbeaten run, the Nix, and on this showing it’s hard to see where the spark will come from Mark Rudan’s side. All sorts of rumours continuing to emerge from around the club this week, mind, with talk of both coaching staff and players about to depart. Let’s hope that hasn’t distracted the playing group from their task over a busy period of games. A-League: HT: Western United 0-1 Wellington It might be uncomfortably hot in Ballarat, but these two teams are all in and this was a very entertaining half of football. Swift ball movement, clear chances, yellow cards, rash challenges, a drinks break and a Phoenix goal that was thoroughly deserved. Scored by a man called Ball. That’s me out. Richard Parkin, you’re in. A-League: GOAL! Western United 0-1 Wellington (Ball, 41’) Well, it was coming. Wellington’s repeated forward moves have caused United some shape issues down back, and some nice work from Dávila sets up Ball directly in front. The Englishman doesn’t miss from there. Advantage the visitors. A-League: 37 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington This game has plenty of heat. Now Pain gets a yellow card and deservedly so after cleaning up Ball with a stray leg just outside the box. Dávila can’t do anything with the free-kick, but moments later Wellington go very close as Ball forces a fingertip save from Kurto. A-League: 30 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington And it’s time for drinks! I’m all for it in football games. Don’t care if it’s really hot, as it is in Ballarat right now, or -40C in a Russian winter. And upon resumption, as if to prove a point, a refuelled and refreshed Burgess slams a piledriver of a strike hard against the right post from distance. Phoenix keeper was beaten. A-League: 23 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington This is getting tasty, and not a little spiteful. Skotadis challenges Ball from behind, raises his arm and collects the Phoenix player square in the back. With meaning. Ball hits the deck, as one might, and there is a break in play while Ball and Skotadis gather their breath, and the gathering throng smoke the peace pipe, take a chill pill and generally chillax. It’s just a game, boys. Boxing Day Test update: Burns is out, Smith is out, the wickets are falling, the New Zealand fans are finding voice at the MCG ... but the Black Caps, who’ll possibly face a few overs tonight, are four-hundred-and-plenty behind and in all sorts. A-League: 10 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington Calver slides into Devlin in the middle of the park and receives the game’s first yellow card. He didn’t miss his former Sydney FC teammate, did Calver. That’s a yellow in anyone’s language. Moments later, Hamill goes down after twisting his left knee. Looked innocuous enough but the Western United man is in some pain. And he’s off, both mentally and physically anguished. Boxing Day Test update: Labuschagne is out, Smith is in ... and New Zealand are still in all sorts of strife. By all means, pop on over to Jonathan Howcroft’s liveblog. A-League: 2 mins: Western United 0-0 Wellington An early shot across the Wellington bow from debutant Dylan Pierias, who forces a good save from Marinovic with his solid right-footed strike from just inside the box. A-League stat attack I: Wellington are undefeated in their last six A-League games (W3, D3), having conceded only one first-half goal in that period. A-League stat attack II: Western United’s Andrew Durante boasts a passing accuracy of 91.4% this campaign, the second highest of any player to have made at least 200 passes. A-League teams: WESTERN UNITED (3-2-2-3): Filip Kurto (GK); Aaron Calver, Andrew Durante, Brendan Hamill; Jerry Skotadis, Max Burgess; Dylan Pierias, Connor Pain; Alessandro Diamanti, Besart Berisha, Scott McDonald. SUBS: Ryan Scott (GK), Valentino Yuel, Apostolos Stamatelopoulos, Dario Jertec, Jonathon Aspropotamitis, Joshua Cavallo, Kwabena Appiah-Kubi. WELLINGTON (4-4-2): Stefan Marinovic (GK); Tim Payne, Steven Taylor, Luke DeVere, Liberato Cacace; Reno Piscopo, Cameron Devlin, Matti Steinmann, Callum McCowatt; David Ball, Ulises Davila. SUBS: Oliver Sail (GK), Liam McGing, Te Atawhai Hudson-Wihongi, Ben Waine, Gary Hooper. We’re not far off the start of the A-League game between Western United and Wellington. This will be the first time an A-League game has been played in Ballarat, proving there is life on Mars (Stadium). Wonderful, wonderful photo essay here on Poppy Starr Olsen, the Newcastle teenager on track to represent Australia at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Do yourself a favour. The Sydney to Hobart has been, um, sailed and won. Comanche, which looked down and out at lunchtime yesterday, absolutely ‘keeled’ them en route to Tassie to take line honours for the third time. Early leader Scallywag collided with a shark and lost ground - or should that be water? Either way, see below for the lowdown and reaction to the annual blue-water classic. The Boxing Day Test is an entirely appropriate moniker for this event in 2o19. Australia, batting for the second time as I type, have New Zealand on the ropes and are landing blow after blow after blow. This will be another massive victory for Tim Paine’s men. Now go and see what Jonathan Howcroft is making of events at the MCG. And then hurry on back. I’ve got a story about a shark for you. Best of the afternoon, lovers of sport. God bless pursuits such as chasing leather and whacking/kicking/catching things. How else would we amuse ourselves in this strange period between Christmas and new year? I don’t know about you, but I have trouble remembering what day it is. I had a half-hour debate with one of my sons earlier on regarding this very subject. He was convinced it’s Thursday (still is) but after giving it serious thought, I settled on it being Saturday. All day, as my mother would say. Enough digression. The Boxing Day Test is continuing at the MCG, we have two A-League games today and a Sydney derby in the Big Bash League. Plenty else on too, no doubt. Hang around. It’ll be fun. You can email me or drop me a tweet. Or, if you’d rather not, don’t."

          "headline": "Submarine to explore why Antarctic glacier is melting so quickly",
          "bodyText": "An international team of scientists has reached the Thwaites glacier in Antarctica and is preparing to drill through more than half a kilometre of ice into the dark waters beneath. The 600-metre deep borehole will allow researchers to lower down a torpedo-shaped robotic submarine that will explore the underside of the ice shelf to better understand why it is melting so fast. Thwaites glacier, which is part of the west Antarctic ice sheet, has lost an estimated 540bn tonnes of ice since the 1980s. But recent measurements show that the melting of the glacier is speeding up, sending even more ice into the Amundsen Sea. “There are several glaciers in Antarctica that are doing similar things, but this is the one we are most worried about,” said David Vaughan, the director of science at the British Antarctic Survey, who has travelled south with the UK-US drilling team. Thwaites glacier is one of the most remote and inhospitable places on Earth. It has taken the researchers weeks to get themselves and their equipment to the drilling site, a spot on the ice shelf about 1,500km (932 miles) from both the British Antarctic Survey’s Rothera research station and the American McMurdo station. In brutal conditions, where the temperature can fall below -20C, the researchers will have only a few days to drill through the ice shelf, deploy the “icefin” submarine and retrieve it, and set a suite of monitoring instruments into the ice before the hole freezes over. “The aim is to do it as rapidly as possible. All of this will happen in three to four days. They really can’t afford to muck about,” said Vaughan. The expedition to the Florida-sized glacier became more pressing this year when Nasa scientists used ground-penetrating radar to reveal a massive cavity in its base. The cavern, two-thirds the size of Manhattan and 300 metres tall, was formed as 13bn tonnes of ice melted away over the past three years. The enormous cavity allows water to get under the glacier and melt it from beneath. Earlier this week, scientists on the team hauled radar-equipped sledges over the ice to map the thickness of the shelf near the “grounding line” where the glacier leaves land and extends over the sea. The map will help them pinpoint where to drill the borehole. During the site assessment, they came across a crevasse that plunged deep into the ice shelf. Once they get the green light, the scientists will use a hot water drill to bore a 30cm-wide hole through the ice shelf. The equipment can melt a hole at about 1.5 metres per minute, meaning it will take more than six hours of nonstop drilling to get all the way through. Small teams who sleep overnight in tents on the ice will work in rotation around the clock to drill the hole, deploy the submarine, and set other instruments into the borehole for long-term monitoring. “Nobody has ever been able to drill through the ice close to where it starts to float and that is the critical point,” Vaughan told the Guardian. “If everything goes to plan, they will drill the hole and then ream it out until it’s about 50cm across, and then lower in the autonomous underwater vehicle. That will actually go into the cavity and send back images in real time so they can navigate it right up to the point where the ice starts to float.” The 3.5 metre-long icefin carries high definition cameras, sonar, and instruments for monitoring water flow, salinity, oxygen and temperature. These can determine how much fresh water is flowing out from under the ice shelf. The robotic sub will also sample the gritty sediment shed into the water as the glacier grinds over the slab of rock it sits on. The data will feed into computer models to refine predictions about the fate of the glacier and the magnitude of sea level rise its melting will produce. Thwaites glacier is already responsible for about 4% of the global sea level rise, as the ice slips off the land and into the sea. But because the ice shelf is melting and thinning, the glacier is speeding up. Thwaites itself contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than 2 feet (61cm), but it holds back other inland glaciers that contain far more ice, enough to raise global sea levels by more than 2 metres. “If Thwaites glacier melts, on its own, we will see a rise in sea level around our own coast,” said Vaughan. “We are not saying that it’s going to happen in the next 100 years or so, but it could certainly begin in that time period.” “We’ll look at the flow of the ice and see how it’s affected, for instance, by tidal changes. All of those things tell us about the sensitivity of the system to small perturbations, which in future might be large perturbations as the ice shelf melts,” he added. “This is all about sea level rise. That is why we are here.” The fieldwork, part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, will run until March 2020."

          "headline": "Chinese company approved to run water mining operation in drought-stricken Queensland",
          "bodyText": "A Chinese-owned company has been granted approval to run a 96m litre a year commercial water mining operation in severely drought-hit southern Queensland, where locals are on water rations and communities at imminent risk of running dry. Last week the Southern Downs regional council approved a development application for the company, Joyful View Garden Real Estate Development Resort Pty Ltd, to operate a water extraction and distribution facility at Cherrabah, a large property at Elbow Valley near the Queensland-New South Wales border. The following day the council implemented extreme water restrictions for residents at the nearby towns of Warwick and Stanthorpe, limiting residents to 80L a day. Stanthorpe is expected to run out of drinking water within weeks. Neighbours of Cherrabah have told Guardian Australia they have not had a reliable water supply at their properties for more than a year, and have been trucking water in on a regular basis. Some cattle properties have removed all their cattle. “I don’t understand how it is allowed to happen,” one resident says. “If that water drains away from the shallow aquifers, it affects our long-term viability.” Joyful View is ultimately owned by Chinese investors Wenxing and Wenwei Ma. The company had attempted to build a large-scale luxury resort at the remote property but pulled the proposal in 2016 after planning and environmental difficulties, including concern for a local population of spotted-tailed quolls. The water extraction licence for the property was first issued by the Queensland government in 2008 and extended in 2016 to allow Joyful View to pump 96m litres from the aquifer until 2111 – another 92 years. Council documents show the company plans to send the water to a bottling plant on the Gold Coast. A local newspaper, the Southern Free Times, reported that councillors who voted in favour of the development application at a 18 December meeting said they had no power to regulate groundwater extraction, which was a state responsibility. The deputy mayor, Jo McNally, reportedly told the meeting the council was aware of many property owners extracting water and selling it outside the region, but that the council could do nothing to stop it. Neighbours who objected told Guardian Australia they had been taken by surprise by the revival of the water-mining proposal. An earlier version of the plan was withdrawn in 2018 after council management recommended it should be rejected. The council conducted no consultation on the new application, instead relying on submissions made by concerned residents in 2018. “Obviously the drought has become 1o times worse in the past year,” one resident said. Even a year ago, locals said in submissions they had observed the impacts of drought and drawdown in groundwater. “I am a close neighbour and I depend on creeks, springs and shallow wells … I have never been surveyed on any long-term effects,” Eagle View property owner Ben Usher said. “I know from information passed down through generations of my family, and from years of my own experience that … springs on the property could be relied on to provide water for the grazing of cattle throughout its history. “This situation has changed. Over time supply has become sporadic with increasing water shortage. I can no longer rely on [the property’s] well and need to cart water to my property.” Another resident, Paul Keogh, said: “The water supply has become unreliable. I cannot say whether this has been caused by the Cherrabah bore or climate change. Whichever way, we no longer had the water supply we had over generations, and so any water allocations … now need to be limited to reflect current water availability.” A 2009 study, which was relied upon by the Queensland government when extending the water extraction licences, raised significant uncertainty about whether the continued pumping of water from the aquifer at Cherrabah was sustainable in the long term. The study concluded there was “insufficient recharge data” to model the sustainability of the aquifer beyond a year, and that there was a “risk” the aquifer would deplete in times of low rainfall. Joyful View has this year commissioned a second study, which was summarised in a council report but has not been released publicly. According to the council summary of the study, it claimed there would be minimal impact on the water resource of surrounding properties. However, the report also acknowledged that test pumping was “extremely challenging to analyse” and that the authors did not attempt to model the long-term drawdown of the water resource because doing so would not be reliable. At the 18 December council meeting, the preceding item was a “water contingency plan” that discussed the dire situation for Stanthorpe and Warwick, and attempts to find alternate “emergency” supply of water. Anyone outside of town water supply has already likely run out of water. Many are reliant on local charity operations. The plan noted that Stanthorpe could run dry within weeks, and additional water was already being trucked to Storm King dam. Water supply in Warwick, which is also being used to support Stanthorpe, will be exhausted without significant rain by mid to late 2020. Attempts were made to contact the council and Joyful View for comment."

          "headline": "Revealed: microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers",
          "bodyText": "Microplastic pollution is raining down on city dwellers, with research revealing that London has the highest levels yet recorded. The health impacts of breathing or consuming the tiny plastic particles are unknown, and experts say urgent research is needed to assess the risks. Only four cities have been assessed to date but all had microplastic pollution in the air. Scientists believe every city will be contaminated, as sources of microplastic such as clothing and packaging are found everywhere. Recent research shows the whole planet appears to be contaminated with microplastic pollution. Scientists have found the particles everywhere they look, from Arctic snow and mountain soils, to many rivers and the deepest oceans. Other work indicates particles can be blown across the world. The level of microplastic discovered in the London air surprised scientists. “We found a high abundance of microplastics, much higher than what has previously been reported,” said Stephanie Wrightfrom Kings College London, who led the research. “But any city around the world is going to be somewhat similar.” “I find it of concern – that is why I am working on it,” she said. “The biggest concern is we don’t really know much at all. I want to find out if it is safe or not.” About 335m tonnes of new plastic is produced each year and much leaks into the environment. The research, published in the journal Environment International, collected the microplastics falling onto the roof of a nine-storey building in central London. This ensured that only microplastic from the atmosphere was collected. They were found in all eight samples, with deposition rates ranging from 575 to 1,008 pieces per sq metre per day, and 15 different plastics were identified. Most microplastics were fibres made of acrylic, most likely from clothing. Just 8% of the microplastics were particles, and these were mostly polystyrene and polyethylene, both commonly used in food packaging. The rate of microplastic deposition measured in London is 20 times higher than in Dongguan, China, seven times higher than in Paris, France and nearly three times higher than Hamburg, Germany. The researchers do not know the reason for the variation, but differences in experimental methods are likely to be partly responsible. The microplastic particles in London were between 0.02mm and 0.5mm. These are large enough to be deposited on to the airways when inhaled and would be swallowed in saliva. Smaller particles that can get into the lungs and bloodstream represent the greatest potential health hazard. These were seen in the samples but their composition could not be identified with current technology. The serious health damage caused by the pollution particles emitted by traffic and industry are well known. A comprehensive global review earlier in 2019 concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. But the potential health impacts of inhaling plastic particles from the air, or consuming them via food and water, are unknown. People eat at least 50,000 microplastic particles per year, according to one study. Plastics can carry toxic chemicals and harbour harmful microbes, and the limited research done to date has shown harm to some marine creatures. The only assessment of microplastic in human lungs, published in 1998, found inhaled fibres were present in cancerous lung specimens. “These studies showing just how much plastic is in the air are a wake-up call,” said Steve Allen, at the EcoLab research institute near Toulouse, France, and whose own work has shown microplastic air pollution in remote mountain areas. “The [London research] is a very well done study showing incredibly high numbers of airborne microplastics. “Currently we have very little knowledge on what effect this airborne pollution will have on humans,” he said. “But with what we do know it is pretty scary to think we are breathing it in. We need urgent research.” Johnny Gasperi, at the Université Paris-Est, said the research shows a widespread contamination of the air by microplastics. He said the London study showed that microplastic deposition did not depend on the strength or direction of the wind, suggesting the city itself was the most likely source. Melanie Bergmann, at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany, said more research on the potential health effects of microplastic pollution was very important. “We do not currently know what proportion of inhaled microplastics actually penetrates the deep lung,” she said. The European commission’s chief scientific advisers said in a report in April: “The evidence [on the environmental and health risks of microplastics] provides grounds for genuine concern and for precaution to be exercised.” Microplastics are also found in drinking water and in August an assessment by the World Health Organization found no evidence to date of harm but said more research was needed. Cutting microplastic pollution requires changing how plastic is used and disposed of, said Wright: “You can’t clean it up, so it is about stopping it at source.” Allen said: “This is not a problem that is going to go away anytime soon.”"

          "headline": "From woke to gammon: buzzwords by the people who coined them",
          "bodyText": "Are we living through a golden age of linguistic inventiveness? Buzzwords and neologisms – from office jargon to the lexicons of democratic chaos in Britain and the US, as well as the ever-expanding culture wars – rain down on us every day, and can gain global currency at the speed of fibre-optic cable. Many, of course, fail – like “Brixit”, an early rival to Brexit, or “Generation Me”, one proposed label for what we now call millennials. Others rapidly become part of the modern conversation. Why, for example, do critics call young, supposedly over sensitive and easily triggered people “snowflakes”? Because in Chuck Palahniuk’s 1996 novel Fight Club, Tyler Durden says: “You are not special. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.” Palahniuk’s contribution, however, was accidental. He later explained: “Back in 1994, when I was writing my book, I wasn’t insulting anyone but myself… My use of the term ‘snowflake’ never had anything to do with fragility or sensitivity.” Instead, he was using it as a means of “deprogramming himself”, so he didn’t believe in his own praise. But the point is that you can’t control what usage will do once it’s out of your hands: a much wider uptake can shift the meaning. The term “woke”, for example, is now used mockingly for a kind of overrighteous liberalism; but its first recorded use, by the African-American novelist William Melvin Kelley, was meant to indicate an awareness of political issues, especially those around race, a positive usage that still also persists. Some people coin words for the sheer fun of it – and if the rhythm and pleasure of the sound are sufficient, they might be lucky enough to see it go viral. This is how we got “fashionista” – coined by Stephen Freid in a 1993 biography of the supermodel Gia – and “amazeballs”, first used publicly by the fashion blogger Elizabeth Spiridakis Olson in 2008. It’s easy to forget that every word in the English language has had a first use; a language is the record of innumerable creative decisions. Most of those responsible are lost to lexicographical history, but in our online age, it is easier to identify the culprit or heroine. I tracked some of them down. What is it like to see a word you invented get into the dictionary? And how does it feel if it spirals out of control, in ways you never intended? Brexit The word Brexit was a tragically unintentional success in verbal invention: coined as a warning, it became a rallying call. In early 2012, the possibility that crisis-stricken Greece might have to leave the Eurozone was labelled “Grexit”, for Greek exit. Then Peter Wilding, a former adviser to David Cameron, left his job as European director of BSkyB in order to set up a thinktank called British Influence, which was designed to celebrate and encourage Britain’s role as a leader in the EU. On 15 May 2012, he published an article on a European blog platform, in which he argued that if Britain’s leaders did not set out a positive vision for membership, “then the portmanteau for Greek euro exit might be followed by another sad word, Brexit.” Between 2005 and 2008, Wilding had worked in Brussels as media and policy director of the Conservative party in Europe. “I found,” he recalls now, “Britain was running the show. It had all the most powerful portfolios in the European commission. The penny dropped for me: here was Britain as the leading power.” In 2016, Wilding went to see Cameron in Downing Street, brandishing the results of a poll that showed the majority of Britons wanted the country to lead in Europe. “I said to him, ‘You could be the new Churchill here: you could say Britain is a leader in Europe and we’ve achieved all these things.’ He said, ‘No, we just don’t have enough time to roll out this message. We won the Scottish referendum and the general election through fear and the economy, and we’ll win this one the same way.’ I said, ‘You will lose.’” And lose they did. Was part of the problem the sheer energy and brio of the word Brexit itself? In 2012, alternatives had been flying around: both the Economist and the Daily Mail referred to a possible “Brixit”, while others suggested UKExit; but Brexit was clearly the most satisfying to pronounce. Wilding says it came to indicate “a stamp of rage: exit, leave, we’ve had enough of it”. Remain is “not a sexy word”, he points out; it is partly a result of the successful lobbying by anti-Europe conservatives to avoid having a referendum question that invited the positive answer “Yes” as to whether Britain should stay in the EU. Brexit is now in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), defined as “The (proposed) withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the political process associated with it.” When it was named Word of the Year in 2016 by Collins dictionaries, Wilding says, “It was a surprise. It had only recently gone crazy in public discourse. I felt shocked that that would be my footnote in the Brexit saga.” And now? The word Brexit, he thinks, “could go down in history, like Vichy or Versailles, as an epitaph for a nation in decline”. Gig economy For a long time, the “gig economy” sounded like a glamorous euphemism for a world of zero-hours contracts and piecework. Why worry that giant corporations such as Uber don’t want to class their drivers as employees? If we’re all doing “gigs”, we’re all hip jazzers. (The word “gig” – “etymology unknown”, remarks the OED – has meant a musical engagement since the 1920s.) But the phrase was originally coined as a criticism. On 12 January 2009, the journalist and editor Tina Brown wrote an article for the Daily Beast website, observing: “No one I know has a job anymore. They’ve got Gigs.” Increasingly, people she knew who used to have staff jobs in the media were working in two or three part-time positions, or freelance. “To people I know in the bottom income brackets, living paycheck to paycheck, the Gig Economy has been old news for years,” she added. “What’s new, is the way it’s hit the demographic that used to assume that a college degree from an elite school was the passport to job security.” Now everyone was a member of “the hustling class”, and company managers were “mesmerised by the notion that everyone can now be hired cheap – that everyone is slave labour”. That was 10 years ago, and it looks awfully prophetic. When people began to use the word “gig” in this context, Brown says now, it worked to project “a subterfuge coolness over a predicament caused by an economic downshift. It’s cool to say, ‘I’ve got these gigs’ rather than to say, ‘My main job has disappeared.’ Because of its cool sound, it helped to familiarise people with the phenomenon.” Does she regret helping to make precariousness sound cool? She laughs. “My only regret is that if I’d had a book called The Gig Economy I would have made a lot of money. I feel rather proud when I see conferences called Managing the Gig Economy – it’s my baby.” Of late, the euphemistic sheen of the phrase seems to have worn off, in any case. When questions are asked in parliament about the gig economy, it is in the context of protecting its vulnerable workers rather than celebrating their freedoms. The gig economy, Brown points out, leaves US workers without healthcare, and might have harmed social cohesion: “I think everybody became so desperate scrabbling around doing their three jobs that the last thing they cared about was other people.” It’s not as though everything was perfect before. “Those jobs people depended on turned out to be treacherous things,” she says, adding that at least these days, “if you get sacked from one gig you still have two others”. Millennials Millennials, eh? They are everywhere, with their selfies and their avocado toast and their feckless refusal to save for a house deposit. The Urban Dictionary has it right that millennial is the “name an old person gives a young person they don’t like”. From the 17th century, “millennial” could be used as a synonym for “millenarian”: associated with the belief that the second coming of Christ was imminent and would usher in a 1,000-year era of peace. But it was first used to describe a specific cohort of people – those who would come of age in the year 2000 – in a 1991 book by Neil Howe and William Strauss entitled Generations: The History Of America’s Future, 1584 To 2069. Howe explains they were looking for a name for “the high-school class of 2000, coming of age in the new millennium”, and wanted an upbeat label, so millennials it was. Chuckling, Howe notes that the name for the previous cohort, Generation X, had not yet been coined while they were writing the book. (Douglas Coupland’s novel Generation X was published in the same year.) “So to make Gen Xers feel even worse about themselves,” he says, “the generation that came after them was named before they were.” Gen Xers won’t mind, of course, he adds: “They have that self-deprecating sense of humour.” The term millennials did not really explode in popularity until well into the new millennium. For much of the 1990s, Howe points out, it did battle with rival labels such as Generation Y. That name, he says, “was almost always the more derogatory alternative. People used it to make the point that this new generation was everything the Xers were, but more extreme. More commercial, more risk-taking, totally over the top. You know, like ‘Gen Xers are a little bit alienated from family life, but these kids are just off the charts.’” By contrast, he and Strauss were forecasting that millennials would be “closer to their family, more into community, more optimistic about the future”. Talking about the differences between generations, Howe says now, is “like a Rorschach test. You’re talking about politics, culture, demography, social science, epidemiology. It acquires the colour of the emotion that the person who uses it wants it to have.” If millennials mainly has a mocking or derogatory sense now, that says more about the older generations who use it that way than about millennials themselves. “Naming a generation is like shooting a bullet into a cave and watching it ricochet everywhere,” Howe says. “You never know where it’s going to come out.” Crowdsourcing For more than a decade, the hot buzzword for companies who want to profit from people’s talent without paying for it has been crowdsourcing. This is a clever play on outsourcing (moving jobs to external contractors, or overseas), combined with an allusion to James Surowiecki’s 2004 bestseller The Wisdom O f Crowds, which celebrated collaborative efforts such as Wikipedia, and the surprising accuracy of prediction markets, where aggregate betting on events such as elections can forecast outcomes better than experts. The word crowdsourcing was coined in June 2006, in an article for Wired by Jeff Howe. “Industries as disparate as pharmaceuticals and television [are discovering] ways to tap the latent talent of the crowd,” he wrote. “The labour isn’t always free, but it costs a lot less than paying traditional employees. It’s not outsourcing; it’s crowdsourcing.” It was an elegant, snappy introduction to a very successful coinage. Did Howe know he was doing that at the time? “You know, we actually kind of did, yeah,” he says now. Two years previously, Wired’s editor-in-chief, Chris Anderson, had coined the phrase “the Long Tail” to describe the potential longterm viability of niche products on services such as Amazon or Netflix (then a DVD-rental business), and that had become a hit book. “So the term crowdsourcing was, in the very beginning, half meant to parody the emergence of such buzzwords,” Howe says. At the same time, he was interested in the possibilities of the new collaborative model of creativity. “One thing about being at Wired in those days,” he recalls, “was that we really did have our ear to the rail in terms of the tech industry and culture. So we knew the timing was right, that there was this thing starting to happen and no one knew what to call it.” The word took off with amazing rapidity. “Within two weeks, there were 600,000 mentions on Google. And it never slowed down.” He published a bestselling book of the same name in 2008, and is now a journalism professor at Northeastern University in Boston. “One thing I’d say is that we really did need a word at the time,” Howe adds. “It wasn’t one of those bullshit marketing words that get adopted by management-consultant types. There was something really exciting taking place in the mid-2000s, and we didn’t have a language for it yet.” Indeed. Crowdsourcing might have been used since in cynical ways, and appropriated by huge brands such as Starbucks (which, since 2008 has solicited customer improvements through its My Starbucks Idea website) and McDonald’s (which in 2014 sold “crowdsourced” burgers), but it can also describe the kind of global altruistic effort that only the internet makes possible. According to Google Trends, the word’s peak search popularity occurred in March 2014, when eight million people around the world used their computer skills to search for Malaysia Airlines plane Flight MH370, which vanished after taking off and was presumed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean. They didn’t find the plane, but this kind of effort, as well as the collaborative news investigations of outlets such as Bellingcat, is what gives crowdsourcing a good name. Binge-watching There’s something about the phrase binge-watching that sums up not only modern modes of media consumption but our whole culture. It’s the perfect metaphor for Netflix-era humans, whom Aristotle would have called “incontinent” in their desires: wanting more and more of the same, with no patience or self-control. We are all the toddlers who fail the notorious (and lately disputed) marshmallow test, according to which a child who is able to wait for a sweet at a tender age will turn out to be more self-reliant and successful as an adult. In northern English dialect, to binge meant to soak a wooden barrel, and so a binge came to mean, from the 19th century, a drinking spree, as it is defined in a Northamptonshire dictionary of the time: “A man goes to the alehouse to get a good binge, or to binge himself.” The word binge-watching, too, dates from more innocent times: still long before the advent of online streaming. It is first recorded in 1996, when to watch all the episodes of a series in a row meant acquiring a set of VHS tapes. That is what a science graduate student in New England named Bob Donahue was looking for when he posted the following to a local Usenet discussion group that year: “I’ve just become hooked on The X-Files, so I’m a little behind... Does anyone by ANY chance have tapes of this show back to season 1 they’d be willing to lend me so I can effectively catch up? I’d be more than happy to travel out to wherever to get them and then bring them back (actually there are three of us who all got hooked at the same time, so I’d predict that there’d be some MASSIVE binge-watching right away! :-)”. “What a cool revelation!” Donahue says now, when I tell him that he probably coined the phrase. “But, to be honest, I have zero recollection as to whether I made up the phrase off-the-cuff, or if I was using something I had heard before. I’m afraid I’ve had no thoughts about it over the years because, honestly, I don’t remember doing it.” After a career as an astrophysicist and now a web developer for an educational foundation, Donahue still occasionally does the thing he named: “Some shows – like Game Of Thrones – are just too irresistible.” After he coined binge-watching as a gerund (or verbal noun), the verb “to binge-watch” followed. It is also first recorded on Usenet, where someone in 1998 asked in a post: “Do you ever binge watch (marathon)?” This was also in the context of The X-Files, so really, it was Scully and Mulder who started it all. In online lexicographical history, the truth is out there. “I suppose that’s one of the cool things about the internet,” Donahue says. “You never know what sort of reach something you say will have.” Gammon On 8 June 2017, the British children’s author Ben Davis was drunkenly hate-watching Question Time on BBC One. Fed up, he tweeted a picture of various red-faced older men who had been speaking from the audience, and wrote: “Whatever happens, hopefully politicians will start listening to young ppl after this. This Great Wall of gammon has had its way long enough.” “When I sent out that tweet, even in my drunken state, I had no inkling it would have any impact,” Davis says. “I thought it would get lost in the ether. When I started getting requests from serious news organisations to discuss gammon, my conviction that the world had gone irrevocably insane only deepened.” Gammon, it turned out, had legs: it was joyously adopted by the left to describe flushed, middle-aged white people with reactionary views and, in time, anyone pro-Brexit. A year later, baffled Americans were discussing how Brits were now having a serious debate about whether gammon was a racist word. This was in part because a Northern Irish MP, Emma Little-Pengelly of the DUP, had tweeted: “I’m appalled by the term ‘gammon’ now frequently entering the lexicon of so many (mainly on the left) &amp; seemingly be [sic] accepted. This is a term based on skin colour &amp; age – stereotyping by colour or age is wrong no matter what race, age or community. It’s just wrong.” Other commentators retorted that gammon could not possibly be racist and was fine as a word with which to abuse, you know, gammons. In more sedate corners of the media, some devotees of philology explored the historical context: in 18th-century thieves’ jargon, a gammon was someone who distracted the mark’s attention; in the 19th century, gammon could also mean stuff and nonsense, of the kind a modern gammon might perhaps spout. The journalist Caitlin Moran deserves some share of the originating credit, too, for having described David Cameron in 2012 as “a slightly camp gammon robot”. “I’m in two minds about the gammon thing,” Davis says now. “When it’s used against genuine bigots, I’m fine with it. When I see it used as shorthand for a working-class person, I’m not so keen. I’m also not exactly proud of creating another weapon in the online culture war, which shows no signs of stopping.” Is there a message in this story, too, about how social media and alcohol are perhaps not the safest bedfellows? “I’m pretty sure that was my only foray into drunk-tweeting and I’m certain it will be my last,” Davis says. “In fact, I think all electronic-communications devices should be fitted with breathalysers.” • Steven Poole’s A Word For Every Day Of The Year is published by Quercus at £14.99.

          "headline": "'It's just something I crave': a young Native American finds her home in rodeo",
          "bodyText": "Rodeo is everywhere in Keira Simonson’s life. It’s in the 22-year-old’s kitchen as a team picture pinned to the fridge. It’s hanging in her bathroom as a horse-themed towel. It’s decorating her truck floor as muddy boots with spurs attached. It’s her weekends and her escape. As an enrolled member of the more than 5,400-strong Little Shell Chippewa Tribe of Montana – which was, until recently, federally unrecognized and without a designated reservation – Simonson often felt removed from the larger Native American community and its culture. But rodeos have become her way of staying connected. “It’s just something I crave – to constantly be going to another one,” she says. Top: Simonson and her brother, Buckshot, wait for her run at the Copper Springs Ranch rodeo, just outside of Bozeman, Montana. Below: Details of the rodeo are peppered throughout Simonson’s life. For the more than 400 other federally unrecognized, landless tribes in the US, communal spaces like rodeos have become integral. It’s what Circe Sturm, a professor of anthropology and the co-director of the University of Texas at Austin’s Native American and Indigenous Studies program, calls a pan-Indian space. It allows people to come together to experience a sense of being Indigenous. “When you have people who have had their land base disrupted, like the Little Shell community, then those spaces become very important,” said Sturm. Simonson, who has been riding since she was three years old, regularly competes in the Indian National Finals Rodeo tour (INFR), the main Native American rodeo organization in the US. Most recently, she won the women’s barrel racing tour championship for the 2019 season. In a barrel race, the rider and their horse burst straight out of the gate, kicking up thick, russet clods of dirt. Next they head for three barrels set up in a cloverleaf pattern around the arena, turning sharply around each before charging for the finish line at breakneck speed. Keira Simonson rides her horse, Diesel, during a rodeo barrel race. The INFR, formed in 1976, sanctions more than 700 rodeos a year across the US for people ages eight to 80. Women and girls’ involvement in Indian rodeo has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s, says a spokesperson for the organization. And while mainstream American rodeo has long been dominated by white contestants, Simonson says that recent years have seen more Native Americans competing at pro rodeos and other open and amateur rodeos not specifically designated for Native Americans. In the remote north-eastern plains of Montana near the Canadian border, more than 30 miles from the nearest incorporated town, Simonson awakens most days around 8am on the family ranch. She shuffles to the stables to feed her beloved horse, Diesel, the first of several chores she and her brother, Buckshot Simonson, complete around the ranch. Simonson, age four, on her father’s horse. Diesel was once described by a rodeo announcer as the fastest black horse he’d ever seen. But in the days leading up to competition, Simonson rests her horse to keep him fresh. The bulk of her preparation lies in the logistics – travel plans, which she organizes in a color-coordinated calendar, and readying the trailer. Inside the black and silver gooseneck unit, there are hay bales, five-gallon buckets and jugs filled with grain and water, saddles, brushes, combs and clothing. There’s even a bed made of wood chips a foot thick for Diesel to sleep on in the horse stalls. “He loves it. Some people will walk by and be like, ‘Is your horse alive?’ recalled Simonson about Diesel’s sleeping arrangements in the trailer. Top and bottom: Keira Simonson readies for competition by resting her horse and prepping her trailer. At the INFR events, Simonson says she’s developed a makeshift family, where she can joke around using “Native humor” – sarcastic, loud and full of laughter. She can share her Native American experience, and learn about different tribes and practices along the way, including her own. But even at those rodeos, she says she feels white compared with everyone else. Her mother is half Little Shell, half white, while her father is white. At other rodeos, she sometimes feels acutely aware of her darker skin and hair, and the stereotypes that come with her appearance. “They probably look at me and they think, ‘Oh, she’s just Native’,” said Simonson. Simonson jokes around with her aunt, Billie Jo, and her mother, Judy, while waiting for her brother’s run at the Copper Springs Ranch barrel race. The Little Shell Chippewa, like many Native American tribes, have a complicated relationship with identity due to European colonization. The Little Shell Chippewa are successors of the historical Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians – a part of the Ojibwe, also known as the Chippewa, tribe – whose land included more than 60m acres throughout the northern midwestern US and north into Canada. In the early 19th century, French men came from the north and married into many Ojibwe families. Photos from recent races hang on the wall in Simonson’s home. The absence of culture and community are common among Little Shell people as a result of being landless, says Kim McKeehan, a Little Shell Tribal Council member and mental health therapist. “People don’t have a place to practice cultural practices or build an economy. Those are the things that really create community,” said McKeehan. McKeehan explains that the lack of community can permeate into individuals’ sense of identity and belonging, too. But she says it’s also made Little Shell people incredibly resilient and independent. “Just because cultural traditions and languages were washed out of the mouths of our grandmothers and beaten out of our communities doesn’t mean that they’re not ours still. We can reach back and get them.” Simonson and Alexis Rose, a close friend, on horseback together at the first University of Montana rodeo team practice of 2019 in February, outside of Lolo, Montana. The Little Shell do not yet have a reservation of their own, having refused to sign a land treaty with the US in the late 19th century that they believed to be unjust. But this state of limbo will soon change. A bill that would provide 200 acres of reservation land was approved by Congress this year as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and was signed into law by Donald Trump just before Christmas. “It’s almost like it’s surreal,” said the Little Shell chairman, Gerald Gray. “It was a long, long road for us – for everybody. It’s a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.” The reservation will still take at least a year to materialize, said Gray. He added that there’s no blueprint for newly recognized tribes, so they want to take their time to do it right. “My motto has always been the squeaky wheel gets the grease. I will always be loud and proud. I’ll never stop until this actually gets done.” Simonson saddles up her barrel racing horse, Diesel, while her mother gets a bridle from their trailer."

          "headline": "New Zealand would be honoured to take Behrouz Boochani. Australia be damned",
          "bodyText": "I wonder if it winds up Peter Dutton to know that Behrouz Boochani, the Kurdish-Iranian journalist, award-winning author and former Manus Island detainee, is a free man in the continent’s orbit. Boochani, the best-known witness, critic and victim of Australia’s offshore “processing centres”, remains in New Zealand after his 30-day visa came to an end. No one quite knows what the No Friend But the Mountains author is planning next, but it seems safe to assume that sooner or later he’ll lodge an application for asylum in New Zealand. A permanent reminder to Dutton, his predecessors and the country’s immigration detention system that they are not as close to vanishing the “boat people” problem as they might have thought. For their part New Zealand’s policymakers fear as much with headlines suggesting if Boochani’s hypothetical asylum application is successful it could “fuel tensions with Australia”. The problem is Behrouz Boochani, New Zealander, would enjoy free movement between his new home and his old incarcerators, unless Dutton and the gang insert new exceptions in the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. This is the “back door” the Coalition government in Canberra is so afraid of, and the political problem preventing Scott Morrison from taking up Jacinda Ardern’s invitation to resettle the last remaining detainees on Manus. For my part: damn the “tensions”. The moral and ethical case for New Zealand accepting Boochani’s application, assuming he’s planning on making it, is as simple as “asylum is a human right”. You can argue the moral and ethical case further, but it seems enough to state a journalist fleeing the threat of death in Iran, and a seemingly permanent incarceration in Papua New Guinea, is entitled to freedom in New Zealand. Or anywhere he should go. There is nothing more human than the right to go about your life in safety and security. As New Zealanders we could feel proud, and even a little radical, if we did our bit to restore that right to Boochani. Geography is responsible for nurturing remarkably different political cultures in Australia and New Zealand. Continental Australia – vast, arid, and uncomfortably close to a populous Asia – seems to maintain a sort of frontier culture. Extractive companies are continually testing the land’s ecological limits, like the investors and prospectors of old, and politicians still vigorously enforce arbitrary social categories treating refugees and asylum seekers differently on no more than their mode of arrival. It’s a system every bit as savage as the US-Mexico “border wall”. Yet island New Zealand – small, temperate and distant from the wider world’s conflict and carnage – is closer to northern Europe in its political character. Nearly every politician orbits the liberal centre. Our working class, middle class and major industries bank their prosperity (or not) on a moderately redistributive state. In policy terms, this makes for only minor differences in refugee and asylum policies. Our “boat people” laws are largely in line with Australia’s. But in political terms the differences are stark. Under the last Labour government, New Zealand took more than 100 refugees from the Tampa, as one example. But across the ditch, or at least in Canberra, Boochani is a bogeyman. In Wellington a good number of politicians are privately happy he’s here, and on the streets of Christchurch, ordinary New Zealanders welcome him with hugs and hongi, a Māori greeting where you gently press your noses together, exchanging breath and life. It’s quite likely if the last detainees on Manus Island ever make it south, the local iwi will accord them the honour of a pōwhiri, the highest welcome to this land. Of course none of this is meant to suggest New Zealanders are somehow better people than Australians. On a trip to Melbourne last month the people I spoke to in blue-ribbon Sandringham and Hampton were almost uniformly against what their government is doing on Manus Island. The difference, I think, is in our respective institutions and cultures. New Zealand’s hard borders are, in truth, the continent to our west (Australia) and the ocean blue to our east (the Pacific). That means we can afford a more generous political culture in these individual cases because the imaginary boats people like Boochani are meant to represent, are so distant. It all reinforces, I think, what a monstrosity hard borders really are. To function they invent categories. The worthy and unworthy, even going as far as to assign dehumanising “points” to prospective migrants. Perhaps the only thing worse than the hard border itself is the in-between places it breeds: Australia’s offshore detention centres; the Mexican borders towns where refugees and asylum seekers are sent to await their application’s fate; the Greek holding camps where Africa and the Middle East’s desperate and hungry hang their hopes on the remote promise of a future in northern or western Europe. The best New Zealand can do right now is reject these in-between places and accept Boochani and all his former Manus comrades who wish to come. Morgan Godfery is a writer and broadcaster.

          "headline": "Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?",
          "bodyText": "Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. “Today I read Annie Ernaux’s I Remain in Darkness, translated by Tanya Leslie,” says JayZed: It’s her memoir of the final two dementia-ridden years of her mother’s life. Actually, memoir is not the right word: it’s her jottings and diary entries at the time, published many years later, so the pain is raw and unfiltered. It’s a very short book, but not an easy read. I found it particularly hard as I’m going through this with my father at the moment. Even so, I was surprised by how much the feelings she articulates resonated with me. She captures the pain of seeing someone you love and have known as a strong, capable parent reduced to helplessness and dependance: “Yet the woman who stands before me today is the same one I knew in the past. That’s what is so terrible.” An honest and moving account of how we react to ageing, dementia and death. Extinctions by Josephine Wilson has impressed SydneyH: Wilson’s prose is very attractive at times. For example, when the protagonist is drinking a champagne cocktail, he “watched thousands of industrious gold and silver bubbles scramble up the tunnel of his glass”. The occasional black and white photographs give the novel a similar texture to WG Sebald’s work, though I was also reminded of Wallace Stegner, especially his novel The Spectator Bird. A retired engineering professor, tormented by regrets, shuts himself away from the world in his home. Meanwhile, his adopted daughter, an Indigenous Australian woman from the Stolen Generation, studies extinct creatures, for whom she feels a certain kinship. I would encourage fans of Sebald or Stegner to scope it out and see if it tempts them. Transcription by Kate Atkinson has entertained Maggie B: It’s described as “A spy novel that dismantles the whole genre” – not really, but it was very entertaining and meticulously researched.There was a surprise ending which I really didn’t see coming and it has a very useful bibliography. A really good read. Women Talking by Miriam Toews is “wonderful” says safereturndoubtful: Between 2005 to 2009, a remote Mennonite community in Bolivia was haunted by a supposed demon that was raping the colony’s women. Eventually, two men were caught trying to break into a neighbour’s house in the night, and they revealed the truth, that the women had been drugged and raped. In 2011, eight men would be brought to trial and found guilty. Officially, there are 130 victims, most likely more. In some places of our world it seems the evil Faulkner wrote about all those years ago isn’t much different today. The fact that Toews can write an entertaining novel about this is remarkable in itself … an astonishing piece of work. “A friend, saying with ironic understatement ‘if nothing else, I thought you’d like the title’, gave me Gilliam’s Freeman’s The Leather Boys,” writes LeatherCol: I’m grateful to her for introducing me to Freeman (who died this year). I was impressed, and moved, by her ability to write about gay men and our expressions of queer masculinity (underlining that we gay men don’t own these themes as our sole territory, and that we should welcome anyone using our experiences positively in literature) and love in the book. I then found her Alabaster Egg and my admiration for her talent deepened, the way she moved between periods (Ludwig’s Bavaria, Nazi Germany, and a present) and stories and, perhaps more than anything, her beautiful use of English makes her a wonderful writer. If you haven’t read her, I recommend seeking her out. It will be worth the effort. “I finished Olga Tokarczuk’s Drive Your Plow Over The Bones of The Dead last night,” says captainlego: As most reviewers have said, it is a novel that is near impossible to categorise. The best description I can attempt is that it reads like a philosophical whodunit; which takes in animal rights and welfare, provincial politics, the role of authority in society, the role of community and how we live and relate to each other. It has a very likeable central character in Janina; a retired engineer and eccentric older lady given to serious contemplation of the animal and human worlds. It is by turns funny and deadly serious and is one of my favourite reads of the year. CCCubbon has just finished The Invisible Library by Genevieve Cogman: It’s not a long book but one which tumbles from one fantasy situation to another, from Fae folk to dragons to articulated alligators, library books to alternative worlds. This is the introductory novel and I would hope the next calmed down a little, less frantic, more developed. A little light relief and fun that needed only a modicum of concentration. Might be just the thing to read over the holiday. Interesting links about books and reading The most expensive sales of the year on Abebooks. (Who came top? Honest Abe…) I am delighted to tell you that there is a book called A Christmas With Carol: An Erotic Scrooge Variation. Lithub’s pick of the most scathing reviews of 2019. The story of the review that made Jack Kerouac famous. And here is that review: “On the Road is a major novel.” A beautiful book about the Earth at night from NASA.

          "headline": "Cold Warriors by Duncan White review – when novels were weapons",
          "bodyText": "It is said that Russia’s imaginative writers are safe from the attentions of President Putin because he believes that literature (unlike TV or the internet) is entirely unimportant. Meanwhile, President Trump’s vision of the US as the world’s greatest nation clearly does not include its greatest writers: was there any presidential response to the deaths of either Philip Roth, last year, or Toni Morrison, more recently? ’Twas not ever thus. Duncan White’s new history of writers’ involvement in the cold war, a big book full of grim case studies, is also a weirdly encouraging reminder that literature can unsettle the powerful. In this account of the ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, covering the half-century from the late 1930s to the collapse of the Soviet Union, writers sometimes seem more influential than politicians, spies or generals. By “writers”, White means novelists, poets and playwrights. He shows how prominent authors were influenced by the cold war between west and east, but also, more interestingly, how literature was used in that conflict. His is a history of “cultural warfare”. We start in the crucible of the Spanish civil war, where George Orwell and Arthur Koestler first discover the murderous consequences of political ideals, but also the power of fiction to display these. Orwell’s books, banned in Warsaw Pact states, became weapons in the war of ideologies. When he was trying unsuccessfully to get Nineteen Eighty-Four published, the Ministry of Information official who advised Jonathan Cape to refuse Orwell’s novel was in fact a long-standing NKVD agent. It would not be long before the CIA was printing copies of Animal Farm that were light enough to be floated by balloons into eastern Europe. Meanwhile Koestler, eventually a zealous anti-communist preacher, berating western liberals and leftists for any ambivalence about the Soviet threat, naturally began as a Communist party activist, able to ignore the evidence of persecution and starvation that he saw on a journey through the Soviet Union in 1932. Posing as a pro-Franco journalist in Spain, he spied for the Soviet Union and narrowly escaped execution. When he renounced communism, he wrote his 1940 novel Darkness at Noon, a fictional treatment of Stalin’s purges, which became a bestseller in France after the war. We shift from Spain to the Soviet Union itself, where the best writers were the most suspect. We follow short-story writer Isaac Babel, trying to survive amid the purges and the show trials, “the compass needle dead on terror”, as the poet Robert Lowell was to put it. It is now possible to reconstruct the narrative of his torture, confession (to “spying”), retraction and perfunctory trial. He was executed in the Lubyanka prison in 1940. White’s narrative method is to base each chapter on the fortunes of one author or pair of authors, but also to switch, from chapter to chapter, between different countries, sometimes different continents. The contrasts are telling. In 1936, while self-consciously leftwing US writers discuss the finer points of ideological commitment at the Congress of American Writers in Manhattan, the Moscow show trials are in full swing. Later, we leave Koestler and Sartre arguing over cold war attitudes at Paris soirees to see Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn entering a prison camp in the remote steppes of Kazakhstan, or the poet Anna Akhmatova, tormented into a show of compliance by the imprisonment of her son in a gulag, her best poetry remembered but not even written down. US government agencies also feared the subversive effects of fiction. The House Un-American Activities Committee notoriously targeted Hollywood writers. White devotes a chapter to the communist novelist Howard Fast, whose novel Spartacus was prevented from publication by the FBI on the grounds that it was veiled pro-communist propaganda. Fast self-published his book and made it a bestseller. Another follows the African American novelist Richard Wright as he grapples with the growing realisation that communism will not offer the alternative to the violent racism that he has known in the US. White is allured by the ways in which British writers became entangled with spies. While working for SIS (now commonly known as MI6) in 1942, the top Soviet agent Kim Philby was reading reports written by one of his agents in Freetown, Sierra Leone – Graham Greene. (Agent Greene’s big idea was for a West African “spy brothel”, which would lure Vichy French officers and filch their secrets from them.) When Greene returned from Africa to SIS HQ in St Albans in 1943, Philby became his boss. Greene later wrote a novel, Our Man in Havana, ridiculing the endeavours of his country’s intelligence agencies, and expressed sympathy for Fidel Castro, yet was continuing to pass information to the British secret service. Not only was literature politicised: sometimes it seems that any cultural initiative had the secret services of the US or the USSR behind it. We find the Soviet Union was backing the Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace, whose sponsors included Leonard Bernstein, Frank Lloyd Wright, Langston Hughes and Paul Robeson. The CIA, set up in 1947, had an equivalent faith in the potency of literary debates and publications. Most famously, it secretly funded the left-of-centre magazine Encounter, begun in 1953 with Stephen Spender as its first editor and Frank Kermode as his successor. The agency was everywhere in the world of letters. The international Congress for Cultural Freedom, a gathering of anticommunist intellectuals, received its covert financial backing. Intellectuals protested in the left-leaning Partisan Review against CIA influence, but this journal too had received funding from the agency. Prestigious literary magazines in various countries were also bankrolled. Paraphrasing Shelley, Mary McCarthy reflected that the leadership of the CIA felt a kinship with intellectuals: “The CIA sees itself as a lonely mastermind, the poet and unacknowledged legislator of the government.” The US and the USSR were ready to pounce on literary achievements that embarrassed each other. Western intelligence services ensured that copies of Boris Pasternak’s Doctor Zhivago were smuggled back into Russia. Equally, it was a Soviet victory when, after years of pressure, Stalin’s favourite, Mikhail Sholokhov, won the Nobel prize in 1965. An author such as Andrei Sinyavsky, imprisoned in the 1960s for his mischievous satirical fiction, may have protested at his trial that his work had no political trajectory, but it was being broadcast by the CIA-funded Radio Liberty. There was no escaping the cold war. This is a long and compendious book, in part because the situation of any given writer often involves a good deal of potted history. It is a work of synthesis rather than of research, but White has a sharp eye for the telling anecdote – for the absurd as well as the fearful. We end in Moscow with the dying spy Philby unsuccessfully seeking out the visiting John le Carré, whose novels he loved, to help him write his memoirs. Philby was firm in his belief that a novelist of the cold war – especially one who had once been his professional foe – could best do justice to his life. Like his former masters, he respected literature. • Cold Warriors: Writers Who Waged the Literary Cold War by Duncan White is published by Little, Brown (£25).

          "headline": "Poem of the week: Not for That City by Charlotte Mew",
          "bodyText": "Not for That City Not for that city of the level sun, Its golden streets and glittering gates ablaze – The shadeless, sleepless city of white days, White nights, or nights and days that are as one – We weary, when all said, all thought, all done. We strain our eyes beyond this dusk to see What, from the threshold of eternity We shall step into. No, I think we shun The splendour of that everlasting glare, The clamour of that never-ending song. And if for anything we greatly long, It is for some remote and quiet stair Which winds to silence and a space for sleep Too sound for waking and for dreams too deep. Charlotte Mew (1869–1928) produced only a small body of poems in her career, but they amount to some of the most individual and formally inventive verse written in English in the early 20th century. Initially, she was more successful as a writer of short stories, and produced little poetry. Thanks largely to the quick eye of Alida Monro at the Poetry Bookshop in London, Mew was able to publish her first poetry collection, The Farmer’s Bride, in 1916. Her work was enthusiastically received and she would go on to enjoy a particularly strong response from fellow writers, including HD, Thomas Hardy and Marianne Moore. But her reputation was not sustained. In 1981, a Collected Poems and Prose, edited and introduced by Val Warner, introduced her work to a new generation. Warner’s magnificent work is honoured by Julia Copus who, as Mew’s biographer, and a poet in her own right, has edited a new Selected Poetry and Prose. The collection contains much interesting background material as well as three previously uncollected poems. Not for That City, first published in 1902, is in many ways a traditional sonnet. Formally, Mew often experimented with long, prose-like lines, and varieties of indentation, bringing a prose writer’s sense of larger rhythmic possibilities into the poem as dramatic lyric. Even in Not for That City, she indents alternate pairs of lines in the original, a cautious hint of more radical structures to come. But, Copus reminds us, this is only the fourth of her poems to be published. What is most striking is the treatment of the ideal – the vision of heaven as a city of perpetual sunlight. The vision is presented as a rather terrifying, relentless prospect: “The shadeless, sleepless city of white days, / White nights, or nights and days that are as one.” This is reinforced later by phrases such as “everlasting glare” and “clamour of that never-ending song”. Mew’s first editors added “is” before “said” to the line: “We weary, when all said, all thought, all done.” Copus has reinstated the original line, and so demonstrates the tangled weight to it. The speaker’s rejection of the cosmic ideal is foreseen in the opening negative, “Not for that city,” and so, when it appears at the turn in the middle of line eight, despite the eloquence of the caesura, the transition is smooth. The alternative spelled out is an earthly, domestic scene, with a characteristic “quiet stair” and a death that brings no afterlife, only oblivion. Not for That City is a tactful poem, not quite professing atheism but certainly rejecting the traditional religious emphasis on eternal life. It is a fluent, vivid sonnet, and also a brave one. Poem of the week is happy to be just in time to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the poet’s birth."

          "bodyText": "In 1988, Time magazine selected “The Endangered Earth” as its person of the year. This December, 31 years later, the honour went to Greta Thunberg. The point of the Time exercise is to take a complex issue and locate a person through whom we can better understand it. Twenty years ago the magazine’s search for a human environmental story stalled in orbit; now it is easy to locate. That wouldn’t have been possible even this time last year. The biggest story in climate in 2019 is the way in which, after years of languishing outside the mainstream, climate activism has finally broken through. It seems obvious in retrospect that the kids were the key. Self-organised, serious, heartbreakingly frank about their anger at seeing their futures foreclosed by politicians who won’t even live to see the consequences, they have lent a powerful moral drive to the entire movement. Climate protests are not new, but they acquired a new urgency this year. Extinction Rebellion looks a lot like green groups of years past, but where those earlier protests were perhaps too polite, ER has enthusiastically embraced disruption. Like the school protesters, it has been emboldened by what now seem to be the obvious immediate effects of the climate crisis: deadly heatwaves across Europe, wildfires in the US, cyclones in the Pacific and record-breaking high temperatures across the world. For several years scientists have been speaking in more concrete terms about the consequences of climate change, and have been willing to connect it directly to current events. The link between the climate emergency and our own lives has never seemed clearer. Finally, after decades of activists struggling to push the crisis into the larger consciousness, poll after poll shows that public concern, and desire for action, is at an all-time high. The question that became clearer as the year went on was, having achieved what the climate movement always wanted – prominent and positive media coverage, widespread public support, audiences with world leaders – was it possible to effect any actual political change? The spectacle of Thunberg and the larger youth climate movement arriving at international meetings and parliaments and accusing heads of state of hypocrisy to their faces is undoubtedly thrilling. But climate politics itself still seems far from any genuine watershed moment. There has been little concrete progress. What the protests have sparked, instead, is a rush by governments to declare a “climate emergency” and to set or retrench future emissions targets. In previous years this alone would have seemed radical enough, generating enormous goodwill; now, however, the gap between words and actions has widened too far, and credulity is in short supply. The climate researcher Rebecca Willis put the new standard succinctly earlier this month: “Targets don’t reduce carbon. Policies do.” There has been some hope on that front. Parties in the UK and candidates in the US Democratic primaries took on comprehensive climate platforms for the first time. These either directly or indirectly reference the concept of a “green new deal” – pairing increased spending on climate with a larger social transformation, and breaking down the wall that separates climate policy from the rest of national politics. But crucially, nothing similar has been brought forward by a government actually in power. What hasn’t changed is the intractable nature of international climate negotiations. The UN’s climate change conference, COP, falls at the end of the calendar year, and, being the place where countries affirm their climate commitments under the UN framework convention on climate change, rarely produces a hopeful coda to the previous 12 months. “Good” COPs are rare. This year’s iteration in Madrid wasn’t the worst, but it seemed strangely removed from the rest of the year’s events, as if the delegates had been bussed directly across space and time from last December’s meeting in Katowice, bypassing entirely the wave of protest and the titanic shift in public opinion. And so, in the same week that Time honoured the climate movement, a loose coalition of rightwing governments – including administrations in Brazil and Australia – effectively stymied the conference’s goal of strengthening the Paris agreement. Despite warnings that current plans are totally inadequate, and 11,000 researchers stating “the climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected”, little was agreed, and hope for action was – again – punted to next year. It’s a depressing story, and it isn’t the biggest climate story of the year because it’s effectively the same news we’ve heard nearly every year since the conference began a quarter of a century ago. The rise of a broadly popular climate movement and the stirrings of national-level climate politics puts the continued failure of the negotiations into stark relief. The international effort was always meant to lead the way, but it feels increasingly remote from the rest of the climate struggle – as if it’s taking place on a different planet. • Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment"

          "bodyText": "“Let’s sort this mess of a town out,” says a voter in Leigh, a former Lancashire mining and mill town on the edges of greater Manchester, writing on the Facebook wall of its first ever Conservative MP. “Like Labour have done anything for Leigh over the last 100 years apart from grind it in to the ground,” says another. The central Tory slogan of “get Brexit done”, handed down from headquarters to James Grundy, a local councillor, now elected to represent the town he grew up in, had an important extra element: “and fix our town”. The writing had been on the wall for years in Leigh. People here would have warned long before the election that a political earthquake was coming. Red for almost a century, the town was among the broad swathe of former industrial constituencies to turn blue, redrawing the electoral landscape to keep Boris Johnson safely in Downing Street. Brexit played a major role in a town that voted overwhelmingly to leave. So did the idea of Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister: the most unpopular opposition leader for half a century, who promised more than he seemed competent to deliver. But while neither can be downplayed, the seeds of defeat for Labour were sown years before 2019. The seismic shift in Leigh and other so-called “red wall” seats across the north comes from two other deep-rooted problems: The first is the consequences of the economic model that has held sway in Britain for 40 years. The second is the vast centralisation of political power in Westminster. Deindustrialisation began long before the late 1970s, but was propelled faster forward as the 1980s advanced to shift Britain, like many wealthy nations, into a service-oriented economy. What went wrong was the failure of successive governments to support areas similar to Leigh that experienced the hollowing out of jobs as manufacturing employment ebbed away. Instead, the red wall towns have low-paid, less-rewarding work as their inheritance, with work in the new boom industries of warehousing, call centres and retail. That’s not to say no good jobs remain. But they do not exist on the scale required, while the idea of commuting to better work elsewhere is a stretch when transport links remain laughably bad. According to the research group Centre for Towns, constituencies that turned from red to blue were almost all ageing as a consequence of these trends, finding that the over-65 population has risen by about 30% in places like Mansfield, Bolsover and Bishop Auckland. All former Labour bastions that are now Tory seats. “It was like a slow-motion car crash,” says Jo Platt, the defeated Labour MP. “Pockets of support were collapsing. We have an older demographic here and our kids leave the first opportunity they get.” “A lot of it was the Brexit vote. It’s not that they liked Johnson in any way shape or form. They thought he was a bumbling idiot. But it was about getting something done that they feel should’ve been done three and a half years ago.” The second factor is about local political power, or the lack of it. Public spending power in Britain is largely concentrated in two neighbouring terraced homes on a street in Westminster, No 10 and No 11, rather than in any post-industrial town. It has left people in smaller towns across Britain feeling as though decisions that affect their lives are somehow a very remote activity, over which they have little influence. According to the IPPR thinktank, as much as 95p in every £1 paid in tax is taken by central government, compared to just 69p in Germany. Just 1% of Britain’s national income is spent by local government on economic affairs, half that spent locally and regionally in France or Germany. Leigh is governed by the Labour-led Wigan council. The local council is relatively popular in Wigan itself – a handful of miles up the road - responding to central government cuts with “the deal,” a big society vision of community groups and charities stepping into the void. But Leigh’s people will tell you they’ve seen nothing and had nothing from the Labour-led council. They feel ignored by the council, while the high street is dead, homelessness has risen, the transport is appalling, and it’s all Labour’s fault. Platt says she took much of the flack on the doorstep. The council has always been Labour and so has the MP, and so it seemed to voters like their problem. “I’m the face of Labour in Leigh,” Platt says, adding: “I was getting blamed for the bins and the potholes. We’re seeing more homeless on streets; fly-tipping up and bin collection down.” Grundy ran a hyperlocal campaign. Promises to extend the Atherleigh Way bypass, stop extensive building on the greenbelt and reopening a train station in one of the biggest towns in Britain without a rail link, from a local lad were hugely popular. It was Grundy’s party and not Platt’s that has had a bigger impact in the area, despite never holding power locally. Over the past decade of austerity, Labour councils in the north of England have been hit much harder than their leafy Conservative equivalents in the south. In Wigan, the amount spent by the council has been slashed by 43% after inflation, compared with an average of 24% nationally, according to a Cambridge university study. The cuts handed down from Westminster were the biggest in Wigan’s history, were the third worst for any local authority in the country, and reduced its budget over a decade by £160m. Boris Johnson knows he cannot continue down the path of his own party, and has turned on the spending taps as a consequence. This is popular and vital. But the prime minister cannot simply mend the problems of his own party’s making by splashing money around. None of his ideas appear to be in any way connected to individual places. And the concern is that pots of funding controlled in Westminster will result in bidding fests across smaller towns, where everyone competes against everyone else. The plans with the most publicity bang for Johnson’s buck will win, rather than the most in need. In reality, interventions that can make the economies of towns work better are of fundamental importance. Central government ought though play a minimal role, handing spending decisions to local areas. In winning the election in places like Leigh, the Tories have a blank sheet of paper to come up with some new ideas about how to best help their new, traditional working-class constituents. Throwing money at the old red wall might sound like a good idea, but if Johnson wants to make it stick, he ought to hand control of the cash to local people."

          "bodyText": "The world awoke to the need to combat global heating Was 2019 the year people finally started to listen to climate scientists on global heating? The previous year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had laid out the monumental challenge of limiting warming to 1.5C. Global CO2 emissions would need to halve within 12 years, and reach zero around 2050. But emissions are still rising, while UN summits make tiny steps towards agreeing how to reduce them. The “emissions gap” between target and reality grows ever wider – and becomes ever harder to close. This struck a chord with vast numbers of people, especially the young, who are thinking ahead to what their world could look like. Greta Thunberg kickstarted a global movement of school strikers, demanding that governments “listen to the science” and “act as if the house is on fire”. Although some countries have ramped up their own emissions cuts targets – the UK now officially aims for net zero emissions by 2050 – public concern and frustration has kept growing. More and more members of the public have taken extreme steps to call for urgent action on climate, with Extinction Rebellion protesters being arrested en masse and controversially keeping the issue in the news. What if we don’t turn things around quickly? Major impacts are already baked in, with glaciers melting worldwide, Greenland losing ice rapidly, and heatwaves and fires happening more often and more severely. Heavy rainfall is increasing, as is drought in some places. We already need to live with a different climate. Although some campaigners’ rhetoric is not scientific (we don’t seriously expect “6 billion deaths”), unchecked warming would still expose tens or even hundreds of millions to extreme heat stress conditions and flooding from the sea. The worst can still be avoided, but the longer we keep heating the planet, the harder it gets. Prof Richard Betts, climate scientist, University of Exeter and Met Office Hadley Centre A last-chance survey of the Arctic sea ice got under way Right now, on top of the world, a ship is frozen into the Arctic sea ice at the north pole. The RV Polarstern is pirouetting on the spot in the dark, with no prospect of sunlight for months to come. This region of Earth, the Arctic Ocean, is still one of the most remote and inaccessible places on our planet. We know very little about what happens here during the polar night, when temperatures can easily drop to -30C, and thick sea ice crunches and bends in the darkness. But this region is critical to Earth’s climate, and it’s essential to understand more. The Polarstern is here on a once-in-for-ever opportunity to fill that data gap. It’s the centrepiece of the Mosaic expedition, probably the biggest polar expedition that will ever be launched. Twenty years from now, it may not be possible to do this: to freeze into the sea ice for an entire year and to drift inside this vast cold environment to watch and learn from the inside. It’s taken 20 years to organise, and over the year of the expedition (September 2019 to September 2020), 600 scientists will rotate on and off the ship, supported by many more in research institutes around the world. There is no question that the data being gathered now will drive a revolution in our understanding of the north pole and our climate, and every one of us will be affected by what they find. Helen Czerski, physicist and oceanographer The first image of a black hole will have huge ramifications The laws of physics can be expressed in a handful of compact equations, but their reach is simply breathtaking. A stunning demonstration of this came with our first picture of a black hole, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope. The black hole is situated at the centre of the Messier 87 galaxy, 54m light years away. The glowing ring of radiation, emitted by tortured matter spinning through warped space-time, is already iconic. The matter is plunging towards an event horizon as big as the solar system, containing the mass of 6.5bn suns. Remarkable aspects of the image abound. The theory of general relativity, published by Einstein a hundred years ago, predicted the existence and features of this beast remarkably well. The cataclysmic whirlpool may be beyond our imagination, but it is not beyond our mathematics. The singularity predicted at the heart of a black hole is a different story though. That is where quantum mechanics and relativity conflict and break down. We would love to know what answers lie there, and we will be scouring the image for any clues. Finally, the global collaboration necessary to capture the image shows we can work together on a worldwide scale to a common goal – something that our science tells us we need to do more of, if we want to survive as a species and continue our exploration of the amazing universe in which we find ourselves. Jon Butterworth, professor of physics, University College London Progress was made in the fight against Ebola in DRC Ebola in 2019 highlights both the achievements of scientific progress and the persistent deep-rooted challenges of improving health in the most difficult settings. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa killed more than 11,000 people and alerted the world to its dangers. It highlighted the rich world’s neglect of research and development for infectious diseases that only rarely present a global risk. At the end of 2019 we have a licensed Ebola vaccine, another hopefully soon to be licensed, and two effective therapeutic drugs. We can now treat those infected as well as prevent spread of the disease, allowing us to move from reactive containment to primary prevention, as a result of large and innovative collaborations that demonstrate how to help develop new and effective technologies, now and in the future. But the current outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has lasted more than 15 months and killed more than 2,000 people. Treatment and control continues to be hugely difficult in a setting characterised by political, economic and social fragility. Effective vaccines and drugs are part of what is needed for epidemic prevention, but we must continue to strive to address the fundamental causes of ill health in these settings. Anne Mills, professor of health economics and policy, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine We found our earliest European ancestors Remember that time when we were young, and we had those nice neat family trees about human evolution? Lucy, Homo erectus, skip a few, Neanderthals and finally us? That whole scheme has been thoroughly binned in the last decade, with more fossil discoveries and the addition of ancient DNA to the armoury. We now have less confidence in the relationships between many more members of the human family, apart from the ones whose legacy we can see in our own DNA – our Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestors. Others will be found soon enough. We remain an African species. Homo sapiens evolved in multiple places in Africa, and a few thousand left some 70,000 years ago to populate the rest of the world. But now we know that there were earlier diasporas from the motherland. This year, we discovered that we had made it all the way to Greece. Embedded in the roof of a cave in the southern Peloponnese, two crushed skulls were found by Katerina Harvati and her team, one a sprightly 170,000-year-old Neanderthal, but the other is us, Homo sapiens, and is more than 210,000 years old. This is far older and much farther afield than we had previously found. The revolution in the story of how we got here shows no signs of calming down. Dr Adam Rutherford is a geneticist and author. His book How to Argue With a Racist is out in February (W&amp;N, 12.99) The promise and fears around gene editing ratcheted upwards Although announced in November 2018, the shock waves from the announcement by the Chinese scientist He Jiankui that two girls had been born from embryos that were genetically modified using genome editing have been reverberating throughout 2019, and will no doubt continue to do so for years to come. This was a misguided and badly conducted attempt to make children resistant to infection by HIV, the virus that causes Aids, by mutating the CCR5 gene, which encodes a protein expressed on the surface of white blood cells that the virus uses to gain entry. He showed disregard for normal scientific and clinical practice, ignored risks to the children born and potentially to subsequent generations. But the work made the prospect of altering our genetic makeup more immediate rather than theoretical. It also raised concerns about where to draw the line with the possibility of not just avoiding genetic and perhaps infectious disease, but ultimately carrying out forms of enhancement. However, it had the positive benefit of stimulating debate worldwide and it has led to the launch of international efforts, notably a science academies panel to judge the science, clinical need, and the conditions that would have to be met for germline (potentially heritable) genome editing to be carried out; and a WHO-appointed committee to develop a framework of governance that can be adopted to control the use of the genome editing methods in treating or avoiding disease. Both of these efforts will report next year. Meanwhile, the science of genome editing and its application in both the field and clinic are progressing rapidly. A novel and ingenious new method termed prime editing, published by David Liu and colleagues, can efficiently make precise, small changes in DNA, without the problems associated with earlier methods, such as those used by He Jiankui. Given that about 85% of disease-causing mutations in humans could, in theory, be corrected by prime editing, it clearly offers great promise. Ways to make animals and plants resistant to disease and to allow plants to cope with climate change have been developed using genome editing, and this year we have seen a huge jump in the number of clinical trials using the methods to treat patients with genetic diseases (“somatic” or non-heritable gene therapy), including cancers, blindness and sickle cell disease. Robin Lovell-Badge, group leader, the Francis Crick Institute, London Work on batteries for the future was rightly honoured The rechargeable lithium-ion battery has helped power the global revolution in portable electronics, and, indeed, many of you will be reading this article on a mobile phone, laptop or tablet computer. In October this year, the three pioneers of the lithium-ion battery, John Goodenough from the University of Texas at Austin, Stan Whittingham from Binghamton University, New York, and Akira Yoshino from Japan’s Meijo University, were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry. For me, this award was long overdue and finally recognised an exciting area of materials chemistry. There are lots of reasons to welcome this news. For the sheer beauty of literally holding the result of their fundamental research in our hands. For the celebration of John Goodenough, who at 97 is the oldest person ever awarded any Nobel prize. For the fact that new materials lie at the heart of developing green technologies that can change the way we live and work. For spurring further development of better batteries for electric vehicles and for storing energy from wind and solar. Perhaps most of all because it helps to shine a light on one of the most urgent challenges of our time: a low-carbon future to deal with climate change. Saiful Islam, professor of materials chemistry at the University of Bath Madagascar’s plight highlighted a global problem Menabe, a dry forest in western Madagascar, is on fire. The only habitat of the world’s smallest primate (Berthe’s mouse lemur) is going up in flames as hungry people, many escaping droughts in the south, clear land for agriculture (despite the area being officially protected). Worryingly, we learned in October that this is far from an isolated problem and protected areas are less effective than previously thought. Using a global data set of population density, night-time light and agriculture, researchers compared the changes in human pressures over time in more than 12,000 protected areas with similar unprotected areas. On average, pressures have increased faster inside than outside protected areas and those in poorer countries are particularly likely to suffer higher pressures. A decade ago, governments agreed a target to increase the proportion of the globe under conservation by 2020. Next year they gather to review progress and, potentially, commit to new targets. The evidence is clear; when it comes to protecting sites for conservation, quality matters. Designating protected areas without effective management (including support for local communities) won’t stop the fires, hold back the expansions of farms, or, ultimately, protect species from extinction. Julia Jones, professor in conservation science, Bangor University Rats like playing hide-and-seek – just for fun Games of hide-and-seek are among my favourite childhood memories, and I still case novel environments for good hiding places. Researchers in Germany studied how rats can learn to play hide-and-seek with humans. All the rats learned to look for the hiding experimenter and all but one learned to hide from her. The only reward the rats received was the experimenter tickling and playing with them. The data suggests that the rats were enthusiastically engaging in the game, looking “frantically” for the experimenter, squeaking and executing Freudensprünge (“joy jumps”) when they found her. They seemed to understand what it means to hide, preferring opaque boxes rather than clear boxes, and remaining silent (no squeals) until found. Frequently when they were found, they would tease the experimenter by running away and hiding again. It’s worth bearing in mind how complex this hide-and-seek is – involving changes in role (hider or seeker) and theory of mind, and it’s almost alarming how well these rats learned to do this, all in the absence of classic psychological rewards like food. The experimenters conclude that the rats learn to play this game for the sheer joy of playing the game, and this is disconcertingly similar to the way human children play. Sophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience, University College London Pioneering work on oxygen levels in the blood paid dividends Once, during an ill-judged holiday in Borneo, I tried to climb a small mountain. While I crawled, panted and coughed on the slopes, my Malaysian guide, Miki, shuffled around politely, hands in his pockets, playing football with small rocks to slow his pace enough to match mine. Unacclimatised to altitude, it took me a day and a half to get to the summit. When I asked Miki how long it would normally take him to do the same he told me that, unencumbered by tourists like me, he could run up and down the mountain in just over three hours. The molecular mechanisms that underpin Miki’s apparently superhuman adaptation to high-altitude life revolve around a family of proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). These substances trigger alterations in a host of genes, which together help regulate oxygen levels in the human body. Their discovery helped explain how oxygen levels could be sensed and gave scientists insight into the mechanisms that allow the body to adapt and survive when demand for oxygen greatly outstrips supply. This year Sir Peter Ratcliffe, Gregg Semenza and William Kaelin shared a Nobel prize for their part in unpicking that mystery. Their work informs more than ill-advised summit attempts. HIFs and the regulation of oxygen levels are together central to almost all aspects of human life, whether in health or disease. The work has already been applied to develop drugs to treat anaemia and may one day lead to new treatments for stroke, spinal cord injury, chronic inflammation and even cancer. Prof Kevin Fong is a consultant anaesthetist at University College London Hospital The Israeli moon probe Beresheet crash-landed but broke new ground My choice is a venture that failed – but was a heroic failure: the Israeli effort to land a small robotic vehicle on the moon. This project, named Beresheet (Hebrew for “in the beginning”), was supported by private and philanthropic funding. It attracted wide interest among the young, and showed what can be achieved with hi-tech ingenuity. To minimise the weight of fuel, it didn’t follow a direct track but was boosted into successively higher orbits around the Earth until it was captured by the moon’s gravity. It was launched on 22 February and was planned to soft-land on 10 April. But a gyroscope malfunctioned; the retro-jets didn’t ignite soon enough, and it crash-landed. I highlight Beresheet because it’s a precursor of a new style of space ventures – small scale, privately funded, and genuinely involving the public. (Indeed, Beresheet carried, as a school project, hundreds of tardigrades, microscopic “water bears”, which may have survived the impact.) We’re moving beyond an era when all space projects must involve national agencies or large commercial conglomerates. Groups from many nations will be able to launch follow-ups similar in concept to Beresheet. Sophisticated, privately funded miniaturised probes will gather data about the moon as well as the Earth. Some may go deeper into space, using advanced robotics, and the sophisticated electronics developed for smartphones. There will still be scope for big projects – maybe even some carrying humans. But space will become an arena for independent experimenters – even hobbyists. Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal The kilogram was redefined using quantum physics There have been so many “significant” science stories in 2019 that I have been spoilt for choice. I could have gone with the climate crisis (David Attenborough’s speech at Davos or Greta Thunberg’s at the UN); or maybe the announcement of the first image of a black hole by scientists on the Event Horizon Telescope project, which seems to have already achieved iconic status. Or I could have chosen Google’s recent announcement that they had achieved quantum supremacy with their new quantum computer. But instead, I’ve gone with “quirky” rather than “significant”. In May, it was announced that the international SI units of measurement had been redefined. For example, the kilogram will no longer be compared with a cylinder of metal sitting under a bell jar outside Paris. Instead – check this out – it can be fixed just by knowing the frequency of vibration of an atom of caesium. That frequency defines the length of a second, which together with the speed of light defines the length of a metre, which in turn, together with knowing Planck’s constant of quantum theory, allows us to calculate what a kilogram is. It is so utterly cool, but probably only fascinating to geeky physicists like me. Still, I make no apology.

          "headline": "‘We can beat Ebola but must prepare for what comes next,’ says Wellcome Trust head",
          "bodyText": "Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust, has a straightforward view about the way doctors and scientists tackled the current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. “In four or five years, we have taken a disease that was absolutely terrifying and which had an enormously high death rate – more than 80% – and we have turned it, potentially, into something that is preventable and treatable.” The fact this has been done in a nation in the middle of a civil war is “simply miraculous”, added Farrar, a world expert on emerging diseases. “It is a truly phenomenal achievement. If you do not celebrate that, you cannot celebrate anything else.” However, there is a sting in the tail of Farrar’s medical message. Yes, over the past four years science has developed diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that are helping to halt Ebola. But major problems still lie ahead for many nations, including DRC, which try to deploy these treatments without continued international help – because they have such fragile health services. And that is true not just for Ebola but for entire health care systems which face continued challenges from TB, HIV, malaria and emerging diseases such as Dengue or Nipah or Mers. All of these could soon become major epidemics thanks to ecological changes taking place across the planet. Ebola was first identified in 1976 by researchers sent to investigate an ailment that was killing victims in a remote part of DRC. Blood taken from patients would not clot, and poured from wounds. Nurses treating patients were also dying. The team named the condition after the local Ebola river. “We now know Ebola is triggered by a virus – probably picked up from an infected bat or non-human primate – that causes blood vessels to leak,” added Farrar. “It ends in organ failure and death.” For the next four decades, small-scale outbreaks occurred in central Africa but were contained by quarantining affected villages. Then in December 2013, a young child was discovered to be infected in west Africa, in Guinea, and because of the extensive movement of people in that area, the disease quickly spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Ebola became a disease of dense populations, killing more than 11,000 people between 2013 and 2016. A new threat to world health had emerged. “The transformation in the behaviour of Ebola came about because of alterations in the movements of humans, changes in human interactions with animals – which act as reservoirs of the virus – as well as changes in ecology and mass urganisaton,” said Farrar. The west Africa outbreak was eventually contained but two years later Ebola appeared again in a major outbreak, this time back in central Africa in DRC in 2018. So far about 2,200 of the 3,500 infected have died. But although the epidemic is still not over, numbers of cases are stabilising . “The world came together and over the past four years we have developed two vaccines to protect against the disease and two drugs that treat those already infected.” said Farrar. “If you can get to people and treat them within four days of them becoming infected, mortality will only be about 10%. A few years ago, it was more like 80%. And of course, vaccines stop you getting the disease in the first place.” Money for the development of these drugs and vaccines has come from the US, UK, Norway, WHO, the European Commission and charities such as the Wellcome Trust. Pharmaceutical firms including Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Regeneron have all provided important help as well. “In addition, all those who carried out Ebola studies in west Africa and in DRC have had to do so under the circumstances of extreme violence and fear, with healthcare colleagues being killed. It is a staggering, astonishing story,” added Farrar. The success he sees in DRC over Ebola is important not just for that disease, he added. There are a number of other illnesses – including Lassa, Mers, Nipah, Marburg and Dengue – which have the potential to become widespread epidemics as a result of climate change or other ecological shifts – and changes in society – in Africa or Asia or Europe. “The lesson from Ebola is that for all these conditions we will need to create vaccines and treatments, where there are none today, over the next 10 years – and we are going to need them. Mers, Lassa and Dengue all have the potential to shift from relatively low infection rates to high ones just as Ebola did in response to ecological change, travel and urbanisation. The world is now very exposed. “Ebola shows we can respond, scientifically, to these threats. The real issue is to ensure drugs and vaccines reach those who need them. To do that we need to set up effective healthcare systems across the world. That will not be easy – but it is critical. It is an issue on which we should be judged. We will succeed, I believe.”"

          "headline": "Robert Pattinson: ‘I don’t really know how to act’",
          "bodyText": "Do you want to hear a funny thing about Robert Pattinson? Robert Pattinson is convinced he doesn’t know how to act. Willem Dafoe can act, Pattinson thinks. Willem Dafoe can act the socks off anyone in the business. And Joaquin Phoenix. Joaquin Phoenix could tie his shoelaces on film and be nominated for an award. And Bruce Willis – Bruce Willis! – now there’s a leading man. But Robert Pattinson? Nope. “I only know how to play scenes, like, three ways,” he says. Three! That’s all. Despite more than a decade in the industry. “I’m nervous on, like, every single movie.” Pattinson, who is 33, is sitting in a booth in a low-lit restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, dunking table bread into a pot of something. It’s the early evening, dark and cold outside. He has arrived from rehearsals for The Batman, which started not long ago and which are taking place, to his delight, in the studio in which he filmed Harry Potter in the mid-aughts. The Batman is the first time he’s worked in a studio in “like, forever,” and his first mainstream leading role since he retired his best-known character, Twilight’s Edward Cullen, sexy vampire. That was in 2012. Maybe he’s tired now. Or maybe he’s had a bad day. Maybe he’s arriving at the studio every morning and not quite getting Batman’s vibe. Maybe he’ll never get Batman’s vibe, and people will finally agree he really can’t act, and his career will come screeching to its inevitable end, and the whole world will fold in on itself. Which are the kind of thoughts Robert Pattinson has. “I’m a catastrophist,” he says, laughing. Pattinson laughs a lot and goes for it: closes his eyes, throws back his head, reveals the square jaw and the fine stubble and the underside of the slightly skew-whiff nose, and lets out a loud, unfiltered giggle. “I’m always thinking that the worst-case scenario is actually going to happen. So when it does happen, I’m like: ‘Gah! OK! I’m prepared!’” Other actors suffer from bouts of false modesty. But Pattinson is wholeheartedly committed to the concept of his ordinariness. He is not “totemic,” he says, like other traditional leading men. And he tends not to work hard in the lead-up to filming, because what if he somehow conjures some very good acting before an actual take, and can’t reproduce whatever spontaneous fluke that created it when the cameras roll? “If I show it in rehearsals,” he says, “then it’s doomed to failure immediately.” It’s strange to hear, all this worry and self-doubt, because over the past six or seven years Pattinson has been slowly, forcefully, making fine films with very good directors. He has worked with David Cronenberg on Cosmopolis and Claire Denis on High Life, Werner Herzog on Queen of the Desert and the Safdie Brothers on Good Time. In The King, David Michôd’s kind of retelling of Shakespeare’s Henriad, which came out on Netflix earlier this year, Pattinson plays a French prince so brilliantly camp it was reported that his co-stars burst into laughter the first time they heard his accent. This kind of thing thrills Pattinson, because at least he got a reaction. “If I’m doing a scene and I see that the other actor is expecting me to do it the way I’m doing it, if I can just see that it hasn’t surprised them, I immediately feel stupid,” he says. Timothée Chalamet plays The King’s titular monarch, but it’s Pattinson scenes you remember: long blond hair; accent as thick as a block of beurre. Next month, Pattinson will star in The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers’s two-hander about lighthouse keepers descending into madness on a remote and craggy island. He appears alongside Willem Dafoe, the actual actor, which was nerve-wracking, of course. “He’s got a tonne of energy,” Pattinson says, “and it’s intimidating.” Before scenes, Pattinson would punch himself in the face, or twirl around to create dizziness, or drink mud from puddles, or force himself to gag. He explains the process as necessary – a wild attempt to maximise creativity – because, you remember, he’s just so bad at acting. “Because I don’t really know how to act, I kind of wanted to somehow make it real, and one of the ways I’ve always thought makes that a little bit easier is if you shake up your physical state just before action. You end up walking into a scene having a different” – pause – “feeling.” Occasionally, Pattinson would gag so hard he’d throw up. “And I forgot I had a mic on the whole time, so the producers and the director, before every single take of the movie, would get…” He sits back in the booth and makes a loud retching sound. “It kind of puts everyone else off.” What did his co-star think? “I don’t know, I was too engrossed in my gagging.” In The Lighthouse, Pattinson’s character grows slowly wilder and more febrile. And so, while filming, Pattinson thought he probably should, too. “I like doing whatever I can to not know what’s going on. To be completely overwhelmed and disorientated. To feel like it’s actually happening.” Did it work? It did! To anyone watching, if not the actor himself, Pattinson emerges as Dafoe’s on-screen equal. (Dafoe, noting Pattinson’s lack of confidence, said recently: “How do I deal with this charming self-deprecation?”) Word is The Lighthouse role might earn Pattinson an Academy Award nomination. Maybe a shot at a Bafta. Which is as good a nod as any to the fact that Robert Pattinson has quietly become one of Britain’s best actors. “I’m kind of amazed by how it’s been received,” he says. He’s sipping a beer now, dunking the bread. “I love the movie. I think it’s soooo cool. But I never would have thought…” He never thought people would actually see it – a small independent film he shot in 2018 – let alone absolutely love it, which has been the near-universal response. “It’s done better than almost anything I’ve done in, like, ages, and it’s the most random movie. Knowing there’s a hunger for stuff that’s very, very strange – that’s cool! That’s the stuff I like making!” The general consensus is Pattinson turned to independent films to escape the interminable celebrity glare. Twilight birthed him into mega-stardom, and mega-stardom turned out to be a state into which he’d have preferred never to have been born, thank you very much. Fans hoped he might bask in the limelight, take on a few major roles, emerge as the leading man he was destined to become. But Pattinson didn’t feel like playing along. He’d tasted the mainstream and decided on the cusp. So we made up that Robert Pattinson had actively chosen the quiet life. That he’d turned against Hollywood. That he couldn’t handle the heat. That he was trying to escape. At one point, during the vampire years, escape required actual physical strategies. For example, sometimes he’d walk into a restaurant with friends, ask that they swap clothes halfway through a meal, and make a getaway while photographers waited for the handsome actor to exit the venue in the same outfit in which he entered. (Take that, Paps!) But appearing in art house cinema was a different escape strategy altogether – an opportunity to continue working while simultaneously blending into the background. He starred in films very few people paid to see on the big screen, the world thought, because a part of him longed to disappear. He didn’t need the money any more; presumably Twilight had made him rich many times over. So why not? But “No!” Pattinson says. He shakes his head. No. No. No. No. No. This hasn’t been about escape. And he hasn’t been trying to defy our expectations. Not strategically, anyway. He just hasn’t been offered the roles. “Nothing ever came up for a big movie!” He did audition for Scorsese, and once for the Coen brothers, “but the whole world auditioned for those parts,” he says, and who was he to walk up to Scorsese and demand work? “I guess there was a part of me that was a little trepidatious about doing, like, a long-running series” – a “saga”. But really there was no conscious decision to avoid one, either. All he wanted was to work with the directors he admired, make the films he wanted to make. “There wasn’t, like, a long-term plan.” And all of this talk of him being terrified of fame… It was never too much. For a while, Pattinson was one of the best-known people on the planet – “R-Patz”, beautiful Edward, boyfriend and then not-boyfriend to Kristen Stewart – but that’s how it goes. He actually thought it was cool! “I think the stuff about fame is the most boring,” he says. “There’s nothing to say. Literally think about what you imagine fame to be for one second. It’s like that. People recognise your face. That’s it.” In the restaurant, nobody pays him much attention. Nobody looks over. Nobody points and giggles. Everything’s different now, he says, but it wouldn’t really bother him if it wasn’t. “When I was younger, when I was a little bit more insecure, I kept thinking people were disappointed when they met me.” And now? “Now I don’t give a shit.” For a long time, Pattinson has been drawn to complex, often oddball characters. The camp French prince. The New York conman on the run. The criminal astronaut with a baby. He plays men called the Dauphin (The King), or Connie Nikas (Good Time), or Ephraim Winslow (The Lighthouse). He rarely plays characters called Ben or Ryan or Joe. Edward is about as boring as it gets, and even then the character is a telepathic immortal. “I’m not entirely sure how to play, like, a normal person,” he says. “I don’t think I’m great at subtle.” He enjoys playing characters that are the opposite of his real self, which, he says, is totally normal and straightforward and low key. “I like characters who, when a situation is placed upon them, their decision-making process is incomprehensible.” He laughs. “I find it fascinating when people make bad decisions. The humour and the befuddlement.” It is the versions of Pattinson that are somehow befuddled that are the most fun to watch. The befuddlement comes from within. “I guess I see the world a lot of the time and don’t know what’s going on,” he says. “Like, I’m kind of disassociated. No, that sounds negative. More discombobulated.” He laughs again. It’s been like this forever. “I can’t remember what book it’s from, but this bit always really stuck with me, something I thought I could use as a good description of myself: there’s, like, a dog in an elevator, and every time the doors open there’s this whole new world, and it just can’t figure out what’s going on. That’s, like, every day for me.” Pattinson grew up in Barnes, south London. It was leafy and calm. “A very, very nice childhood,” he says. In his teens he went through a skateboarding phase, but he could never act the part. Then he went through a music phase. He never wanted to be an actor, but he very much wanted to be a musician. There was a time, before he was cast in Harry Potter and when he was still very young, when he played at an open mic night in London’s Soho every Monday, presumably hoping for a break. “In a lot of ways I haven’t developed past 15,” he says. “This is still my style of clothing” – he points to the skateboard T-shirt he’s wearing – “and this is still my music taste. Like, hip-hop between 1997 and 2002. And Van Morrison. And Jeff Buckley. All the people I found at 14.” He was a “space cadet” as a kid, he says. And still now. “But then I have periods of extreme ambition, of being very, very driven.” His great gift, he explains, is not acting, but being excellent at choosing the right people to work with – people who can make him better. “I think I’ve got good taste in movies,” he says. “I can see, from a very short meeting, whether a director is going to make something good.” Before working with the Safdie brothers on Good Time, he saw a single still image from one of their films, became convinced they should collaborate, and was overjoyed when they agreed. And when he took the call to say he’d got the job with High Life director Claire Denis, a director he’d long admired, he could “barely even stand up”. “I sat down on a kerb, near here.” He nods at the window. “And I was so high from it! There’s nothing better for actors than getting the jobs you want. Nothing better. Especially when they’re difficult to get.” He kind of slaps the table. “There’s nothing that feels better than achievement!” The Batman is achievement, he says. Pattinson said yes to the part because “I felt a connection to it, I don’t know why,” but also because, “I just really wanted it.” The role has a “power”, which is why “everyone is attracted to it. It’s an unidentifiable thing.” But he’s already sick of the questions. He just wants to get on with making the film. “I’m already remembering what it’s like to talk about a movie where there’s an expectation. Whenever you say anything, people are like, ‘Argh! You idiot!’ Like, dude, I haven’t even started yet!” I point out it’s a lot to live up to. “But there is no harsher critic of myself than myself, so I don’t need to worry about anyone else.” And what will he do if all of his worst case scenarios play out? If he never gets Batman’s vibe? He thinks for a minute, then tosses back the head and gives the big giggle. “Porn,” he says. “But art house porn.” The Lighthouse is in cinemas from 31 January Producer Stephanie Porto; set design Cooper Vasquez; stylist Rebecca Grice at Forward Artists; grooming Kristan Serafino at Tracey Mattingly; shot at Milk Studios"

          "bodyText": "We are going to leave the live blog there for the night. If you need updates on the fire situations: • The CFS site is for South Australia • The VicEmergency site is for Victoria • The RFS site is for New South Wales There are two fires at watch and act level in New South Wales: the Gosper Mountains fire and the Grose Valley fire. Authorities are keeping an eye on ember activity in Athelstone in South Australia from the Cudlee Creek fire. Although conditions have been less severe today, it is expected the fires will continue without significant rainfall. We will have updates in the morning, and in the meantime, please stay safe. My colleague Helen Davidson wrote this just two days ago about the effort to save Balmoral. It’s so utterly devastating that almost all of the town is gone now. AAP has some more horrific detail on the extent of the devastation in Balmoral. The town has around 150 houses and a population of 400. There is “not much left” but we don’t know exactly how many homes were destroyed yet. AAP: Matthew Deeth, who’s the mayor of the neighbouring Wollondilly Shire Council, says everyone knows everyone in the small village. “They were all banding together until they got hit yesterday and they were just decimated,” Deeth said on Sunday. “Most people were pulled out of their houses and if there was nobody defending houses they kind of just all lit up.” Residents in the nearby town of Bargo, north-east of Balmoral, were counting themselves lucky on Sunday. One house in Bargo’s Ashby Close was lost to the Green Wattle Creek blaze, with fire damaging a number of other properties in the street. Joe Cefai, 50, said the blaze just missed his home. Cefai, who evacuated with his two young children and a neighbour, lost a number of buildings next to his house. “It could have been far worse,” he said on Sunday. “I could have easily kissed my home goodbye. To return to see how close it did get, words can’t explain.” A total fire ban has been declared for tomorrow in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. An update on the situation in Victoria from AAP: Bushfires in Victoria’s East Gippsland have been downgraded as firefighters get a leg up on blazes thanks to milder weather conditions. A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale- Barmouth Spur is still not under control. “Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,” the VicEmergency website states. Fire crews have managed to get a handle on two blazes with warnings lowered to advice across Goroke, Lawloit, Little Desert, Peronne, Burnbank, Evansford and surrounding towns. One of the fires, the Lexton-Ben Major bushfire in the vicinity of Mt Lonarch, has been contained after burning through 2,711 hectares, and an advice warning in place. It comes as the temperature took a dip on Sunday with about 24C forecast in Tambo Crossing and a milder 22C in Melbourne after a top of 44C in the Victorian capital. The bushfires have been burning since 21 November but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. ABC is reporting SA premier Steven Marshall has said 72 homes have been destroyed in the Cudlee Creek fire. It is up from 15 yesterday. A total of 404 outbuildings and 227 vehicles were also destroyed in the fire. Here’s a bit more on what the Australian defence force has been doing to help out the firefighting effort in the past day. An aerial tanker has been provided to the NSW RFS from the RAAF base in Richmond. The HMAS Albatross has helped with water refuelling and retardant loading for the Currowan fires from the naval air station in Nowra. The army is also supplying personnel to prepare meals three times a day for 250 firefighters in the northern rivers region from November until mid-January. It is also assisting with transport and logistics for the RFS in Glen Innes, Kempsey, Casino, Wollondilly and in the Hawkesbury. Helicopters and accomodation are also being supplied You can read more about what defence is doing to help out here. I am going to leave you in the very, very capable hands of my colleague Josh Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. Conditions continue to be a lot better than yesterday, but that just means firefighters are having to try and use what time they have to get ahead of what is coming after that. Please pay attention to the alerts and make sure your plan is ready. Thank you for following along with me today – and as always, take care of you and those around you. Journalist Royce Kurmelovs has another update from the South Australian fires: James Tilbrook coughs from the smoke inhalation as he picks through the wreckage of his Adelaide Hills vineyard. “It’s not good,” James says of both the cough and the scene. The boutique Tilbrook Estate winery and vineyard is run by James and his wife Annabelle, who fled their property on Friday morning as the Cudlee Creek fires started to burn out of control. Coming back, James says he is shell-shocked. “We’ve lost everything,” he says. “Our house is on a separate property. My wife, son and our dog left at 10.30 for Mt Barker. At about 11am I had to choose between staying to defend the vineyard, or going to defend our home. I had to make that choice. The result is our house – our home – is still standing, but the vineyard’s gone. We’ve lost our livelihood.” “Once our house was safe, I went to help a friend with his home. I figured the vineyard was toast, there was nothing I could do there, so I might as well go help friends.” As the fire swept through, James says “cooked” the decades-old vine plantings and melted the winery on the property. A neighbouring cherry orchard was also destroyed in the blaze. “We were only a small producer, we make 1000 cases a year but all our stock was in the winery,” James said. “All the barrels of our last vintage. All our wine in tanks. All the wine in the tank is still there, but it’s probably cooked too. “I got a photo of some bottles that were sitting on top of a filing cabinet and the bottles have melted or collapsed. Someone said to me that the melting point of glass is 1400 to 1600 degrees. It would have been fucking hot in there. Excuse my language.” James says the biggest problem going forward is going to be income. The couple planted their first vines on the property in 1999 and it will take years for them to recover or regrow. In the meantime, they have a multi-million dollar mortgage to pay. “Someone told me there’s a chance the vines may recover and come back,” James says. “I’m usually a positive person, but I just don’t know. I don’t believe it.” Some friends have already set up a fundraiser for the family. Victorian fire update, courtesy of AAP: Bushfires in Victoria’s East Gippsland have been downgraded as firefighters get a leg up on blazes thanks to milder weather conditions. A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale – Barmouth Spur is still not under control. “Emergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,” the VicEmergency website states. Fire crews have managed to get a handle on two blazes with warnings lowered to advice across Goroke, Lawloit, Little Desert, Peronne, Burnbank, Evansford and surrounding towns. One of the fires, the Lexton-Ben Major bushfire in the vicinity of Mt Lonarch, has been contained after burning through 2711 hectares, and an advice warning in place. It comes as the temperature took a dip on Sunday with about 24C forecast in Tambo Crossing, and a milder 22C in Melbourne, after a top of 44C in the Victorian capital. The bushfires have been burning since November 21 but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. A relief centre has been set up at the Omeo memorial hall, 60 kilometres north, for people affected while generators have been set-up to restore power and services. Hundreds of firefighters on the ground and in the air have been working across the state to contain the fires, which are concentrated in steep and largely inaccessible terrain. People are advised to monitor the VicEmergency website. Anthony Albanese’s office has just released the transcript to the press conference, which includes this line at the end: In terms of this crisis, I have tried to visit the Rural Fire Service headquarters … Minister Littleproud, can I say this, has been exemplary at providing information and briefings to the opposition, but I have made a request now for days to visit the rural fire service. And that request has not been met up to this point. That would be the headquarters Scott Morrison held his “I have returned” press conference from this morning. From my time covering state politics in Queensland, those decisions are usually up to the state government. You can hear the terror and the frustration in this video. These fires – they are different. It’s not just authorities saying it. It’s those on the ground, the “quiet Australians” who have lived through previous seasons, but not like this. Which is why politicians saying they’ve seen smoke haze in Sydney before, or that we’ve always had fires, or quoting Dorothea Mackellar is not good enough, on any measure. NSW police say a man is missing in Lithgow, following a fire. From AAP: NSW police say a man is missing from the rural village of Bell after a huge bushfire tore through the Lithgow area, destroying dozens of buildings. The man in his 60 or 70s lives on a remote property in Bell and the area was engulfed in fire on Saturday, NSW police chief inspector Chris Sammut said on Sunday. Another elderly man who had been missing from neighbouring Dargan has been located “safe and sound”, the Rural Fire Service tweeted on Sunday morning. He was found at an evacuation centre in Lithgow which was threatened by the huge Gospers Mountain megafire over the weekend. Sammut said the man who was still unaccounted for lived on one of the remotest properties in Bell. “He may have self-evacuated or went to stay with friends and we want the public to let us know any information they have to assist us locate this missing person,” he said. Sammut confirmed up to five properties were burned in Lithgow on Saturday while about 30 buildings were lost in Clarence and Dargan. Those numbers include sheds and other structures. About 350 residential homes in Lithgow remained without power on Sunday afternoon. For those who missed the prime minister’s press conference, here is the beginning, including where he apologises for causing anxiety: But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they’re going through this terrible time. And I say to those Australians who I caused upset to, and I apologise for that. It is important I think when you [are] confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. Bits and pieces are slowly coming out of Balmoral. Anthony Albanese says he won’t be leaving Australia this summer, and thanked David Littleproud for being “exemplary” in providing the opposition with briefings. In the briefing that the opposition’s had this morning, there are cooler conditions expected as we’re experiencing today, over the next few days, but north-western Australia is a real issue. And of course, when you have heat, that’s where the heat begins. And it’s there now and is expected to come across the country to the east coast to the more heavily populated areas over the next week. Around north Queensland, around Townsville, Mount Isa and in that area, is also being looked at very carefully at the moment. And people should bear in mind the warnings that are there if they are thinking of going on driving holidays, for example, down the south coast, they need to listen to the expert advice which is there and not take any risks. The first priority is keeping people safe. And I thank minister Littleproud for the ongoing briefings that he’s provided, and the personal discussions I’ve had with him as well. Back to Scott Morrison’s decision to leave Australia, Anthony Albanese says: I wouldn’t have made the decision that he made to go – that is a matter for him and his family circumstances and it is difficult – I haven’t sought during this week to, to pass judgment on that, it’s a matter for his judgment. He chose to leave. He chose also to do it in a way that I think created a major issue of secrecy. This government has a real problem with being accountable with any scrutiny whatsoever, and the circumstances whereby Michael McCormack wouldn’t say whether he was acting prime minister or not, whereby people didn’t know when Scott Morrison was coming back – and even after he said he was coming back, he didn’t come back and wouldn’t tell the media or public when he would be returning. I just think this government has a problem with scrutiny and openness and it’s on display all the time, over so many issues. I’ve raised this for a considerable period of time – it is part of Mr Morrison’s character that when asked a question, that’s just a straight question, he dismisses it, or he prevaricates, he speaks about the bubble, or he says it’s just gossip and he won’t provide answers to simple question whether it’s in parliament or from the media. And I say to the media that they need to hold him to account, and we’ll do our job of holding him to account in the parliament, with a whole range of issues in which he just won’t provide a straight answer. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison’s assertion his government won’t be changing its emissions reduction policy: Well, I just find it staggering that in the current circumstances, whereby he’s sent Angus Taylor, a discredited minister, who has been misleading parliament since his first speech, to represent our nation at Madrid to try and undermine international action on climate change, including arguing for accountancy tricks rather than lower emissions. Australians do want action on climate change. The deputy prime minister yesterday said new measures were needed and a new response – and today, going from the acting prime minister to the real prime minister, we have a dismissal of the need for any action on climate change. The government needs to listen to the International Energy Agency head, who has said it is time for Australia to get our act together. And quite clearly, when it comes to climate change, the prime minister’s attitude is there’s nothing to see here. It’s business as usual. Well if he thinks there is nothing to see her, it’s because he can’t see through the smoke that’s coming from those bushfires. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison’s return from Hawaii. (Earlier in the week, Albanese said he would not be criticising the PM for taking leave.) Now I note that today, Scott Morrison has returned from his holiday in Hawaii. It’s a good thing that he is back. But we saw today no change in strategy with regard to the bushfires, a Coag meeting to be held next March. I wrote to the prime minister in November, asking him to convene Coag in November, prior to the emergency levels of the current crisis. And that was dismissed. We see no change to climate change policy. And we’ve seen no commitment to provide compensation to our volunteer firefighters who are giving up working and the wages that comes with that in order to help their communities, but they’ve still got to pay the rent, they’re still going to pay their mortgages, they’re still going to buy food for their families, and they are really struggling, they’re fatigued. And there’s a need for the government to look at making sure that they’re properly compensated. So they don’t have to choose between whether they continue to help out, or whether they have money to put food on the table for their families. Australian Associated Press has an update on the South Australian situation: Smoke from the Adelaide Hills bushfire had dropped the city’s air quality rating to poor. The Environment Protection Authority says air quality readings are improving but parts of the hills and metropolitan area remain affected by bushfire smoke. The situation on Sunday was further exacerbated by an early morning temperature inversion layer which kept smoke low to the ground. The EPA said anyone with health issues or concerns should stay inside with windows and doors closed. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze, with the Country Fire Service reporting some renewed fire activity within the 127km perimeter. The fire has burnt through more than 25,000 hectares and destroyed at least 15 homes. Before it was sparked on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology also reported that smoke from the NSW bushfires had made its way to Adelaide. Anthony Albanese has just held his press conference in Rozelle. Unfortunately it hasn’t been broadcast as yet, and I am in Canberra, so I will bring that to you as soon as I can. We are still waiting on Anthony Albanese’s press conference. It should be soon. The smoke has officially made its way north. Which brings Scott Morrison back in to the frame: I think all Australians, I think, are very proud – I know the commissioner is very proud and the premier is very proud of the services that the lead. But all Australians are extremely proud of what is being done here, and in so many places around the country. ... All Australians are proud and have a great, great reason to be proud. This is this is Australia at its best, Australia at its best, and we thank them for it. The commissioner finishes with how proud he is of the fire services: We’ve seen only tragically this week, the risk is real. And the consequences can be fatal. And and as a result of the events only this week, there are there are families, there are loved ones, there are wives and there are children and there are mates, who will never be the same again because of the horrendous that unfolded this week. I could not be any more proud, not just of the extraordinary volunteers that that I have the privilege of being the commissioner for, but the entire coordinated fire response over here in NSW, partnering with the commonwealth, ... It’s a massive, huge logistical operation maintaining and sustaining more than 2,000 people per shift, day and night – the people behind the scenes of people on the front line, I could not be any more proud of the extraordinary efforts and commitment and dedication that we see following rolling out day in day out, and we know that they’re going to be doing it as long as their community and the people of NSW are going to be threatened and, and all we pray for is rain. And unfortunately, we need a lot of rain to start getting some reprieve. Shane Fitzsimmons on Balmoral: Unfortunately I don’t have the specific numbers – there are teams in the field today. But as the premier indicated the team inside there say that it was devastating, and I think I coined the phrase “there’s not a lot left or there’s not much left”, and that’s just really confronting to contemplate and, and whether it’s Balmoral or Buxton ... we are talking dozens of properties, dozens of buildings. As a matter of fact, right across all the far grounds of the last 24 hours, we could be talking about another hundred buildings that being added to the state tally so far this season. That doesn’t mean there’s 100 homes and we need to make sure we differentiate between buildings, property and homes. The detailed analysis going on in the field now will seek to differentiate between what is a home, what is a house, what is a shed, and you know, and that takes some time, we need to access these areas. But the toll is significant. ... There’s a long way to go before we really have an understanding of the magnitude and scale of the the loss and damage here as a result of these fires. Commissioner Fitzsimmons on what is coming up: We’ve got to keep in mind that we’re not expecting any rainfall to make any meaningful difference to these fires until January /February. That’s still a way to go. We’re still talking four to six weeks at best before we start to see a meaningful reprieve in the weather, based on the forecast are available. And then, as the prime minister indicated, we will want to do some very critical post-incident reviews, post-season reviews, gather the information gathered the support from firefighters and communities right across NSW. That will take some time. And the last thing we want is ad hocery or, or unnecessary reactiveness so close to the end of this season, and particularly when other states and territories are still going to have challenges heading well and truly into March. So they will need to be a very concerted effort to consolidate the learnings to ensure that we’re hearing far and wide and formulate that into lessons and proposals in due course but it is certainly something [we] will be very much focused on. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons on that same issue: Fatigue management, and the drain, the relentless nature of this season is certainly taking a toll and so to is a geographic spread of the activity – you might recall for several months between July and and into September, most of the effort was really concentrated in north-east NSW, we’ve now got fires spreading from north-east NSW and Queensland border down to the south coast of NSW. Those logistical challenges, those transport and, and accommodation challenges spreading and moving people right across such a broad geographic area all add to the challenges of fatigue and crew rotation. Underpinning all of this is a combination of members that are in a very strong position, a very ready position to sustain ongoing efforts and support for three days, five days at a time, coming back for rest and doing another three to five days coming back from a rest. Not everybody can do that. There are also teams that need to maintain a local presence and our local level of fire covering case we get new fires. And then on days like yesterday, where we saw such a broad area affected by catastrophic forecast and unfolding in the day, devastating fires, we saw a whole, a whole bunch of people in the order of 1,000 people stand up and make themselves available to bolster that effort. We’ve got another 30 people that the prime minister met this morning in at the state headquarters that have just arrived from Canada and the United States. We’ve got commitments to see beyond that, from our interstate colleagues, and our overseas colleagues to help us with the fatigue management and the crew rotations and where appropriate, the bolstering of numbers on those difficult days. It is a tough challenge. It is a difficult challenge, and something that we work very closely on, and we will continue to work very closely on as we see through the balance of this season. Scott Morrison on the fatigue volunteers are facing: It’s obviously one of the many significant issues that the commissioner manages with this incredible volunteer fighting force that is out there. But I gotta tell you, one of the things that commissioner told me this morning just, again, just impressed me so much is when a call went out yesterday for extra hands. An extra thousand firefighters showed up in response to that call. A thousand. That is just incredible. People know what’s at stake and they’re all making their contribution. Scott Morrison on the scheduled March Coag: Well, the immediate needs as I said this morning, simply require the requests to come forward as they do through the regular meetings that are held of the fire chiefs and commissioners. The ministers responsible ... they only met a few weeks ago. And what we need to do in March is to ensure that we deal with the recommendations that come out from many of the lessons that have come through these fires not just here in NSW, but in other states and territories as well that have been affected. And we look forward to receiving those proposals then, right now they are fighting fires, and we don’t want them sitting around writing submissions. We want them [to] obviously be focused on the operational tasks they have in front of them. Coag has been very busy over the back end of this year, particularly dealing with a lot of the environmental issues that we’ve been working on and waste management which I thank the premier for her support on and will be considering those proposals. A lot of the ministers have been meeting through their various councils in recent weeks and months. And that means there will be a really good body of work that comes forward to character in March which will be in NSW and it’ll be in Rooty Hill. And I’m looking forward to bring out their their wonderful new facility out there in Rooty Hill. From Australian Associated Press: More than 3,000 properties in the Adelaide Hills remain without power as a result of the devastating bushfire that swept through the region and continues to burn. SA Power Networks says crews are working in a number of areas to restore electricity supply. But it says the timeframe to have all power restored is unclear, and in some cases it could take several days depending on access and the extent of the damage. The company said it had already identified a number of spots where trees had fallen on powerlines. “Anyone in fire-damaged areas is urged to keep clear of power poles and wires as there may still be some that haven’t been inspected,” it said. Among those without electricity are properties in Woodside, Lenswood, Mt Torrens, Charleston and Lobethal. The Adelaide Hills fire has so far burnt out more than 25,000 hectares inside a 127km perimeter. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze which has destroyed at least 15 homes. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says fire authorities don’t expect any real relief in terms of conditions until well into January. Gladys Berejiklian: Question: There’s been concern in Balmoral specifically about when people will be able to get back in and see whether or not their home is still standing? Berejiklian: Look, it’s devastating not knowing whether your property is standing or not. Unfortunately, we have received bad news. There isn’t much left [in Balmoral]. I might ask the commissioner to add to my comments. I understand expert teams are going in on the ground in a lot of those communities today, to make full assessments and to let people know when it is safe to go back. Even if people have lost their properties, they still want to go back to see what’s left and if there is anything they can salvage. We know that’s part of the recovery. We want people to have access to their land, to their property, as soon as they can, but it has to be safe. Scott Morrison: As the premier has just said, the category C assistance is being extended to the Wollondilly shire. That, as the premier said, includes payments for small producers and businesses of up to $15,000 and includes things like mental health support and small grants to communities in both shires to help them rebuild particularly with community resilience programs and things of that nature coming out of that fund. That support is going to over – around 40 local government areas around NSW at the moment. It’s the same sort of support that’s been provided in many other parts, say, of Queensland where they have had the fires as well in recent times. These programs are designed to help people with their immediate needs. The premier and I have agreed also this morning that those $1,000 disaster assistance recovery payments that are paid to – for each individual and the $400 that are paid for each and – each child, in a family, that will be extended to the shire as well. It is already in place for Wollondilly. Those arrangements will be put in place today. These things are done as a partnership. This is the best coordinated, the best resourced, the biggest-hearted response that I think we’ve seen once again here from our response to these terrible disasters. It is something, I think, Australians – as I said earlier today – can be be enormously proud of, seeing their country at their best. That is what we have to keep focused on – allowing Australians to continue to be at their best, supporting them as they get tired and ensure that we can continue to roll out what has been an extraordinary performance from all of those who have been involved. Scott Morrison is called to the front – he starts with a repeated call for “kindness”: It is great to be here with you of course, your colleagues, and Angus Taylor, the local member, and Commissioner Fitzsimmons. Thank you, again, for the tremendous job you’re doing with all of your team – all around New South Wales. As the premier said, it is humbling as you come and speak to families and individuals, you speak to volunteers, and you see the best of Australia on every single occasion. That’s what we’re seeing here again today. Friendships, neighbours looking after each other, simple kindnesses that are being extended. I met one wonderful, wonderful lady today from Malta. She was there with another lady, a single lady, who was finding it tough. She was looking after her. She was making sure that she gets back to her property today. She’s holding her hand. That’s what she’s doing. And this is the – these are the – this is the grace, this is the kindness, that events like this need and that’s what’s being displayed here on the ground. That will continue. Not just through the ordinary everyday things that are done by members of the community off their own bat, but also by the many volunteers. We rightfully praise those in the RFS, but equally today we met with members of St John’s Ambulance, the State Emergency Service – those who are looking after the care and welfare of animals, and others – there are so many people who stick up their hands in these times. We thank them very, very much for everything they are doing. Berejiklian finishes with this: The devastation is shocking. I have also been just literally bowled by the way the community’s come together, the resilience and people’s generosity. People with not much are giving away everything they have to support others. And it’s times like these when you really appreciate what New South Wales and what Australia’s about. Gladys Berejiklian: So, as you know, we announced joint funding and now that joint funding is in excess of $63m across the state and extends to a dozen councils. These two are now part of that. ... I also want to stress – I have mentioned this to the mayor who is here today – that $63m is on top of the $25m the New South Wales government’s already set aside to get rid of hazardous materials and just to start the clean up. For some families, some families will be given notification they can go back to their properties, perhaps today, tomorrow. Other families have to wait. We want to make sure – no matter what people’s circumstances – just the hope of being able to move forward is so important. If we pick up the tab – sometimes it costs thousands of dollars – to get the hazardous materials off the property, whether you are insured or not insured, the state government is picking up that cost to get on with rebuilding as soon as you’re physically and emotionally ready to start the rebuilding process. As I’ve said, we’re not just here today and tomorrow but we will be with you for the weeks and months and for some communities years. Gladys Berejiklian is addressing the media – she is formally announcing the additional areas who can now access the disaster relief funding. Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian have arrived at one of the Green Wattle creek fire evacuation centres – the Picton Bowling Club. About a dozen people had stayed there last night. If you haven’t seen it, Lenore Taylor has written on what she took out of Scott Morrison’s press conference. A taste: This isn’t about an adjustment to your language, it requires an adjustment to your policy, it requires a credible policy, the kind of policy we know could benefit us economically, that business is begging you to enact so that they can invest. And we know that would mean we could fight for effective international action rather than continue to act as a hindrance. We know we can’t solve the heating that is exacerbating this crisis on our own, so please don’t insult our intelligence again with that “1.3% of global emissions” argument like you did at the start of this fire season. Given the consequences we are suffering, we should be doing everything we can, and we know that we are not. You’ve just kept pretending. You’ll find the whole thing here: Two more areas have been given access to disaster recovery funding. From the release: The commonwealth and NSW governments are providing another $3.5m to extend the community recovery assistance program under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) to the Wingecarribee and Wollondilly LGAs. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said this additional funding brings the total federal-state recovery fund to more than $63m. “Having witnessed first-hand the devastation these bushfires have inflicted on locals and their communities it is vital the government act right away to provide assistance as quickly as possible,” Berejiklian said. “We have already made available support for people who are suffering personal hardship; help for people whose homes have been damaged; funding for firefighting operations and to restore damaged essential public assets; and financial support for small businesses, primary producers and non-profit organisations. “Importantly, we are also supporting these communities to become more resilient to disasters by extending the NSW Bushfires Economic Recovery and Community Resilience Grants Program.” Victoria Mackinlay has published this photo of dead ladybugs washing up on Bondi beach, surrounded by ash The ACCC has responded to the National Electricity Market price report – and it is not as rosy as Angus Taylor made out. From the ACCC public media release: The average annual bill for households in the National Electricity Market fell in 2018–19 compared with the previous year, by $65 or 4%, the latest ACCC electricity markets report has found. But while average household bills fell to $1509 in 2018–19, households were still paying about 20% ($254) more than in 2007–08, and the average price for a unit of electricity drawn from the grid was about 45% higher in real terms. “There is still work to be done to make electricity more affordable for households,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. “We continue to seek action on our previous recommendations, which we believe will help drive bills down.” Further action on environmental scheme costs needed Environmental costs have been the biggest driving factor behind the increase in average household bills over the longer term, due to federal and state government policies aimed at encouraging greater uptake of renewable generation, promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Customers with solar panels made up about 16% of all residential customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2018-19, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2007-08. Many of these policies, such as premium Feed-in Tariff (FiT) rebates, result in additional costs for retailers that ultimately flow through to customers’ electricity bills, unless funded through other means. The costs of such schemes accounted for $103 or 41% of the long-term increase in household bills between 2007–08 and 2018–19. ...For example, the average household pays about $550 a year (or 9.4 cents per kWh) more than a household with solar panels, a situation the ACCC believes raises significant questions about fairness. “The cost of installing solar panels has reduced significantly in recent years, so environmental schemes like the premium FiT rebates are no longer needed to make solar an attractive option for those households that can afford it,” Sims said. “Indeed, all customers who can, should consider how much they could save by installing solar panels. “We are primarily concerned about the additional costs such schemes have imposed on households that cannot access or afford to install solar panels,” Sims said. “Funding environmental schemes through government budgets rather than through increased electricity charges should also be considered as a more equitable option.” A very welcome piece of good news from the NSW RFS – a missing man has been found, safe. Scott Morrison is still making his way to an evacuation centre in Picton Royce Kurmelovs has provided an update on the South Australian fires for us: Adelaide has woken up to the smell of smoke as a haze lingers over the city from fires burning in the Adelaide Hills and on Kangaroo Island in the south, but the South Australian CFS says it is hopeful they will have a handle on the situation in the coming days. While the CFS is not confident enough to issue a statement on containment, cool conditions overnight have allowed fire crews to get on the front foot, with back-burning operations currently being performed in an effort to contain the Cudlee Creek fires in the northwest. So far the blaze in that area has consumed over 25,000 hectares, destroyed homes and properties, injured lifestock and native wildlife. Two people have been confirmed dead within South Australia during the bushfires, and 26 CFS volunteers injured battling the blaze. Road blocks remain in effect areas as fire crews are working to manage hotspots along the perimeter and are wary of flare ups in the coming week. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast temperatures in the 30’s in South Australia, with the mercury to climb as the days wind out. Elsewhere, the “complex” series of fires on Kangaroo Island has been downgraded and is being treated as two separate fire fronts with 50 firefighters currently on the scene. A spokesperson for the CFS said mop-up operations are expected to continue. “We’ll have fire crews on the firegrounds for quite some time. Even if we do get it contained, there’ll be fire crews out there checking the ground doing mop up for a few days yet.” I’ve just been alerted to Scott Morrison addressing the US and Canadian fire fighters at the Sydney RFS headquarters, which was shown on Sunrise (which is why I missed it the first time). He cracked a joke about Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Let’s hope he is talking about Trudeau’s love of a selfie, given the circumstances.: We value the same things, we share the same values, that we will be will all be doing, over this period time – I will be making sure to pass on my personal thanks to prime minister Trudeau and president Trump later today. I’ll get a pic and send it to them – I know Justin like his pictures. (There is laughter.) I’m not teasing him, I promise. We’ve often done that together, when we’ve been together. The Grose Valley fire has been raised to “emergency”. The smoke haze has hit Brisbane. As of 10:30am AEDT, here’s what we know the fire situation is across Australia at the moment. In New South Wales there are five fires at watch and act level: Gospers Mountain fire, Green Wattle Creek, Grose Valley, Kerry Ridge, and Upper Turon Rd, Palmers Oaky. In Victoria there are three fires at watch and act level: Tambo Crossing and Wattle Creek, Ensay and Reedy Flat and Brookville. In South Australia there are still two fires burning at Duncan and Menzies on Kangaroo Island, and a watch and act in place for a fire in Cudlee Creek. The weather conditions are a bit milder than yesterday, and there’s no emergency warnings currently in place, but we will update if that changes over the course of the day. Just before Scott Morrison’s press conference, RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons* gave an update on the NSW fires: We have still got an enormous amount of fire burning in the landscape. Conditions are particularly dry and fire behaviour continues to be very challenging for firefighters and those areas affected by fire. A big focus this week, a significant focus this week, and starting today is the implications now for the entire Blue Mountains community along the Great Western Highway. We effectively got fire now stretching from the Darling Causeway, Lithgow area, in the western areas of the or the upper Blue Mountains, and only four, 4, 5km north of the Great Western Highway spreading all the way down to Currajong Heights, that’s due north Winmalee, Springwood, which is not far the Penrith escarpment and region. We have seen widespread damage and destruction being reported across a number of those fire grounds and we have got impact assessment teams already deployed into the field this morning trying to gain access to those impacted fire grounds to do assessments and undertake surveys in order to identify the extent of damage and the extent of destruction. As we indicated last night, the reports are still indicating that we are expecting another heavy toll, unfortunately, with estimates that property loss could be in the dozens of – of buildings including homes, outbuildings, sheds and businesses. That damage and destruction effectively ranges from places like Lithgow, Clarence, Dargan, Bilpin, all along the Bells Line of Road, we got places down around Balmoral and out towards Buxton and Bargo down on the Green Wattle Creek fire. We have also got down the Currowan fire south, up in the north-west corner of that, the communities of Neriga. There’s a very wide area of impact overnight and those assessments will be undertaken. *apologies for the typo in the original post Anthony Albanese will be up at 1pm. I imagine he wants Scott Morrison’s press conference to sit and marinate for a while, before he adds his two cents, given you know, the prime minister wants us all to be kinder to each other, and leave any division to the side - unless of course, you need to make your own political point. For example: Scott Morrison at the beginning of the press conference: It is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. Scott Morrison half way through the press conference: I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tons less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place if we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don’t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. This ‘debate’ if you can call it that, given Chris Smith seems to have decided his job, now that he is returning to Sydney radio 2GB is just to yell over anyone who has a different view, or you know, the facts, sums up most of the country right now: Angus Taylor has also decided right now is the perfect time to put out a release on electricity prices coming down: Residential electricity bills are coming down according to the latest Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Inquiry into the National Electricity Market report. The November 2019 report found: a reduction in the average residential electricity retail price across the National Electricity Market (NEM) from FY2017-18 to 2018-19 of approximately 3 per cent, average annual residential electricity bills across the NEM have decreased by $65, or approximately 4 per cent, the most recent annual reduction in household bills of $65 is part of a longer-term trend that has seen bills fall by $209 in real terms since 2013-14, and average household bills across the NEM are at their lowest since 2013-14. (Which we knew they would, because a butt load of renewables have come onto the grid, which was anticipated for quite some time) So to quickly recap that press conference: Scott Morrison defended leaving the country to take a holiday (which he said he planned six weeks ago), having “made a promise to my kids” but said in hindsight, he would have made a different decision. (Morrison was due to return to work, as scheduled, tomorrow, December 23, according to what his office told the New Daily’s Samantha Maiden last week). I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it, but as prime minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. He has “learnt lessons” including about how his office dealt with the media: I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. After pointing back to the one comment he made in February linking climate change to worsening disasters “among other factors” for the majority of this (early) bushfire season, Morrison made an explicit point of joining the dots There is no argument, in my view, or the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world – but I’m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. But there will be NO change to Australia’s emissions reduction policy under his government. People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Morrison also believes the time to talk about his holiday is in the past, and the time to talk about climate change is not now. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. ... Australians know we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let’s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of protecting people’s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. On whether he believes he has shown leadership, Scott Morrison says: This has been going on for a long time, since September, and on each occasion I have been here, whether it is in Taree or out at Wilberforce a couple of weeks ago. Not on all occasions have I gone and been there with a travelling media team. I have been there on occasions just in a low-key way, talking to those in incident control rooms, and it would seem that whether it is myself or others there will always be criticism made but what I have confidence in and have always had confidence in is in the fair mindedness of the Australian people. As I said for I take responsibility for my own decisions and I take responsibility for those I made in relation to my family and, more broadly, in terms of my leadership responsibility for the nation and that is why I am here. On Labor’s proposal for tax breaks for volunteer firefighters who are unable to work while they deal with the bushfire emergency: Q: Labor wants compensation for volunteer firefighters. Is that something you are considering? Scott Morrison: I don’t know what the specific proposal being proposed … I will take that where it is. But these are things that the government has been considering, in the first instance these are matters for state governments. The RFS and the fire services around Australia are run by state governments so it is not for the commonwealth to step in and make decisions. But these are things that I think can be contemplated. But I very much want to do that in consultation with state and territory governments. As I said to the commissioner today, whatever they need, whatever they think they need to bolster support, sustain the operations that they are running, they simply need to ask. And they will get that support. I think there are immediate issues that need to be addressed there with the rural firefighters, particularly as they get into areas of terrible fatigue now. ... They have been fighting fires for a while now and they are still going. Thankfully, as I was briefed this morning, those parts of the state are more under today than they were when I was there not that long ago. But these are the many issues that I think we need to understand. Let’s not forget, there are 210,000 rural firefighters around the country, and there are thousands of surf-lifesavers who will be patrolling our beaches, those who are volunteering on meals on wheels and carers and others. Australia is a magnificent country because it does have that volunteer spirit. And Australia relies on them and they should be celebrated and we do so. And where there are ways that we can further support that volunteer effort, we are very open to considering this. Let me say one thing, all our firefighters are professionals. They are all professional at what they do. They are well-trained and they are very good at what they do. One of the things we focused on this morning was ensuring how we can better supplement the clearing work and the other things that need to be done in those areas that have been ravaged by fires and ensure that we can get even more prompt defence support into those arrangements. There has been defence liaisons in these … there has been in Queensland other places, and I am sure we can get some … at local level as well through the state government. The defence forces being deployed in those, defence force members who are firefighters, are out there fighting fires, just like any other employee would be. They are not in their platoons, they are in their brigades. Scott Morrison on why the government is not considering changing its climate change policy: The Kyoto targets set by the previous Labor government, when we came to government, there was the projection that we would miss those by some 700 million tonnes. Now we’re going to beat them … And I would hope that not only will we meet, and I’m sure we will, our Paris commitments, that we will beat them as well. And there is a long time between now and 2030 and we will continue to refine our policies because we’re about taking action. But what we will not do is act in a knee-jerk or crisis or panicked mode. A panic approach and response to anything does not help. It puts people at risk. Not just their livelihood but if you walk out there into the control room you will not see people panicking, you will see people be very professional, very focused on the job they have, talking to each other in a very professional way and getting the job done. Government is the same thing. Whether it is taking action on climate change or ensuring that, as the midyear economic statement shows, that the government is on track to achieve a surplus or the further job creation that is all over the last week. Over 100,000 jobs created since last election. You get these results by being calm and by being stable. And having clear goals and having the policies in place to achieve them. Whether that is on taking action on climate change or job creation or ensuring that we get the welfare system targeted to support those who need it most or dealing with the environmental challenges of waste management and plastics and any of these issues, mental health issues, the government is addressing them. On all these issues the government has clear plans and a clear approach to deal with them and is doing it in a very patient and in a very applied and professional way. We get back to climate policy – there will be NO change. Q: The government has been criticised for using carryover credits. Going forward after these fires, how can your government provide a more genuine commitment to making Australia a responsible global actor when it comes to reducing carbon emissions? Scott Morrison: People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tonnes less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don’t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. We are taking action and we will continue to take action. We are part of a global action on the commitments we have made, we are meeting. We are meeting and we are beating. So I do not accept the suggestion that Australia is not carrying its weight. We are carrying our weight. We are meeting and beating our target and there are very few countries who can say that. Q: You said you have learned some lessons from this past week. What are they? Morrison: I think I have already outlined that in my earlier remarks. Question: You were critical of the Victorian police commissioner when she went to dinner during the Black Saturday bushfires. Scott Morrison: I have already made a number of comments today, as you know, where I think I have held myself to that same standard. Equally I would note that I am not the operational leader of an emergency service or police force. I am the prime minister. And as prime minister I was kept regularly and sought to be kept regularly updated on the events. The acting prime minister was in full control of what was it occurring ably supported by Minister Littleproud. The premier was leading, obviously the governments of the operational response here in New South Wales, and I have been in contact with the premier [regularly] on these arrangements …were in place to ensure that I could continue to do and fulfil my responsibilities, but I understand and the reason I have returned is out of a deep respect and sympathy for those Australians who were tragically killed a few nights ago. That demanded my attendance here, I believe, out of simply respect and sympathy for them and what they were going through and that is why I have been pleased to return. That is a decision that Jenny [and I made] and we told the kids about it and Australians are fair-minded. They know at the end of a difficult year people go on leave and they know that when a dad makes a promise to the kids they like to keep it. And events late last week are not where they were today so I think it would be unfair to say the events in very recent days were the same as a week or so ago. Nevertheless, I understand the anxiety and my people have been upset at this and that is why I am pleased to be back. This is not exactly a glowing defence of the deputy prime minister. Q: Why were questions referred to your office; why couldn’t McCormack simply say he was acting? Morrison: These are not the matters I am focused on now, I will leave those matters for others. Australians are worried about the fires and the support necessary to support those out there today. I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. Question: But you knew about these catastrophic fire conditions. Are you sorry to the residents? Morrison: I already said that. I already said it. Q: Do you believe that the release of the information about this was handled poorly and the public needed to know? Morrison: The deputy minister was the acting prime minister and each time I have taken private family leave as prime minister I followed exactly the same process. There was no change. On my earlier leaves no statement was issued. I took private family leave and no objections were raised by the press on those occasions but it is something we will rectify. (No one knew he was leaving the country). Question: Where have you been and why the secrecy? Scott Morrison: I was in Hawaii, a trip with my family, a trip planned seven weeks ago and when I take family leave, it is a private family time. And then the prime minister asks us to all be kind to each other: Let me finish by saying this, and I apologise for the lengthy nature of my remarks this morning, it is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. If people have something they want to contribute, that is fantastic and I want to thank all those who turned up to fire stations and made donations and you may want to think of dropping off some toys for the children of the firefighters who may not have had time to go out and buy some this Christmas because they have been too busy. These are things that people can do constructively. Australians, we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let’s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of detecting people’s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. Australia is the most amazing country on earth. How do I know that? Because I see what is happening out there right now on those fire front and in the communities that have suffered terrible loss. That is why Australia is the best country in the world and that is the country I am proud to lead. know we all support in the cause which we all rally now and focus on supporting efforts of Australians. Scott Morrison says he believes Australians are “fair minded” and will understand why he took his holiday. Two other points. I have returned from leave and I know that has caused some great anxiety in Australia and Jenny and I acknowledge that. If we had your time over again and the benefit of hindsight we would have made different decisions. I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it that as Prime Minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. And so to those Australians who had [cause for upset] and I apologise for that. I think it is important when you confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. And then we move on to power prices: We must take action on climate change and we are taking action on climate change. At the last election I said we would, I said we would meet and beat our Kyoto targets, I said we would meet our Paris commitments at a canter and we will. We welcome the record investment in renewable energy technologies and at the same time we welcome the fact we pursue our climate policies while getting electricity prices down as the ACCC noted today with a $65 reduction as a direct result of the policies in place to get power bills under control in this country. And we will do it without destroying the economy or jobs. We will do it with sensible target to get the balance right. That is what I promised Australians when we went to the last election and that is what I am committed to doing. We are not going to beat our Paris target “in a canter”. Emissions are still rising in Australia and have every year since 2014, when the carbon charge was scrapped by the Coalition. Scott Morrison on the climate change link debate: I appreciate that when things get as anxious as they have become, then people will think, you know, what’s been prepared? Is anything happens? Or have they thought of this? I understand that those anxieties are positively meant and are natural. But I want to reassure you that this- our officials, our commissioners, our firefighters, both those professionals who are paid and those who are unpaid, they are doing this year-round to prepare for events just like this. And that is why this response is something where we’re seeing the best of Australia, not the contrary. Flowing on from that public anxiety, there is also been other issues that have been raised, not just about the response and the resources which I think I have addressed, but also around issues of climate policy. It is also been the case - our Government has always and I have always acknowledged the connection between these weather events and these broader fire events and the impacts globally of climate change. It’s one of many factors as I have said. The drought conditions have certainly been a big contributor in terms of the dryness of the fuel load. There are also many other issues as you would be well aware and they’ll all come under scrutiny as we prepare for what needs to happen next time - issues of management in national parks of fuel loads, issues of back-burning and managing native vegetation and building codes and all of these sorts of things, ensuring our communications programs are important. I mean, there are some fires that have been started by just carelessness. Others sadly have been the result of direct arson. Many have been created by dry lightning strikes. And understanding all of that it will be important as we move through to the next phase. There is no argument, in my view on the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world but I’m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. He moves on to the anxiety he says he sees the community dealing with: In talking to the Commissioner, I want to acknowledge what he has acknowledged - and that is as we face these fires at the moment, I want to assure Australians of this because I know people are anxious and I know people in some places are rightly fearful of what is literally at their door, and the haze and the smoke and all of these things heighten that anxiety as you think about your kids and your family and your can see the red tinge at night if you’re close enough, but our fire services in Australia are the best in the world. The response to these disasters, these fires, is the best in the world. This is a time when Australia should be very, very proud that we have the best-resourced, most-coordinated, best-equipped fire services of any nation on earth to deal with this. And that’s because as a country, we’re used to dealing with fires - admittedly and very rightly this season is much more lengthened and started a lot earlier and there isn’t the respite rains that we can expect any time soon and that is making this season harder than we have seen in a long time. But it is also true that after every fire, we sit down, we learn the lessons and we make sure we’re better prepared next time and that’s what’s happened on this occasion. The coordination is seamless between not only the states and the Commonwealth, but between the states and overseas jurisdictions as well. Our defence forces are deploying wherever they’re called upon and particularly now as you look at the burnt-out vast territories across particularly here in New South Wales, but in other states as well, there is wreckage to clear, there are trees to remove, there is access that needs to be provided to people’s properties and businesses and homes, and that’s the work that our defence forces can, are and will continue to play and they have been doing it since September - airlifting, ensuring they’re providing night flights for recognisance, and providing that heavy support that is backing in and complementing the amazing work of our firefighters. There’s some 70,000 firefighters here in New South Wales alone. That’s bigger than the entire of our defence forces and reserves. So we’re talking about an enormous force that has drawn together here in New South Wales and that’s about a third of the national force. So they will continue to get everything that they need and I have run through some matters this morning with the Commissioner and I have been speaking to the Premier as well - there will be a COAG meeting in March and at that meeting, as always, I have already put on the agenda the response capabilities for future disasters and lessons, of course, will be learned by these responses but I do know the response you’re seeing right now is informed by how this work has gone on each and everyday since the last fire. I mean, emergency management Australia which is the Commonwealth agency responsible for our engagement, both in drawing in the ADF and the other systems of support, including the important income support, later today I’ll be announcing with the Premier further disaster assistance payments into new areas of affected areas as three payments have been rolling out. Scott Morrison moves into addressing the issues which have exploded since he left on his holiday: There are over 100 fires active in New South Wales today and many of those are quite serious, but I do remind people that there are also severe fires in South Australia and in Victoria. I spoke to the South Australian Premier last night when I arrived back in Australia to get an update and there’s been loss of life there and there are fears for others. We have heard further news this morning of people missing, an individual missing out in Lithgow where the fires also have raged overnight. No-one wants to be out there fighting these fires, no-one wants these fires to be happening at this time. But when those fires do occur, as they have for a very long time in this country, then those who have - there’s over 200,000 of them in Australia - who have signed up and put their hand up to be there to defend their communities, then they go out and they do this work and they do it on behalf of all of us and they’re getting tired and they’re getting fatigued because this has been going for a very long time and this is one of the key issues I have been in discussion with the Commissioner about thismorning and also with the Premier and I know that Minister Littleproud, who joins me here and I thank him for that, David, and the work you have been doing, and the Deputy Prime Minister during my absence, we will continue to look at all of these issues as we go forward. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service and all the fire services across Australia will continue to get everything they need from the Commonwealth. As you know, the operational response to these disasters is delivered and is run at a state level, but with great Commonwealth support. Scott Morrison continues: A few months ago I was up in Canungra when the first of these dreadful fires started to appear. ...When we got out to Wilberforce just a few weeks ago up in Queensland and here we are again today following the terrible tragedy that occurred earlier this week. Andrew O’Dwyer and Geoffrey Keaton. Their families, Lisa and their little daughter Charlotte, 19 months. Jessica and their 19-month-old son, Harvey. When our volunteers go out there, they do it for so many reasons, but I can’t help but thinking that one of the most important things that inspires them is their love of family - family is community and they’re out there defending their community on that fateful night. And Jenny and I my heart broke when he heard of their terrible loss and their great sacrifice and I just want to extend to them our great sympathies, our love and support. They’re getting tremendous support from their Rural Fire Service family out there at Horsley Park and from the broader families of the firefighting communities around the country. What we, the rest of us, can offer them is our honour, our acknowledgment, and our respect for what they have done for all of us. Scott Morrison: ...Men and women who are out there today here in New South Wales who were out there yesterday, the thousands of men and women around Australia, not just here in New South Wales, up in Queensland, down in South Australia where it’s also been a difficult week, down in Victoria, all those that have come from other states - Tassie, the west, the ACT, up in the Territory. I want to thank those who have come from overseas - the Americans, the Canadians, our Kiwi cousins, those who have come to support us in this hour of need. I particularly want to thank Commissioner Fitzsimmons and the amazing team he leads here in New South Wales and for the opportunity to be briefed this morning. I want to commend the Premier, who I have been speaking to over the course of the last week, and for the tremendous job she’s been doing with her team here in New South Wales to respond to this disaster, this threat, that is ongoing and has been going for many, many months now. The prime minster is now addressing the media. If you can, you should watch this with the sound on. The firefighters all remain so calm, despite what they are facing. The “got this” at the end just sums up everything about how our volunteers are handling this. The prime minister will head to Picton after the Sydney RFS briefing, to meet with evacuees. Here is what the government has spent: Australia’s aerial firefighting force has been given an $11m funding injection from the Morrison government amid growing concern about the resourcing of firefighters combating the bushfire crisis. On Thursday the federal government announced it would nearly double the commonwealth’s annual contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which coordinated the 140 aircraft used to battle fires across Australia. “In response to the request from our national fire chiefs we’re backing our firefighters and our water-bombing fleet with an extra $11m boost,” the prime minister, Scott Morrison said in a statement. “That’s on top of the $15m we already deliver each year for aerial firefighting to tackle what has already been a devastating fire season.” There is a lot of commentary over how prepared Australia was for this bushfire season. The fire authorities said they did all the preparations they could - including hazard reduction burns, but the group of former fire chiefs who came to prominence at the beginning of this season (which started early) said they wanted to talk about how to prepare for this new normal. Paul Karp has found Labor’s bushfire policy from the election, given this debate. The bushfire season in Australia is lengthening and already overlapping with the northern hemisphere, increasing the risk that we won’t be able to access the aircraft we need at times of peril. At the same time, the Federal Government’s contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre has plummeted from 50 per cent of funding to just 23 per cent, reducing our overall firefighting capability. The Bureau of Meteorology has identified this summer as Australia’s hottest on record, which included devastating bushfires in Victoria and Tasmania. Now is the time to invest in giving our firefighters the resources they need to keep us all safe. Labor’s national firefighting package will deliver: $80 million to establish the National Aerial Bushfire Fighting Fleet of aircraft It will include retro-fitted Black Hawk helicopters as they are phased out from active use by the Australian Army and Erickson S-64 Air-crane helicopters (or ‘Elvis’ as they are commonly known) which has a 2,650 gallon tank capable of snorkelling or scooping fresh or salt water. It’s expected that the national fleet will include a standing capability of up to six Large or Very Large Air Tankers, and up to 12 heavy rotary wing helicopters. Australia’s first ‘smokejumper’ units Smokejumpers are firefighters trained to be rapidly deployed by helicopters at remote fires during the short window during which those fires can be contained. Smokejumpers usually rappel from helicopters and use chain-saws, hoes and other dry firefighting tools to establish a containment perimeter around the fire. They then patrol the perimeter to ensure the fire does not jump containment lines while working with water-bombing aircraft to ensure the contained fire is fully extinguished. $21 million for the National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) A Shorten Labor Government will stop the Federal Government’s reduction in funding for our firefighting capabilities by returning to a 50-50 funding split between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Scott Morrison’s return to Australia last night has brought him back on deck a day before he was scheduled back to work - the PMO told reporters, including Samantha Maiden, that Morrison would be back to work on Monday, late last week At least one person died in the Adelaide Hills fire which blazed last night, with another reported missing. More than 50 people have been injured - including 23 firefighters and two police officers. At least 15 homes have been destroyed, with about 30 other structures having also been consumed by the fire. But with residents only returning to take stock of the damage today, the number of structures destroyed is expected to rise. The government has announced the disaster recovery payment has been extended to South Australia. Claims will be open from Monday 23 December 2019. For more information or to make a claim visit www.humanservices.gov.au/disaster or call 180 22 66. Scott Morrison has not yet addressed the media - but here is what he had to say to the RFS at Sydney headquarters. Mike Bowers was at the Green Wattle Creek fire last night. Here is some of what he saw Good morning. It is another day of watch and wait as fire fighters across the east coast and south Australia keep a very, very close eye on what Emergency-level fires have swept across parts of New South Wales and South Australia, and the death toll and number of injured firefighters has risen, as the country’s severe heatwave and bushfire crisis continued on Saturday. Two people were confirmed dead in South Australia, and homes were destroyed and communities evacuated in what authorities described as “an awful day” in which fires raged across three states, even creating their own thunderstorms in some parts of NSW. At Lithgow, about two hours’ drive west of Sydney, residents were forced to flee as fires threatened the community of more than 10,000 people and destroyed several homes on the outskirts of the town. At 7pm, a person was reported unaccounted for in the Dargen area, near Lithgow, the ABC reported. Four firefighters in NSW were treated for heat exhaustion on Saturday, the ambulance service said, while another firefighter was reportedly injured after being struck by a truck in Richmond. Scott Morrison has returned to Australia - he flew in late last night. He is starting the day with a briefing with the New South Wales rural fire service headquarters in Sydney. AAP have the morning update: An elderly man whose home was consumed by flames remains missing and dozens of properties have been damaged or destroyed by bushfires which raged during heatwave NSW conditions on Saturday. Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described the day as “awful” for firefighters, with up to 20 homes lost to the immense Gospers Mountain fire northwest of Sydney alone. At least two more properties were razed near Batemans Bay on the south coast, and others at Balmoral southwest of Sydney. Southerly winds moving upstate on Saturday evening fanned flames in new directions and caused erratic fire behaviour, before creating cooler conditions for the 3000 firefighting and emergency personnel in the field. A fire-generated thunderstorm also formed over fires in the Shoalhaven. With forecasts predicting close to a week of advantageous conditions across NSW, Mr Fitzsimmons said his crews would ‘make hay’. Tougher conditions would likely return later in the week or next weekend. Two total fire bans will nevertheless be in place on Sunday in the Northern Slopes and North Western regions, under “very high” fire danger. “Our big focus is on trying to consolidate and establish containment lines across as many fire grounds as we can. We have significant fire spread south of the Bells Line of Road and through the valley system such as the Grose Valley in the Blue Mountains,” Mr Fitzsimmons told reporters. “So we will be looking at what are the options, what are the fall-back lines and at what point do we start implementing very significant strategies to secure protection for an impending threat to the Blue Mountains, particularly the communities along the Great Western Highway.”"

          "headline": "Labour: After the debacle, what comes next?",
          "bodyText": "David Lammy: “We need to unite the country around a vision for the UK we can all take pride in” The first election I paid attention to was in 1983. In the wake of the Brixton riots, Michael Foot’s commitment to tackling racial discrimination and disadvantage awakened my political consciousness. The manifesto was Labour’s most radical of the century, offering increased spending for the NHS, comprehensive care for under-fives and an emergency programme for investment in housing and transport. To a boy growing up poor in Tottenham, it seemed the exact tonic our sickly country needed. After learning the result – wipeout for Labour and a majority of 144 for Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives – I was distraught. I could not believe that, offered a hopeful vision for a fairer UK, the public had opted for more economic conservatism. In the early hours of Friday 13 December, as the Tories secured their biggest win since the Thatcher era, I recognised the same disappointment and disbelief in many of those around me. The Jeremy Corbyn I have known for decades as the MP for my neighbouring constituency is kind, compassionate and thoroughly decent. I regard him as a friend, with a wonderful track record as a constituency MP. To put it politely, these were not the qualities that came up on doorsteps as I campaigned in London, Halifax, Bury, Bolton, Cardiff, Birmingham, Watford and elsewhere. The leadership’s failure to deal with the stain of antisemitism within the party stripped Labour of moral authority. Jeremy’s triangulation on Brexit left Leavers thinking he was a Remainer and convinced Remainers he supported Leave. His well-reported hostility to institutions such as Nato cemented the public’s distrust. It was not Jeremy’s righteous belief in economic justice that lost Labour this election; it was his perceived worldview, failure of competence, and mind-boggling decision to abdicate leadership on the biggest issue of the day. For Labour to win back what were once seen as our heartlands, we need to unite the country around a vision for the UK we can all take pride in. This does not mean imitating Boris Johnson’s populist, ethnic nationalism. Many people voted Tory because of a legitimate commitment to leaving the EU, or because they did not like Corbyn or what Labour was offering. But Johnson cynically scapegoated migrants during the campaign, warning that Europeans had treated the UK like “their own” country for too long. This is not the first time Johnson has attacked a minority in an attempt to win popularity. In 2018, he compared Muslim women to bankrobbers and letterboxes, which led to a surge in hate crimes. By lurching to the right, Johnson was able to make a Faustian pact and convince Nigel Farage to stand down. This helped him win, but set a very dangerous precedent. Johnson’s ethnic nationalism relies on the idea of the nation as the natural home of a people whose ancestors are all from one ethnic group. History suggests that once ethnic nationalism is introduced into a nation’s politics it is difficult to remove and even more difficult to control. Once one group is defined as “the people”, the next step is often to classify the excluded as second-class citizens. This is hardly a route back to national unity. A new tribalism has gripped the UK. However, recent surveys show that on the most fundamental issues – climate change, equal pay and the right of women to have careers, faith in science and scientists, the NHS – we are not divided. On these issues our collective views are converging, and even heading towards a consensus. We need a politics that reflects that. The alternative to Johnson’s ethnic nationalism that Labour should offer is a civic nationalism. Rather than basing national pride on biological heritage, skin colour or religion, civic nationalism says we can unite around shared values and institutions. To foster this, we need new spaces and places in which the UK’s diverse peoples can engage with each other and belong. Why don’t we start by creating a citizens’ assembly to begin deciding the basis for a new British bill of rights and a codified constitution? Next, who is up for scrapping our unfair voting system and replacing it with something proportional to encourage a new politics of compromise? Then, why not trial a form of universal basic income – call it the citizens’ fund – so that all people have the capacity and capital to come together in social clubs, sports teams and other parts of civic life? More controversially, could compulsory national civic service – compelling young people from all regions, ethnicities and social classes to mix – remind us what we have in common? Labour will win back the country only if we show the public that we love the UK, too, and are positive about what we have achieved together, and optimistic about the inclusive, multicultural, dynamic society we want to build. The difference is that our national pride manifests itself in hope, rather than fear. While Johnson pulls the country back towards a nostalgic version of Little England, Labour must own the future of a reinvigorated UK. As for which Labour figure I believe is best-placed to lead this hopeful vision, I will consider that over Christmas. David Lammy is the MP for Tottenham in London Mary Creagh: “I asked Corbyn why he is still leader given how toxic he is” “Can I ask why you’re voting Conservative this time?” I asked the woman – who voted Labour in 2017 – smiling at me from the doorway of her home, beautifully decorated for Christmas. “Not at all,” she beamed. “First, education…” “Cut by £69m, in real terms, in Wakefield since 2015,” I interjected. “Second, the NHS,” she continued. “Suffering the longest funding squeeze in its history,” I countered. “Third, Brexit – I voted Remain but I just want it done.” I was used to Brexit objections, given my own long-standing opposition to it. Paradoxically, I benefited from Lib Dem and Tory Remainers backing me, and the Greens’ generous decision not to stand, which kept the swing against me to 6.5%, lower than in neighbouring seats. But this voter was switching because she trusted the Tories on education and the NHS, even after the photo of a child with suspected pneumonia asleep on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary was in every newspaper. I knew then that we would lose. Labour, the party of the NHS, was no longer trusted with it. The causes of our worst defeat in 80 years are complex – and simple. A winter election that Jeremy Corbyn should never have agreed to, against the advice of his shadow cabinet and the parliamentary Labour party. In the middle of a Brexit crisis, his indecision on the biggest issue facing the country meant we lost Leave and Remain voters. His leadership ratings were abysmal. Voters didn’t trust him on defence, security and the economy. They hated the party’s infection by antisemitism and saw good MPs bullied out of their seats. They just didn’t like him. When our “all shall have prizes” manifesto was published, people asked where the money was coming from and scoffed at our nationalised broadband idea. Nostrums of the 1970s were presented as answers to the 21st-century challenges of new technology, climate change, an ageing population and the changing nature of work. The £58bn for the Waspi women knocked the “carefully costed” mantra on the head. People despaired at the invidious choice before them and picked what they saw as the lesser of two evils. Thousands of party members had resigned. More have resigned since the result. Those failures mean a hard Brexit looms in January. Boris Johnson’s promises on workers and environmental rights have gone, exposed as a ruse to win power. His anarchic Vote Leave government is cracking on. A £10 minimum wage will happen only “if economic conditions permit”. They won’t. The economy will shrink and people will be poorer. Brexit threatens the union and will harm our public services. The gap between north and south, rich and poor will grow. So when I saw Jeremy posing for a photo with young people in parliament, I seized the moment. In my accidental exit interview, I asked why he wasn’t apologising to them. Why he was still leader when his personal toxicity, organisational incompetence and political mishandling had led to the catastrophe? How did losing the election mean we won the argument? The answers were indifferent and infuriating. The pre-election trigger ballots to reselect Labour MPs were because he wanted more democracy in the party. The bullying? Mainstream media. Antisemitism? Did I think he wants racism in the Labour party? He was present, but not involved. The Labour party, formed to represent working people, cannot ignore their verdict. We have failed them for four elections in a row. The party does not have a God-given right to exist. Members must decide if we are to be the strong social democratic opposition our country needs, or an ideological vanity project. The next leader must speak not just to members but to voters in Wakefield and Wolverhampton. They must ignore the keyboard warriors and speak to the decent, silent majority who want a leader they can trust. The next leader must reaffirm Labour’s progressive internationalism, kick out the antisemites, rebuild organisational competence and enforce the rules. They’ll need the heart of a lion and a strong stomach for the fight. We need to detoxify and become again a principled opposition that people can trust. We need a courageous, credible, clever and competent person to reshape our movement. Observer readers should join us and help get it right this time. Mary Creagh was MP for Wakefield from 2005 to 2019 Jon Trickett: “We need radicalism, social justice and national renewal” The Johnson government is clearly resolved to use the power of the state in order to drive through a rightwing shift. Our task is both to oppose Johnson but also to advocate the renewal of the country in a way which unites, rather than divides, and which offers a new economy, social justice and democratic reform. We must use the leadership election to debate our future. A blizzard of discrete tax and spend policies which lack any connective narrative or national story will not work. First, we need an analysis. Labour’s concern about impoverished public services, gross inequality and class stratification was surely correct. Our transformative approach should be sustained. It is also clear that many millions of people share the view that we need a big change. How else can we explain the fact that over 17 million people voted to leave the EU? A sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo has been incubating from as far back as the 2005 election. It is most deeply rooted in those areas which have suffered most from recent economic changes and which are geographically peripheral to the metropolitan growth nodes of the new economy. Too many people in too many communities experience a loss of agency; the power to control their own lives, to make a difference, and to have a voice which can make itself heard. Instead they sense they’re in a place where (bad) changes happen. Loss of control, no apparent economic purpose, and the collapse in social mobility means that your kids and grandkids can’t break out. The communities which I represent lost their coal mines 35 years ago. Their raison d’être was stripped away. Of the 533 English constituencies, mine is the 529th worst in terms of social mobility. Children born here can have little expectation of making progress in their lives. Loss of purpose leads to a sense of alienation and to emotional responses such as anger and a deep sense of existential angst. The right has understood this loss of agency. It explains the Brexit slogan of “take back control”. Of course, these working-class communities will not recover any control with a Tory government. Sadly the Remainer contingents failed to understand the emotional sense evoked by the offer of restored national sovereignty. Instead they sought to overturn the referendum in an apparent further twist of the knife by a social group which had never seemed to listen to or understood the “held back” regions. Given that the party was seen as tilting towards rejection of the votes of millions, it can hardly be surprising if those millions were suspicious of everything else we said, even though – taken singly – our policies were so popular that in some cases even Boris Johnson was using similar language. Where next, then? I would suggest three things. Each will require humility and a listening ear. First, there must be no going back to New Labour, where the alienation from so many communities began. Rather we must retain our central drive towards a transformation of our economic structures. But this must be rooted in a clearer understanding of working-class and left-behind areas. Never again should we present ourselves as knowing better than millions of our erstwhile supporters. Second, we need a connecting national story which explains who we are and where we are heading. This will require us to demonstrate how we will empower communities throughout the country and restore agency to those whose lives are subject to impersonal, often global economic forces. None of this new national story needs mean a return to a sense of an imperial Britain. The future is in internationalism on the one hand and localism on the other, bound together by a strong value-laden principle of solidarity. Third, we need to tackle the wholly dysfunctional, remote and incomprehensible political structures manipulated to their narrow interests by a golden elite group. We need a careful process of building power structures outside the metropolitan centre. It feels to me that progressive federalism with regional devolution in England alongside devomax for the nations is the only realistic way forward. Acting carefully, rooting ourselves in all Britain’s communities with resolve and radicalism but also with economic credibility, we can win again even in this dark hour.

          "headline": "Retired biologist's 'painfully beautiful' debut novel becomes year's surprise hit",
          "bodyText": "A retired wildlife biologist who spent much of her career studying hyenas, lions and elephants in southern Africa has emerged – at the age of 70 – as one of the most successful authors of the year or any year, with her debut novel one of the sleeper hits of 2019. Delia Owens has now sold more than 4.5 million copies of her novel Where The Crawdads Sing, since it was published in August, 2018. In addition to several accolades, a book club endorsement from Reese Witherspoonhelped it blow away the competition, exceeding the combined sales of grandees Margaret Atwood, John Grisham and Stephen King this year. It has sold more print copies than any other adult title – fiction or non-fiction – in 2019, according to NPD BookScan, the New York Times reported. Owens, 70, the co-author of three non-fiction books about her life as a scientist, received glowing reviews upon the novel’s launch in 2018. The New York Times Book Review called it “painfully beautiful”. But Crawdads, a coming-of-age story of a young woman living in the marshes of North Carolin, which involves an unexplained murder, took months to catch on. By December last year, according to Publisher’s Weekly, sales crossed just 186,000, with 39% of print sales coming from southern states. Publishers credit the endorsement of Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine book club for the delayed surge. Sales peaked in March at 75,000 copies in one week. Last week, the book landed back at No 1 on the New York Times’ fiction bestseller list, a return to the top spot it previously held for 30 weeks. And now Witherspoon plans to produce and star in a feature film based on the story. Publishing experts are baffled by the scale of the book’s success. A survey by the analysts Codex Group found that 55% of Crawdads readership identified as progressive; 30% as conservative; and 15% as centrists, suggesting that the story of a young woman wrestling with isolation and loneliness in lushly descriptive settings resonate beyond political boundaries and in defiance of falling sales of adult fiction. “This book has defied the new laws of gravity,” Codex Group president Peter Hildick-Smith told the New York Times. “It’s managed to hold its position in a much more consistent way than just about anything.” Owens, who was born in Georgia but lives in Idaho, said her mother encouraged her to venture far into the oak forests, saying: “Go way out yonder where the crawdads sing.” But according to some, Crawdads has a clouded genesis. According to Slate, after spending 22 years in Africa with her husband, Mark, they were advised never to return to Zambia after they were wanted for questioning in connection with the murder of a poacher. The murder, which took place in 1995, was filmed by an ABC camera crew. Owens is not implicated, but her stepson and her husband were identified by some witnesses. The crime later became the subject of an 18,000-word story written by Jeffrey Goldberg and published in the New Yorker. Goldberg told Slate’s Laura Miller he was surprised how Owens and her publishers have brushed over the episode. “I got a copy of Crawdads and I have to say I found it strange and uncomfortable to be reading the story of a southern loner, a noble naturalist, who gets away with what is described as a righteously motivated murder in the remote wild,” Goldberg noted. In an interview last year, Owens said she reads more non-fiction – biology and physics – than fiction. She said: “There is too much great, real science to be had. So when I read novels – to break away from the precision of science writing – I choose those with compelling story lines written descriptively.” When sales surpassed a million this summer, Owens posted on her website that her connection with readers “has filled my life”. She said: “Booksellers, giant ones and tiny ones, recommended Crawdads. And then came my readers. I treasure the connection I feel with you all. I cannot even express my gratitude, but I’ll try with a simple thank you!”"

          "bodyText": "A few months ago, Russell Wantling pulled over to the side of the road near the southern Queensland town of Stanthorpe to speak to a family he saw carrying buckets of water from the town dam. Again and again, they lugged each bucketload up the dam wall and poured it into a tank strapped to the tray of an old ute. “I just stopped and asked what they were doing,” Wantling says. “He said to me that they had no water, he couldn’t afford to buy water because he’d lost his job. So I went to my wife and said ‘we’ve got to do something, this is terrible’. “They talk about this Day Zero all the time, but it already is Day Zero.” Wantling, a truck driver, now coordinates the handout of about 340,000litres of water a week in Queensland’s granite belt region. He is one of several ordinary people trucking water to desperate and drought-ravaged parts of Queensland and New South Wales, where Day Zero has long come and gone. This is a familiar, hopeful story about the resilience of Australians and their communities, the sort condensed into our folklore at times of natural disaster and crisis. But it is also punctuated by anger and disbelief that the burden of supplying the most basic necessity to thousands of people in inland towns, on rural properties and in Indigenous communities has fallen mostly to community groups and charities. The longer they wait for rain, the more acutely people learn they cannot rely on interventions from local councils or governments. ‘You have to swallow your pride’ At the water shed run by Granite Belt Water Relief in Stanthorpe, people in old paddock bashers and newer four-wheel-drives queue for a 1,000L allocation of free water every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. Almost all come from outside town, beyond the reticulated water supply. They all tell slight variations of the same story, one after the other. The tanks are empty. No one is listening. The tanks on Amy Doherty’s property have been dry since March. Until Wantling began his deliveries, she and her family were able to shower only once a week. About two months ago, she became sick and unable to work, Doherty says, as she lines up. “I didn’t want to come here to begin with. There was no way I could do it because I was too proud,” Doherty says. “I live with my mother and my two young kids and I said to my Mum, ‘I can’t do this any more. I cannot cope’. “We had to have four horses put to sleep because we had no food, no water and our horses were just suffering. With less showering there were hygiene issues. It was hard. It was even hard to talk about it. But you have to swallow your pride, and that’s even harder.” Danny and Peta Johns and their son Balin also rely on the supply from the water shed. They have not had water in their dams for almost five months. “We moved from Victoria about five years ago and when we bought our house we were getting about 500ml of rain a year. We’ve had 150ml in the last two years probably. “Without [the water charity] we’d be buggered. We’d have no animals. None of these people here would have any stock at all. It’s disastrous. Having a family, paying a mortgage ... without this we would just be buggered. I couldn’t afford to buy water. “There’s nothing from the government at all. If it weren’t people like these volunteers, then we don’t know what we’d do.” Les Watnell says his property near Stanthorpe has had about 40mm of rainfall all year. “When you’re not working it’s too expensive to get the tank filled. “We’ve had to share our drinking water with our stock. We’re on one tank for a four-bedroom house. We’re having baths after the kids so we can keep down on our water. “The government has done nothing. Without [the water charity] we’d have nothing, it’s as simple as that.” ‘I’m a homeless guy and I can get trucks out there’ The cracked brown dirt of the middle-of-nowhere, north-west New South Wales, is a long way from Sydney’s cold, concrete streets where Lanz Priestley still lives rough when he’s not on the road delivering water. Priestley is best known as the mayor of Martin Place, from his days as a ringleader of the tent city that sprang up in Sydney in 2017. He now runs Dignity Water, which has taken emergency supplies of drinking water to thirsty places such as Walgett, Menindee, Bourke, Tenterfield and many smaller communities in between. “I have said directly to various people in government: ‘I live on the streets in Sydney, here I am a homeless guy in Sydney and I can get these B-doubles out there, why can’t the government?’” Priestley says. “I’ve done things about problems for decades. We’ve politely asked governments, we’ve done protests. I’ve come to the realisation the fastest way of getting any action is beating government to doing something. I’m not prepared to ask any more in the futile hope that government might do something. Here we’re just mobilising people. Here’s a solution, let’s just get in and do that.” Dignity Water started with a few pallet loads to places in need. Priestley crowdsources funding, supplies and support to do larger water drops. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The remote Indigenous communities are detrimentally affected right across Australia. They’re included in the communities we service, of course. I’m not going to take water out there for black people, white people, rich people, poor people. If we take water out there, we take it out there for people. “These problems are much bigger than are going to be solved with a few bottles and a few truckloads of water. Everyone knows that. Most levels of government should have been acutely aware of this 40 years ago and did nothing about it.” Last week, Priestley arrived in Tenterfield as locals marked 77 days since they were first advised to boil their drinking water, which has been heavily contaminated by ash from recent bushfires. It smells of bushfire smoke and heavy chlorine. “If people in Sydney had to live like this, millions of people were forced to live like this, it would be unacceptable,” says Luanna Legge, a local who has started Tenterfield Water Relief to hand out drinking water. “There would be protests, there would be riots. They would be calling for change after one week.” ‘They’re amazed that we’re there at all’ Back in June, a Sydney-based Indigenous activist group, Fighting In Resistance (Fire), posted a remarkable video on YouTube showing water drops to towns such as Collarenebri and Walgett, where the rivers that for centuries sustained Aboriginal culture have turned to dust. The footage is raw and powerful and shocking. It has been viewed online 66 times. Towards the end a First Nations man is filmed walking across the sandy river bed that used to be the Barwon. “It’s only taken them 200 or something odd years to bugger stuff up,” he says. Those rivers in the north-west of New South Wales, the Barwon and the Namoi, are major tributaries for the sick Murray-Darling system. They have been dry for more than a year, something many locals say has never happened before. Much of the water in Walgett is now coming from bores and is so salty it stinks. There is no desalination plant, despite warnings from health experts and traditional owners for more than a year about potential impacts. “It tastes really foul and minerally and slimy,” says Andy Mason, who is coordinating water distribution for Fire. “If there isn’t water being provided by us or by whoever ... people are spending really large amounts of income buying bottled water. In places like Walgett some families say they were spending a quarter of their income just buying water. People have been travelling to Moree 150km away just to get drinking water.” Mason says Fire decided to become involved about a year ago after learning of the water situation in Walgett. The group has installed water filters in homes and helps to coordinate local distribution of water so Indigenous people don’t miss out. “At first we just bought drinking water in supermarkets and physically drove it there in as many cars as we could get. Since then it’s evolved. “Our primary concern is Aboriginal families in all these towns. “A lot of people are amazed that anyone cares. We get that response quite often – it’s depressing in itself. They’re so used to being ignored, they’re amazed that we’re there at all.” ‘The reality is it’s left up to me’ There is little definitive information available about how many people live off the water grid or the scale of their suffering in a drought where the focus of government has been on monitoring and shoring up town water supplies. In 1994, a Human Rights Commission report into Indigenous water and sanitation estimated 154,000 people living in small communities had no reticulated water supply and another 285,000 were on small water schemes serving fewer than 1,000 people. Those figures don’t take into account large numbers who live on properties outside town and village centres, in some cases just a few kilometres away. In some places the situation creates a sort of water segregation. In Stanthorpe, trucks are bringing water to Storm King Dam to stave off Day Zero for those in town. Rural people can fill mobile tanks from the dam, but have to pay a $170 deposit for an access key – money many say they don’t have. Otherwise they must rely on charity. The local MP, David Littleproud, is also the federal water minister. He told Guardian Australia that while water supply to communities has been a state issue since federation, the federal government would consider stepping in. “The federal government will obviously not stand by if states do not provide water for towns,” he says. “But our expectation is that they secure water now and into the future with better planning and building of water infrastructure for future droughts.” Wantling says hearing story after story about people struggling has become difficult; that he is shouldering a burden that local and state and federal politicians are not. The water shed has morphed into a larger charity setup with a pantry full of donated food for those most in need. Each Wednesday and Saturday there are 30 volunteers. “It’s heartbreaking,” he says. “And I’m a truck driver. It’s hard for me. I walked into the office the other day and all the women were crying and sobbing. There was a girl who lost her job a few weeks ago and didn’t have food. We gave her fuel vouchers and washing vouchers and more food. It’s not a small amount of people, it’s a lot of people. “They’re just working class people who you’d think would get by. They’re not used to even using the system, so to ask for help is a really hard thing. “I do get pissed off because the reality is it’s left up to me and if I don’t get the water, they don’t get the water. If we shut down tomorrow, there would be people with no water. We’re doing all this work and a lot of people are going to bed at night not even worrying about this. They wouldn’t know what was going on.”"

          "headline": "Lucky strike? How lightning inspired builders of Callanish",
          "bodyText": "For thousands of years the Callanish standing stones erected on the remote Hebridean island of Lewis have remained a mystery. Why were they placed there? And for what purpose? Now archaeologists have uncovered dramatic new evidence that suggests our Neolithic ancestors were inspired to construct the megaliths as devotional monuments by the natural phenomenon of lightning strikes. A geophysical survey around one of the stones has astonished archaeologists by revealing a star-shaped pattern formed by one, or possibly multiple, earth-shaking lightning strikes. New technology has exposed a clear pattern covering an area of up to 20 metres in diameter, buried until now beneath peat bogs. The single stone, within “site XI”, is about 2.8km from the famous Callanish great circle in the island’s Loch Roag area. Geophysical techniques have mapped buried features and the new evidence shows that this 1.5-metre-high stone was originally part of another circle with the lightning strike pattern at its centre. The stones’ original positions have been revealed as magnetic anomalies in the survey. “We’re really excited,” said professor Vincent Gaffney, one of the archaeologists. “This was completely and utterly unexpected. Seeing the evidence for a massive strike, right in the middle of what now seems to be a stone circle, is remarkable.” He added that such a lightning strike may have hit an upstanding feature – perhaps a tree or a rock – in “a prehistorical equivalent of an act of God”: “It does rather look as if lightning was part of the game in creating this stone circle.” Dr Richard Bates, a geoscientist at St Andrews University, who is leading the project, described the discovery as highly exciting. He said: “We’re finally getting new results on these places because of new technologies, allowing us to look at standing stones in a whole new light.” The Callanish great circle is thought to have been erected in 3,000 BC, some 500 years before the major stone settings at Stonehenge, which is linked with another natural event: the solstices. More than 15 other sites on the island have been identified as possible satellite circles. With the geophysical survey, determining the chronology is difficult, said Bates. “Did the lightning strike come first or did the building of the stone circle come first? The lightning strike occurred before peat started forming So we know it’s pre-peat, which started to form around 3,000 years ago. It seems more than coincidence that these are occurring in the same place.” Gaffney, from Bradford University’s department of archaeological sciences, has also headed the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes project, surveying land around the Wiltshire monument. He described the new geophysical evidence as “phenomenal”: “We’ve never seen this before. It just says so much about how our ancestors related to nature. It is not a great leap of the imagination to believe early societies would have been enamoured with natural events. Standing stones are linked, for instance, to astronomic events. Remember what Jove used as a weapon – lightning bolts. This is something which occurs in a number of religions. So we can identify here a rule of nature perhaps informing or reinforcing belief structures in the past.” Gaffney’s brother, Dr Chris Gaffney, an archaeological geophysicist, said that it was impossible to see the fossilised lightning strike by just walking across the site. “You literally have to peel back all of the peat potentially to see the scarring on the bedrock.” He added that the evidence suggests that the stones sanctified the spot of “a really huge-looking event”: “The prospect of understanding why a particular stone circle might be in a particular location is amazing. We’re always trying to get into other people’s heads when we’re thinking of these ancient ritual sites. Well, we might now have an idea.”"

          "headline": "The law that helped the internet flourish now undermines democracy",
          "bodyText": "In October 1994, an unidentified user of a bulletin board hosted by an online service provider, Prodigy.com, posted an item that was to have far-reaching consequences. The post claimed that a Long Island brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont had committed criminal and fraudulent acts in connection with the initial public offering (IPO) of another company. Stratton Oakmont sued Prodigy and the unidentified poster for defamation – and won. Prodigy argued that it couldn’t be held responsible for what anonymous users posted on its platform. The judge disagreed, arguing that the company was liable as the publisher of the content created by its users because it exercised editorial control over the messages on its bulletin boards in several ways and was thereby potentially liable for any and all defamatory material posted on its websites. The case alarmed an Oregon congressman (now a US senator), Ronald Wyden, who accurately perceived it as a mortal threat to the growth of the internet. It would mean that every online hosting service would need to have lawyers crawling over its site, thereby slowing exploitation of the technology to a crawl. So with another congressman, Chris Cox, he inserted a short clause – Section 230 – into the Communications Decency Act, which was then incorporated in the sprawling 1996 Telecommunications Act. The section itself is short (about a thousand words) but the core of it is a single sentence: “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” That sentence laid the basis for everything that has followed. It constitutes, as the title of a recent book puts it, The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet. What it does is create a “liability shield” for online platforms. It does not prevent them from moderating content, if that’s what they choose to do. But what it has done is enable these platforms to scale up at an exponential rate. Thus users can upload videos to YouTube, post reviews on Amazon and TripAdvisor or classified ads on Craigslist; and it enables Facebook and Twitter to offer social networking to millions – all without incurring legal liability for what those folks do on their platforms. Section 230 is thus the get-out-of-jail secret behind countless internet fortunes. And if it were to be repealed tomorrow, many of those platforms would shrivel. Not surprisingly, given the manifold abuses of surveillance capitalism and the societal damage that the tech giants are causing, people are beginning to wonder if Section 230 ought to be revised. The answer to that is yes, but it’s a bit like the question of whether we should give up burning fossil fuels tomorrow. In both cases, the problem is that there are too many vested interests to extricate ourselves before catastrophe strikes. Although Section 230’s purpose was clear, its language was not. Since it did not make the liability protection conditional on responsible content-moderation practices, lawyers have persuaded US courts to interpret the statute as providing a sweeping immunity far beyond what its authors intended or imagined. As a result, says Danielle Keats Citron, a noted legal scholar, courts have massively overextended Section 230’s legal shield; platforms have been protected from liability no matter how irresponsible their conduct and no matter how grave the harm inflicted. The statute, she writes, “has been extended to protect sites whose business is revenge porn, whose operators choose to post defamation, and whose role is getting a cut of illegal gun sales”. The prospects for revision of Section 230 in the US seem remote. Although lawmakers’ hostility to the tech giants has greatly increased, their animus is too incoherent to be effective. Conservatives think that S230 allows the companies to escape responsibility for discriminating against conservative political viewpoints. The Electronic Freedom Foundation, on the other hand, sees it as “one of the most valuable tools for protecting freedom of expression and innovation on the internet”. And so it goes on: in the land of the first amendment, every dog has his day – or at least his say. With the 20/20 vision of hindsight, Senator Wyden’s clause might be regarded as a sensible statute for the mid-1990s, when the web was just getting going and before companies like Google and Facebook existed. But that was a long time ago, and things have changed out of all recognition since then. Because of the way the clause’s reach was inexorably extended by ingenious lawyers, permissive judges, inattentive legislators and determined tech-company lobbying it has become a tool for undermining democracy. It does this by enabling tech companies – especially social media – to behave with impunity because they don’t have legal liability for the consequences of the activities that their platforms (and their business models) enable. It effectively says that there are some powerful agents in society that can escape responsibility for the harm that they do. Impunity on this scale is incompatible with a functioning democracy.

          "headline": "The jaguars fishing in the sea to survive",
          "bodyText": "A thriving population of jaguars living on a small, unspoilt island off the coast of the Brazilian Amazon has learned to catch fish in the sea to survive, conservationists have found. The Maracá-Jipioca Ecological Station island reserve, three miles off the northern state of Amapá, acts as a nursery for jaguars, according to WWF researchers who have collared three cats and set up 70 camera traps on the remote jungle island. Although jaguars have previously been spotted catching fish in Brazil’s Pantanal wetlands, this is believed to be the first evidence the elusive creatures have been jumping in the sea to catch prey. “This is the first time that behaviour has been spotted in the Amazon,” said Marcelo Oliveira, senior programme officer at WWF Brazil, who is leading the NGO’s first jaguar-collaring research. “On the way [past the camera], the jaguar was dry and on the way back it was wet and had a moving fish in its mouth.” He believes a big proportion of their diet is likely to be fish. Oliveira said the jaguars have two fishing techniques – one is to wait for the tide to come in and to catch fish in the ponds that form among the mangroves, the other is to jump into the sea. “I’m not aware of any other jaguar population that eats so much fish – it’s very unusual,” he added. The 600 sq km (230 sq mile) island – which is protected by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – has no human residents and animals have little contact with people. It has a diverse landscape of tropical forests, flooded grasslands, dense coastal mangroves and mudflats. It is also a stop-off point for a number of migratory birds, including American flamingos, osprey and cuckoos. Fishermen say they have seen jaguars – as well as deer, anteaters and buffalo – swimming between the island and mainland. There are 27 jaguars on the island and five to six cats per 100 sq km in some parts. Normally only two to five jaguars would share a territory of this size. The island’s jaguars are believed to hunt deer, buffalo, lizards and monkeys, but a plentiful supply of fish could be the secret to their success, researchers say. Iranildo Coutinho, head of the ecological station on the island, describes it as a “kind of nursery or sanctuary” for jaguars because it may be fuelling populations on the mainland. “The fishermen often say that the island produces jaguars. It is the only coastal island along the coast of the Amazon and this is why it holds very important samples of fauna and coastal vegetation that are very well preserved and act almost like a live laboratory,” he said. The area of mainland adjacent to the island is dangerous for jaguars as there are several buffalo farmers who feel threatened by the presence of the cats. At the end of 2018, a female jaguar was killed with her cub after attacking dogs in the village of Sucuriju, 30 miles (50km) from the island. Jaguars are near threatened according to the IUCN red list, with sharp declines caused by deforestation and the illegal wildlife trade, which targets them for their skin and body parts. The Amazon is the single largest remaining stronghold for jaguars, but it is estimated recent wildfires have destroyed the habitats of 500 individuals. These cats are one of the largest predators in South America and are often seen as a litmus test for forest health. The satellite technology fitted to the collars of the jaguars on Maracá-Jipioca provides researchers with hourly updates on the animals’ movements. The camera traps have already taken more than 30,000 pictures. Understanding how a predator uses its territory will help researchers learn how to limit inevitable conflicts with humans. WWF conservationists also collected blood samples from the collared jaguars to work out if they are crossing onto the mainland to breed – if not, then they are likely to have a very small gene pool, which could pose a problem for the long-term health of the population. Researchers place a GPS collar on a jaguar for research and monitoring. Dr Chris Carbone, a senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who is an expert on predator-prey relationships, said the research (in which he was not involved) shows how versatile these cats are. “It is good to see jaguars showing such adaptability, as wildlife in general are increasingly exposed to reductions in their habitats and this ability to adapt may be critical for the future survival of such populations,” he said. “That said, we shouldn’t be complacent. We don’t know how long jaguars have been fishing on these islands. If it is a long-standing behavioural adaptation, it may be that many species are experiencing changes in their habitats which are too sudden to allow for them to adapt.” The research is being carried out in collaboration with the Jaguar Conservation Fund and Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. Jaguar conservationist Lailson Ferreira, who works with WWF on the island, said: “It’s important to preserve this island because this place is a treasure. There are very special creatures here, like the spotted jaguar and many others.” Oliveira added: “Months of meticulous planning went into the mission, but we can never guarantee collaring a wild animal. To have collared three jaguars on this first WWF expedition is an amazing result. “The satellite technology fitted to the collars is providing us with hourly updates on the animals’ movements for up to eight months, resulting in a bank of information on how the jaguars use the forest to live and flourish.” Next year, researchers are setting up more camera traps and in June 2020 they will collar two more jaguars."

          "bodyText": "We teach our children that if a bank makes a mistake, the money is yours. A roll of the dice on the Monopoly board game takes you to the Community Chest card. It reads: “Bank error in your favour. Collect £200”. Older versions of the cards picture a bank teller mistakenly handing cash to a top-hatted gent, who looks both gleeful and astonished at his good fortune. In recent weeks we have revealed a much larger banking error, as £193,000 turned up in the account of a heavily indebted car mechanic in Cambridge. He was gleeful and astonished too; in his words “I thought: ‘Whoa! Bloody hell, whoopee.” And who wouldn’t? Yes, lots of very decent people will instantly contact the bank, knowing the money isn’t their’s, and that they are not legally entitled to it. Lots more will think, hold on, maybe it is actually mine somehow … maybe the bank will never notice … and what about finders keepers … doesn’t that mean I can just keep it? There’s an important difference between failing to hand back £193,000 in your account, and directly stealing it from the bank. In religious teaching, the first is a sin of omission, the second is a sin of commission. They are both sins. But the Catholic altar boy in me tells me I’d be given rather fewer Hail Marys for omitting rather than committing. This business of money just landing in your account happens more than you think. I know of an accountant who saw £28,000 wrongly credited into the account of his son, an oil worker abroad, and the bank did not notice for 10 months. I know a shopkeeper whose business account was suddenly credited with heaps of small, individual payments obviously intended for another business account. Both handed the money back … eventually. In each case, they knew the money wasn’t theirs. But they held on to it. I think we shut our eyes and imagine that the only loser is the bank, and they’re a rich, remote, corporate entity, not a real person. But if you found £193,000 in a suitcase you would behave differently. You would know full well it belongs to someone, and possibly someone very dodgy. And if you have ever seen the 1994 film Shallow Grave, you’d know to high-tail it to the police station immediately. Is poverty or debt a good reason to hold on to what is not yours? I’m humbled by the tale of Kevin Booth, a homeless man in a small town outside Seattle. This time last year, Booth was at the local food bank before it opened when he found a plastic bag full of $20 notes. He patiently waited to hand it in to the food bank when it opened. There was $17,000 (£13,000) in the bag. “I felt like doing the right thing would be better than taking off with it,” he said. “It made me feel good.” He had been living on the streets for seven years. Maybe some people think they can just get away with it. Two metal detectorists unearthed an astonishing hoard of Saxon and Celtic treasure in a Herefordshire field. They had not obtained permission from the land owner to search for treasure, and the law says they should have declared the find for the nation. Finders really is not keepers. They were recently sentenced, many would say harshly, to ten years and eight and a half years respectively. Goodness knows what Lord Elgin should have got for those marbles. If you have any residual doubts about “bank error in your favour”, consider the case of Sarah Jane Lee who in 2007 found £135,000 in her account. Unlike our car mechanic last week, she and her sister Amanda Moorcroft blew almost the lot, splashing out on a £10,000 Florida holiday and luxury items. Their bank, Abbey (now Santander) in Blackburn, didn’t spot the error for several weeks, but they did eventually catch them. They were charged with “retaining wrongful credit” and were sentenced to 12 months and 10 months respectively. There are lessons to be learned from the curious case of the man who made a tiny sort code error, lost £193,000, and the man who received the cash. The technical lesson is that banks have woefully failed to sort out “confirmation of payee”, which would have prevented the error occurring in the first place. The legal lesson is that you are not entitled to money wrongfully credited to your account. The life lesson is that, whatever mental gymnastics you may go through to somehow think the money is yours, it’s not, and it’s really not worth the hassle trying to keep it. p.collinson@theguardian.com"

          "bodyText": "Canadian police were prepared to shoot Indigenous land defenders blockading construction of a natural gas pipeline in northern British Columbia, according to documents seen by the Guardian. Notes from a strategy session for a militarized raid on ancestral lands of the Wet’suwet’en nation show that commanders of Canada’s national police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), argued that “lethal overwatch is req’d” – a term for deploying an officer who is prepared to use lethal force. The RCMP commanders also instructed officers to “use as much violence toward the gate as you want” ahead of the operation to remove a roadblock which had been erected by Wet’suwet’en people to control access to their territories and stop construction of the proposed 670km (416-mile) Coastal GasLink pipeline (CGL). In a separate document, an RCMP officer states that arrests would be necessary for “sterilizing [the] site”. Wet’suwet’en people and their supporters set up the Gidimt’en checkpoint in December 2018 to block construction of the pipeline through this region of mountains and pine forests 750 miles north of Vancouver. On 7 January, RCMP officers – dressed in military-green fatigues and armed with assault rifles – descended on the checkpoint, dismantling the gate and arresting 14 people. The checkpoint lies 22km east of a camp operated by a house group of the Wet’suwet’en called the Unist’ot’en, which has been at the center of the struggle against the pipeline. The camp is one of several instances where Indigenous people in British Columbia have reinhabited ancestral territory that falls outside of demarcated reservations, in what they refer to as “reoccupation”. Unist’ot’en spokesperson Freda Huson (Howilhkat) said that the RCMP’s militarized posture during the raid was consistent with a long history of colonial violence. “In our experience, since first contact, RCMP have been created by the federal government to dispossess Indigenous peoples of their lands,” Huson said. “They have proven [that] through their harassment of my people to support Coastal GasLink in invading our territories.” Police records seen by the Guardian include transcripts from police strategy sessions, reports filed after the raid and audio and video files. One document noted that the Wet’suwet’en possessed “firearms for hunting/sustenance” but police intelligence indicated that there was “no single threat indicating that [land defenders] will use firearms”. An RCMP spokesperson declined to comment on the specific content of the documents, saying they were merely carrying out a December 2018 injunction against people who interfere with the CGL pipeline. “During the planning for the enforcement of the court-ordered injunction, the RCMP took the remote location of the Morice River Bridge into account and ensured that enough police officers were present in the area to keep the peace,” the spokesperson said. “We also took into consideration the unpredictable nature of what we could face in the remote area, and so we moved additional police resources including members of the tactical and emergency response teams to provide support.” The revelations come as the Wet’suwet’en camps brace for a provincial supreme court ruling on an injunction applied for by the pipeline builder TC Energy (formerly TransCanada), which seeks to permanently restrict the Wet’suwet’en from blocking access to pipeline work sites. The pipeline would run from the Dawson Creek area of northern British Columbia to a facility near Kitimat on the Pacific coast. CGL has begun road-building and clear-cutting on the right-of-way, and the company intends to start construction in early-2020. Founded in 2009, Unist’ot’en camp was the first among a constellation of Indigenous-led uprisings against fossil fuel pipelines in North America – including Keystone XL, Trans Mountain, Enbridge Line 3, Dakota Access and Bayou Bridge. Like most Indigenous people in British Columbia, the Wet’suwet’en have never relinquished their land to the Canadian government by treaty, land sale or surrender. In a 1997 ruling, the supreme court of Canada determined that aboriginal land ownership had never been given up across the Wet’suwet’en’s 22,000 km sq of territory. Wet’suwet’en leaders say they are defending their right to protect themselves and future generations from irreparable harm. The pipeline would run directly beneath the Morice River, a river system several municipalities rely on. The documents show that ahead of the raid, the RCMP deployed an array of surveillance, including heavily armed police patrols, a jet boat, helicopter, drone technology, heat-sensing cameras and close monitoring of key land defenders’ movements and social media postings. Police established a “media exclusion zone”, blocking reporters from accessing the area. They took care to hide their carbine rifles on the approach to the roadblock because the “optics” of the weapons were “not good”, according to one of the documents. The documents also show close collaboration between the RCMP and TC Energy: police officers attended company planning sessions and daily “tailgate” meetings, and were privy to CGL’s legal strategy. The RCMP were prepared to arrest children and grandparents: “No exception, everyone will be arrested in the injunction area,” a document reads. Another makes reference to possible child apprehension by social services – a troubling disclosure given the violent history of residential schooling in Canada and the disproportionate number of Indigenous children currently in the child welfare system. “The police are here to support the invasion of Indigenous territories,” said Tlingit land defender Anne Spice. “It is what they’ve always done. Now, they watch us when we travel to pick berries. They ‘patrol’ the roads where we hunt. They harass us and profile us under the guise of ‘public safety’.” Since the January raid, an RCMP detachment known as the Community Industry Safety Office has maintained a large presence in an effort to forestall any resistance to pipeline construction. Armed RCMP officers can be seen patrolling the area, and three police trailers are tucked away in the woods alongside the access road. Drones and helicopters often circle overhead. CGL has also retained two private security firms that track Indigenous people’s movements. According to the RCMP spokesperson, the police detachment will remain in place in Wet’suwet’en lands “as long as deemed necessary”. The RCMP Community Industry Response Group (CIRG) has also recently been deployed to monitor and suppress Indigenous people fighting the proposed Trans Mountain tar sands pipeline, which would pass through a separate area of British Columbia and which officially began construction last month. One of the Gidimt’en land protectors, Molly Wickham (Sleydo’), from the clan’s Grizzly House, described the CIRG detachment in her people’s territory as a violation of “free, prior and informed consent” between a settler state and Indigenous people -- a principle enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. “What I’ve witnessed over the last year is not only violent oppression by RCMP and the state on 7 January, but the continuing occupation of our territories and surveillance of our people and camp by CIRG,” she said. The RCMP’s suppression of Indigenous dissent against resource extraction is rooted in its founding as a paramilitary entity 150 years ago. In the late 1800s, the RCMP (formerly the Northwest Mounted Police) carried out surveillance, violent displacement and relocation of Indigenous peoples onto reserves, and the forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families in order to place them in residential schools. Advocates say it was the police force which enabled the Canadian government to seize Indigenous homelands and undermine Native sovereignty. More recently, the Canadian state has thrown its national security apparatus behind oil and gas development – often directly at Indigenous people’s expense. The 2015 Anti-Terrorism Act, Bill C-51, sanctions the criminalization of Indigenous environmentalists by enhancing surveillance and legal powers against any potential interference with Canada’s “critical infrastructure” or “territorial integrity”. Land defenders such as Freda Huson have been identified in RCMP intelligence reports as “aboriginal extremists”. Despite the onset of winter, Wet’suwet’en land defenders remain at the camps to protect their lands and waters. As construction crews dynamite the land in preparation for laying pipe, and RCMP and private security forces patrol the territory, they trap for food and build new cabins. “We will continue to resist, to insist on respect for our way of life,” said Spice. • This article was amended on 30 December 2019. An earlier version described “lethal overwatch” as “a term for deploying snipers”. To clarify, it describes the deployment of an officer who is prepared to use lethal force, who may or may not be positioned as a sniper. An earlier version also included the quote “sterilizing the site” from an RCMP record. The word “the” does not actually appear in the record."

          "bodyText": "Durbridge Play Fortune theatre, London, 2 October 1971 The conventional stage whodunit is about as exciting as a vicarage parlour game. But the great virtue of this slick, highly polished thriller by Francis Durbridge is that almost from the start we know who is going to murder whom: the dramatic excitement, as in Dial M for Murder, lies in watching the net slowly close in on the smug, smooth protagonist. Company Her Majesty’s theatre, London, 19 January 1972 How good is Company? When I saw Stephen Sondheim’s musical 18 months ago in New York, I thought it a marvellously tart, wry, original show that got away from all the lumbering cliches of the formula-bound Broadway musical. Second time round I admire it even more; partly because its surface exuberance seems to conceal a great sadness, partly because it has the whiplash precision of the best Broadway shows plus a good deal of intellectual resonance. Not I Royal Court, London, 17 January 1973 If Beckett has a painter’s eye, he also has a poet’s ear. The mouth belongs to a 70-year-old woman whose past life flashes before her, like that of someone drowning, but who transfers her experiences to someone else: the impression is of a buzzing skull, a mouth on fire helplessly attached to a body incapable of feeling. If I had to sum up the play’s theme in a phrase, it would be the anguish of memory at a time when all physical sentience had departed. Billie Whitelaw’s performance is an astonishing tour de force combining frenetic verbal speed with total sensitivity to the musical rhythm of the piece. Ken Dodd Liverpool Playhouse, 17 April 1973 Ostensibly, the intention is to explore the nature of laughter: in reality what we get is a king-sized Dodd-fest. It begins with those wayward teeth spotlit in what looks like a conscious parody of Billie Whitelaw in Beckett; and it goes on to run the gamut of Doddy jokes. Wisely, perhaps, Dodd avoids too much theorising. He quotes Freud’s opinions that a laugh is a conservation of psychic energy; but, as he says, the trouble with Freud is that he never played Glasgow second house on a Friday night. Brassneck Nottingham Playhouse, 21 September 1973 Brassneck by Howard Brenton and David Hare is an important play. Not since John Arden’s The Workhouse Donkey 10 years ago have I seen any work that attempts to put a whole regional community on stage and show in detail how the provincial power nexus works. Judging by the outraged huffing and puffing near me, it was courageous of Nottingham Playhouse to stage it. Words of Advice Greenwich theatre, London, 5 March 1974 Fay Weldon’s play is tight, tart and alert. In the centre of the ring are Tammy and Julia, a primary schoolteacher and his suffocating wife, who use each other like punchbags. Encircling them are their parents and in-laws who prefer contradictory, self-interesting advice. My gripe about the play is that its horizons are inevitably limited. It scarcely touches on the high cost of loving, on the way social inequity affects private relationships and on the crucial fact that even our emotional crises are carried on against the background of changing public events: only in plays do people have time to suffer in a vacuum. But Miss Weldon can certainly write. The Tempest Old Vic, London, 7 March 1974 Fourteen years ago precisely, Peter Hall began his brilliant Stratford reign with an over-decorated, eccentrically cast production of Two Gentlemen of Verona. We should not, therefore, despair if he has begun his National Theatre career with a lethargic, vulgarly spectacular, masque-like production of The Tempest that almost manages to submerge the presence of the greatest living Shakespearean actor, Sir John Gielgud, in opulent excess. Bordello Queen’s theatre, London, 19 April 1974 I have, I suppose, seen worse musicals than Bordello. Indeed I can wincingly remember one about refrigerated corpses and another about premature ejaculation at a certain north London engine shed. But it’s a long time since I’ve seen a show of such extravagant pointlessness or one that deployed such elaborate resources to convey a message that could be comfortably inscribed on the back of a 3½d stamp. Travesties Aldwych, London, 11 June 1974 I find it difficult to write in calm, measured tones about Tom Stoppard’s Travesties: a dazzling pyrotechnical feat that combines Wildean pastiche, political history, artistic debate, spoof-reminiscence and song-and-dance in marvellously judicious proportions. The text itself is a dense Joycean web of literary allusions; yet it also radiates sheer intellectual joie de vivre, as if Stoppard were delightedly communicating the fruits of his own researches. Play Mas Royal Court, London, 17 July 1974 Mustapha Matura’s Play Mas is an endearing, intelligent comedy. I only hope the work, playing at heavily reduced prices, gets through to the popular audience it deserves. Not that the play is by any means a mere colourful folksy romp. Even if everything in Trinidad stops for the annual gaudy Dionysiac rite, Matura shows that this cannot conceal either the social and political tensions or the interracial bitterness. Autosacramentales Roundhouse, London, 27 December 1974 I must be honest: I found Autosacramentales, an hour-long Victor Garcia production of a Calderon religious drama, almost totally inaccessible. Even with the help of programme notes and a pocket torch, I could not sort out Sin from Death, the Soul from the Body, or Cain from Abel. No Man’s Land Old Vic, London, 24 April 1975 Harold Pinter’s new play is about precisely what its title suggests: the sense of being caught in some mysterious limbo between life and death, between a world of brute reality and one of fluid uncertainty. But although plenty of plays, from Sweeney Agonistes to Outward Bound, have tried to pin down that strange sense of reaching into a void, I can think of few that have done so as concretely, funnily and concisely as Pinter’s. The Big Red Ladder Show Camden Town Hall, London, 6 December 1975 There was a cup final atmosphere last night at Camden Town Hall as a packed, exultant house roared its approval of the Red Ladder company’s new show, It Makes Yer Sick. The occasion was a benefit night for this spring-heeled leftwing troupe, who next month move to Yorkshire to set up a permanent base. I can only say that the north should count itself lucky, for this show is a model of what popular political theatre ought to be: festive, exuberant and theatrically pungent. Macbeth The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, 10 September 1976 The simpler, the better; that is my feeling about Trevor Nunn’s ceaseless quest for the ideal Macbeth. Two years ago he staged the play in Stratford’s main house as an over elaborate religious spectacle. He then stripped away the ritual for an Aldwych version spoiled by gabbled speaking. And now, at Stratford’s Other Place in a production played without an interval, he has hit the right balance between verbal clarity and depraved religiosity; I have never seen the play come across with such throat-grabbing power. Dusa, Fish, Stas and Vi Mayfair theatre, London, 11 February 1977 Pam Gems’s play is a bright, naturalistic, observant comedy that, I presume, tells it like it is. It is written with a glancing lightness worlds away from the grisly gaiety of those all-girl TV sitcoms, and Nancy Meckler’s production has an eye for simple, behaviourist detail I haven’t seen since Peter Gill’s New York production of Fishing. Vautrin Citizens theatre, Glasgow, 10 October 1977 What other company but the Glasgow Citizens would have had the chutzpah to revive Vautrin, a play by Honoré de Balzac that has not been seen since its ill-fated Paris premiere in 1840? Having chosen to revive it, what other company would have been able to hit the right note of opulent romantic melodrama? Coriolanus Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 21 October 1977 Terry Hands’ production of Coriolanus at Stratford is staggeringly good. Played on a dark, cavernous stage over which two huge ribbed doors swing on hinges, it combines the imagistic power of continental theatre with a very English respect for actors. The paradox of the production is that Alan Howard, one of our most likable actors, plays Coriolanus, Shakespeare’s least likable hero. But not since Olivier has anyone played the part with such complete understanding of his mental process. Betrayal Lyttelton, London, 16 November 1978 Themes, say some critics, don’t matter: what counts is the skill a dramatist brings to his chosen subject. Well the petit-point school of reviewing should have a field night with Harold Pinter’s Betrayal at the Lyttelton since it is full of technical resource. What distresses me is the pitifully thin strip of human experience it explores and its obsession with the tiny ripples on the stagnant pond of bourgeois affluent life. Winter Journey Ashcroft, Croydon, 12 September 1979 Clifford Odets’ Winter Journey is a fascinating backstage melodrama that requires incandescent acting to lift it to a higher plane. Allegedly, it got it when Michael Redgrave, Sam Wanamaker and Googie Withers did a legendary production at the St James in 1952. But the present Cambridge Theatre Company version, now on tour at the Ashcroft, Croydon, is competently acted, thinly directed and wretchedly designed. The curtain is lowered between each of the eight scenes, giving one infinite time to read and reread the programme ads for Turkish restaurants, locksmiths and piano-tuners. Sweeney Todd Theatre Royal Drury Lane, London, 3 July 1980 Sweeney Todd is the reversal of everything we traditionally expect of a musical. It has a powerful and gripping story, hardly a single extractable tune, a fierce sense of social justice. Yet, after seeing it on Broadway 18 months ago and now at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, I would call it sensationally effective. Indeed, burning a boat or two, I would say it is one of the two (My Fair Lady being the other) durable works of popular musical theatre in my lifetime. Cats New London theatre, London, 12 May 1981 An exhilarating piece of total theatre that demolishes several myths at one go: that the British can’t get a musical together, that our dancers are below American standard, and that musicals with a literary source always dilute their origins. What is heartening is the way the poems are integrated into the occasions. Thus Gus the Theatre Cat (beautifully played by Stephen Tate) is seen as a wistful, white-haired Victorian relic dreaming of palmier days. He is then transmogrified (or transmoggified) into Growltiger, the cutlass-bearing Pirate cat. Noises Off Lyric Hammersmith, London, 25 February 1982 Michael Frayn’s play is not simply a machine for creating laughs. It is about the booby-trapped minefield of theatre itself in which one false move, one missed cue, can destroy a carefully created fiction. In one sense, it panders to our sadistic delight in things that go wrong; in another, it is a very intelligent joke about the fragility of all forms of drama. Aunt Mary Donmar Warehouse, London, 25 June 1982 Not believing that pain-racked evenings are good for the soul, I am delighted to report that the reopened Donmar Warehouse has highly comfortable, well-raked purple seats, a foyer bar and even a portable interval drinks trolley. The new regime’s opening choice is Pam Gems’ Aunt Mary, which confirms the amiable impression it made on me when I first encountered it as an RSC reading. It may not blaze like a comet, but it is a perfectly decent, compassionate if slightly quirky play (like the work of a Brummagem Tennessee Williams). Top Girls Royal Court, London, 9 February 1983 What I admire about Caryl Churchill is that she is not unafraid of downright passion (the rarest commodity in modern British theatre). Having taken us all round her subject, in the final scene Ms Churchill gives us an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation between Marlene, the one who got away, and her trapped East Anglian sister. And, without spoiling the denouement, it is fair to say that Ms Churchill proves that both sisters are in different ways deprived and that some things are bigger than blood ties. Glengarry Glen Ross Cottesloe, London, 22 September 1983 The play is filled with the spiralling obscenity and comic bluster of real-estate salesmen caught off guard; yet underneath that there is fear and desperation. Mamet says that he admires his characters’ pragmatic individualism, but to me the piece comes across as a chillingly funny indictment of a world in which you are what you sell. Death of a Salesman Broadhurst theatre, New York, 6 April 1984 What is remarkable about Dustin Hoffman’s performance is that it captures all of Willy’s devouring insecurity. “I still feel kind of temporary about myself,” says Willy at one point, and Hoffman presents us with a man who in his sad 60s still doesn’t quite know who he is. Mrs Gaugin Almeida, London, 5 June 1984 Style is stronger than substance in Mrs Gauguin: the second production of the new Almeida Theatre Company and an attempt to redeem the reputation of the painter’s wife, Mette Sophie Gad, given a bad press by Maugham in The Moon and Sixpence. Helen Cooper’s script, however, is little more than a series of quick, data-starved, impressionist sketches fleshed out by Mike Bradwell’s visually elegant production. Saved Royal Court, London, 21 December 1984 Edward Bond’s Saved returns to the Royal Court in a very fine production by Danny Boyle that brings out more clearly than previous versions the play’s savage humour and tenuous optimism. Nineteen years ago, critics and audiences were understandably poleaxed by the notorious scene of baby-stoning violence. But, while that remains as stomach-turning as ever, it is by no means exploitative or Bond’s final statement on the human condition. Henry V Barbican, London, 18 May 1985 Kenneth Branagh’s Henry confirms the good impression he made in Stratford: he combines boyish vulnerability with moral gravitas. I’m not sure he would be capable of the brutalities threatened before Harfleur, but it is an immensely appealing and well-spoken performance. Ian McDiarmid’s Chorus (looking like an RAF bomber pilot) is vocally tricky but rivetingly sardonic, and there is good work from Nicholas Woodeson, who makes the Dauphin a nervous peacock, and from John Carlisle as the Archbishop of Canterbury, who puts the case for war with desperate ingenuity. But then he (and this is one of the production’s major points) doesn’t have to endure the horrendous reality. Macbeth Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, 26 August 1985 The dominant image of Yukio Ninagawa’s production, often seen through a transparent, latticed screen, is cherry blossoms in full bloom. To us, the cherry blossom symbolises beauty; to the Japanese it also signals danger and fear. Thus Banquo is murdered not in the usual stygian darkness but in full light under a cherry tree while putting up the heroic fight expected of a samurai. And Birnam Wood is not the usual set of tatty Babes in the Wood branches but a whole series of ambulatory trees. Throughout, the falling blossom also betokens time passing and the transitoriness of earthly things. Shirley Royal Court, London, 1 May 1986 There are echoes here of A Taste of Honey and a midweek telly soap opera. But what gives the play a distinctive tone is Ms Dunbar’s refusal to moralise about her characters: Shirley is seen as neither good nor bad but simply the product of a live-for-now culture. The play neither wags its finger nor buttonholes us with argument. But it is not hard to deduce from it a pretty scathing vision of modern urban life in which men and women see each other as instinctive enemies, relationships are defined by appetite, and escape routes are sought in glue-sniffing by the young and Malibu pineapples by the middle-aged. Romeo and Juliet Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 10 April 1986 As Benvolio arrives on a motorbike and Tybalt turns up in the Veronese square in a low-slung red sports car, it becomes impossible not to dub this the Alfa Romeo and Juliet. Michael Bogdanov has set the play unequivocally in Verona 1986. The result is hip, cool, clever and witty; a painless revitalisation of a play that, for my money, never lives up to its advance publicity as a great love-tragedy and that depends too much on the faulty postal service between Verona and Mantua. Pour un Oui Institut Francais, London, 20 January 1987 Nathalie Sarraute excavates, with a good deal of wit, the thoughts that lie between words and the capacity of lifelong relations to be ruined by a momentary inflexion or sudden pause. Read beforehand, the text seemed a bit flat. As played by Jean-Francois Balmer and Sami Frey with enormous emotional variety, it takes off. Mahabharata Zurich, 18 August 1987 “We’re going to spend the night together.” So Peter Brook roguishly told a thousand people gathered on Saturday in a large boathouse on the edge of Zurich’s famous lake. The occasion was the premiere of the English-language version of The Mahabharata. Our communal one-night stand began around eight o’clock on a warm summer’s evening. It ended sensationally 11 hours later with the revelation that the back wall of the boathouse was like a large movable blind, which was slowly lowered to reveal a dazzling morning sun. Even Nature now appears to be directed by Peter Brook. Uncle Vanya Vaudeville, London, 26 May 1988 Michael Gambon has inherited Ralph Richardson’s ability to exist in two dimensions at once. Half the time he seems to be living in a private dream: there is a magnificent moment when he is accused of being drunk and cries, “Possibly, possibly” in a voice so alien and remote it might be coming from a man under hypnosis. The Love of the Nightingale The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, 11 November 1988 This is virtually the last production we shall see at Stratford’s Other Place. It is no longer to be licensed as a theatre and we shall have to wait until the early 1990s for a purpose-built replacement. I once called it the most productive corrugated-iron hut in history, and it is amazing to think of the work that has poured out of it over the last 14 years. I can’t think how Broadway, let alone the RSC, will manage without it. Over the years, it has combined classical and modern work and Timberlake Wertenbaker’s oddly haunting, 100-minute fable looks like an attempt to combine the two. Hamlet Leicester Haymarket, 20 September 1989 It’s curtains for Yuri Lyubimov. To be more precise it is one curtain, designed by David Borowsky and apparently woven out of hemp, that is the undoubted star of the Lyubimov Hamlet, which has opened at the Leicester Haymarket before going on a world tour. This curtain can advance, retreat, spin on its axis and send characters hurtling into the grave in a way that evokes the nightmare despotism of Elsinore. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Barbican, London, 29 November 1991 Scene: a murky pub near the Barbican. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, two sides of the same critic, have just emerged from the first night of David Edgar’s RSC adaptation of RLS’s chilling novella. They compare notes over a vintage malt. Dr J: My dear Hyde, a capital evening was it not? Mr H: No sir, more like a capital offence … Moby Dick Piccadilly theatre, London, 19 March 1992 Moby Dick is the latest nail to be driven into the glittering coffin of the West End musical. Lacking logic, style, coherence or sense, it turns Melville’s great Dostoevskyan novel into a campy, vulgar schoolgirl spoof in which lines like, “Three years at sea and still no sign of Dick” signal the level of sophistication. Robert Longden’s concept itself poses a problem that his own production never begins to solve. The idea is that we are watching a black-suspendered, St Trinian’s-style school putting on a homemade version of Moby-Dick, which is a bit like the students of Narkover doing The Brothers Karamazov. Which Witch Piccadilly theatre, London, 24 October 1992 One of the West End theatre’s special torments is the religious musical. Over the years I recall such vintage horrors as Thomas and the King (with Queen Eleanor’s memorable cry of “Seize that monk!”), a rock Joan of Arc and Bernadette. To that select band we can now add Which Witch, which seems like Norway’s revenge for all those years of humiliation in the Eurovision song contest. Things start ominously with the Inquisition denouncing women for spiriting away men’s private parts and leaving them dangling over trees. We then find a Roman orphan, Maria Vittoria, being unhappily affianced to a German banker somewhat misleadingly named Anton Fugger. But, since Maria is already deeply in love with her Catholic confessor, Daniel, it’s a clear case of Fugger off. The Tempest Royal Shakespeare theatre, London, 13 August 1993 Adrian Noble’s biggest problem at the RSC has lain in finding new directors who could handle the main Stratford stage. But Sam Mendes makes the transition from the Swan to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with a confident, cohesive and strikingly beautiful production of The Tempest: it is the best debut at this daunting address since Noble’s own. The Piano Lesson Tricycle, London, 9 October 1993 August Wilson’s decade-by-decade portrait of African-American life reaches Pittsburgh in 1936 – and the key issue is a family’s battle for possession of a symbolic piano. For all the play’s faults, including prolixity and a final lurch into mystical melodrama, you have the feeling throughout the evening that something momentous is at stake. As in Ibsen or O’Neill, the past constantly informs the present. Old Times Birmingham Rep, 2 November 1993 “It’s a long way to the coffee table,” said the lady behind me. She had a point. Watching Harold Pinter’s tense, intimate three-hander, Old Times, in the big Birmingham Rep is a bit like seeing Godot in Madison Square Garden. But Bill Alexander’s new production is so beautifully cast and so alert to every nuance of Pinter’s power battle that we soon forget the wide open spaces of the fawn-carpeted circular stage. The Statement Watermans, London, 25 January 1994 Although passing tribute is paid to Ruth Rendell and Dorothy L Sayers, the spirit of Marguerite Duras hovers over Helene Pedneault’s The Statement: a six-year-old Quebecois play being presented by The Troupe, in Mark Ravina’s translation, at the Watermans. As so often in Duras, a murder becomes the occasion for an exploration of family relationships, and a certain patience is required before you get your dramatic reward. Maria Friedman Donmar Warehouse, London, 31 May 1994 The 85-year-old Elisabeth Welch was in the house the night I went to hear Maria Friedman – By Special Arrangement at the Donmar Warehouse. Fascinating to watch a cabaret legend gazing benevolently at a rising star. For Friedman undeniably has a vocal class, engaging candour and eclectic repertoire that puts her in the great tradition. The Schoolmistress Chichester Festival theatre, 8 July 1994 Pinero’s drawing-room dramas are highly revivable. His farces, however, strike me as arch and rickety. And they don’t come much archer than The Schoolmistress (1886), being revived at Chichester Festival Theatre with a fixed and deadly grin. Farce is partly about desperation, but here nothing vital seems at stake. Leave Taking National Theatre, London, 7 January 1995 There’s a shining truthfulness about the writing. In particular, Winsome Pinnock shows an extraordinary intuitive sympathy for two different generations. She understands the dilemma of both Enid and Mai, the Obeah woman, who have been deserted by their menfolk and have had to acquire a steely toughness to survive in a strange land. But, equally, she empathises with Viv and Del, who combine an English upbringing with “Caribbean souls” and who have to break free to discover who they really are. It’s a mature, heartbreaking play that deftly combines the specific problems confronting Jamaican families with the universal issue of mother-daughter relationships. Mojo Royal Court, London, 20 July 1995 Echoes abound: not only Mamet but Cagney gangster movies and even the recent work of Tarantino. But Jez Butterworth is playing a subtle double game. On the one hand, he himself is influenced by the mythic structures of American movies. On the other, he ironically punctures the way small-time Soho drifters, even in the 1950s, modelled themselves on transatlantic icons: they live in Macmillan’s drab England but they aspire to Mitchum and Mature and are openly derisive when one of their number invokes the wartime team spirit of his Uncle Tommy. Butterworth’s ability to write scintillating dialogue may, at the moment, outstrip anything he has to say. But he understands perfectly how language can be used to camouflage fear or boost ego. It Could Be Any One Of Us Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, 21 August 1996 It is a parody of the kind of thriller that used to be staple fare in the reps. Alan Ayckbourn makes amusing play with the cliches of the genre. But his real purpose, as so often, is to write a compassionate anatomy of failure. Indeed, his chief character is a half-shut private eye and deadbeat claims assessor (it is no accident that two of the characters are intending to see Double Indemnity) who could not solve a crossword puzzle. He, of course, decides to take charge of the investigation and, in Jon Strickland’s well-judged performance, he even dons a trenchcoat to quiz the suspects and spins on his heel to finger each of them in turn in the time-honoured tradition of the stock thriller. Art Wyndham’s theatre, London, 16 October 1996 When they hand out the acting awards, they are going to have to devise a hydra-headed statuette to cover the blistering performances of Ken Stott, Tom Courtenay and Albert Finney. Add Mark Thompson’s pristine, white-walled set and Gary Yershon’s score, and you have an evening that gives undeniable pleasure. But the real test is whether the play encourages audiences to embrace modern art or reject it. I have an uneasy feeling that Yasmina Reza’s play, for all its manifest cleverness, panders to popular prejudice. Playing With Fire Nottingham Playhouse, 3 May 1997 Good theatre often confirms one’s prejudices; great theatre radically alters one’s perceptions. And the remarkable thing about Luc Bondy’s brilliant modern-dress production of Playing With Fire, starring Emmanuelle Béart, is that it totally reinvents Strindberg. In its lightness, wit, eroticism and aestheticism, it resembles nothing so much as an Eric Rohmer movie. The Cherry Orchard Birmingham Rep, 29 May 1997 Watching an American adaptation of The Cherry Orchard set in the deep south, Noël Coward famously described it as A Month in the Wrong Country. No one could be so brutal about Janet Suzman’s equally radical version of Chekhov’s play – a co-production between Birmingham Rep and the Market Theatre, Johannesburg – which transposes the action to today’s South Africa. It is an intriguing experiment that throws some areas of the play into high relief, while obscuring others. Suzman never cracks one key problem. Chekhov’s play is a study of a society on the brink of change; in South Africa, the revolution has already happened. Caravan Bush theatre, London, 18 November 1997 What better way for the Bush to celebrate its 25-year existence than with a first play by a new writer? Caravan, by Helen Blakeman, yet another graduate of Birmingham University’s playwriting course, bulges with promise: not least because the action is shaped by character, public events and the holiday home that gives the play its title. The setting is a caravan park in North Wales: what we see is the steady disintegration of a Liverpool working-class family in the enforced intimacy of their hideaway. Haroun and the Sea of Stories Cottesloe, London, 3 October 1998 What makes a children’s classic? A mixture of adventure and allegory. Of adolescent excitement and adult myth. And the charm of Salman Rushdie’s Haroun and the Sea of Stories, beautifully staged by Tim Supple in an adaptation by him and David Tushingham, is that it works on so many levels. Behind its picturesque fable lies a passionate plea for imaginative freedom, symbolised on the first night by the author’s liberated presence on stage at the curtain call. Be My Baby Pleasance, London, 14 November 1998 Amanda Whittington’s Be My Baby poignantly pictures the painful predicament of institutionalised young mums. Set in 1965, it also reminds us of the stranglehold of official morality even in that supposedly libertarian decade. Whittington focuses on 19-year-old Mary, a pregnant middle-class girl deposited by her mum in the St Saviour’s home. Once the child is born, welfare services will place it with adoptive parents. But the real point is to show how, in the 60s, all classes treated extramarital pregnancy as a guilty secret and how even pop culture nourished the dream of holy wedlock with the perfect partner. One of the most touching scenes shows the girls in the home miming to the Dixie Cups’ insidiously catching hit Chapel of Love. Easy Virtue Chichester Festival theatre, 29 July 1999 Who does the young Noël Coward remind me of? In a strange way, John Osborne. Both were iconoclasts nostalgic for a world they attacked, both were headline celebrities with a private belief in the work ethic. And, for proof of Coward’s internal contradictions, you have only to see his 1924 play, Easy Virtue, given a rare and largely successful revival by Maria Aitken at Chichester. King Lear Royal Exchange, Manchester, 17 September 1999 Tom Courtenay is undeniably better at conveying the anguish of suffering than the arrogance of power; in that sense, he is more sinned against than Sinden. In the opening scene, played in what looks like a formal Renaissance court, one misses the “great rage” that should animate Lear. Courtenay establishes Lear’s shuffling, slow-speaking antiquity, but he reacts to Cordelia’s silence and Kent’s candour with a wry puzzlement rather than a tyrannical wrath. Even the fearful curses rained down on Goneril’s womb seem more rhetorical than heartfelt. The turning point comes with Lear’s great attack on superfluity: “O, reason not the need.” Suddenly, Courtenay’s voice acquires a pitiable desperation that pricks one’s tears and, as Lear declines into madness, so the actor grows steadily in stature. The Lion King Lyceum, London, 21 October 1999 The show’s undoubted appeal lies in Richard Hudson’s scenic design and the masks and puppetry of Julie Taymor and Michael Curry. Taymor, as director, is the organising visual spirit behind the show, and she produces a child’s garden of delights. But even here one notices how much she borrows from the international theatrical language. When the lions demonstrate grief over the death of their king, Mufasa, by producing ribbons of white silk from their eyes, the effect is pure Peter Brook. Taymor has shopped around shrewdly; but, as with the music, what we have is an artful synthesis of international styles rather than something African. Arcadia Chichester Festival theatre, 24 August 2000 Tom Stoppard’s play is many things: part satire, part detective story (who was the hermit who died in the grounds of Sidley Park?), part debate about determinism and free will, part celebration of ungovernable human curiosity in the face of the running down of the universe. The play is a fantastically ingenious construct, but it lacks a strong internal dynamic, and Peter Wood’s production, explanatory rather than emotional, makes you aware of the lack of narrative propulsion. The one genuinely moving moment comes when Thomasina’s tutor, responding to her lament over Caesar’s burning of the Alexandrian library, argues that whatever is historically lost is recovered in the long march of humanity. Faust Hanover Expo, 2 September 2000 “Time is short and art is long,” says Goethe’s Mephistopheles. He’s not kidding. Peter Stein’s historic, uncut staging of the two parts of Goethe’s Faust, currently playing in Hall 23 of the Hanover Expo, has just taken up 20 hours of my life. You can see it over six evenings or, as I did, during a marathon weekend: 3pm till 10pm on Saturday and 10am till 11pm on Sunday. The action is divided between two hangar-like arenas filled with portable steel seating: the audience constantly shuttles between the two spaces. The audience is certainly moved by Stein’s Faust: literally, for two days. But the ceaseless motion is not a device to distract us. It is a way of ensuring that, imaginatively, we share Faust’s exploratory, circular journey. The Circle Salisbury Playhouse, 12 October 2000 The danger is that this kind of play, written in 1919, elicits a stock response. It boasts french windows, a stately drawing room, Georgian furniture: all the things young dramatists have fought against. Study the play closely, however, and you see that Somerset Maugham is offering a waspish portrait of upper-class manners. The Accused Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, 6 December 2000 Jeffrey Archer, in the character of a doctor on trial for wife murder, was last night proclaimed guilty by a majority audience vote of 333 to 254. A more considered verdict might be that, as the play’s author, he is also culpable of taking West End theatre back about 50 years by creating a cardboard courtroom drama. Blasted Royal Court, London, 5 April 2001 Five years ago, I was rudely dismissive of Sarah Kane’s Blasted. Yet watching its revival last night I was overcome by its sombre power. So what has changed? The space, the design, the lighting, the cast and James Macdonald’s production are all radically different. But, above all, one sees the play through the perspective of Kane’s tragically short career and her obsession with love’s survival in a monstrously cruel world. Frozen Cottesloe, London, 4 July 2002 The force of Bryony Lavery’s play lies in its ability to change hearts and minds. It never mitigates the horror of child killing, but it makes us understand Agnetha’s argument that physical damage to the brain, rather than inborn evil, prompts serial murder. In an extraordinary scene, Nancy confronts Ralph in his cell and offers him a forgiveness far more fatal than a distant, cold-blooded revenge. I still think there are contradictions within Lavery’s argument: on one level she is out to prove the predictable banality of the killer, yet Agnetha describes Ralph as “mesmerising like a rattlesnake”. And, while showing Ralph as methodically calculating, Lavery brushes aside the idea of moral responsibility. But, in a world filled with tabloid hysteria, Lavery’s play comes across as a refreshing draught of sanity. Sanctuary Loft, Lyttelton, London, 31 July 2002 I admire Tanika Gupta for using the stage to rub our noses in global reality. There is a graphic description, for instance, of the killings in Rwanda and of the butchery of 3,000 Tutsis seeking sanctuary in a church. And Kabir feels he is haunted by Satan for having failed to protect his wife from a group of rapacious Indian soldiers. Gupta’s play may not always be fair, but it touches a nerve when it suggests that, in our snug little island, we are either ignorant of or indifferent to the world’s suffering. Mother’s Day Lyric Studio, London, 21 September 2002 Unironic optimism is a rare quality in modern drama. But Courttia Newland’s Mother’s Day, enthusiastically put across by the multicultural Post Office company, posits a Britain in which the nuclear family thrives, racial harmony is easily achieved and local councils act with enlightened beneficence. By the end, I was almost prepared to believe in Santa Claus. The Mob Orange Tree, London, 9 September 2003 The stock argument against John Galsworthy is that, in plays like Strife and Justice, he suffered from a neutralising impartiality. But here his passions are sufficiently aroused for him to allow his hero an unnerving Coriolanus-like contempt for the mob; and even though Galsworthy shows a measure of sympathy for More’s wife, whose brother is called to the front, he also suggests that she shamelessly uses sexual blackmail to break her husband’s militant pacifism. The Sugar Syndrome Royal Court, London, 21 October 2003 This first play by 22-year-old Lucy Prebble has many of the virtues – and some of the faults – you expect in early work. It tackles tricky subjects, such as paedophilia and teenage psychological disorders, with unselfconscious candour: at the same time, having outlawed instant moral judgment, Prebble can’t quite determine what to put in its place. Her purpose may be unclear but she has an instinctive playwright’s gift for grabbing your attention and compelling sympathy for damaged people. Hamlet Old Vic, London, 28 April 2004 Trevor Nunn’s boldest decision is to cast Ben Whishaw, in his early 20s, as Hamlet. With his hollow cheeks, spindly frame and nail-biting intensity, Whishaw makes a compelling figure. In his feigned madness, he reminded me of a scuttling, manic Danish Mr Bean. There are several moments, as when Hamlet tells Gertrude that at her age “the heyday in the blood is tame”, when Whishaw profitably reminds you of Hamlet’s callowness. But what this Hamlet lacks is irony, reflectiveness and any sense that he poses a real physical danger to Claudius. The History Boys Lyttelton, London, 19 May 2004 What is astonishing is how much territory Bennett manages to cover: the teaching and meaning of history, inflexible and imaginative approaches to education, and the idea, as in Forty Years On, that a school has the potential to be a metaphor for English life. It is no accident that the play is set in the 80s, when the arguments between beleaguered humanism and pragmatic functionalism were at the very height. The play is also blissfully funny, but behind the almost ceaseless laughter lies a hymn to the joys of language, intellectual exploration and inspirational educators. Don Carlos Crucible, Sheffield, 4 October 2004 The triumph of Michael Grandage’s production and Christopher Oram’s design lies in their visualisation of Schiller’s ideas. A swinging thurible, a prison-like court with high, barred windows, even the menacing hiss of the ladies-in-waiting’s fans all tell us that we are in a world of religious and political tyranny – a point underlined by Mike Poulton’s translation, where Philip announces: “The instrument God places in my hand is terror.” But Grandage also captures the subversive eruption of feeling in this crepuscular hell: at one point Richard Coyle’s neurotic Don Carlos beats against the court doors like a trapped animal, and his simultaneous passion for Posa and the queen implies a state of Hamletesque sexual confusion. Hedda Gabler Almeida, London, 17 March 2005 The character of Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler is infinitely various. In the past we’ve had melodramatic Heddas, neurasthenic Heddas, socially superior Heddas. But, in Richard Eyre’s fine new production, Eve Best gives us a dazzlingly ironic Hedda: one aware of life’s absurdity and viewing it with a mixture of dark humour and angry exasperation. You Never Can Tell Theatre Royal, Bath, 27 August 2005 I am staggered by our current indifference to Shaw: when, for instance, did the National Theatre last revive one of his plays? Peter Hall almost single-handedly keeps the Shavian flame alight; and his revival of this 1897 comedy captures perfectly its Mozartian ability to handle serious issues with an airy lightness and grace. A Right Royal Farce King’s Head, London, 2 August 2006 Last year Toby Young and Lloyd Evans wrote a mildly amusing farce, Who’s the Daddy?, about the shenanigans at the Spectator. Now they have tried to repeat the format with the royal family, and the result is an evening of desperation. Even to summarise the inane plot requires a heroic act of will … Young and Evans struck lucky with their Spectator skit, but this play suggests they don’t know their farce from their elbow. War Horse Olivier, London, 18 October 2007 Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris recreate the kaleidoscopic horror of war through bold imagery, including the remorseless advance of a manually operated tank, and through the line drawings of Rae Smith projected on to a suspended screen. Admittedly, the performers are somewhat eclipsed by the action, but Luke Treadaway, as the tenacious Albert, and Angus Wright, as the sympathetic captain, make their mark. The joy of the evening, however, lies in the skilled recreation of equine life and in its unshaken belief that mankind is ennobled by its love of the horse. The Brothers Size Young Vic, London, 14 November 2007 Tarell Alvin McCraney is a graduate of Yale School of Drama and what he has done in this study of two black Louisiana brothers is draw on “elements, icons and stories from the Yoruba cosmology”. In practice, this means that the action combines ritual and realism, and that the language takes the form of a heightened prose-poetry. Without doubting McCraney’s talent, I feel that the result is a conscious literary artefact. What I wouldn’t deny is that it comes thrillingly alive in performance. Glaspell Shorts Orange Tree, London, 9 April 2008 It was the deceptively named Trifles, written in 1916, that established Susan Glaspell’s reputation. Set on a remote farm where a murder has taken place, it shows female observation triumphing over male obtuseness. While an attorney and sheriff blunder around, their wives discover the real clue to the crime in an empty cage, a strangled songbird and a badly sewn quilt. With the deftest economy, Glaspell conjures up a world of solitude, despair and imprisonment where the women acknowledge their share of guilt. Fast Labour West Yorkshire Playhouse, 25 April 2008 The play reminds us of our own complicity in the migrant labour industry: as someone points out, the British want their last-minute iceberg lettuce in March without questioning how it got there. Steve Waters’ twin-focus technique allows the migrants to drop their fractured English, signalling a return to their native tongue, and exchange wickedly subversive thoughts about their inherited world. Her Naked Skin Olivier, London, 2 August 2008 Rebecca Lenkiweicz’s method is to start with a wide-angled shot and then gradually focus on intimate relationships. Film footage of Emily Davison’s sacrificial gesture at the 1913 Derby is followed by a sketch of male political intransigence over female suffrage. But Lenkiewicz’s real concern is to show how female militancy transcended class and sexual convention. Lady Celia Cain, trapped in a loveless marriage, is erotically drawn to Eve, a young suffragette machinist. Passion and politics coalesce as they pursue an intense affair, but the question Lenkiewicz obliquely raises is whether liberation is more easily achieved from a position of social privilege. Imagine This New London theatre, 20 November 2008 They said it couldn’t be done: a musical about the Warsaw ghetto. And, now that I’ve seen it, I know that they were right. If this show ultimately fails, it is not for want of trying, but because of the discrepancy between form and content. The romantic sentiment and uplift inherent in the musical sit uneasily with a story of not just heroic resistance but starvation, suffering and the death of more than 100,000 Polish Jews. Death and the King’s Horseman Olivier, London, 9 April 2009 Rufus Norris’s production, with the aid of Katrina Lindsay’s spectacular design, moves assuredly from the teeming world of a raffia-filled market to the play’s elemental conclusion. There are sterling performances from Nonso Anonzie as the horseman, Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as his son, and Claire Benedict as the market leader. One emerges dazzled but also disturbed by Soyinka’s ideas: in particular, the unfashionable notion that death can be seen as a triumphant entrance rather than a tragic exit. Funny Turns Hull Truck, 30 April 2009 In these recessive times, a new theatre is as rare as snow in June. And, in moving from an old converted backstreet Methodist church into a spanking new space in the town centre, Hull Truck has got itself a dazzler. What strikes me is the value for money of the £15m venue: it boasts a 440-seat main house, a 135-seat studio and wide public spaces that use glazed brick and steel. The wraparound stage has echoes of the former Spring Street building, and Funny Turns, written and directed by John Godber, shows his familiar optimistic championship of society’s underdogs. Even if it doesn’t have the instant mythic appeal of Bouncers and Up’n’Under, it displays a similar warmheartedness. It Felt Like a Kiss Hardman Square, Manchester, 3 July 2009 The last third of the evening is a total letdown. We find ourselves wandering through debris-filled rooms, entering desolate cells, even being pursued down darkened corridors by a masked man clutching a chainsaw. I guess the aim is to show how the American dream turned into a nightmare. But to do it through these fairground shock tactics is an insult to our intelligence. The cant critical word for this kind of thing is “scary”. But what is the point of simply making people jump out of their skins? The Black Album Cottesloe, London, 22 July 2009 Hanif Kureishi has turned his own vibrant 1995 novel into a play. The result is a busy, hectic affair that raises all kinds of issues about religious and political faith, fatwas and censorship and the purpose of art. But, as so often with adaptations, you get the bones without the thickness of texture that was part of the original’s charm. Category B Tricycle, London, 13 October 2009 The Tricycle certainly thinks big. After its trilogy about Afghanistan earlier in the year, it now comes up with an ambitious three-play season by black writers about the state of Britain. First out of the blocks is Roy Williams with a typically forceful play about prison life that manages to avoid most of the cliches that cling to the genre. Williams’ setting is a category-B jail: the kind that neither the screws nor the prisoners want to end up in. But what he brings out are the uncanny parallels between the institution’s rival power blocs. Behud (Beyond Belief) Belgrade, Coventry, 31 March 2010 You can see why Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti had to write this play. It is her response to the notorious events that in 2004 led to her play, Behzti, being withdrawn after mass Sikh protests outside, and even inside, Birmingham Rep. By recreating that traumatic episode in fictionalised form, Bhatti is clearly exorcising her demons and liberating her imagination. The new piece, however, is only intermittently successful as drama. The Man Finborough, London 1 Jun 2010 Theatre is different every night, but this new piece by James Graham, which forms the centrepiece of a Finborough festival offering 30 plays in 30 days, takes the idea of flux to Ayckbourn-style lengths. Four actors alternate in the role of Ben (I caught Samuel Barnett). The sequence of events also depends on receipts handed out to the audience as they enter; they are later reclaimed by Ben as he struggles to fill in a tax return and recall a year of London life. The idea of tax receipts as an index to existence is highly original. The Persians Brecon Beacons, 13 August 2010 This is site-specific theatre with a vengeance. High up in the Brecon Beacons, in a mock-up village used by the military as a training base, National Theatre Wales is recreating the oldest extant play in western drama: Aeschylus’s The Persians. The combination of the story and the setting, with the sun slowly disappearing over the hills, is overwhelming. We assemble in a square in this deserted military village where the four-strong male chorus is rejoicing in war and announcing: “No one can withstand this tsunami of the Persians in full rage.” We then march up a hill to sit in front of a four-storey house with the front cut away; and there we see, both in live action and on video, the tragedy enacted. There’s a wonderful moment when Atossa arrives in a white car to a blaze of trumpets. Onassis Novello, London, 13 October 2010 Martin Sherman has written not so much a play as a part, and it is one that Robert Lindsay fills to overflowing. But, as if to compensate for the emptiness of the dialogue, he is forced to lapse into an Anthony Quinn style of overacting that I’m tempted to dub Exorbitant the Greek. “Stillness always works,” Onassis remarks at one point, but you’d scarcely know it from the restless, larger-than-life performance filled with extravagant hand gestures that Lindsay feels obliged to give. He is a fine actor compelled, by the fundamental lack of drama, to put on a bit of a show. Racing Demon Crucible, Sheffield, 18 February 2011 David Hare’s play gets richer with time. Acclaimed in 1990 for its accurate portrait of a Church of England in crisis, it now seems a perfect metaphor for British institutional life. Presented as part of Sheffield’s three-play Hare season, it could be about the tensions inside any hierarchical organisation, from a political party to a national newspaper. What is impressive is Hare’s imaginative reach: his ability to see the virtues, as well as the flaws, in every character. Frankenstein Olivier, London, 24 February 2011 Benedict Cumberbatch’s Creature is unforgettable. “Tall as a pine tree,” as the text insists, he has humour as well as pathos: his naked entry into the world is marked by a totter on splayed feet and, when he moves, it is with a forward-thrusting, angular, almost Hulotesque curiosity. But there is also an epic grandeur about Cumberbatch. As he quotes Paradise Lost, his voice savours every syllable of Milton’s words and when, in outrage at his rejection by the exile’s family, he burns their cottage, he utters a Hamletesque cry of “I sweep to my revenge.” It is an astonishing performance. Miller’s strength, in contrast, lies in his menace. Stockier than Cumberbatch, his Creature makes you believe in the character’s satanic impulse and in his capacity for murder. truth and reconciliation Royal Court, London, 6 September 2011 Staged by debbie tucker green herself in the Theatre Upstairs, with the spectators sitting on hard chairs that replicate those endured by the characters, the piece is cryptic, fragmented, unsettling and well acted – especially by Wunmi Mosaku as the Rwandan widow, Petra Letang as the zealous Zimbabwean, and Clare Cathcart as a defiant Northern Irish mother. But, although the play raises the issue of whether truth and reconciliation can be compatible, it feels strangely incomplete. I wanted either to hear the piece again or attend a post-play discussion to learn whether the author’s political pessimism was justified. Stones in His Pockets Tricycle, London, 20 December 2011 Marie Jones’s witty conceit is to view the making of a piece of Hollywood-Irish hokum from the perspective of two County Kerry extras: the quintessentially optimistic Charlie and the more jaundiced Jake, lately returned from New York. What Jones does is to skilfully oppose life and art. In the movie, the high-born heroine romantically weds a local lad; in reality, Jake rejects the advances of the gushing American star who pretends to seduce him in order to appropriate his accent. And, while the film offers a rose-tinted vision of Irish life, the truth is that the land is being split up and Jake’s suicidal cousin is the latest victim of both rural decline and the national propensity to dream. Hay Fever Noël Coward theatre, London, 27 February 2012 Among the guests there is a peach of a performance from Jeremy Northam as the buttoned-up diplomat quivering with shy lust. His initial, embarrassed encounter with Amy Morgan’s taciturn flapper also proves that Coward, like Pinter, knew the comic value of extended pauses. And Phoebe Waller-Bridge makes something truly memorable of Judith’s daughter whom she plays as a gauche 19-year-old trying strenuously hard to be soigné and sophisticated. But that simply offers further proof that Coward’s 1924 comedy becomes even funnier when played, as in Davies’s fine revival, for its emotional veracity. The Radicalisation of Bradley Manning Cardiff High School, Wales, 19 April 2012 Tim Price gives us a vivid picture of Manning’s life and of the contradictory responses that he evokes. But what troubles me is the blurring of fact and fiction. I can easily believe that Manning would have been taught about Welsh radicals, from the Chartist John Frost to Aneurin Bevan. But, in one scene, Manning is asked to enact the role of the 23-year-old Dic Penderyn, who in 1831 led a Merthyr uprising and was publicly executed. Entering into the spirit of the part, the 13-year-old Manning denies that Penderyn was a martyr and says: “I just got caught and blamed for something I didn’t do.” Dramatic licence is here stretched to the utmost in that Price makes the schoolboy Manning utter sentiments that appear to prophesy his present predicament. London Road Olivier, London, 13 August 2012 Conventional musicals, even at their best, take us into a world of fantasy. This miraculously innovative show finds a new way of representing reality. Rufus Norris’s production and Katrina Lindsay’s design also deftly evoke the community’s transition from a period of terror to one of entrapment, symbolised by a maze of police incident tape, to restoration, as floral baskets descend from the Olivier ceiling. And an 11-strong ensemble play multiple characters – with Kate Fleetwood, Nick Holder and Nicola Sloane outstanding as leading lights in Neighbourhood Watch. A previous Blythe show about seaside sex workers, The Girlfriend Experience, smacked of condescension. But this one not only explores the way it takes a crisis to engender community spirit but opens up rich possibilities for musical theatre. My Life After Corn Exchange, Brighton, 27 May 2013 The Brighton festival’s theatre programme ended with this extraordinary import from Argentina in which five actors recalled, with the aid of photos, letters, home movies and old clothes, the lives of their parents. Conceived and directed by Lola Arias, the show offered a compelling mix of personal memories and – since the actors were all born around the time of the 1976-83 dictatorship – a mosaic of modern Argentinian history. I suspect Arias is an admirer of the Brazilian pioneer Augusto Boal, whose “theatre of the oppressed” dramatised communal issues. Here, the big question is how the actors either live up to the radicalism of a previous generation or, in one case, live down its collusion with dictatorship. Chimerica Almeida, London, 30 May 2013 “Chimerica” was a term coined by economist Niall Ferguson to indicate the global dominance of the dual country that is China and America. But Kirkwood’s play highlights the sharp differences, as well as the similarities, between the twin superpowers. In America, Joe’s bolshie individualism as a photographer who records world events is ultimately celebrated; in China, Zhang Lin, who has already suffered for his involvement in the Tiananmen protests, pays a heavy price for inciting unrest. Kirkwood goes further in examining the nature of capitalism in both countries. China may be open to western investment and apparently enthralled by its products; at the same time, Joe’s girlfriend, Tessa, in a brilliant presentation speech to her clients, explains that the only way into its markets is to understand that China is a country that values the supremacy of its culture. Handbagged Tricycle, London, 2 October 2013 Buffini’s brightest idea is to double the central roles. So we get an older and younger Queen, respectively known as Q and Liz. Equally, we get an older and younger Thatcher, identified as T and Mags. Add in two male actors playing 17 other roles, ranging from Kenneth Kaunda to Rupert Murdoch, and you have what sounds like a recipe for confusion. In fact, Buffini’s device gives the whole evening a buoyant, meta-theatrical playfulness. The older Q spends much of the play trying to hustle the action along in order to get to the interval. And the two Thatchers, while consistent in their detestation of socialism, often lapse into a good cop/bad cop routine that says a lot about the late PM’s contradictory techniques. Punishment Without Revenge Theatre Royal, Bath, 22 October 2013 This is the real deal: an unqualified masterpiece by Lope de Vega that, in Meredith Oakes’s excellent new translation, forms part of Bath’s Spanish Golden Age season. Since Lope’s 1631 play deals with the guilt-racked love between a young woman and her stepson, one is inevitably reminded of Euripides’s Hippolytus and Racine’s Phedre in its moral intricacy. However, Lope’s play is the equal of its twin rivals – and indeed, in some ways, far better. This is a multilayered play that touches on numerous themes, from the power of theatre to poisoned inheritances. It gets a first-rate production from Laurence Boswell, which is physically spare yet implies sumptuousness. Much of that is down to Mark Bailey’s sets and costumes, with their silver thrones and sable doublets. Ciphers Everyman theatre, Cheltenham, 23 October 2013 Even if Dawn King’s play is not as original as Foxfinder, it is clearly the work of a natural dramatist who knows how to generate suspense. Blanche McIntyre’s production and James Perkins’ design, based on sliding white screens, also have a pristine purity that contrasts neatly with the murkiness of a world in which human beings are disposable. Keenan doubles beautifully as both the enigmatic Justine and her upfront sister, and there is strong support from Jhutti as both a community worker and an adulterous artist, and from Bruce Alexander and Shereen Martin as figures who, in both sections of the plot, are pulling the strings. The result is an intelligent puzzle play in which, rather as in Macbeth, nothing is but what is not. Ellen Terry With Eileen Atkins Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, 21 January 2014 Actors are often the sharpest judges of Shakespeare: a point proved by Ellen Terry, who in 1910 started touring a series of informal lecture-demonstrations on Shakespeare’s characters. Eileen Atkins has now adapted them into a 75-minute show that offers the delirious pleasure of seeing one great actor inhabiting the mind and spirit of another. Atkins possesses not just an immaculate technique but an imagination that allows her effortlessly to transcend the limitations of age and gender. If the BBC does not instantly send a film crew to record this masterclass in the art of acting, I shall go and chain myself to the portals of Broadcasting House in protest. Twelfth Night Everyman, Liverpool, 13 March 2014 Adam Levy’s white-suited, self-dramatising Orsino repeats the play’s opening word, “If”, three times as a prelude to a visual coup introducing the shipwrecked Viola. As scholar Michael Dobson has pointed out, the whole play seems to take place within a conditional clause, asking “what if there were a country such as Illyria?” Gemma Bodinetz seizes on that idea to present us with a series of interlocking fantasies in which people lose their sense of self. There’s a telling moment when Jodie McNee’s disguised Viola, asked by Natalie Dew’s Olivia “What are you? What would you?”, looks totally flummoxed as if she herself is unsure. This May Hurt a Bit Octagon, Bolton, 27 March 2014 Since the NHS is never out of the headlines and directly affects most of us, our theatre has long been crying out for a new play on the subject. And, while Stella Feehily’s piece, co-produced by Out of Joint and the Octagon, is unapologetic agitprop on behalf of a beleaguered service, it makes its points most effectively when it captures the mix of care and chaos you find in wards up and down the country. Yellow Face The Shed, London, 12 May 2014 David Henry Hwang uses the satirical format to ask what it means to be classified by ethnicity, and also to invoke the xenophobic persecution of Chinese-Americans in the late 1990s. Behind the laughter, this is a probingly political play that tests the validity of Hwang’s optimistic assertion that “it doesn’t matter what someone looks like on the outside”. Alex Sims’s bracing production pursues its ideas with quickfire vigour. It’s a peach of a play, using theatre as a metaphor for life. Ballyturk Black Box, Galway, 21 July 2014 As so often in Enda Walsh’s plays, the main characters inhabit a hermetic world – almost a womb without a view. In this case, they are two men, simply identified as One and Two, who pass the time in speeded-up, silent-comedy rituals and speculating about daily life in an imagined Irish town called Ballyturk. But when the character Three turns up, he not only breaks up the partnership but invites one of the duo into the outer world, en route to inevitable extinction. It is not the last surprise Walsh springs, but it is as if Beckett’s Godot had unexpectedly materialised. The James Plays Festival theatre, Edinburgh, 11 August 2014 The main thing to say about Rona Munro’s plays is that, while telling us a lot about Scottish history from 1421 to 1488, they are also full of topical resonance. You see this especially in the opening play, The Key Will Keep the Lock. It shows James Stewart, after being kept a prisoner by the English for 18 years, finally assuming the Scottish throne that was rightfully his. As he does so, James McArdle’s wonderfully nervous king gives a speech to his aggressive nobles in which he pours scorn on England’s financial predatoriness and claims that a future Scotland “will be assaulted but it will never be broken”. It’s a good line that could easily be appropriated – and probably will be – by Alex Salmond. The Apple Family Plays Brighton Dome Corn Exchange, 5 May 2015 British drama tends to be driven by politics and American by relationships. That, at least, is what we assume. Such generalisations are blown apart by Richard Nelson’s extraordinary quartet of plays, which dominated the opening weekend of this year’s Brighton festival. Lasting close to seven hours in total, the plays use the crises within a single family to explore the larger confusions of liberal America. What is striking is how much ground Nelson covers: hope and disillusion, individual and collective memory, and the need to acknowledge the past without being possessed by it. The Trial Young Vic, London, 29 June 2015 Someone must have had it in for Michael B. He was dozing peacefully at home when a knock came at the door. Two men appeared, telling him he had to attend a new production of Kafka’s The Trial. “But I’ve done nothing wrong,” he protested. “I’ve seen Steven Berkoff’s version on stage. I’ve also seen a film directed by Orson Welles and another written by Harold Pinter.” He was forcefully told that was not enough. This time everything would be radically different. Watched by his guards, he arrived at the theatre to find a crowd excitedly milling around. To get to the auditorium people were led down long corridors and admitted through keyhole-shaped doors. Once inside, Michael B was seated on a judicial bench and at first astonished by what he saw. The Skriker Royal Exchange, Manchester, 6 July 2015 When Caryl Churchill’s collaborative fantasy was first seen in 1994, it was regarded as bafflingly obscure. Aspects of it remain difficult but, watching the magnetic Maxine Peake, it becomes clear that the play offers, among other things, a vision of climate catastrophe we can all understand. In some ways, Churchill’s play is like a darker version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in that it shows a collision between mortal and immortal worlds. The big difference is that Churchill’s skriker, a shape-shifting, ancient fairy, is chillingly visible, unlike Shakespeare’s Puck, to the two teenage girls whom she haunts and pursues. Medea Gate, London, 10 November 2015 Euripides’ Medea has achieved such mythical status it is subject to endless variations. But, where Rachel Cusk’s new version at the Almeida cheats us of the cathartic climax, this radical update by Kate Mulvany and Anne-Louise Sarks, that originated at the Belvoir Sydney, does not duck the story’s horror. Its big idea is to see the action from the perspective of the heroine’s two children and the effect is as startling as Tom Stoppard’s notion of viewing Hamlet from the vantage point of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Look Back in Anger Derby theatre, 9 March 2016 You may go expecting a museum piece. What is startling is that John Osborne’s play, intimately based on his experiences as a married actor at Derby rep – and now celebrating its 60th anniversary – survives due to its unremitting emotional intensity. Director Sarah Brigham has also had the wit to precede it with an hour-long mono-drama by Jane Wainwright that charts the reaction of a gutsy, modern working-class woman to life’s baffling disappointments. Osborne’s play was initially hailed as a vital social document. It says a lot about the class-ridden culture of mid-50s Britain and paints a still-resonant picture of a younger generation educated but with nowhere to go. However, what keeps the play alive is its scorching, Strindbergian portrait of a failing marriage. Long Day’s Journey Into Night Bristol Old Vic, 30 March 2016 Timing matters with Eugene O’Neill as much as it does in a Wagner opera. I suspect Richard Eyre is seeking to contrast the brisk allegro of the play’s opening with the long adagio of its tragic end where the four members of the Tyrone family confront the appalling truth. But too often the tempo is unvaried, so that we miss the almost comic pattern of accusation and retraction that afflicts all the characters. When James Tyrone, a celebrated actor who sold out to commercial success, recites Shakespeare and his tubercular son Edmund recites Baudelaire, we should also feel them dwelling on the consolations of poetry rather than rushing through the speeches as they do here. Doctor Faustus Duke of York’s theatre, 26 April 2016 The idea of media stardom as a trick of the light is now a truism, and Lloyd’s production is forced to work overtime to give it purchase. We get lashings of sex and violence as well as an awkward collision of the two when Faustus invokes Helen of Troy who appears in the shape of the adoring Wagner and whom he proceeds to stab and rape. The lead actor acquits himself well in the circumstances. Given that he is obliged to bare his buttocks and parade in bloodied boxer shorts, I was tempted to dub him “off-with-your-kit Harington”. But he is much more than a TV icon and, when the production allows him, he gives us a sense of Faustus’s flailing despair. Bitches Finborough, London, 18 August 2016 Bola Agbaje has written a number of very good plays about different aspects of cultural identity. She has now come up with a new piece for the National Youth Theatre about two female pals – black Funke and white Cleo – who dedicate their energies to a music-and-chat vlog, but who, off camera, reveal their deep divisions. In exposing the potential dangers of a faith in new technology and the transcendent power of video, Agbaje makes a shrewd point that absolves her from the charge of vlogging a dead horse. The Rover The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon, 16 September 2016 Even if Loveday Ingram allows no innuendo to go unstressed, she successfully steers us through Aphra Behn’s multiplying subplots and allows the action to grow, with the aid of Grant Olding’s fizzing score, out of a society in a permanent state of fiesta. Joseph Millson, making his entrance swinging on a rope like a Restoration Errol Flynn, plays Willmore excellently as a shameless rakehell whose sexual rapacity is offset by a boyish charm. You may not approve of him but you can’t help liking him. Barber Shop Chronicles Dorfman, London 8 June 2017 Bijan Sheibani’s exuberant production begins and ends with a party in which audience members dance with the cast or even go on stage for a quick trim. That seems entirely in keeping with the spirit of Inua Ellams’ invigorating play, which shows how barbers’ shops, run by and catering for African men, combine the roles of pub and political platform, social centre and soapbox. It makes the average white British male’s belief that you simply go in for a haircut look decidedly dreary. Julius Caesar Storyhouse, Chester, 26 June 2017 As the audience assembles in the foyer, pro-Caesar supporters emerge bearing banners saying: “Make Rome great again.” Although upbraided by the tribunes, the crowd noisily cheers as cameras record the arrival of their beloved leader. Celebrations continue in the auditorium, where the Lupercalian fertility festival is in full swing and Christopher Wright’s Caesar, to the accompaniment of rock music, poses for selfies and morphs from Donald Trump in Washington to Jeremy Corbyn at Glastonbury. Gangsta Granny Garrick, London, 2 August 2017 Ben, the 11-year-old hero, is a reverse Billy Elliot who has a covert wish to be a plumber and abhors his parents’ passion for ballroom dancing. Meanwhile, his lonely old gran, on whom he is deposited once a week, seems boring, smelly and flatulent but turns out to have a hidden life. It all makes for a lively show that prompts self-examination. When I asked my grandson on the way out if he found me smelly and boring, he had the wit to reply that at least I didn’t smell. Loot Park theatre, London, 24 August 2017 Michael Fentiman’s production constantly reminds us that Joe Orton’s shock tactics are a way of alerting us to the hypocrisy of a society in which greed, gain and lust are masked by religious piety and veneration for authority. You see this most clearly in the figure of Inspector Truscott, who, while posing as a man from the Metropolitan Water Board, turns out to be a corruptible sadist. Christopher Fulford plays him to perfection as a moustached suburbanite with a manic gleam. For Love or Money Viaduct, Halifax, 24 September 2017 Northern Broadsides have made a habit of giving European classics a Yorkshire setting. So it seems fitting that Barrie Rutter’s farewell, at least on home soil, to the company he founded should be a version by Blake Morrison of Alain-René Lesage’s Turcaret. Even if Morrison’s adaptation is unlikely to cause the offence that the original did in France in 1709, it remains a lively satire on capitalist corruption. Morrison shifts the action from Louis XIV’s Paris to a Yorkshire town in the 1920s, but the characters are still propelled by greed. Rose, a young war widow, milks a besotted bank manager, Algy, for all she can while herself being conned by a money-grubbing cousin. But loot is to this play what sex is to La Ronde, in that it forms an endless daisy chain. The Shadow Factory NST City, Southampton, 16 February 2018 Howard Brenton seeks to highlight the gulf between a bloody-minded British belief in liberty and the dictatorial necessities of wartime. Even the local engineer forced to execute Beaverbrook’s plans says: “I feel like I’m carpet-bombing my own town.” This leads Brenton into some strange ironies, whereby an aristo who readily hands over her stately home to the Spitfire design team emerges as more instinctively patriotic than the obdurate Dimmock. The play’s vitality, however, springs from its ability to show British resistance to any form of authoritarianism while keeping its roots firmly in Southampton life. The Last Ship Northern Stage, Newcastle, 22 March 2018 Having bombed on Broadway, this musical by Sting about the shipbuilding industry is being revived on its native soil with a new book by its director, Lorne Campbell. The only mystery is why the show ever premiered in the US in the first place. It is a deeply British musical that champions Tyneside life and leaves you in no doubt where it stands on Thatcherite economics. It was received, quite rightly, with full-throated acclaim by its Newcastle audience. Nine Night Dorfman, London, 1 May 2018 There’s a key moment in Natasha Gordon’s highly impressive debut play when Aunt Maggie leaves the nine-night funeral wake that is part of her Jamaican heritage to go home and watch EastEnders. “Big tings are gawn in the Queen Vic tonight,” she announces. For me, that neatly sums up Gordon’s theme – which is the ability to inhabit two cultures and to acknowledge one’s ancestral past while living fully in the present. Machinal Almeida, London, 12 June 2018 Sophie Treadwell’s writing is impressive for how much it leaves out. She doesn’t need to show us every detail of Helen’s honeymoon or home life to make us understand her sense of suffocation. While her dialogue is stylised, Treadwell uses the polyphonic possibilities of theatre to press home her point. From the outset, Helen seems surrounded by “the purgatory of noise”, whether it be the clack of office machinery, the clatter of garbage collectors or the drill that shreds her postnatal nerves. Sound has lately been reduced to an ominous hum in British theatre; in the expert hands of Ben and Max Ringham, it becomes a vital part of the play’s texture. The Watsons Chichester Festival theatre, 8 November 2018 I would seriously urge anyone planning to attend Laura Wade’s adaptation of Jane Austen’s unfinished novel, The Watsons, to stop reading now since one of the play’s many pleasures is its capacity to endlessly take us by surprise. We go in expecting a literary exercise and come out having seen a philosophical comedy. Sweat Donmar Warehouse, London, 20 December 2018 Lynn Nottage, as she showed in Intimate Apparel, has the capacity to dramatise work. In this breathtaking new play, she tackles the devastating impact of loss of work and of de-industrialisation on modern America. Based on extensive interviews with residents of the rustbelt town of Reading, Pennsylvania, it shows the anger and despair that helped fuel the election of Donald Trump. Our Lady of Kibeho Royal and Derngate, Northampton, 17 January 2019 Katori Hall’s virtue is that she puts a complete world on stage, one that embraces a cloistered college, a faith-hungry village and tribal hatred. James Dacre’s production rises to the challenge with the aid of a community ensemble, a Jonathan Fensom set that shows the sun-kissed landscape beyond the hermetic school, and an Orlando Gough score that blends a cappella singing with tingling accompaniments to the girls’ visions. La Reprise: Histoire(s) du Theatre (I) Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh, 4 August 2019 I loved this show for its clarity, compassion and curiosity. Director Milo Rau has something of the ability of Ken Loach to ask disturbing political questions, while extending the possibility of the medium in which he works. This show – which, among many others things, portrays the economic depression of a de-industrialised city and proves theatre is a form of inquiry – marks him out as a major talent. Mary Poppins Prince Edward theatre, London, 13 November 2019 I was rather grudging in my praise when I first saw this musical in 2004. Richard Eyre’s production, based on the PL Travers stories and the Disney movie and supplementing the Richard and Robert Sherman songs with new ones by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe, was more remarkable for its clinical efficiency than its pulsating joy. Either the show, which has enjoyed a long UK tour, has changed or I have: it now strikes me as rapturously pleasurable. Pippi Longstocking Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton, 19 December 2019 The virtue of the show is that it conveys the spirit of Astrid Lindgren’s books and suggests that Pippi belongs in the great line of rule-breakers from the medieval Till Eulenspiegel to Richmal Crompton’s William. I came out with a smile on my face, which is fortunate since this show marks the end of a chapter in my life as a critic and allowed me to exit stage left happily chuckling."

          "bodyText": "The train cuts west across Berlin and then veers north. Suburbs of pale stucco houses peter out into birch and pine forest. Beyond these is the Bruchland of the North German plain: sandy-soiled, marshy and latticed by canals. A few shaggy horses drink from troughs in silver fields. It’s early in the day and mist still rises from the ground. Next to me in the carriage are local teens, travelling between towns to pass their Saturday, and young couples visiting their families in the small villages north-west of the German capital. A cluster of literature buffs have clambered aboard too. We’re making the 90-minute journey to Neuruppin, the birthplace of 19th-century author Theodor Fontane, little-known to English readers but sometimes called the German Charles Dickens. Fontane was born on 30 December 1819 – 200 years ago this month – and the town has spent the year celebrating his bicentennial with events, tours, readings and walks. I first discovered Fontane for myself after moving to Berlin five years ago. I read translations of his famous novels – Effi Briest and The Stechlin – and was then transfixed by his enthralling non-fiction five-volume work, Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg (Rambles through Brandenburg state), which has never been translated. Fontane took inspiration from the English habit of documenting the minutiae of rural life, and published the Wanderungen between 1862 and 1889, to render his home region in the same style. In a country where 20th-century history weighs heavily, Fontane offers a long gaze on the landscape. Reading, I was transported to a time when the wilderness of the east became the centre of the Prussian empire, to when Berlin industrialised and the state of Brandenburg emptied as workers sought jobs in urban factories, a century after the same had started to happen in Britain. The natural world he described – with birch and alder stands in sandy soil and marshes so thick that cattle would become mired in mud – remains visible in traces today. I’m visiting Neuruppin to follow one of Fontane’s journeys, something I’ve done often in recent years, taking footpaths from his birthplace and along the shores of the lake, Ruppiner See, looking for a thread between his past and Germany’s present. He could hardly have imagined that his hometown would become known for him: as Fontanestadt (Fontane Town). Crowds disembark from the train and gather for local tours – Fontane’s old haunts are handily marked out for visitors – but I wander the town alone, setting a course for the lakeshore. Where he described the town bathed in summer warmth, I find cold December sun pouring over the cobbled streets. Calling Neuruppin pretty would be an understatement: rebuilt in neoclassical style following an enormous fire in 1787 (leaving it “like a loaf of bread of which only the heels remained”, wrote Fontane) the town is tidy, with wide streets and stately pastel townhouses. Miniature Christmas decorations hang from lamp posts, and a small farmers’ market occupies the central square. Still, the traces of the region’s more recent history linger: I head for the water, past the Apotheke above which Fontane was born, following Karl-Marx-Strasse and passing Friedrich-Engels Strasse – the town served as a garrison for Soviet troops from 1945 until the Wall fell. Fontane’s stories centred on the everyday: the details of the landscape and the lives of villagers, the intrigues of local counts and crown princes, the beauty of their castles. He wrote of picturesque villages tucked into woodlands, and fishermen gathered on the shores, trading stories of the Seven Years’ or Napoleonic wars. Now, a wellness spa named for Fontane rises from the water, cold Nordic wood and metal against the town’s Prussian houses. Luxury apartments are under construction next door. Beyond here, paved roads turn to sand and a forest track wanders off northward. The woods feel deserted. Fontane travelled often by boat; I decide to test the water with an icy swim. I’ve traced his boat journeys south of Berlin in much the same way and found lakeside villages still quiet despite the capital city on their doorsteps. The countryside here still manages to feel remote, unchanged. Lake Ruppin is still as Fontane described – sandy-bottomed and clear, under gentle slopes that seem at odds with the flat fields beyond. Swimming out into the cold, I can see the length of it – almost 10km end to end. Dressed and warm again, I walk a few more kilometres until the lake narrows to a canal. I reach a freshly paved road, signposted as a Fontane cycle route, and then arrive at another lake altogether: Molchowsee, lined with crumbling dachas and newly built mansions. Fontane said that despite its lack of mountains this land of lakes – the Ruppiner Schweiz (Ruppiner Switzerland) – is beautiful because of its wealth of clear waterways and vast forests. To the friendly and attentive eye, he wrote, this watery landscape could offer more than enough. The sun dips low on the horizon so I turn back toward the railway station. As I ride home to the city past the unchanged fields, surrounded by refreshed spa visitors and Berliners clutching their novels, I see a sparrow hawk hunting along a hedgerow and count baubles of mistletoe high among the trees. • Jessica J.

          "headline": "'They travel hours to see a doctor for a minute': India's mental health crisis",
          "bodyText": "On a sunny morning at Calcutta Pavlov Hospital, 600 people wait patiently in the outpatient department. For many, the journey to see a doctor started hours before sunrise, with some even travelling overnight to secure their place in line. Despite waiting for hours, most will spend just 90 seconds with the psychiatrist. One of the doctors on call, Dr Debananda Saha, expects to treat about 250 patients during his seven-hour shift at the government hospital. “These patients travel from very remote areas. They left home at two in the morning, just to talk to a doctor for one minute,” he says. “If I spent half an hour with each patient, I would not be able to see them all.” His workload is typical of most government hospitals in India and reflects the scale of the country’s mental healthcare crisis. As the number of people suffering from mental illnesses continues to rise, the “treatment gap” of medical professionals to tend them remains one of the largest in the world. The National Mental Health Survey, commissioned by the Indian government and carried out by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans), found that 150 million Indians (10.6% of adults) were suffering from a mental health disorder in 2016. A report by the World Health Organization in 2017 found there were fewer than two mental health professionals for every 100,000 people, drastically lower than the global average of nine. The crisis is expected to worsen, and many experts say it could have serious economic, social and cultural consequences. Between 2012-2030, WHO estimates that India’s mental health emergency will cost the economy more than $1tn in lost productivity (as measured in 2010 US dollars). “Right now, the people of this country are suffering,” says psychiatrist Dr Soumitra Pathare. “We need to get Indians healthy, so they can reach their full potential and the country can thrive. The economic loss is one thing, but the loss to humanity is worse.” He says a variety of factors are contributing to the treatment gap, including poorly trained staff as well as insufficient state resources for mental health. For patients like Karan Khan, this has meant a delay in diagnosis. In 2014, aged 28 and more than a decade after he had first experienced symptoms, Khan was diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder. His mother estimates the family visited more than 10 different doctors over several years looking for help, though no doctor could properly recognise his symptoms. “I kept taking him to the different hospitals,” she says. “Different doctors, trying to get help. Some would tell me ‘go here’, others would say ‘go there’. We were running in circles.” But while Khan eventually received care, so many patients in India do not. That’s because the treatment gap is worse in rural areas, where the majority of India’s 1.3 billion people live. Dr Shyam Ravilla is a psychiatrist with the Banyan, a mental health organisation that hosts pop-up clinics in rural areas. He typically sees up to 50 patients during a clinic. The quality of care he provides has to suffer, he admits, or he would have to turn people away. That’s partly because the nearest mental health facility is often out of reach. A 2014 Human Rights Watch report found 70% of India’s population lives in a rural area, where only 25% of the country’s health infrastructure is located. “If someone must travel to a government facility, that often requires taking time away from work,” says Dr Ravilla. “Then there’s transportation and food costs, accommodation, and the cost of the treatments, follow-up care and any medication. It’s not something the average Indian can afford.” While there is a public healthcare system in India, Dr Ravilla says many rural patients give up on care entirely or turn to private providers. Despite the challenges, there has been progress. Perhaps the most significant breakthrough came recently with the new Mental Healthcare Act in 2017. It mandates that every citizen has the right to adequate treatment and says insurance companies must cover mental health services. Experts agree that the government needs to increase funding and create incentives for doctors to work in rural areas, but many say it won’t be able to tackle the crisis alone. That’s why hundreds of groups around the country are experimenting with different ways to ease the burden on psychiatrists. A variety of NGOs such as Sangath in Goa, Mata Jai Kaur in Rajasthan and Anjali in Kolkata have started using lay counsellors and community health workers to reach underserved populations. Dr Nishanth Kn works with the Nimhans primary care psychiatry programme that uses video conference calls to train doctors in general psychiatry. Its goal is to reach physicians in rural areas who otherwise would have no access to training. “Even in the next several decades, India will never be able to train enough psychiatrists,” he says. “So we must find other innovative ways to address the treatment gap.”"

          "bodyText": "When I was a child, we always spent Christmas at my uncle’s. “Ogre” is a strong word, but everyone was scared of him. He had an insane number of rules. He would come to fetch us in his car – then insist we leave the dog behind in case he scratched the upholstery. It was never obvious when children were meant to speak and when they weren’t. If you chose the wrong time to go to the loo, you would get a 20-minute peroration on every 18th century print lining the stairs. I cannot tell you how uninterested I was in the window tax, which was another of his favourite subjects. There were tons of unspoken rules about nice stuff, such as where you could put a chair leg so it didn’t leave a dent in the rug, where you could put a drink down and which was the right cloth to clean the table with (it transpired, over a period of some years, that there was no right cloth; there was a tiny battery-powered vacuum cleaner for detritus, and a chamois for high shine). There was an electric carving knife that made everyone tense. There are just so many things that can go wrong between an unevenly shaped carcass and a vibrating serrated blade. He was my mother’s brother – my parents were separated – and disapproved very strongly of my father, which was fair, I guess, except that it meant we all had to pretend he had never existed, and definitely didn’t exist now. I never got the hang of that until I was an adult – constantly tripping myself up in the middle of a sentence. “I went to the cartoon cinema with my da … some man. Wait, not a man: a woman. Some strange woman took me to the cartoon cinema. Yes, it was great, we saw Bugs Bunny, thanks for asking.” Protocol was a big thing, but it was unguessable. Things you would think were posh – the Queen’s speech – were not posh, and my aunt had to sneak off and watch it on her own. Things you would think were not posh – putting on your cracker party hat and not taking it off, not ever, not until you got home – were mandatory. Once, he asked me if I wanted lemonade and I said: “No, thank you – it might make me fart,” and I thought this was the most courteous and intelligent answer ever, since a classy person would definitely think ahead, but then I saw my mother’s face, and it turned out that is not what a classy person would have done. Anyway, at some point in the late 80s, the tables were turned and everyone was coming to us. My sister and I were in our teens. We were maybe 10% more competent than your average teenage cook, but it would be a stretch to think we could manage the turkey, and I can’t remember whose idea that was. Probably mine. (I think my uncle came to our childhood home to eat 10 times in my whole life – and once to my first flat, when I made potted ham, and it was unbelievably disgusting, claggy and mealy, as if it had been chewed and then refrigerated. I offered him some bread, and he said: “Yes, that might help,” which was, again, fair.) Having guests always seemed to involve eating in a room we didn’t normally eat in, so we would spend the day moving a bed out of it, and a lifetime’s stash of the stuff that collects behind stuff. Then we would move a table in and cover it with a sheet because we weren’t oversupplied with tablecloths. And then we’d stand back and stare at it for hours: does that look like a dining table? Or a really uncomfortable bed? Is any of this in any way posh? So that was the drill this Christmas, and all this time the turkey was in the oven, sort of cooking. It definitely didn’t go in early enough, but the main problem was that the door wouldn’t close. For some reason, I thought this would be fine. That’s the most common argument I have now with my kids; me going: “It’ll be fine,” and them going: “NO, IT WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE FINE.” The atmosphere was like a montage scene of the Tudor servants of a remote lord getting ready for the king to arrive, except those people would have known what they were doing with suet, and we were just acting nervous and a bit hysterical. And it was all absolutely fine. We had enough chairs, we had enough drinks. We’d got all the right stuff – we had smoked salmon, a stilton in a truckle, and nobody had gone off-piste and innovated. It was a bit stiff, but it was nothing like as boring as it normally was. There really wasn’t a hitch, except when we got the turkey out, and it wasn’t cooked at all. You have to understand how incredibly regimented Christmas Day was: the salmon was always at the same time, there was always a walk afterwards, the lunch was always after the walk, the presents were always after that. Any spontaneous change to the order of events would have been more than an act of aggression; it just wouldn’t have computed. It couldn’t have happened because it had never happened. There was no way the turkey could have just spent longer in the oven, never mind the three more hours it needed in a much bigger oven. It was like an anxiety dream where you have murdered someone, but forgotten to bury them: I was trying to carve it at the table, without anybody noticing the blood. I went round the bird’s extremities, finding modest portions of the least dangerous meat, and distributed them in order of my favourites, although also on a family-hold-back principle, so I think my cousin’s wife did OK and my sister got potato. The stuffing I took out and fried, while pretending to make gravy that I think my mother had already made. Luckily, the dining room was nowhere near the kitchen because it was actually a bedroom. My uncle was absolutely fine. It’s possible his eyesight wasn’t great. He was much more benign off his own turf, and did a lot of nodding and smiling. Who knows, he might have had a thing or two to say when he got home. Plainly, nobody died, otherwise I would have adopted a different tone to describe all this. Formality has so much power: the most formal person sets the rules and everyone tries like crazy to meet and anticipate them, like sheep trying to avoid a fence that isn’t really electrified. A lot of its heft is in the things it leaves unsaid, which become immune to verbal challenge. Then you get the point where the potential downside is that you kill someone you are related to, and you sail straight past that point, to maintain the fiction that you can do formal as well as the next man. Reflecting on the event afterwards, I thought: in future, I’m not going to do those kind of manners any more. I’m going to do a rigorous separation between the stuff that hurts people’s feelings, and the stuff that dresses up as courtesy but is actually a set of class-based mechanisms of domination and control. I also learned that it’s harder to give people salmonella than you may think."

          "bodyText": "Ex-WWE wrestler John Cena stars in this pretty ropey piece of mainstream nontertainment, about Jake “Supe” Carson, lovable but uptight, who runs a crew of dedicated firefighters in California called “smoke jumpers” who ’copter into remote terrain to tackle any blaze. His goofy comrades are Mark (Keegan-Michael Key), Rodrigo (John Leguizamo) and Axe (Tyler Mane). Things go sideways when Supe and the gang rescue a bunch of unattended kids from a burning house: mouthy teen Brynn (Brianna Hildebrand), kid brother Will (Christian Convery) and baby sister Zoey (Finley Rose Slater). Then he and his bros have to look after them back at their man-cave fire station until their parents arrive. The kids sweetly cause anarchy, letting off hoses etc, and clueless bachelor Supe figures they need some maternal authority, so he calls in local naturalist Dr Amy Hicks (Judy Greer) with whom he is shyly in love. The whole thing is shot and lit in that dull flat way that is mandatory for Hollywood family comedies, and the script is mainly dull, though I concede Key has some nice lines as he gets cross with Brynn’s sarcastic attitude (although for a wised-up teenager, she doesn’t comment on the cause of all these forest fires they’re tackling). And, considering it’s a vanilla family film, Cena is required to take his shirt off pretty much every five minutes, revealing his bulging and borderline-grotesque torso with veins the size of snakes squiggling up and down his forearms. As they used to say in Mad magazine: yecch. • Playing With Fire is released in the UK on 26 December and in Australia on 1 January."

          "bodyText": "When the French entrepreneur Jacques Mouflier visited the remote Alpine village of Val d’Isère in 1935, he saw the future before him. “A miracle is going to happen,” Mouflier told his young son, as he gestured towards the mountains encircling the village. “Ski champions from every country will come to compete where we’re standing right now.” He was right. In 1948 Val d’Isère produced France’s first Olympic ski champion, and ever since, professional athletes have flocked to the village, which sits 1,850 metres above sea level, to train and compete. They are joined by tens of thousands of amateurs. Last year the resort sold 1.3m ski “days” to tourists, and more Britons visit Val d’Isère each year than any other ski resort in the world. For a long time, the source of Val d’Isère’s enduring attraction – aside from its almost oppressively picturesque surroundings, five-star hotels and 300km of pistes, each one as groomed as a Surrey garden – has been that it is, in the parlance of the skiing industry, “snow certain”. Year in and year out, the arrival of the first snowfall, in mid-November, was as reliable as a Swiss watch. In 1955, when the resort began hosting an annual ski competition called the Critérium de la Première Neige (“the competition of the first snow”), its organisers boasted that Val d’Isère was the only French resort able to guarantee snow throughout December. Villagers claim to be able to predict the year’s coming snowfall by the berries on the local rowan trees. Plump clumps in summer promise deep snow in winter. For decades, the branches drooped under the berries’ weight. But in the mid-1980s, locals began to notice a change. The date of the first snowfall began to drift later. Patches of bare ground appeared on slopes that, in previous years, had been covered in an uninterrupted white drift. Some ski seasons would have an abundance of snow; others, a scarcity. More consistent was the retreat of the Pissaillas glacier, whose run-off water feeds the surrounding forests; each year it withdrew a little farther up the Pointe du Montet mountain, which dominates the jagged horizon. By 2014, snow was arriving so late to Val d’Isère that, for the first time in its history, the Critérium de la Première Neige was relocated, to a more snow-reliable resort in Sweden. For reasons scientists don’t fully understand, the Alps are warming faster than the global average. The 1.4C rise in the average global temperature since the end of the 19th century has translated into a 2C rise in the Alps. In the past hundred years, the number of hours that sunshine hits the mountains each year has increased by 20%. The heat and light cause snow to melt, or not to fall at all. In 2017 the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research recorded that less snow fell in the Alps during the winter months than in any year since 1874. In April a report by the European Geosciences Union showed that 90% of glacier volume in the Alps – an essential source of drinking water, crop irrigation and ski runs – could be lost by the end of this century. For the Alpine ski industry, which hosts 35% of the world’s ski resorts across eight countries, and serves an estimated 120 million tourists each year, this is potentially an extinction-level event. Val d’Isère is one of the mountain range’s highest resorts, so it will be one of the last to feel the full effects of the climate catastrophe. But farther down the mountains, the disappearance of snow has already begun to devastate the ski industry, as well as the communities that rely on it. Since 1960, the average snow season has shortened by 38 days, while “seasonal drift” has pushed the coldest weather from December to the early months of the year, throwing the ski season out of sync with the lucrative Christmas holidays. In November 2017 the EU launched the Prosnow project, whereby scientists advise Alpine resorts on how to “maintain the same season duration with 30% less snow”. Such efforts have not been entirely successful. According to some reports, as many as 200 ski resorts now stand abandoned across the Alps, where bankrupt hotels have been left unoccupied, and forsaken ski lifts dangle in the wind. The disaster encroaching on Val d’Isère has been obvious to Olivier Simonin, the director of tourism at the resort, since the infamous 2006-7 season, when a scarcity of snow caused a 7% decline in revenues across Alpine resorts. This September, for the first time, the French ski industry’s main union, Domaines Skiables de France, held an emergency meeting of directors from France’s most important resorts to discuss the existential challenges they face. Twenty-five directors attended the meeting, which was held in the valley of Chambéry. The mood, according to Simonin, was sombre. “This is now the main topic of conversation among us,” said Simonin. “Nobody wants to die.” Unlike the islanders of Kiribati, whose homes will be swallowed by the Pacific Ocean in the coming years, or the farmers of rural Bangladesh, whose crops fail whenever their fields are flooded by saltwater, the Alpine ski industry, which turns over billions of euros every year, is disproportionately well-equipped to fight for its survival. And resorts like Val d’Isère have invested tens of millions of euros in the most straightforward solution imaginable: when the snow stops falling, it’s time to make your own. * * * “You need four things to make snow,” Pierre Mattis told me in September as we toured the control centre of the snow-making operation he runs in Val d’Isère. “Water, air, cold and talent.” One morning in 1995, Mattis, who was then a 28-year-old ski-lift engineer, was told he was being redeployed to look after the resort’s handful of snow machines. Four years later, he began building his snow-making factory, or atelier neige, installing a 70km network of pipes beneath the mountain that now, after years of expansion and improvement, can cover 65 sq km of slopes in artificial snow at the touch of a button. It is one of the most sophisticated snow-making operations in the world. The first snow-making machines in Europe appeared in Italy in the early 1980s, just before the locals in Val d’Isère began to notice the seasons shifting. (In 1963 snow-making equipment was installed at Mar Lodge in Scotland, but the project was abandoned after two seasons as the water kept freezing.) As winters with unreliable snow became more common in the Alps, so did the machines. Most were based on a design by a Pennsylvanian man named Herman K Dupré, who in 1968 had fitted a water sprinkler to an air compressor system he bought at a scrapyard. Dupré pumped the air and water at high pressure through a lance-like nozzle to create a fine spray that, at sufficiently low temperatures, turned to snow before it hit the ground. The HKD snowmaking system, as Dupré named his invention, became the industry standard. The first one arrived in Val d’Isère not long before the snow-scarce winter of 1986. Warm winters had occurred before the mid-1980s, Robert Steiger, an economist and tourism researcher at the University of Innsbruck, told me, “but at that time Alpine communities had not been so dependent on ski tourism.” Today, 95% of Italian, 70% of Austrian, 65% of French and half of Swiss ski resorts are reliant on snow machines for their continued survival, according to estimates from Claus Dangel, CEO of Bächler, a snow-machine maker that supplies more than 200 resorts across the Alps. It takes an awful lot of technology, water and energy to manufacture the amount of snow that might have naturally blanketed the Alps two or three generations ago. Mattis’s control centre in Val d’Isère is housed in a cavern chiselled into the mountainside, like the bunker of a Bond villain. It is large enough to house some 40 double-decker buses, and home to six 10ft tall pumps, water filters, and a phalanx of computer screens – all maintained by Mattis’s 12-member “snow team”. Using software developed in-house, the team controls a vast network of snow machines via a bank of 10 computers. Like the timer on a boiler, the software allows the team to set “on” and “off” periods for the snow machines, ensuring a consistent covering of snow throughout the season. Forecasts fed into the bunker from weather stations on the mountains help the team to adjust their schedules. During the ski season, three people monitor the system throughout the night, like security guards watching over a bank vault. They check the correct positions of the cannons in relation to the prevailing wind, watch the quality of snow, and ensure that the pump rooms are working satisfactorily. If a patch of ground appears in the melting snow, they can cover it before sunrise. The snow is shot on to the mountains at a speed of 250km/h via 650 snow cannons. Ten years ago the cannons could be spaced 80 metres apart from one another and still create an unbroken blanket of snow, but climate change has since forced Mattis to cut that distance in half. The system has to be continually upgraded to keep pace with the effects of climate change. The current iteration was completed in 2014 at a cost of €2m, and can produce 8,000 cubic metres of snow per hour – eight times the capacity of five years ago. The plant is one of the largest in the Alps, and differs from most of its rivals in that all of the equipment (bar HKD’s nozzles, which are imported from Quebec) was designed in-house. Mattis claims his system is unique as it allows the team to control the density of the snow on a sliding 10-point scale, enabling him to create a more compact, “faster” snow, ideal for professional competitions. This technology comes at a major financial and ecological cost. Today, one in every 20 euros spent anywhere in Val d’Isère goes into the snow factory, covering energy costs, staffing, maintenance and upgrades (a hidden “artificial snow” tax that is continually increasing). Although snow machines are becoming increasingly efficient, a typical snowmaker still uses about the same amount of energy as a boiler in a family home. When multiplied into the tens of thousands across the Alps, snowmakers become something of a self-defeating invention: they worsen and sustain the climate problems they’re supposed to solve. And yet, for life in the Alps as we’ve come to know it, they remain essential. Steiger’s most recent simulations suggest that unless every ski resort in the Alps installs state-of-the-art snowmaking facilities like the ones Mattis operates at Val d’Isère, by the 2050s up to half will no longer be able to sustain their businesses. Only the wealthiest resorts, like Val d’Isère – where chalets can sell for more than €23,000 per sq metre, five times the average cost of property in London’s most expensive borough, Kensington and Chelsea – are able to make the necessary investments to continually update and retool their snow-making facilities. Less-moneyed resorts rely on a cheaper source – snow farming, whereby snow is gathered or made in January and February, when manufacturing snow costs less than in warmer months. The snow is then placed under a 40cm layer of wood chippings, which absorb and release moisture and keep the snow cool, compact and manageable during the summer months. The wood chippings are then removed at the end of October, allowing the snow to be deployed on the slopes in time for the skiing season. Artificial snow, be it farmed or sprayed, is not only the would-be saviour of the ski industry, however. This is a region where, as the International Commission for the Protection of the Alps, Cipra, puts it, “there is an urgent need for innovative ideas and solutions”. One Dutch professor believes artificial snow may also hold the key to saving glaciers, in the Alps and beyond – along with the communities that rely on them for their food and water. * * * On the morning of 11 July 2000, after a night of unexpectedly heavy summer snow, Hans Oerlemans went to check his weather station on the Morteratsch glacier, near the village of Pontresina, Switzerland, 400km north-east of Val d’Isère. The Morteratsch is one of the largest glaciers in the Alps, and a popular attraction for sightseers and thrill-seekers, many of whom come to ski along its 6km back. Since 1860, though, the glacier has shrunk by 2.5km – an average of nearly 16 metres per year. Oerlemans believes lessons learned by studying the Morteratsch can aid anyone interested in saving snow and ice across the Alps. A Dutchman who grew up in Utrecht, Oerlemans is tall and handsome, and wears the thin-rimmed glasses of a Hollywood therapist (studiously removing them for photographs). He has been studying glaciers since 1980, when he earned his PhD from Utrecht University, where he is an emeritus professor. His weather station on the Morteratsch, which he personally built in 1995, was one of the first in the world designed to measure the effects of climate change on glaciers. By monitoring the Morteratsch’s vital signs – fluctuations in the depth and temperature of its ice, as well as the ambient humidity – he hoped to solve a number of basic, yet unanswered, questions. “If the climate becomes one degree warmer,” he told me recently, “what happens close to the surface of a glacier: do you have 1 metre more of ice melt, or 10cm, or 10 metres? Nobody knew.” When Oerlemans crested the mountain that overlooks the Morteratsch that July morning two decades ago, he expected to see the glacier in its state of typical summer resplendence – a great frozen river, flowing in imperceptible slow-mo down the mountain. Instead, he saw nothing but snow, covering the glacier in a half-metre-deep drift. In the weeks that followed, he noticed something even more surprising in the weather station readings: the glacier’s thaw had halted almost entirely. Two processes melt ice: the transfer of heat from warm air, and solar radiation from the sun. Oerlemans’s readings suggested that the latter had a much greater effect than scientists previously understood. The covering of snow from the unseasonable summer storm had apparently acted as a reflective shield, fending off enough solar radiation that it was equivalent to dropping the air temperature by a full degree. He wrote up his findings in a paper published in 2004 by the International Glaciological Society. Then, for a while, he put what happened to the back of his mind. This autumn, as Oerlemans and I took a bobbing cable car up to a viewing station overlooking the glacier and mountain-top restaurant – home to “probably the most expensive plate of spaghetti in Europe,” he said – he explained what happened next. About five years after his paper was published, the villagers in Pontresina learned about an experiment in which polyester fleece has been used to cover snow to preserve it during warm weather. They laid the fleece on to the glacier in two-metre wide strips, like a blanket shorn from a massive sheep. “They put it out in the middle of May, and covered the ice till September,” he said. Not only did the fleece blanket stall the effects of melting, it actually reversed them: measurements showed that, over the course of the summer, ice in some of the areas under the fleece grew in thickness by up to two metres. When news of this ice reversal reached Oerlemans, he immediately thought of the weather station reports following the heavy snow drift in July 2000. If it were possible to cover a glacier in a protective barrier during the spring and summer months, might this counteract a century of decline? “The scale is totally different,” Oerlemans recalled. “You could not use fleece on a glacier the size of the Morteratsch, which moves, because it will be destroyed quickly. But, I thought: it might just be possible to use artificial snow.” To test the theory, in the summer of 2017 Oerlemans and his team sprayed a 2.5 metre-deep blanket of artificial snow over a small section of the Diavolezzafirn glacier, one of the Morteratsch’s diminutive neighbours. The experiment, which ran to the autumn, was successful: further melting was prevented, and in some places the ice even grew. With positive results in hand, Oerlemans and his collaborators began to consider the much greater challenge of how to blast a sufficient amount of artificial snow over the much larger expanse of the Morteratsch. Snow cannons such as those installed in Val d’Isère could not be placed on to the glacier, as they would be caught in the slow-moving current of the ice and torn from their pipes. Instead, Oerlemans and his colleague Felix Keller considered using a cable car equipped with a snow machine to travel above the glacier, dropping artificial snow as it went. (Oerlemans and Keller’s partnership is not short on creative thinking – the pair also play in a two-piece tango band called Tango Glaciar and often splice musical performances into their lectures on glacial retreat; once they even performed on a glacier, which one onlooker drolly likened to the musicians on the Titanic stubbornly playing while the ship sank.) This idea stalled when it came to supplying a moving cable car with the necessary water to make the snow. Finally, in a eureka moment, the team settled on an ingenious invention: a “snow rope”, stretched in a zigzag pattern across the width of the glacier, hundreds of feet across. Acting like a sprinkler system, the rope could deposit snow from altitude while the glacier trundled conveyor belt-like beneath it. After two years of preparatory studies, finding willing engineering partners and filing patents, on 1 October 2019 Oerleman received a 2m Swiss franc grant from the Swiss Innovation Agency to begin work on his extravagant snow blanket scheme. “We have passed the point of no return,” Oerlemans told me. “It’s no longer just theory; it’s happening.” * * * On a warm morning this past summer, I hiked with Hans Oerlemans along a dirt path from the village of Pontresina up to the Morteratsch glacier. Perhaps to convince sceptical visitors of the scale of the Morteratsch’s retreat, the village council had erected 2.5 metre-tall markers along the path to show how far downhill the tip of the glacier stretched in certain years. With an accumulating sense of dread, we walked from the marker for 1865, which sits close to a car park at the base of the mountain, and past the ones for 1940, 1960, 1980. The farther we walked, the farther away the next marker was – the glacier’s retreat was accelerating over the decades. The effect was like trekking along a countdown to the oblivion of the glacier, or perhaps even our own. Along the steep-sided valley carved out by the glacier over millennia, the cliff walls most recently vacated by the shrinking floe are packed with “dead ice”, a dark grey substance that looks like granite. Dead ice poses a major threat to sightseers because it can cause massive rock falls; last summer a boy ignored a set of warning signs and wandered less than 50 metres from the main tourist path. He was crushed to death by a falling boulder. The villagers of Pontresina are distressed by the likely effects of the erosion of the ice on the village’s tourist economy, Oerlemans told me. But not everyone is convinced that his snow-blanket scheme is the best use of 2m francs. “I am sceptical of the entire project,” an employee from the local council said. “It’s such a huge amount of money, and it’s not clear what effect it will have.” Even if the scheme meets expectations, there is a sense that the funding behind the glacier-saving technology has essentially been awarded to prop up the skiing industry, the recreational embodiment of extreme privilege – just like the artificial snow operation in Val d’Isère. Oerlemans and his team argue, however, that if the wealthy ski resorts of the Alps can facilitate the development of these technologies, they will have a knock-on effect in the coming years, enabling poorer communities around the world to benefit from these advances. The professors’ snow rope system may provide a solution, ensuring the survival, not only of expensive tourist resorts, but also farming communities, such as those in India and Tibet, whose crops are reliant on glacial water. “There are 230,000 glaciers in the world, and it’s unthinkable that you could use our technique on a scale that would, for instance, stop glaciers from contributing to sea-level rise,” says Oerlemans. “But at a local level it could prove invaluable for local economies that depend on melt water from glaciers for their survival.” That technologies developed for the rich will one day help the poor is a familiar refrain among tech idealists – and a dubious one. “Assuming that western technologies can be easily implemented in developing countries is a bit naive,” said Robert Steiger, from the University of Innsbruck. “Poor regions in poor countries lack the institutional background that is required to implement new technologies and, even more importantly, to provide the knowledge and money to maintain this technology.” Besides, Claus Dangel, the CEO of the snow machine company Bächler, which is currently developing Oerlemans’ snow sprinkler, estimates that the company needs an additional 3.5m Swiss francs to fully develop the system – far more investment than is provided by the Swiss Innovation Agency grant. Dangel’s hope is to make the system as low-energy as possible, perhaps by using gravity to feed the sprinkler system from lakes high in the mountains, above the snow rope. “We want it to work without using energy,” he told me. “But this is very complicated because you need high water pressure, and the system will probably need to be heated in one way or another, to prevent it from freezing.” In the long term, it seems unlikely that artificial snow will save even the wealthy Alpine ski industry. Resorts are beginning to consider how they might make more fundamental changes to their businesses in order to adapt to, rather than stave off, the effects of the climate crisis. For many resorts, this means reorienting themselves around non-skiing activities: hiking, mountain bike-riding, nature-watching, sightseeing. “We can see what is coming for us,” said Olivier Simonin, the director of the resort at Val d’Isère. “There will need to be a complete change.” By 2050 Simonin hopes that 30% of the resort’s income will be derived from activities other than skiing. The number of tourists visiting the Alps during the summer is already increasing year on year, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature. Changes in climate are being matched by changes in what visitors, especially millennials, are looking for. But hiking and other summer activities are less profitable than skiing, so although tourism may endure, the stratospheric revenues of the heavy snow decades may not. “We may have a bit more time compared to others but, then again, we are a big resort,” Simonin said of Val d’Isère. “We have a greater economic challenge in order to maintain our current levels of profit.” For a few moments Simonin held his head in his hands. “It will require solidarity between the villagers, the resorts, the hotels,” he said, finally. “But people who live in the mountains are hardy. We are used to having to adapt.” Perhaps, he wondered, with a note of surprise at what appeared to be a fresh afterthought, whether in 50 years, people might come to Val d’Isère, not to ski but simply to see snow – human-made or otherwise – precisely because of its scarcity. With a dry laugh, he added, “Maybe the mere sight of snow will become a privilege.” • This article was amended on 20 December 2019.

Chronic water shortages could have a deadly effect on remote Aboriginal communities over summer, where hundreds rely on live-saving kidney treatment. A single dialysis treatment for renal failure requires 600 litres of clean, cold water – something increasingly in short supply as central and northern Australia endure another heatwave. “People are getting worried for their lives,” says Dadu Corey, an Alice Springs elder. At least nine communities are running out of water, with the Northern Territory’s Power and Water Corporation reporting that most of the 72 communities in the arid region are “faced with some level of water stress”. Sydney is bracing for extreme temperatures with forecasts of 44C in store in Penrith, with volatile winds posing an “enormous challenge” for firefighters across NSW. “We’re going to have a number of wind fronts escalating the fuel, the fires burning, and the potential to have spot fires and embers travelling very long distances,” Gladys Berejiklian confirmed.

Getting older, especially crossing into your 30s and beyond, means forgoing all that intimacy and connection, at least with people outside your family or your marriage. Data supports this but even if your close friendships get fewer they also get more resilient: “There is a lot of elasticity in these relationships. They can stretch, occasionally go slack, sadly, but often they snap back better than you might think.” It’s a buzz term that was used across the 2010s but what will the “new normal” be for Australia’s economy in the 2020s?

          "bodyText": "As Australia endures another heatwave, chronic water shortages are endangering life-saving kidney treatment for hundreds of Aboriginal people in remote desert communities. The dialysis machines they depend on need cold water, and lots of it. But a run of hot summers mean “people are getting worried for their life”, according to Dadu Corey, among the elders sitting at the lunch table outside Purple House dialysis clinic in Alice Springs. Purple House operates clinics in 18 remote communities, so Aboriginal people can be on country, receive treatment and still take part in the cultural life of their communities. People with end-stage renal failure usually need dialysis three times a week. A single treatment uses 600 litres of clean, cold water. “The last couple of summers we’ve really struggled with the temperature of the water,” says the chief executive, Sarah Brown. “The water has to be below a certain temperature or you can’t actually use it for dialysis. And over the last few years, two things have happened. “One is that the temperature of the water coming into the system has risen and that’s because the water pipes in the community aren’t far underground. As the ground heats up, because the days are hotter, the water in the pipes is heating up too.” At Kintore, 530km west of Alice Springs, Purple House raised funds to install a chiller tank inside the clinic to cool water overnight in an air-conditioned room. But this isn’t an option everywhere. “In most of our communities, where we don’t have chillers, we were having to limit dialysis to one shift a day, whereas before we could do two,” Brown says. Last summer nurses were getting up at 4am to get a shift of dialysis done early in the day. “It takes five hours,” Brown says. “If you get up at four, you’ve got the patients on by five o’clock in the morning, you can have the dialysis done by 10am before it’s too hot.” “The other thing is that you need quite a lot of water. And people worry about how long we’re going to have enough.” The Norther Territory’s Power and Water Corporation, which is responsible for essential services in 72 remote communities and outstations, says most communities in the arid region are “faced with some level of water stress”. At least nine remote communities and outstations are running out of water. A further 12 have reported poor quality drinking water as aquifers run low and the remaining supply is saline. NT Power and Water says emergency planning is under way and drilling programs are planned, but “finding new water sources is very challenging”. “Without large or extended rainfall … the water security risks will progressively increase in some centres, with an increased likelihood that source supply capacity at some could fail.” Since it began in 2000, Purple House has raised millions of dollars to set up remote clinics. It is a successful, independent Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation. “And because it’s community run and the dialysis patients are our bosses, we have better outcomes than anywhere else in the country. So it’s one place where you can say we’ve actually closed the gap,” Brown says. “Purple House patients have a longer life expectancy than non-Aboriginal people on dialysis. “It would be incredibly sad if the next reason why people are forced off their country … will be because we can’t access enough water to dialyse people.” Brown says research and development is needed on a sustainable model of dialysis, better suited to new conditions. “We need to start talking to these for-profit companies about really lifting their game to fight with us for technology which is more robust, cheaper and more sustainable and uses less water.” Brown says she takes inspiration from the resilience shown by the desert communities she works for. “We need to be valuing the knowledge of Indigenous peoples and helping them to remain on country. That knowledge is going to help us save it. But more than that, I think that Aboriginal people from remote communities are incredibly resilient and persistent and determined. And we all need some of that resilience now.”"

          "headline": "Was Adam Driver wrong to walk out of an interview?",
          "bodyText": "Adam Driver really does not like to listen to the sound of his own voice. In the middle of an interview on the NPR program Fresh Air earlier this month, the actor reportedly walked out rather than sitting through a clip of himself singing a song from the recent movie Marriage Story. Driver, who also appears in the new Star Wars film, left the New York studio abruptly during a remote interview with the show’s longtime host Terry Gross, Fresh Air’s executive producer Danny Miller confirmed to the Daily Beast. The producers of the show were aware that Driver preferred not to listen to or watch his own work – he told Gross as much in a previous interview – and said they encouraged him to remove his headphones, an offer that apparently irked him. “I don’t want to hear the bad acting that probably was happening during that clip,” Driver told Gross in the previous interview from 2015. “I’ve watched myself or listened to myself before, then always hate it,” he said. “And then wish I could change it, but you can’t. And I think I have, like, a tendency to try to make things better or drive myself and the other people around me crazy with the things I wanted to change or I wish I could change.” A New Yorker piece from October touched on what they called Driver’s “phobia” as well. In the story Driver recalled watching himself on Girls for the first time and recoiling. “That’s when I was, like, I can’t watch myself in things. I certainly can’t watch this if we’re going to continue doing it,” he said. Driver recalled hating seeing a scene of his in the film Inside Llewyn Davis and said he stopped watching altogether until the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” “I just went totally cold,” he said, “because I knew the scene was coming up where I had to kill Han Solo, and people were, like, hyperventilating when the title came up, and I felt like I had to puke.” Many actors have expressed a similar displeasure with or refusal to watch their own work, including Johnny Depp, Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie and others, so Driver’s reaction is not out of the ordinary. Many other people outside of acting often register surprise or disappointment when they hear their own voices played back to them as well. The reasons for this are complicated ranging from a difference in the acoustic quality of the sound when it’s not being conducted through our own bodies, or various extra-linguistic cues, such as anxiety level, that only become apparent to the speaker when their voices are played back. “We don’t really understand why he left,” Fresh Air’s Miller told the Daily Beast. “We were looking forward to the interview. Terry thinks he’s a terrific actor, he was a great guest when he was on in 2015, so we were disappointed that we didn’t have a new interview to share with our listeners about Marriage Story.” Earlier this year Driver said he had a technique for avoiding watching his own films at movie premieres. Speaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Driver said: ‘‘I just go into a room and wait with a guy in silence, and then I got to go back and sneak in and pretend like I was there the whole time. It always seems like a better alternative than watching all the mistakes that you’re making that are now immortalised on film.’’ Driver is not alone in avoiding watching his own films. Julianne Moore once has said that “I haven’t seen any of my movies”. Reese Witherspoon says watching her own movies would make her “spiral into a state of self-hate”. “I don’t know who feels good looking at themselves. Nobody, right?” Witherspoon said on Chelsea Lately. “It’s torture. Why would you want to watch yourself being stupid and pretending to be somebody else?”"

          "bodyText": "You’d be hard pressed to find a writer or book lover who doesn’t harbour a secret dream of running a bookshop, preferably in a serene, coastal location. This week, I had the pleasure of doing just that, and became the short-term proprietor of The Open Book, a secondhand bookshop in Wigtown, a rural seaside town in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. For just £400, two people can rent the flat above the shop on Airbnb for a week, running the shop in whatever way they see fit. I’m clearly not the only one for whom this is a lifelong dream – The Open Book is currently booked out until 2023, but I got lucky with a last-minute cancellation. So, on an icy Monday morning, my boyfriend and I hastily booked a rental car – public transport to Wigtown is practically impossible, thanks to its remote location – and started the long drive north. The harsh winds and icy rain hit us the minute we arrived. With the assurance that there was no need for heavy-duty locks or alarm systems here, we were given a key and access to the cash float. All the money made in The Open Book goes back into ordering stock and keeping the shop going. The next morning, we were up bright and early, ready for our first day of bookselling. Wigtown is an auspicious spot to try one’s hand at this trade as it boasts more than 15 bookshops – not bad for a town with a population of about 1,000 souls. Partly thanks to a concerted regeneration effort in the late 90s, this has made it Scotland’s official “book town”. Although there is no expectation about when to open and how to sell, every bookseller is encouraged to make their mark on the shop, dictating everything from the displays and layouts to pricing. First on the agenda? Unpacking boxes of books. We soon realised a large part of the life of a bookseller is sifting through an endless press of Dan Brown thrillers. Surprisingly, the shop’s fiction section was pretty sparse, with most space given over to books on the local landscape, Scottish history, wine and wildlife. Our pricing strategy was vague at best. We generally plumped for £1 for a paperback, £2 for a hardback and £4 for a coffee-table book or anything by Dickens. People always want Dickens, so we figured we may as well leave a little room for negotiation with the tough customers desperate for another copy of Oliver Twist. As we were hunting through a pile of books about wild falcons on our first morning, we turned around and suddenly the shop was full, with a family of American Baptists asking where the religious section was. Before we knew it, they were explaining how we were destined for eternity in hell. We sold them a dusty old book about God’s suffering in exchange for £1 and a prayer card explaining exactly what we needed to do to recognise Jesus as our lord and saviour. Because we were there during the winter season, the customers were few and far between, but always memorable. An old chap arrived just before we were about to close, who took a real interest in the old 1970s Playboy annual we had in stock. He proceeded to tell us – at length – about the differing aesthetics of Playboy and Penthouse models throughout each magazine’s history. Forty minutes later, when we were just about losing the will to live, he left, having bought nothing. The name on everyone’s lips, though, was Shaun Bythell. Owner of the town’s largest bookshop, Shaun wrote The Diary of a Bookseller, the book that introduced me – as well as many others – to Wigtown. Referred to as the “King of Wigtown” by other residents, he really seemed to be at the centre of everything that goes on there. We popped into his shop a few times over the week, but he always seemed to be out, which was a shame. As soon as I saw a Kindle mounted on the wall which had been blasted with a shotgun, I knew we’d have got along. The Open Book is actually the brainchild of Shaun’s ex-partner Jessica Fox. Fox is the author of Three Things You Need to Know About Rockets, a book about her move from LA, where she worked for Nasa, to Wigtown, where she came following her dream of running a bookshop and promptly fell in love with Shaun. The pair are no longer together, but still get on really well, I was assured by literally every person I met. There’s no sense of privacy in Wigtown, but I can’t blame them. It’s a great story that, needless to say, has been optioned for a film. If we weren’t being entertained by the customers, it was the other booksellers, who welcomed us like old friends. We became as much of a tourist attraction for the locals as the place was for us, and the conversations we had were worlds away from those back home. Nobody cared what our jobs were – they were more interested in what had brought us here. Our time in the bookshop was not an economic triumph. We probably bought more books than we sold, but it didn’t matter. For me, as for so many others, the idea has been a long-held retirement plan. With high streets in ever increasing trouble, that plan has become more of a ridiculous dream. To be able to live it for a week was an undiluted pleasure, reminding me yet again of the need for bookshops in local communities. I feel like I left a part of myself in Wigtown and am already counting down the days until my next visit … even if I have to wait until 2023."

          "headline": "'These babies should not have died': How the measles outbreak took hold in Samoa",
          "bodyText": "“Every time I visit my baby, I see a morgue full of dead babies,” says a mother sitting at Tupua Tamasese Meaole National Hospital in Apia, the capital of Samoa. The woman’s one-year-old died in the measles outbreak that has wracked the Pacific nation over the past two months. She now comes to the morgue day after day, awaiting the release of her child’s body. “It is the most unnatural thing you would ever see in your life, these babies should not have died,” she says. Since October, a measles outbreak has gripped the Pacific nation, killing 76 people – more than 60 of them children under the age of four. A state of emergency has been declared in the country, which is 4,300km east of Sydney and has a population of nearly 200,000. A mass vaccination campaign has been implemented, with health workers going door to door to carry out immunisations. Experts feel the emergency response is working and they are over the worst of the outbreak. But as funeral homes report running out of children’s coffins and young parents make their way to morgues to retrieve the bodies of their babies, they are questioning how it came to this. A tragic event with tragic consequences In one sense it is an easy question to answer. Samoa’s vaccination rate was too low to protect its people when measles arrived, probably brought by a traveller from New Zealand, which has suffered its own measles outbreak over the last year. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that in order to have immunity, there needs to be at least 95% coverage of people who have had two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Four years ago, roughly 85% of one-year-olds in Samoa were vaccinated, in 2017 that dropped to 60%. The rate plummeted sharply after a scandal that rocked Samoa in July 2018, when two Samoan nurses administered MMR vaccines to babies who subsequently died. The problem was not with the vaccine, an investigation determined, but rather its administration, after it emerged that one of the nurses mixed the MMR vaccine powder with expired muscle relaxant anaesthetic instead of water. But the impact on public trust in vaccination was profound. The Samoan government suspended the country’s vaccination programme for 10 months, despite advice from the WHO that the country immediately restart the programme. By 2018, only 31% of infants had been vaccinated. “When you pause for 10 months that’s enough time for thousands of kids [without immunity] to accumulate,” said Jose Hagan, regional immunisation specialist for the WHO. The country had already been a target for anti-vaxxers, but the MMR incident provided fertile ground for their messages to take hold. “It’s really hard to know how much to attribute to the anti-vaxxer messaging,” said Hagan. “They’ve certainly been extremely active in Samoa, for perplexing reasons. They’re flying all the way to Samoa to spread this message.” While these events played a part in reducing the immunity level; health experts and government sources in Samoa have told the Guardian that once the disease arrived on Samoa’s shores, its impact was worse than it needed to be because of mismanagement. The Guardian spoke with health workers, government and ministry of health sources – including those involved in the measles emergency response programme – who all said the situation had been mishandled from the start. The Samoan government sources who spoke to the Guardian did not wish to be named out of fear they may lose their jobs. The prime minister has shut down criticism of his government’s handling of the crisis, saying that those who have suggested an inquiry into the outbreak show a lack of “common sense” and that such calls were a “political gimmick”. ‘I was told I was being a paranoid mum’ One local senior health expert who did not want to be named said that tragically many of the measles cases were probably contracted at hospitals and clinics when people went to get vaccinated in the early days after the outbreak was declared. “Once the public were encouraged to vaccinate after the outbreak declaration the hospital was not properly prepared for the safety measures that are required for such a virulent disease. As such most of the cases would have been contracted from the clinics and hospital where the people went to get their initial vaccination once the outbreak was declared.” Hagan, from the WHO, says that this is something the organisation sees “constantly”. “This is a feature of almost every measles outbreak I’ve ever been a part of, including in highly-developed countries. Measles is so incredibly infectious, whenever people are gathering, if there is a measles case, it will rapidly find people who are not immune and it’s very difficult, even in the most prepared setting, to prevent.” Hagan says it is unlikely that people who attended clinics to be vaccinated themselves would have been infected, as the vaccine would have protected them, but that anyone who attended a clinic for other reasons, including parents taking their children to receive the vaccine, were at risk. The senior health expert also said that the government response was too slow to take action to prevent the spread of the virus, with schools allowed to remain open after the outbreak was declared. “The late declaration of the outbreak delayed appropriate response from government, WHO, Unicef and donors. There was a clear misunderstanding by MOH [the ministry of health] of their role and their responsibility in a state of emergency. They did not realise that the state of emergency would give necessary support and resources outside their capacity,” the source said. He said that despite the surge of humanitarian assistance from other governments and development partners, they were not put to good use immediately. “There was a noted delay in acceptance of humanitarian support such as doctors, nurses and emergency health workers, even with the growing numbers of cases. There was no system in place, no plan or established coordination in the health sector itself.” While Hagan calls the response from the Samoan government “extraordinarily aggressive over the past weeks”, people report being turned away from understaffed and overrun hospitals with their sick children. Joyetter Fa’apouli Feagaimaali’i, a reporter for the Samoa Observer, says she was repeatedly turned away from Tupua Tamasese Meaole II hospital in Apia after her seven-month-old daughter was showing early symptoms of measles several weeks ago. Despite the fact that the outbreak was well under way, she told the Guardian that doctors said her baby’s symptoms, which included fever and refusing the bottle, were most likely the result of teething and growth spurts and she was accused of being a “paranoid mum”. Feagaimaali’i took her daughter to the hospital five times over several days before the child was finally admitted for treatment. “I cried hysterically, as her breathing was getting worse, the sound of her cough was heartbreaking. As a mother you know her body is changing, she was deteriorating.” Her daughter had intensive treatment for eight days in hospital and has recovered. ‘We owe it to the children’ Devastating measles outbreaks like this one do not happen in a vacuum. Last year there were nearly 10 million cases and 142,000 deaths from measles worldwide and the figures for 2019 look set to be worse, with three times more cases reported so far this year than at the same stage in 2018. “These outbreaks just don’t happen by themselves in places like Samoa,” says Hagan. “They’re really isolated and they haven’t had any cases in years and years … the fact that this measles outbreak is whipping around the world on airplanes, which is really a global failure to protect children against this horrible disease.” Pacific nations, which often have remote communities, developing health systems and infrastructure, are often at risk. One nurse educator said the low numbers of nursing staff graduating from Samoa’s national university meant that there weren’t enough nurses to carry out the necessary extensive village outreach programme. For now, the mass vaccination campaign seems to be working. The immunisation rate in the country is now at 93% and Hagan says “It feels comfortably like we’re over the peak … We’re already starting to see the beginning of the impact of the campaign, I think we will start to see a rapid drop-off in the next weeks. But there are questions to be answered. Olo Fiti Vaai, an MP, has called for the government to launch a special commission of inquiry into the way the epidemic was managed. “We owe it to the children of Samoa that have passed on and their loved ones whom to this day are in mourning. There has to be an investigation as to where the lapse is and how the measles came into the country,” he told the Samoa Observer. Both the Samoa government and the CEO of health were contacted for comment."

          "bodyText": "Josie Douglas sits on a verandah overlooking a ridge of red rocks and earth, scrubby with saltbush and spinifex near the centre of Alice Springs. It’s late afternoon and only 31C – a reprieve from a run of days in the high 30s and 40s. But Douglas knows that from now on it will only get hotter. Last summer was the hottest on record, and the driest in 27 years in central Australia. Five per cent of the town’s street trees died. A heat monitoring study showed that on some unshaded streets the surface temperature was between 61C and 68C. “We can’t keep going on the way we’re going,” says Douglas, who is manager of policy and research at the Central Land Council. “Central Australian Aboriginal people are very resilient. They have evolved to cope with the harsh and variable desert climate, but there are limits. “Without action to stop climate change, people will be forced to leave their country and leave behind much of what makes them Aboriginal. Climate change is a clear and present threat to the survival of our people and their culture.” Across central Australia, people are bracing themselves for another scorching summer of drought. At least nine remote communities and outstations are running out of water. A further 12 have reported poor quality drinking water as aquifers run low and the remaining supply is saline. Temperature records have already been broken. In the year to July 2019, Alice Springs had 129 days over 35C, and 55 days over 40C. It wasn’t meant to be like this – at least, not yet. The national science agency, the CSIRO, predictedthat these temperatures would not arrive until 2030. As the Northern Territory’s environment minister, Eva Lawler, said last September: “If we don’t do anything, the NT will become unliveable.” The problem is where to start. In Alice Springs opinion is divided among local politicians about the impact climate change is having on life in the desert. Sitting on the grassy lawn outside the council, Jimmy Cocking of the Arid Lands Environment Centre talks openly about climate refugees: those who have already come into town, and those who will have to come in the near future. “We’re going to end up with a whole bunch of internally displaced people within the Northern Territory in remote Australia, if we’re not planning for that,” he says. “If regional centres like Alice Springs and others aren’t planning to be able to deal with the influx of climate refugees internally within our region, we’re going to be left flatfooted and unable to deal with any of the challenges and social consequences that will come from that.” Cocking is on the town council and has sought to pass motions to declare a climate emergency. But the mayor, Damien Ryan, is reluctant to sound the climate alarm. “In local government speak, when you have an emergency, you close it down,” Ryan says. “I have not had any of the people who talk about an emergency say what is the next step. So you declare an emergency, what do you do then the next day? That’s never been made clear to me.” At its October meeting, the council did not agree on the word “emergency” but voted unanimously to say there was an “escalating urgency for climate action”. Douglas and the CLC say Aboriginal communities are doing what they can. “People are already mitigating climate change through traditional burning and they are investing their income from land use agreements to install solar power, plant bush tucker gardens in communities and operate swimming pools, but all that counts for little in the face of the lack of climate leadership from the government,” she says. ‘You see people hosing their brick houses’ The NT government says it has allocated $15m to “revitalising” the Alice Springs city centre. Some of those funds will go towards shade and landscaping to help cool the streets, and to public water stations. Ryan says the council is encouraging local schools to plant more trees. The Territory government says it has a climate change response strategy and is working with other governments and the Bureau of Meteorology to “develop national guidelines for the development of a warning system for extreme heat events”. In the meantime, Douglas says, people are living in houses that are “unbearable”. “During our summers you can sometimes see people in communities hosing the outside of their Besser brick walls with garden hoses to keep cool despite the water shortages – that’s how desperate they are.” About 3ookm north-west of Alice Springs is Yuendumu, the largest remote community in central Australia. Its 900 or so residents are facing summer without a reliable supply of adequate drinking water. The NT government has stopped building new housing because there isn’t enough water in the dwindling aquifer to accommodate more people. Yuendumu is not alone. The Central Land Council’s chief executive, Joe Martin-Jard, says that at every regional meeting, water security is top of the agenda. “Between Alice Springs and Mount Isa, there’s probably only one major community with a decent water supply,” Martin-Jard says. “We’re not getting the rain we used to, to recharge the aquifers. So as water is drawn out of the aquifers it becomes more saline and less potable [drinkable]. “It’s a really horrible dilemma.” The NT’s Power and Water Corporation, which is responsible for essential services in 72 remote communities and outstations, says most communities in the arid region are “faced with some level of water stress” and emergency planning is under way, but there are “rarely any simple solutions”. “The difficult reality is that many communities originally developed historically in locations where there was never any secure, reliable, high quality water resources in close proximity,” a spokesperson said. “As those communities have grown … and expectations of improved levels of service have appropriately increased, the challenges also continue to increase.” Power and Water says more drilling programs are planned but “finding new water sources is very challenging and often these drilling programs have moderate prospects for success”. “Without large or extended rainfall … the water security risks will progressively increase in some centres, with an increased likelihood that source supply capacity at some could fail.” At least 12 communities have reported poor quality drinking water. At Laramba, Willowra and Wilora, nitrates and uranium are at levels exceeding health guidelines. NT Power and Water says it is “investigating alternative technology options”. It has already installed treatment plants at Kintore, Ali Curung and Yuelamu to reduce high levels of nitrates, uranium and fluoride. ‘Air conditioning is essential in the desert’ In Alice Springs’ 18 town camps, where people from out bush often end up, houses are commonly built from Besser bricks – hollow concrete blocks which are cheap, but which trap the heat. There’s a lack of tree cover or other kinds of shade. Houses bake in the sun and, while the majority have solar panels, they often have only an evaporative air conditioning unit, known locally as a “swampy”, to cool the house. A “swampy” uses a lot of water and can struggle on hot days, especially when there are a lot of people sharing a house, which is common in town camps with big families and fluctuating populations. “Air conditioning is an essential item in the desert, not a luxury,” the CLC’s Josie Douglas says, “but it does not come standard.” When remote community and town camp tenants are offered housing, there is “a hole where the aircon unit should be and they are told to buy it themselves”. “Many can only afford to ‘close the gap’ with a piece of wood, or run expensive reverse-cycle aircon very sparingly,” she says. “Some places don’t have enough water to use a cheaper swampy.” Houses that don’t cool down overnight create big health and social problems. “People resort to sleeping outside, or cramming everybody into the coolest room of the house, with all the well-known consequences for the spread of diseases that whitefellas only know from medical textbooks. “It’s also common for people to sleep in shifts, with young people roaming the streets at night where they get into trouble, and sleeping during the day when they should be at school.” This is at odds with the NT government’s view of the quality of town camp and remote community housing. A government spokesperson tells Guardian Australia that homes are designed with weather conditions and regional climate in mind, and they include external shading, natural ventilation and insulation. “Investment into housing in town camps has included the installation of louvres, sunscreens, verandas and insulation,” the spokesperson said. “The Department of Housing and Community Development has also upgraded some key community infrastructure including improved shading and the installation of fans.” Douglas is calling on the government to “stop building concrete hotboxes”. “More than a decade ago, the government and the CLC were partners [in research] that came up with really solid recommendations about how to make desert houses more energy-efficient and communities more resilient. “Some measures, such as making sure houses are built with the right orientation … and have passive cooling and a white roof, cost almost nothing. We would like to know how many of these expensive research findings have been implemented in our region.” Shirleen Campbell is a Warlpiri and Arrernte woman who grew up at Hoppy’s Camp, or Lhenpe Artnwe. She told the Alice Springs climate rally in October that town campers were very worried about climate change. “This is our place,” she said. “If it gets too hot, if we suffer through endless droughts or we spoil our water, then we don’t have another place to go. “We want houses that are right for this place and right for our people. We want to invest in renewable energy, like solar.” Campbell is a co-coordinator of the women’s family safety group at Tangentyere council, which delivers services to and advocates on behalf of town camp residents. “Most of all we want people to treat this place as a legacy to be handed down to our children and grandchildren. It is not a speculative commodity and it is not something to be sold or exported. “We have been here for a long time and want to look after this place for those that come after.” Keeping cool in the library There are few public places in Alice Springs to cool off. The Yeperenye shopping centre has security guards at the doors and, according to Douglas and Campbell, Aboriginal people are regularly moved on. The library is a popular, free cool space. There’s a widescreen TV rigged up with headphones, showing movies. Westerns are popular, as are replays of AFL grand finals. The Saltbush room down the hall is a haven for older folk, while little mobs of kids hang out among the young adult stacks or cluster around the phone-charging station. “We found there’s a gap in after-school care services from about 2.30 to 4.30, the hottest time of the day,” says the head librarian, Clare Fisher. “The kids can come to the library, cool off, have fruit and sandwiches.” “Libraries are for connection and relaxation as well as knowledge. We make everyone welcome – but we explain how to use the library and how to behave as well. We very much believe in come and be who you are.” Thirsty and dying animals culled In January footage of dead and dying horses in a dry creek bed at Ltyentye Apurte, 80km south-east of Alice Springs, flashed around the world. The Ltyentye Apurte rangers had the unenviable task of dragging more than 100 dead horses from the creek bed and disposing of their bodies. In June the CLC conducted an emergency cull of more than 1,400 feral horses, donkeys, camels and cattle from a waterhole near Lajamanu. The animals were thirsty and dying, congregating around the last remaining springs and water sites. The CLC has eradicated 6,279 feral animals in preparation for summer. Traditional owners don’t usually support animal culls, the CLC says, but there were no alternatives, with so many animals dying or in poor condition. Feral animals damage community infrastructure and housing. Thirsty camels, for example, will attack air conditioning units because they smell water, and lay waste to water tanks, bores, fences, pipes and taps. How hot is too hot? Heat, health and housing hotboxes In town, Tangentyere council wants to measure exactly how well houses are functioning. Tangentyere’s social policy and research manager, Michael Klerk, is in discussions with the CSIRO to install temperature data loggers in people’s houses, to build a case for improvements that are taken for granted elsewhere: solar power, insulation, better air conditioning, wide awnings, more shade. “Last summer – which was a very hot summer, soon to be repeated – a lot of anecdotal feedback was that people’s evaporative air conditioners weren’t cooling the houses sufficiently,” Klerk says. “This probably reflects the reality that evaporative air conditioners are not good at cooling houses when the external temperatures are in the mid-40s. “You might drop the temperature of a house to mid-30s, but that’s not an optimal internal ambient temperature for comfort or for health.” Most people living in town camps and remote communities, and some in suburban public housing, have pre-paid electricity meters. Residents are issued a power card, which they top up with their welfare payments or income. Once the credit is spent, they have to top it up again, or go without electricity. Klerk says that happened a lot in the last quarter of 2018. In Alice Springs, 420 of 570 households with prepaid electricity meters had at least one self-disconnection, which lasted, on average, 7.5 hours. Of the 570 Alice Springs meters, 285 are in town camp dwellings. In effect, more than half the town campers ran out of money to pay for electricity. “When the power goes off, it is bad for our health, the food gets spoiled, we can’t wash our clothes and we can’t wash our kids,” Shirleen Campbell told the rally. “In summer, when our houses are hot or when we don’t have electricity, our people look for comfort in air-conditioned public places. We are not always welcome in these places and sometimes there are problems. We are thankful for places like the library and the pool.” Klerk says low-income residents shouldn’t have to go broke trying to keep their houses cool. “It’s not acceptable that people’s houses are making them sick, and something really needs to be done about it. It shouldn’t all be passed on to the consumer. “If it’s the case of people having to spend more money to keep the houses at a temperature that delivers health outcomes, then we have to rethink the levels of income support that are available to people, particularly in these regions where it’s so hot.” Predictions by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress for the health impacts of heat are dire. In its submission to the NT government’s climate change policy discussion paper, it outlined some of them: “Increased sickness and mortality due to heat stress, increased food insecurity and malnutrition, increased risk from infectious disease, poorer mental health and an increased potential for social conflict.” ‘The antidote to despair is action’ The Pintupi-Luritja artist Irene Nangala was among the first to return to her home country at Kintore in the western desert, near the border with Western Australia, in the early 1980s. Until then, Pintupi people had been living a long way from home at the mission at Papunya, and they were homesick. Nangala helped set up the Kintore school. It was a “windbreak school” at first, she says: just a tarp to keep the sun and the rain water out. “Then we got a few teachers. It was hard work. We’ve got a proper good school now, proper shop. Nice clinic and aged care, child care.” Nangala says she doesn’t have an air-conditioner. On hot days the family puts blankets on the windows. Other elders whose aircon units break down have to wait for a repairer to come from Alice Springs, more than 10 hours’ drive away. “It’s really hot in Kintore. We can’t go and sit outside. We have to go at night to sit down with the families.” Nevertheless, Nangala says she does not want to leave. “We built up Kintore,’ she says. “People are really enjoying going back to their grandfather’s land. That’s the right thing to do. And it’s good for them to go back, the old people, good for the heart and the spirit. “When they went first, they cried, they missed that place for a long time.” Nangala says people don’t want to come into town, where life might be worse. “Climate change is true,” Nangala says. “They [politicians] got the map and weather things, they should see the temperature what is happening around Australia, it’s so hot.” Jimmy Cocking says: “We are walking blindly into the new climate reality. We’ve moved beyond hope, and we can’t be running on hope alone. “The only thing that is going to get us over the line is action. And the antidote to despair is action. “So there’s a lot of things that we need to be looking to change so that we aren’t going to be putting people’s lives at risk.”"

About 60 craft beers are available, plus locally roasted coffee, touring theatre shows, art exhibitions, and a great selection of new and secondhand vinyl. It’s run by the team behind Ventnor Fringe, launched 10 years ago by a group of teenagers who wanted to make a difference to their dilapidated Victorian seaside town, and two of this original team are still at the helm and guarantee you a warm welcome. • ventnorexchange.co.uk Doug Innerpeffray Library, Perthshire To reach the first free lending library in Scotland, drive up a rutted farm track until you reach a group of elegant whitewashed buildings and a chapel. It was founded in 1680 “For the benefit of all” by the third Lord Madertie, and you can pore over books from the 16th and 17th centuries onwards. Oh, the thrill of wondering who turned the pages before you! A handwritten ledger details who borrowed what – and the librarian tells tales of farmers and servants walking miles and wading through rivers to get here. • Entry £7.50, innerpeffraylibrary.co.uk Carol Ann Crawford David Parr’s house, Cambridge On the outskirts of Cambridge, a modest terraced house hides an astonishing interior. It once belonged to David Parr, a craftsman of the Arts and Crafts movement who was employed on commissions for colleges and churches. In his spare time, he decorated his family home with handpainted walls, richly patterned with intricate foliage and luscious colours in William Morris style. After Parr’s death, his granddaughter continued to live in the house – without making any alterations – until she died. The house was discovered by historian Tamsin Wimhurst and, after restoration, opened to the public earlier this year. • Tour £14.50, davidparrhouse.org Helen Brazier Furzey Gardens, New Forest Set within enchanting woodland near Lyndhurst in Hampshire, these beautiful gardens harness a plethora of delights for all ages. Mums and dads can marvel at the flora and fauna while children can hunt for the 40 intricately carved hidden fairy doors. You weave and wind through an outdoor play area, a barn for creating pictures and crafts and a tearoom and shop that serves the best cream tea we’ve ever had. The garden is looked after by Pete White, with a team of 30 people with learning disabilities and other volunteers. The garden supports Minstead Trust’s charitable work. • Entrance by donation, minsteadtrust.org.uk jordan bailey Genesis cinema, London This independent cinema is run by the local community in Mile End, the heart of London’s East End. Named after the band Genesis, it shows both mainstream and arthouse films and has themed weeks for the surrounding area but is open to anyone and has a nice and friendly chilled atmosphere. Sit, chat and eat in The Kitchen, where its wonderful fare is part of the “pie and picture” deal for £15. The building has a fascinating history, with one previous incarnation being a Frank Matcham theatre called the Paragon, where Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy performed many years ago. • genesiscinema.co.uk Gonca Willow and Wetlands centre, Somerset Venture on to the Somerset Levels and you feel as if you are stepping back in time. In the heart of this unusual landscape is the Willow and Wetlands centre, near Stoke St Gregory. This magical place describes a time when willow was used to make bicycle panniers, hot-air balloon baskets, invalid carriages and much more. When this industry declined, the Coates family diversified into making artists’ charcoal and today is a supplier of world renown. The museum is free to enter but there is a charge for guided tours. • englishwillowbaskets.co.uk Robert Webb The Grouse Inn, Carrog, Denbighshire Eight miles from Llangollen, you simply cannot beat the views from the terrace here, watching the river meander under the 17th-century bridge, especially with late afternoon sun lighting the mountainsides of the facing Dee Valley. So many villages no longer have a pub; but the Grouse enjoys a symbiotic relationship with locals, travelling regulars and tourists from the campsite and the Llangollen Railway, which stops 300 yards away. It’s a bustling little village hub, which serves good beer and food in a cosy atmosphere inside, but never better than when sitting outside with that view. • thegrouseinncarrog.co.uk Dave Thomas Scarthin Books, Cromford, Derbyshire You may have discovered independent bookshops with stimulating, well-curated stock before, but few can match Scarthin Books’ historic setting – the Derwent Valley Mills, a Unesco world heritage site. First off, it overlooks the millpond that powered the world’s first factory, Richard Arkwright’s (now restored)cotton mills. You can also take a trip along the beautiful Cromford Canal, trek up to a sandstone outcrop and meander down through the backs of pretty mill-workers’ cottages. Scarthin also has a secret cafe behind a bookshelf door, leading out on to a Derbyshire hillside where you can drink tea and read books, hidden among a muddle of cottage gardens. • scarthinbooks.com Alison Staveley Mill Yard, Lake District A veritable hive of activity, the Mill Yard boasts a cycle hire centre, furniture workshop and gallery, a beer hall, cookery school, outdoor store for mountain equipment and brewery. Outdoorsy Wilf’s Café has diversified, with the addition of the more urbane More? artisan bakery, next to Hawkshead brewery and beerhall. There’s also Mr Duffin’s coffee roasters and Kimi’s gelateria, all in one small Lake District village.

There is a statewide total fire ban in place for NSW from midnight tonight, as well as total fire bans in the Wimmera district of Victoria and parts of South Australia. The heatwave, which saw temperatures reach 46.5C in Ceduna and above 40C in Adelaide today, will continue in South Australia and stretch across to Victoria tomorrow. It’s forecast to reach 39.5C in Melbourne on Wednesday and 44C in Mildura. Sydney won’t get really hot until Thursday, but there will be thick smoke around all morning. Stay safe, stay hydrated, and don’t go jogging in the smoke. We’ll see you tomorrow. This is how the rescue operation for those koalas at Kanangra-Boyd National Park was carried out. The heatwave that began in Western Australia last week has reached Adelaide, and temperatures have exceeded 40C in much of the state – including Adelaide – with a high of 45.5C in Ceduna. The Gospers Mountain megafire is continuing to burn in Wollemi national park in the Blue Mountains, but is being controlled. It remains active on both sides of Bells Line of Road and fire is increasing in Berambing, but has eased near Wallerawang, Lidsdale and Blackmans Flat. There will be a community meeting about the Gospers Mountain fire at Grose View public school at 7.30 tonight, and a bushfire information point will be open at Cullen Bullen rural fire station between 4pm and 5pm. Watch and act alerts remain in place for the Gregory River fire and Mount Maria fire in Queensland. The communities of Promisedland and Pine Creek near the Cordalba state forest, and Lowmead near Lake Monduran, have been told to evacuate. New South Wales is about to go into a four-day statewide total fire ban, which will coincide with the heatwave. In a stark reminder that the effects of bushfires often extend many years after the fire has been put out, 445 people who were affected by the 2013 Dunalley bushfires in Tasmania have launched a class action against those they allege were responsible for the fire. The Dunalley fire destroyed 193 homes and 186 other properties, including the Dunalley school and police station. The cost of the fire is estimated to be more than $100m. A terrifying photograph of one family sheltering from the flames under a jetty was the subject of one of Guardian Australia’s first reports. AAP reports that legal papers for the class action were lodged with the supreme court of Hobart, alleging that a man and a woman were negligent in lighting or failing to properly put out a campfire which later flared and burned through 25,000 hectares. They claim that a campfire was lit in a tree stump at a property in Forcett, 20km north-east of Dunalley, on 12 December 2013. It is alleged dirt was kicked on to the stump and two half-buckets of water poured on the fire, with the belief it had been extinguished. The woman on 1 January saw steam coming from stump after rain but did not take any steps to investigate, it is also claimed. Two days later, in hot, dry and windy weather and when the fire danger was very high to severe, the smouldering fire spread to grass and then into bushland. The class action claims the man and woman ought to have known when they lit the campfire in December there was a risk of fire spreading over a wide area. A rescue operation is under way to protect a significant wild koala population in the Kanangra-Boyd national park in the Blue Mountains from the threat of bushfire and extreme heat. The Kanangra-Boyd koalas are directly in the path of a 140,000-hectare bushfire. They’re also one of the most genetically diverse wild koala populations in the country and, crucially, one of only two chlamydia-free wild koala populations in NSW. The organisation Science for Wildlife and the Taronga Wildlife hospital have rescued a small group – three adult males and five adult females, four of which have joeys – and taken them to the wildlife hospital until it is safe to release them to the wild. It is one of five areas of significant koala population under threat from the Blue Mountains fires including the Gospers Mountain megafire, Science for Wildlife’s director, Dr Kellie Leigh, said. We have found at least five areas that support significant numbers of koalas and three of those are currently being hit by bushfires. I spoke to the NPWS who are dealing with these fires, and they gave us their full support to get some out. The national park is closed to the public due to fire risk but they gave us a two-day window when it was safe to go in in front of the fire. These koalas are hard to find and catch. We wish could have saved more but we’re glad we could rescue this group. A lot of good people helped at very short notice. Koalas are a threatened species and are vulnerable to extinction in many parts of their range due to habitat loss, Leigh says. Saving each and every koala population is vital to the species’ survival. It’s just reached 40C in Adelaide. On that topic, Victoria is set to cop the heat tomorrow. Melbourne is forecast to reach 39C. A heat health alert has also been issued for the north of the state. Bendigo is set to hit 42C, and Echuca, Swan Hill and Mildura will reach between 43C-45C. Today it’s already 36.4C in Mildura, 34.4C in Shepparton, 33.5C in Albury, and 30.1C at Melbourne airport. For eastern states the heatwave will be worse at the end of the week, posing a concern for athletes at the weekend. There’s an important discussion to be had here, reminiscent of the haze in Sydney that shrouded a Sheffield Shield cricket match last week. At the time, New South Wales spinner Steve O’Keefe said the air was “not healthy” and “toxic”, and said Cricket Australia needed to look at its air quality policy. At Sydney’s Wynyard station, the Red Cross and the City of Sydney have installed a dramatic burnt Christmas tree. Created from wood from fire-hit areas, it is part of a charity drive to collect Christmas donations for those affected. In NSW, it’s 37.9C in Bourke and 35.8C in Mildura. It’s 30.5C in Canberra. The latest Bureau of Meteorology observations: it is 39.5C in Adelaide’s city centre, and the forecast is for 40C. It’s 42.1C in Port Augusta, and 44.5C in Ceduna. Residents along Tableland and Cross roads are being told to prepare to leave with the Mount Maria bushfire at watch and act level. The fire is burning in the vicinity of Cross, Hills, Wytallabah and Kirkpatrick roads but no properties are under threat. But Queensland fire and emergency warns the situation could change quickly. NSW RFS reports an increase in fire activity for the massive Gospers Mountain fire near Bells Line of Road and Mount Wilson Road but no properties are under threat. There are reports that the heatwave and fires are resulting in a number of Christmas events being cancelled. The rural fire brigade for my home town of Winmalee in the Blue Mountains, for example, has cancelled taking Santa to some parts of the town because of the predicted high fire situation. AAP reports that NSW Health has warned that if you see bats and flying foxes in distress over summer, don’t touch them: People should avoid rescuing distressed bats and flying foxes during mass die-offs over the summer. NSW Health’s zoonotic disease manager, Keira Glasgow, says humans could catch a rabies-like infection while trying to rescue dying animals. “Most people scratched or bitten by a bat have been trying to rescue them – it is essential that people do not touch bats to avoid being infected,” she said on Tuesday. “While human infection is very rare, if not prevented lyssavirus progresses to a rabies-like illness which is almost always fatal.” Large numbers of bat deaths are associated with heatwaves or a lack of food. NSW Health says the cause of current deaths isn’t known but they were likely to continue over summer. Three people have died from Australian bat lyssavirus since 1996. If people are bitten they should clean the wound with soap and water for at least five minutes before applying antiseptic and seeking medical advice, NSW Health says. Don’t use drones near fires. We’ve seen a few of these warnings in the past few weeks but it bears repeating. Fire and Rescue NSW’s chief remote pilot, Anthony Wallgate, said in a Faebook post that firefighters increasingly rely on drones to collect data and monitor fires when the public uses drones it can make it dangerous for everyone. “If members of the public fly drones in or near a fire area, then we can’t do our job,” he said. “Fixed-wing and rotary aircraft can’t fly and are unable to fight the fires as we are forced to ground all aircraft for safety reasons.” Residents in Promisedland and Pine Creek are being told to prepare to leave. The fire in Elliott River state forest is at watch and act level. The fronts of the fire are travelling in a north and north-westerly direction. Timed without irony, the federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, has sent out a press release on the “strong international demand for Australian coal”. It goes into great detail about the government’s plans to wind down its coal production for the sake of the planet, as recommended by world-leading scientists ... no, it doesn’t. Canavan is drawing our attention to a report by the International Energy Agency which he says has forecast coal will remain “an important part of the global energy mix” after being the source of 38% of the world’s electricity in 2018. “The IEA report shows Australia is well placed to take advantage of the shifts in international demand, and to supply markets in south-east Asia and India as new coal-based electricity generation comes on line over the coming years,” he said. “For the sake of Aussie jobs and our dynamic regional communities we need to grasp the opportunities that coal presents, both here and overseas.” Some more information on those Queensland fires from AAP: Two communities in south-east Queensland have been told to get ready to leave as two dangerous bushfires rage north of Bundaberg. The residents of Mount Maria, about 75km north of Bundaberg, have been warned to be prepared as the fire burns close to homes on the eastern side of the town. The fire was at watch and act level this morning. Another at Promisedland and Pine Creek was also at watch and act and residents have been told to prepare to leave ahead of a fire burning in the Elliott River state forest. The leave now warning was also issued for Gregory River (north of Childers) yesterday. Queensland police have increased the size of an exclusion area in the region. The area is now bound by Cedars Road, the Burnett River, Onoprienkos Road and Newlands Road. Childers Road is closed in both directions. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, says bushfires have already taken a “tragic” toll on the state, AAP reports, but she feels current resourcing is meeting the state’s needs. “When you have extreme fire fronts this large, people have to make decisions about what to protect, where to put priorities, where to put resources and I have every confidence that our teams are doing an exceptional job,” Berejiklian said today. “If you look at how bad the fires have been and how widespread they’ve been, it’s pretty much a miracle the lives lost haven’t been more, and I’m deeply grateful for that.” She said NSW was resourced to meet the crisis: “I feel at this stage that our resourcing is meeting needs.” Six people have died so far this season and more than 720 homes have been lost. The NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, says firefighters will not be able to contain every blaze before conditions deteriorate. “While we’re very concerned about the Gospers Mountain fire, there are more than 100 fires burning throughout the state,” he said. “Anyone of them could cause problems over ensuing days.” The most recent update from Queensland’s fire service on this Gregory River fire is from about two hours ago, but it is at a watch and act level with residents told to be ready to activate their fire plan. A local ABC reporter, Johanna Marie, reports the Bruce highway has been closed between Bundaberg and Childers. At the moment there are no emergency level fires, despite the continuing seriousness of the crisis. In NSW there are about 100 fires burning at advice level. In Queensland there are three fires at watch and act, and five at advice level. In Western Australia there are 15 at advice level fires. In Victoria eight fires are at advice level. In South Australia firefighters have contained a grass fire at Myponga, but warnings are still current. A reminder that “heatwaves are Australia’s deadliest severe weather” with this outlook from the Bureau of Meteorology yesterday at the start of what it’s calling a week of “exceptional heat”. It’s likely to break numerous December and all-time temperature records across the country, and we might even top Australia’s warmest day on record (7 January 2013) which had 40.3 C as a nationwide average. Here’s a very quick wrap-up of what we’re looking at, and it’s not good news, with maps showing a lot of purple (a new colour they had to add to the temperature guidelines in recent years). “Australia is burning while we turn a blind eye to the driving force which is climate change and a warming planet.” Former fire commissioner Greg Mullins and a number of former emergency service heads held a press conference a short time ago, addressing the nation on the bushfire crisis “and the leadership vacuum in Canberra”. “Here in NSW the fires are totally unprecedented,” he said. “More country has been burned, three times more homes lost than our worst previous fire season in history, and the fires are still burning. We have a heatwave coming. Who knows what that will do, and the driving force behind this is climate change.” Mullins said the prime minister had declined their repeated requests to meet. They have met ministers David Littleproud and Angus Taylor and given them a list of suggestions. They’re confident of a response, Mullins says. “However, it falls to us because of that leadership vacuum to call an emergency bushfire summit after this summer. When the experts, the firefighters, are available and taking a well-earned rest. We don’t know when that will be. Normally it would be March but it might be April, it might be May.” Mullins says he wants to see farmers, health professionals, Indigenous people, firefighters, people from the military and politicians from all levels of government at the summit. “It’s no good saying we’re only a small emitter of carbon dioxide,” he said. “It’s simply not true. Amongst about 200 countries, we’re number 17. When we add in the coal we sell to other countries we come up to about number five. “We have no moral leadership as we saw in Madrid. The bushfires weren’t even mentioned. Other countries were aghast.” The lovely year six kids at Windsor public school have donated their annual fundraising to the RFS. We previously reported the RFS is confident it will be able to keep the Mount Piper power station safe but was a little more concerned about the fire’s proximity to the Springvale coalmine. Jamie Hanson, head of campaigns at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, has raised comparisons with Victoria’s Hazelwood mine fire in 2014 which emitted dangerous toxic fumes after it caught alight from a nearby bushfire. “These chemicals are extremely toxic and dangerous to communities and families, but especially the Australians most vulnerable to health impacts, such as children and the elderly,” he said. “New South Wales is already in the grips of an air pollution crisis from these bushfires, and if a coalmine and coal power station are ignited as a result of this bushfire emergency, the health risks to Australians are extremely high.” It’s a smoky day for Canberra again. A reminder that NSW Health’s advice is that vulnerable people – the young, elderly and those with respiratory conditions – should stay indoors, avoid exercise and minimise exposure as much as possible. This was taken today at Sydney’s Central Station and shows masks for sale. But remember, only a few styles work. Sad news from the Mount Tomah botanic gardens in the Blue Mountains, which were affected by the Gospers Mountain fire. The director of horticulture says “most of the 186-hectare conservation area burned”. The RFS says it is “concerned” about the potential for the huge Gospers Mountain fire to reach the Springvale coalmine, and the nearby Mount Piper power station. It was reported earlier that the fire was 6km from the power station but the RFS is confident the station will be safe. “That fire is some kilometres away [from the coalmine] but we are concerned about that,” a spokesman said. “Crews on the ground are maintaining obviously close monitoring of that fire because the last thing we need is for that to get into coal areas or worse. “It is a critical facility and as such fire agencies will do whatever they can to keep fire out of that area.” The outlook is better for the power station – the RFS says the weather is on its side. “It’s not directly under threat at the moment. The fire is still a few kilometres away from that area. Luckily it won’t get the worst of the weather because the fire is to the east of that. “There are a lot of units monitoring that. We are quite confident of protecting that facility.” Fire authorities and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, are giving a press conference. The RFS says roughly a dozen buildings have been destroyed by the Gospers Mountain fire. “We think there are a dozen homes destroyed in that area but we do have to get crews in there. There are reports of other buildings but we need to get people in to look. Was it sheds? Was it homes? But certainly we’re talking around a dozen homes.” As the bushfire conditions worsen this week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, is on holiday, a move which has angered climate campaigners and opposition MPs. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge tweeted that the prime minister had “an obligation to stick around”. Morrison’s office confirmed to the New Daily that he was on holiday but said widespread claims on social media that the prime minister was in Hawaii were “wrong”. One protest, organised by the school strikers for climate, is planned for Thursday, outside Kirribilli House in Sydney. “Extreme heat is gripping us this week and towns are running out of water, yet our prime minister has fled the country,” organisers said. “Those on the frontlines don’t get this luxury. “Scott Morrison tells us to be quiet, chill out, enjoy the cricket whilst failing to show the leadership we need when we’re in the midst of a massive climate crisis.” Morrison is on a family holiday – not in a professional capacity – with his wife and daughters during the school holidays. Inland NSW will feel the heat today although the heatwave has not yet made it to the coast (for now). It is forecast to to reach 40C in Bourke and Brewarrina, 41C in Wilcannia, 39C in Broken Hill, 40C in Menindee, 37C in Tamworth and 36C in Albury. It will be 33C in Canberra. The forecast for SA later this week is frightening. Oodnadatta will hit 47C on Wednesday and stay like that until Friday. Port Augusta will reach 47C on Thursday, and Wudinna 48C. On Friday Port Augusta and Whyalla will rise to 48C . Meanwhile Adelaide will experience highs of 42C, 41C and 44C on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. In NSW, the huge Gospers Mountain megafire which covers more than 400,000 hectares is burning within 6km of the Mount Piper power station, the Western Advocate reports. Now that the dust and mercury have settled, we can confirm that various heat records were smashed on Monday across the country. Yesterday Perth posted a maximum of 40.9C. This made it three days in a row above 40C for the WA capital, the first time in December since records began. The average maximum temperature for Perth this month is an astonishing 36C, 7C above average. And it was also the fourth day over 40C day in December, setting another record. The previous record was two, and there are still 14 days in the month to go. In Queensland the temperature in Brisbane hit 41.2C by midday. That equalled the previous record for the city’s hottest day, set in 1981. In Gatton in the Lockyer Valley, a record did fall. The top of 43.2C was the hottest December temperature recorded there, beating the previous record which was set on Saturday. Before that the record had stood since 2002. In Oakey, Beerburrum and Nambour, temperatures also exceeded the previous December record, the Bureau of Meteorology said. And the big news from this morning: a coalition of 29 former fire and emergency chiefs say they will go ahead and hold a bushfire crisis summit with or without Scott Morrison. Last week a former NSW fire chief, Greg Mullins, and a former Queensland fire chief, Lee Johnson, called for the national summit on how Australia should prepare for bushfires in a changed climate. Earlier this year the fire chiefs had asked to meet the prime minister, but said their advice had been ignored. The group is calling for action on the climate crisis which has made bushfire season longer and more intense. Here’s the fire map for NSW. A quiet morning, with all fires are at advice. But yesterday the commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, warned that conditions will deteriorate – and fires will flare up – as the heat kicks in. Good morning and welcome to our continuing coverage of the bushfire crisis. The heatwave that settled over Australia yesterday bringing above-40C temperatures to Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland is set to continue and slowly move east. Today Adelaide is forecast to hit 40C and Port Augusta 45C. In WA, Perth will peak at 33C, and the Kimberley and Pilbara will reach 44C. In Queensland, Birdsville will hit 46C, and in NSW, Wilcannia will reach 41C. Overnight three fires in NSW that had flared to emergency levels (Gospers Mountain, Palmers Oaky and Kerry Ridge) were downgraded to watch and act, and further downgraded to advice, thanks to the work of the RFS. In WA, the fire north of Yanchep was also downgraded after it had burned at emergency levels all day across 13,000 hectares."

          "headline": "Rio Tinto’s plan to clean up Ranger uranium mine in doubt after hedge fund objects",
          "bodyText": "Mining giant Rio Tinto’s plans to clean up the controversial Ranger uranium mine have been thrown into doubt after objections from a Singapore-based hedge fund. The mine is owned by ASX-listed Energy Resources Australia (ERA), which in turn is 68% owned by Rio Tinto. ERA is required to remediate the mine site and return it to a state fit to be incorporated in the surrounding Kakadu national park, by 2026. There have been longstanding concerns about the risk of a uranium leak from the Ranger mine, amplified by its location at the eastern end of the remote national park in the Northern Territory. A decade ago it was revealed contaminated water was leaking every day from a tailings dam. In 2013 a burst leach tank at the mine released up to 1m litres of acidic radioactive slurry. Those concerns, which contributed heavily to Mirrar native title holders insisting that mining cease, underscore the risk if the site is left without remediation. Last month, ERA asked shareholders to tip in an additional $476m to finance the clean-up operation, and Rio Tinto said it would guarantee the money if no other shareholders wanted to contribute. If no other shareholders participate – quite likely as the deal is not expected to generate any financial return for ERA – Rio Tinto will end up with more than 95% of the company’s shares. As part of the underwriting agreement, ERA also undertook not to develop a mine at Jabiluka, to the north of Ranger, which has been strenuously opposed by the Mirrar traditional owners. However, the entire plan was thrown into disarray on Wednesday after the Takeovers Panel put conditions on the deal following a complaint from Singapore hedge fund Zentree Investments, which owns about 16% of ERA and is controlled by investor Richard Magides. Magides could not be reached for comment but in the past has reportedly accused Rio Tinto of trying to get its hands on $646m in tax losses run up by ERA. He also claimed Rio Tinto has overstated the cost of remediation and called for the development of Jabiluka, which ERA has agreed not to mine without the consent of the traditional owners, and another resource, Ranger 3 Deeps, which the company regards as uneconomic. The deal proposed by ERA and Rio Tinto would have allowed Rio Tinto to compulsorily buy Zentree’s stake if it ended up with more than 90% of the company’s shares. This would give it complete control of the company and allow it to consolidate it into its corporate group or wind it up. But the Takeovers Panel has barred Rio Tinto from doing so for a year. The panel found that “Rio Tinto sought to consolidate control and acquire ERA” through the underwriting arrangement because minority shareholders were unlikely to participate, but had not given enough information to the market about its intentions once it had the company in its grip. ERA had also not done enough to ensure a board committee looking at the issue was sufficiently independent of Rio Tinto, the panel said. It is not clear whether Rio Tinto would be willing to stump up the $464m potentially required if it is barred from taking full control of ERA. Guardian Australia understands traditional owners remain confident that Rio Tinto will do so regardless. “Adequate funding for comprehensive clean-up of the Ranger site is essential,” a Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation spokesperson said. “[Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation] welcomes ERA and Rio Tinto’s commitment to finding a funding solution to restore country.” On Friday, Rio Tinto applied for a review of the decision."

          "headline": "Superglue plant and ‘miracle berry’ among 2019’s new finds",
          "bodyText": "A snowdrop discovered on Facebook, a miracle berry that tricks your tastebuds and a rubbery shrub that oozes its own superglue are among new plant species that were discovered in 2019. Others identified by experts at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, include a ylang-ylang tree of which just seven individuals are known to exist, a new candy-striped violet and a fungus with pink fruiting bodies that can fight cancer and viruses. Discovering and giving scientific names to new species is the crucial first step to protecting them, the scientists said. Kew scientists officially named 102 plants and eight fungi in 2019, but many are already in danger of extinction. The major threats are the destruction of natural habitat for farmland, timber, dams and mining, as well as the impacts of the climate crisis. Plants account for 82% of all life on Earth by weight – humans are just 0.01% – and they underpin all life, producing oxygen and food and providing shelter and medicines. There are almost 400,000 known species of plant, and about 2,000 new species are named every year. “We all depend on plants,” said Martin Cheek, a senior botanist at Kew and who names about 10 new species a year. “It is shocking that we are still discovering so many. It is easy to think we know everything on this planet, but we don’t. The local people might know the plants, but they are unknown to science.” “It is important to name the plants now because natural habitat is disappearing rapidly,” he said. “Only when they have a name can they have an official assessment under the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and only then do we have a chance of getting national authorities to protect those areas.” The new snowdrop species was discovered in north-west Turkey when a paediatrician uploaded her holiday photos to Facebook, where they were spotted by a Ukrainian snowdrop specialist. The pair returned to the site and collected a sample, which was confirmed as a new species by Kew’s snowdrop expert Aaron Davis. The snowdrop has already been assessed as critically endangered. The new miracle berry species was discovered the rainforests of the Chimanimani Mountains, on the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border. The fruits of these species contain a compound called miraculin that blocks tastebuds so that sour foods, such as limes, taste sweet. The new species is classed as endangered, due to the continuing destruction of the forest. The rubbery shrub species was found on a single waterfall on the Bafing River in Guinea, west Africa. “They have some kind of biological superglue with which they can stick themselves to rocks to avoid being swept away, but this interesting compound hasn’t been investigated yet,” said Cheek. Kew scientists expect the shrub to become globally extinct when construction of a hydroelectric dam begins next year. “We have examples of species from that family that have been wiped out by other hydroelectric dams,” Cheek said. Plant extinctions in general are occurring at a “frightening” rate, according to scientists, and one in five of all plants are at risk. The rarest find in 2019 was the zonozono, a 20m-tall tree from the ylang-ylang family discovered in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. Just seven trees are known. The spectacular new violet family species was found in New Guinea. The bamboo fungus from Yunnan in south-west China was only given a formal scientific name in 2019, but has been used in the region as a traditional treatment for arthritis for more than 400 years. Scientific interest is increasing due to the discovery of compounds called hypercrellins in the fungus. When exposed to light, these compounds combat tumours, viruses and other fungi. Most new species are named after local places, but one Kew scientist took a more romantic approach. A new orange gladiolus found on top of a remote table mountain in Guinea is now called Gladiolus mariae, after Xander van der Burgt christened the plant after his wife Maria. “It is perfectly OK if other people name a species after you,” said Cheek. “But it would be considered very bad form to name a species after yourself.”"

          "bodyText": "The feral horse population in Australia’s alpine national parks has more than doubled in the past five years, with conservationists blaming what they have called a disgraceful lack of management by the New South Wales government. The updated population figures come from an aerial survey of the alpine national parks and surrounding state forests in NSW and Victoria conducted in April and May of this year. It mimicked a survey of the same area in 2014. The survey data, released on Monday, showed the feral horse population had grown an estimated 23% a year over the past five years, from 9,187 in 2014 to 25,318 in 2019. The population growth was strongest in the northern section of Kosciuszko national park, which showed a five-fold increase. Andrew Cox, chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, said that if feral horse numbers continued to increase at the current rate, horses would become the most-sighted animal in the park. “It is a disgrace to see how much the population has grown out of control,” Cox said. Cox said the exponential growth meant that authorities would have to remove thousands of horses a year just to keep the population stable. He said all humane and effective forms of population control – including aerial culling, which has been explicitly ruled out by the NSW government – should be back on the table. “If we don’t do it, horses will be the main animal you see there,” he said. “Australia’s most iconic park is being lost to horses.” NSW last year introduced laws to protect the Snowy Mountains brumbies for their “heritage value”, scrapping a recommendation from the state’s environment department that feral horse numbers in the alps be reduced by 90%. Victoria, meanwhile, has committed to removing 1,200 horses from its side of the border. The driving force behind the change in the NSW policy was deputy premier John Barilaro, whose electorate of Monaro includes the Snowy Mountains. Barilaro said he remained opposed to aerial culling. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I have never ruled out culling if the numbers show we need to,” he said in a statement. “But what I have ruled out is aerial culling of wild brumbies because, I stress, I won’t let this be a repeat of the Guy Fawkes massacre.” The culling of more than 600 horses at the Guy Fawkes national park in north-western NSW in 2000, where at least one horse was found alive with a bullet wound, is frequently cited as an argument against aerial culling. But aerial culling is commonly used against feral horses in remote parts of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Cox said the Guy Fawkes incident had been mythologised and exaggerated. He said the damage to native flora and fauna, including the critically endangered northern and southern corroboree frog, would be severe if horse numbers were not curbed. Attempts to trap and retrain brumbies have resulted in a relatively small number being rehomed. About 800 have been trapped in recent years. “You can’t just take a few hundred horses out, there needs to be a serious control program put in place,” Cox said. Failure to do so will have negative animal welfare impacts on the brumbies themselves, Cox said. They are already being hit by cars. “The horses will overflow the park and spill into surrounding private lands if we don’t do something to control their numbers,” he said. “They have no natural predators, they have no diseases. They will starve themselves out.” Barilaro said brumbies had been part of the Australian alps for almost 200 years, since they were released by or escaped from European settlers. “I have always maintained that it is important we find a balance between the cultural significance of the brumbies and managing the environmental impact on the Kosciuszko national park,” he said. A community advisory panel has been formed to help draft the wild horse management plan."

          "headline": "Andy Burnham warns northerners to be wary of 'glib' Tory promises",
          "bodyText": "Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has urged new Tory voters in the north of England to be wary of Conservative promises to invest tens of billions in the region’s infrastructure. Small print in the Conservative manifesto allowed for up to £100bn in additional capital spending over the next five years, £78bn of which has not yet been allocated. To date, £22bn has been earmarked for specific projects, such as £500m to reopen old train lines, £2.2bn on a public sector decarbonisation scheme, £4bn on flood defences and £2bn on potholes. An unnamed “senior Tory” told the Sunday Times that the remaining money needs to “show the voters in the red wall seats that they have something to show for voting Conservative”. The new MPs already have an extensive shopping list of demands they promised to voters during the campaign, including rail links to remote ports, new nuclear reactors and train stations. Speaking in Tony Blair’s former constituency of Sedgefield in County Durham on Saturday, Boris Johnson promised to “level up” the UK by “investing in better infrastructure, better education and fantastic modern technology” across the country. He will be under pressure from northern businesses and civic leaders to spend over half of the money – £39bn – on Northern Powerhouse Rail, a new TransPennine rail link from Liverpool to Hull which doesn’t have stops in many Conservative constituencies. Burnham welcomed Johnson’s sentiment but said such promises were easier to make than deliver. “If there is a positive to take from last week, and it’s a big if, perhaps it’s that the political classes are finally addressing the issues the north has long suffered from,” he said. “But I would warn people to be wary of glib commitments around infrastructure because they are decades off. And sometimes these are easy pledges for politicians to make but they never come true because they are beyond the political cycle. “The issue is people’s lives in the here and now. Clearly the north needs infrastructure but that doesn’t tick the box for the north, which is the way the Westminster world is portraying it now.” Burnham said he would like the government to commit funds now to reduce homelessness and to subsidise bus services so they are as cheap as in London. Each month he donates 15% of his own salary – £1,375 – to try to cut rough sleeping in Greater Manchester, and his Bed Every Night scheme was part-funded by more than £300,000 from then Manchester City player Vincent Kompany. The army of new Tory MPs in the north of England have already started to demand investment in their patches. “As a newly elected member for the north-west of England I am going to be fighting very, very hard to get funding here. We need rail infrastructure, we need road infrastructure,” Andy Carter, the new MP for Warrington South, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics North West show. Many new parliamentarians seem to believe in growing public spending rather than reducing it, reversing the party’s dedication to austerity over the past decade. James Daly, who won Bury North from Labour by just 105 votes, said he wanted “more money for public services, more money into our brilliant schools, more money into NHS services and more police on our streets”. Mark Jenkinson, who won the west Cumbrian seat of Workington, wants the government to build small new nuclear reactors in the region and has promised to lobby for better road and rail links to the ports in Workington and Silloth. Ian Levy, whose win in the Northumberland seat of Blyth Valley gave the first indication on election night that the “red wall” was crumbling, wants the return of passenger rail services to the constituency. Graham Stringer, the Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton in Greater Manchester, warned that an increase in Conservative MPs in the north wouldn’t necessarily equal more investment. “We had more Tories in the north of England in the 1980s and that’s when our infrastructure was seriously damaged,” he told the BBC. Transport for the North, the statutory body which advises government on transport in the region, wants the government to fund its £70bn plan to upgrade road and rail connections, including £39bn for Northern Powerhouse Rail. “Now is the time to advance that northern agenda in the national interest. The prime minister must now deliver,” said chief executive Barry White. “We’ve been encouraged by promises to fully commit to Northern Powerhouse Rail, and invest in our strategic and local roads. That, and tackling the challenge of making our networks greener and more inclusive, will be critical in the coming months and years,” he said. A source close to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said no decisions had yet been made on how to spend the £78bn. “Broadly what we are looking for is projects that will improve productivity, offer good value for money and make a real difference to people’s lives,” they said."

          "bodyText": "More than 50,000 people had to evacuate their homes in Brindisi in the south of Italy on Sunday, as experts removed a second world war British bomb. The British bomb, uncovered by construction workers on 2 November during refurbishment works at a cinema, is believed to have been dropped on the port city in 1941. The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera described the operation as “the biggest peacetime evacuation in the country” as more than 54,000 inhabitants were forced to leave their homes for several hours on Sunday morning, within a radius of 1,617 metres from where the bomb was found. As part of the operation, the city’s airport, train station, two hospitals and a prison were shut down. More than 200 inmates were moved to the prison in Lecce, 38km away. At about 1pm, authorities confirmed that experts had successfully defused the explosive, which is 1 metre long and contains 40kg of dynamite. Authorities said that on Monday they will take the bomb to a remote location for a controlled explosion. On 1 December, more than 10,000 residents of Turin were evacuated for the defusal of another British bomb from the second world war, dropped on the city more than 70 years ago. Previously, on 19 October, authorities ordered about 4,000 people living near Piazza Verdi in the northern city of Bolzano to leave their homes for several hours after a second world war explosive was discovered in the city centre. Unexploded ordnances are still a problem throughout Italy, especially near the border with Austria, where most of the undiscovered ones are believed to be. In July, the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano reported that at least 10 unexploded bombs dropped by the Allies are still hidden within the foundations of the archaeological site of Pompeii. In August 1943, Allied air forces dropped 165 bombs on Pompeii, in nine different air raids. The bombs were dropped on 24 August 1943, the same day in AD79 on which the ancient city was formerly believed to have been destroyed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. In October 2018, however, a newly discovered inscription in the city proved that it was destroyed after 17 October in AD79, and not on 24 August, as previously thought. According to statistics from the Italian defence ministry, thousands of second world war bombs are defused in the country every year."

          "headline": "Tinie Tempah’s temple: design to energise and inspire in a musician’s east London home",
          "bodyText": "I’ve always been obsessed by Victorian architecture,” says British rapper, singer and songwriter Tinie Tempah, explaining why he still can’t get over his luck at “finding myself a double-fronted big old Victorian terraced house smack bang in the middle of one of the coolest places in London – Hackney.” He bought the four-storey terrace overlooking east London’s Victoria Park, once owned by the late Alexander McQueen, a few years ago. “McQueen spent millions in here, redoing the interior and making it perfect. I thought, if it’s good enough for him, it’s good enough for me. When I first went in there, a 23-year-old boy from south London, I was overwhelmed. “Walking in, it reminds me of an art gallery, a bit like Saatchi’s on the King’s Road. It’s got glass walls and gigantic white walls, begging to be filled with something.” McQueen did the honours with a stuffed giraffe’s head in the hall. “It’s the pièce de résistance of the house and I thought, you know what, this speaks to me.” Tempah matched it with a zebra’s head in the minimalist white kitchen. He bought it in Dover Street Market – “as you do! They said it died of natural causes. I took their word for it, man.” The relationship between space, wellbeing and creativity underpins Tempah’s interest in design. “The ceilings in the kitchen are so high you could build a mezzanine in there and turn it into four rooms,” says Tempah, who turned the basement into “the ultimate bachelor pad. Growing up in a council estate and then in a 1930s semi-detached, I never had a basement. I was fascinated by it. “I turned it into a boys’ den – punch machine, massive TV and projector, red velvet sofa, a popcorn machine, exposed brickwork.” He added a mini gym and a steam room. A pair of Back to the Future Nike Air Mags trainers are displayed, trophy-like, in a glass box and his music awards line one wall. There’s a laugh in his voice the whole time he speaks. When he first moved in, he kept the rest of the house “secret. I got some of my mates to design it so that it looks like a one-bedroom flat. People I wasn’t too sure of, I would invite them into the house through the basement and pretend there were other flats in the house.” It is a mark of his modesty. “Everyone was my age, and I was a bit shy of it,” he says. The basement is “colourful and fun,” says Tempah, who has moved to the ’burbs since becoming a father; this is his urban bolthole for now. “I naturally gravitate to colour,” says the natty Tempah, winner of GQ’s best dressed award. “It’s something to do with being African. I wasn’t born there, but my motherland is very, very colourful. In my dress sense and my style colour is a no-brainer,” says Tempah, whose own label, What We Wear, nods to a Lagos vibrancy. The golden ostrich-leather L-shaped sofa in the living room is part of McQueen’s legacy – “one of our greatest creatives” – as is the horn chandelier. “Everything happens for a reason. I believe in God and I believe God wanted me to be in this house.” He’s added his own flourishes, including a grand piano. “Take it out and it’s just a massive space. I’m keen for my daughter to learn.” A painting by Chicago artist Hebru Brantley featuring two comic-style superheroes sits on the mahogany partition wall in the main bedroom, one of two in the 3,126 sq ft house: “It reminds me of me and my daughter.” The free-standing bath beyond it reminds him of the creative restrictions of council accommodation. “I’ve always wanted a massive bath,” he says. “I got one like an egg. Maybe it was just having the same generic bath as everyone else on the Aylesbury estate. Here I redid the taps; they’re a bit industrial, like fire hydrants. But it’s not even a thought to do modifications in a council flat; the council does it for you.” The flat was all about “uniformity”. “That’s why design inspires me. Your home is basically like your world. When I think of the way I grew up, I thought everyone lived like that. Then, through the vehicle of music, I began to be exposed to different spaces – photoshoots in Shoreditch, abandoned warehouses. My mind was blown. The same London I was born and raised in had all these different people living in all these different ways.” That includes whopper beds. McQueen had a super-king-sized bedframe built for the main bedroom. “The skylight is exactly the same size as the bed.” Lie there on a summer’s day, he says, and ping on the remote to open the blinds, “and it’s the most incredible feeling. That is when I understand how the amount of light and height and windows you have affects your energy in all kind of ways. “I’ve got a massive window, too, overlooking this incredible Japanese-style garden. I added mood lighting in blues and purples.” He put some koi in the Zen fish pond, too, and built a relaxation pod. “You can see Anish Kapoor’s big slide from up here, too,” he says, and raves about the views of Victoria Park from the roof terrace. “Up there, I feel like I am in this tangible ivory tower. It makes me feel proud to have achieved this for myself at a relatively young age.” But his real pride and joy is the wall of trainers, displayed like rare finds behind tinted glass. “Some people like to collect watches and Gucci handbags. Growing up, trainers were the ultimate achievable luxury. A lot of our heroes were associated with one of the big brands. I’ve got a bit of a collection. It’s my ghetto luxury.”"

          "headline": "Britain’s new political landscape: what the voting numbers tell us",
          "bodyText": "The exit poll stunned us all again. In 2017 it raised the curtain on a night of humiliation for Theresa May and the Conservatives and triumph for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn. This time the roles were reversed. Boris Johnson succeeded where May failed, mobilising Leave voters’ frustration at Brexit deadlock to secure the largest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher’s third victory in 1987, and the largest share of the vote (44%) won by any party since Thatcher’s first win in 1979. Corbyn secured a “glorious defeat” in the summer of 2017, when a surge in Labour support saw the party advance in defiance of expectations of disaster. The defeat this time was not glorious. Labour fell everywhere, but the party collapsed in its northern and Midlands heartlands where voters have returned Labour MPs for generations. The “red wall” collapsed, and Corbyn’s party was left to pick through the rubble of its worst defeat in more than 80 years. Last Thursday I worked at BBC HQ with the team headed by Professor John Curtice to produce the poll released at 10pm on the BBC and ITV that predicted the new political shape of Britain. The security was watertight – our phones were taken from us, and we had to be escorted to and from the toilets. The early declaration of Blyth Valley made clear why the exit poll was projecting the largest Conservative majority for more than 30 years. The Tories took this north-east mining seat for the first time since 1935 on a dramatic 10-point swing. Further shock defeats soon followed in Workington, Darlington and most dramatically in Leigh, the rock-solid north-west seat formerly held by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. This set the pattern for the night: a general slump in Labour support, with huge swings to the Conservatives in older, white, working-class urban seats with many voters who left school with little in the way of educational qualifications. Brexit was a key driver of these shifts. The higher the Leave share, the greater the Tory gain, rising from a modest two-point swing in seats with a Leave vote below 45% to a whopping eight-point swing in seats where 60% or more voted Leave in 2016. Abstract voting statistics cannot capture the crushing emotional blow of this defeat. Seat after seat that had backed Labour in every vote since at least 1945 abandoned the party, many electing Conservative MPs for the first time ever. Rother Valley, Labour since 1918: gone. West Bromwich East, Tom Watson’s former fortress: gone. Stoke-on-Trent Central and Stoke-on-Trent North, both Labour since 1935: gone. In the former mining seat of Bolsover, the former miner Dennis Skinner was ejected after 49 years serving a seat that has returned Labour MPs for nearly twice as long. Then, at 3.30am, minutes after Corbyn delivered a defiant address from his Islington count, the returning officer in Sedgefield announced the first Tory victory in 88 years in Tony Blair’s old seat. This was total repudiation. Labour returned its smallest cohort of MPs since 1935, and the prospect of power looks more remote than at any time since the early 1980s. Yet even in 1983, the party was suffering just its second successive defeat, and even this could be blamed on a divided vote following the SDP split. In 2019, Labour faced a fourth, crushing defeat in a row to a Tory party that has governed for nearly a decade, yet grown its vote each time it faced the electorate. Labour was not the only party bitterly disappointed by last week’s results. The Liberal Democrats entered the campaign with high hopes of mobilising opposition to Brexit to secure an electoral breakthrough, returning the party to relevance after four post-coalition years in the wilderness. Party leader Jo Swinson even sought to present herself as a prime minister in waiting. It was not to be. The party that had sought a Remain realignment finished with fewer seats than before, as just three gains in strongly Remain areas were more than offset by four losses of seats won in 2017, including Swinson’s as she was defeated by the SNP in East Dunbartonshire. The party can at least take some consolation from the substantial increase in its vote share in the most middle-class and Remain areas of London and south England, which leave it well placed to benefit at future elections if the Conservatives’ growing alignment with nationalist and Eurosceptic voters alienates its traditional support base in suburbia. The Brexit party also proved an electoral flop, its thunder stolen by a prime minister who talked of little else but “getting Brexit done”. Nigel Farage’s new outfit secured just 2% of the overall vote, though this low figure in part reflects the party’s decision to stand candidates down in Conservative-held seats. The Brexit party secured an average of more than 5% in the seats where it did stand, and the main effect of its strongest performances was most likely to prevent even more Tory breakthroughs, helping to save Labour incumbents including Ed Miliband, Yvette Cooper and John Healey by splitting the Leave vote. This was also a night of crushing disappointment for the many defectors and independents who sought to put principle before party. The Liberal Democrats fielded new recruits from both Labour (including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger) and the Conservatives (including Sarah Wollaston and Sam Gymiah). All were defeated. Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, expelled from the Conservatives for rebellions over Brexit, achieved large swings as independents but could not break traditional voter alignments in their safe Tory seats. The various former Labour and Conservative MPs who broke away at the start of the year to form Change UK, and mostly now stood as independents, fared even worse, while Chris Williamson lost his deposit standing as an independent after being expelled from the Labour party.. Local roots matter more than national arguments, with the strongest independent performances on the night both coming from homegrown independent candidates in Ashfield and Devon East. The two governing parties in Northern Ireland also had a very bad night, as Remain-supporting opposition parties surged in the region set to be hardest hit by Brexit. The DUP lost two seats, with its Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, defeated by Sinn Féin in North Belfast. The SDLP took a seat each from Sinn Féin and the DUP on huge swings, while the cross-community Alliance party took North Down and ran the DUP very close in East Belfast. These results could herald major changes in the balance of power if, as expected, another election is called in the province next year to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland assembly. The Conservatives were not the only governing party to advance. The SNP, which has ruled at Holyrood since 2007, secured its second Westminster landslide in four years. The SNP slumped in 2017, when its campaign for a second independence referendum turned unionist and Leave voters against it. Two years later, the imminence of a hard Brexit under Johnson has renewed the appeal of independence, and the SNP has 48 of Scotland’s 59 seats. The Scottish Conservatives gave up more than half of the seats gained in 2017, but the biggest loser was Scottish Labour, once again reduced to a single seat on its lowest ever share of the vote. The SNP’s triumph makes a new constitutional clash highly likely in the coming parliament, as a party determined to secure a mandate for independence faces a prime minister firmly opposed to a second Scottish referendum on the issue. The return of a large and loyal majority will transform the Brexit legislative process. The narrow votes and high drama of the past two years will be at an end. Johnson can go to Brussels safe in the knowledge that any deal he negotiates will pass smoothly through the Commons. Brexit will get done. The harder task comes after that. Johnson’s party may be united (at last) over Brexit, but the places it represents are now drawn from opposite sides of a deeply divided nation. The newly elected Conservative MPs represent some of the poorest parts of the country, joining party veterans who represent some of the wealthiest seats. The government will face a new pressure to spend and invest from the party’s new MPs, who will want to show that “getting Brexit done” delivers some tangible results for constituents in their marginal seats. But big spending runs very much against the ideological grain for the Conservative party, and the challenges such seats face after decades of stagnation and neglect cannot realistically be addressed in a single term of government. Voters who discover that Brexit brings little positive change to their lives may soon turn against a party they have long disliked and still distrust. The Conservatives’ future troubles are as nothing compared with the existential crisis facing Labour. The electorate has rejected Corbyn and Corbynism, but loyalists to the radical cause control the commanding heights of the party. Its future direction now lies in the hands of the huge membership Corbyn attracted, who will soon be asked to choose his successor. Will they see this electoral mauling as a signal to change course, or will they regard it as an aberration driven by Brexit fever? Further strife seems inevitable whatever answer the party’s members deliver. The dramas of a gridlocked Commons may be over, for now. But those hoping for a return to boring politics in the new year may be disappointed. Dr Rob Ford is a professor of politics at Manchester University"

          "headline": "This Labour meltdown has been building for decades",
          "bodyText": "On the really painful days in politics, most commentary isn’t worth the name. It’s not analysis, it’s score-settling; party political broadcasts for the I-told-you-so brigade, rushed out by people who won’t admit to ever getting a single thing wrong themselves. So it will go this weekend. You’ll read that Labour’s wipeout was only down to Brexit, by those who won’t admit a flaw in Jeremy Corbyn and his noodling mess of a campaign. Or that it was all the Labour leader’s fault, said by remainers who have seen the position they urged on him blown to bits. It was both, of course. Ask voters in those seats that have just gone blue for the first time since the 1930s, or the Labour would-bes who tried canvassing them. If you want to play election Cluedo, then Corbyn and Brexit go together like Colonel Mustard with the candlestick. But when a party descends into civil war, the factions at each others’ throats rarely bother looking up at the rest of the country. To clear the decks, here’s my confession. I never foresaw the scale of this wipeout – and what it spells for our already failing economy, fractured society and battered democracy frankly scares me. Yet the reporting I’ve done – both in this election and before – made me almost sure Labour was going to lose, and in precisely those areas that are all over the front pages. What were called its heartlands, at least until Thursday night. The Bolsovers, the Bishop Aucklands. The un-metropolitan, unfashionable, never-kissed-a-Tory land that would, as the old saw goes, elect a donkey if it wore a red rosette. And I can say with certainty that this week’s meltdown is the culmination of trends that stretch back decades. They were Corbyn’s poisoned inheritance, not his creation – but any leader who wants to win back those seats will have to deal with them better than he managed. For decades, their party took much of the north, the Midlands and Wales as its birthright. It was the “red wall” that would repel invading Tory forces. As one Labour county councillor in Derbyshire, the region that lost Dennis Skinner as an MP on Thursday night, told me: “They barely bothered to campaign.” While the party bigwigs threw their weight about, the mines and the manufacturers, the steel and the shipbuilding were snuffed out. With them went the culture of Labourism: the bolshy union stewards, the self-organised societies, most of the local newspapers. Practically any institution that might incubate a working-class provincial political identity was bulldozed. In North East Derbyshire last month, I saw up close what was left: warehouses and care work. Bullying bosses, zero-hours contracts, poverty pay and social security top-ups. Smartphones to tell you whether you have a shift that morning, and Facebook to give you the news, or some dishonest fragment of it. Across the UK, mines were turned into museums, factories swapped for call centres, meaningful local government replaced by development quangos. And what was Labour’s response? Tony Blair and Gordon Brown pretended some new skills-based economy lay around the corner and parachuted their own chosen people into these safe seats. Thinktankers, union HQ bureaucrats, ex-student politicians: all found careers and weekend homes for themselves. David Miliband swung from the Institute for Public Policy Research to Blair’s office to MP for South Shields – which, as a longstanding Labour parliamentarian told me yesterday morning, “he couldn’t even find on a map”. Last week Miliband claimed on Twitter: “The biggest Labour challenge is not the angst of the middle class … it is the disbelief of the working class.” This tribune of the Tyneside proletariat now works 3,000 miles away at a New York-based charity that in 2017 reportedly paid him £680,000. What did such smooth-cheeked careerists offer their constituents? Head pats about the “white working class” and their “legitimate concerns”. Never mind that the working class might also be brown. Even as the working class were marginalised politically and destroyed economically, New Labour patronised them into apathy. As the Oxford political scientists James Tilley and Geoffrey Evans argue, the “decline of class-based voting was driven by Labour’s shift to the political centre ground”. Meanwhile, the big gap in the electoral market that opened up was for a party offering a welfare state with reactionary social policy. That was Nigel Farage; now it’s Boris Johnson. What won on Thursday night wasn’t Conservatism: it was Faragism. The Tories’ key personnel come from Vote Leave and, just as in that campaign, are happy to play with racism. Some in Labour might well think they can win back seats by beating up on immigrants and tacking to the right: Johnson’s party can do both with far more gusto. Corbynism began with promises of democracy, but ended up as bunkerised as all other Labour leaderships. What started as anti-austerity movement is now a melange of ideas, most of which look and sound utterly absurd on a doorstep on a rainy morning. In the era of taking back control, Corbyn offered yet more direction from Westminster, with utilities run from the centre and hundreds of billions disbursed from remote state institutions. Many of these ideas are interesting, but few of them were properly worked through and none patiently argued for. Giving workers stakes in firms, a green new deal, free broadband: each one came well-intentioned but bedecked in question marks. Any radicalism that fails to ask the really thorny questions isn’t radical at all. In Britain in 2019, those include: against rampant inequality and climate change, what’s the economy for? What do the public actually want from politics and economics? In the 2017 election I wrote that a party that grew out of social institutions needed to turn itself into a social institution in precisely those areas it historically took for granted. That remains the key task: providing advice to those whose benefits are being slashed, legal support to tenants under the cosh from their landlords, haggling with the utilities to provide cheaper and better deals. Add to that: teaching political and economic literacy to voters, not just activists, and consulting constituents on what issues Labour should be battling on. None of this is as easy as getting the woman with the great backstory to run No 11, or some GCSE marketing talk about finding new “narratives”. It’s hard graft, and it won’t make good copy. But Labour has no God-given right to expect votes, let alone to govern. It needs to renew its contract with its base. The big question is whether it wants to. • Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Australia governments urged to stamp out enslavement and exploitation of Aboriginal artists",
          "bodyText": "More than 21 Aboriginal art centres, leading galleries and high-profile individuals have written to the federal, state and territory governments pleading for action to stamp out “carpetbagging” – unethical art dealing and the exploitation of vulnerable Aboriginal artists – in central Australia. The letters – from award-winning artists Tony Albert and Del Kathryn Barton, gallerists such as Tim Olsen, writer Richard Flanagan, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the Namatjira Trust, the National Art School and eight Aboriginal art centres from the Tiwi Islands to Adelaide – express concern about the re-emergence of exploitative practices in the Aboriginal art industry. “We have called police to extricate dialysis patients from painting sheds where they have been locked into premises, and dealt with the stress caused for people in debt to unethical dealers through loans given to them or their family members,” the director of the Purple House dialysis clinic in Alice Springs, Sarah Brown, wrote. “We have witnessed people being underpaid, paid in alcohol, takeaway food and secondhand vehicles. “We welcomed some dealers shutting up shop or declaring themselves bankrupt a few years ago. It has been disconcerting to see them re-emerging and becoming more aggressive and unscrupulous in their activities in the past 12 months. “The behaviour of some dealers is unquestionably worse than we have witnessed before. Unchecked we fear it will become worse still. “People are often sick, poor and desperate for the quick cash that is available to them through these dealers.” The director of the Alcaston gallery in Melbourne, Beverley Knight, expressed “utter disbelief” that in her 40 years in the industry “many Indigenous artists are still subjected to unfair practice and slavery”. “I have many stories that would shock you including slavery, even death of artists,” Knight wrote. She said that as the Aboriginal art market recovers from the post-global financial crisis slump in 2008, “the same old story surfaces. In fact, now with worldwide attention on many communities and artists across Australia, I believe the federal government needs to act.” Knight and dozens of others have called for a “total revamp” of the Indigenous Art Code (IAC) to toughen its powers to weed out “dodgy” dealers. Other writers recommended the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and police be better supported to protect Indigenous artists. The APY Art centre, whose members have recently been a target of carpetbaggers, said contending with unethical dealers “has become a dangerous and untenable game of whack-a-mole for art centres.” “Measures are taken to protect vulnerable artists against one carpetbagger and it is only a matter of time before another one pops up demonstrating the very same unscrupulous and dangerous behaviour,” APY directors Nyurpaya Burton and Tjunkaya Tapaya wrote. “Unscrupulous private dealers place the health and well-being of our vulnerable artists and staff at risk and cause conflict and violence within our families and communities.” Carpetbagging has been an issue for APY Lands art centres since 2005, they said, but neither a 2007 Senate inquiry, nor the creation of the Indigenous Art Code in 2009, have made an impact and “further action is needed.” All 21 letters have called for an urgent meeting of federal, state and territory governments with artists and their representatives. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said he supports a roundtable with key stakeholders in the Indigenous art industry “to examine these issues and help protect the cultural and economic interests of Indigenous artists.” “The Morrison government is concerned by the production of fake and inauthentic products and the exploitation of Indigenous artists,” Wyatt said. “Over the last month, the National Indigenous Australians Agency has been working with art centres and in communities to seek information about individual cases of unethical dealing of Indigenous art. “We will continue to work with the Indigenous art industry to determine strategies to minimise the risk of exploitation of Indigenous artists through unethical art practices and, where illegal activity is identified, provide this information to the relevant authorities.” A spokesman for the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said: “It is intended the meeting will occur early in the new year. “It is clear that coordinated action between federal, state and territory governments is needed to address the scope and complexity of the issues involved.” In the meantime, the APY Art Centre directors said they were working with lawyers, the police and “important Indigenous organisations to deal with the current situation.” “Indigenous elders like us across the central desert and across Australia have worked hard to grow our art centres,” Burton and Tapaya said. “Our art centres are often the only sources of non-government income and employment in remote Indigenous communities. They are places where our culture is celebrated and instructed daily to future generations. Our art centres are the instruments elders are using to impact the disadvantage we face in our communities.”"

          "bodyText": "Flat Holm/Ynys Echni, Bristol Channel Where better to escape political disappointment than a tiny island? Each is a nation unto itself ready to be declared an independent democratic republic (with yourself as benign dictator-for-life, naturally). Flat Holm, a 24-hectare isle four miles into the Bristol Channel, has been home to hermits, farmers, military garrisons and a cholera hospital. Nowadays, it offers some of Britain’s most isolated accommodation: a hostel, a campsite and a cosy Grade II-listed former lighthouse keeper’s cottage. This last would make a perfect presidential palace from whose garden you could issue statutes banning fake news and charlatans, and welcoming all immigrants (well, except a certain blond one, perhaps). • Cottage £100 a night, sleeps 4, £150 for 6.

It is an elemental hotchpotch of cliffs, geos, tiny townships and a mountainous skyline. Follow the B8011 to remote road’s end at the deserted village of Mealasta. Along the way hike across the vast Uig sands, where the tide retreats almost a mile and it feels as though you walk towards the sea for ever. Around the township of Mangersta the cliffs are serrated and brutal; near Loch Ròg Beag plod through the peat-squelch to beehive shielings (summer dwellings), which resemble stone igloos, once home to Celtic monks seeking solitude. Drop into Loch Croistean, a restaurant run by the indefatigable one-woman band that is Marianne Campbell. Warm up on elderflower and lemon drizzle cake and spiced Moroccan chicken. The Bridge House B&amp;B (rooms from £75 B&amp;B) Brèinis has panoramic views and is great for wildlife-spotting. Mark Rowe, author of Outer Hebrides, the Western Isles from Lewis to Barra, bradtguides.com Easdale island, off Oban, Argyll and Bute Easdale is the smallest permanently inhabited island of the Inner Hebrides, 16 miles from Oban. Despite its remote location, it’s easy to access at short notice: either by tiny ferry or by swimming (though that’s not recommended in mid-winter). It was swimming that drew me there last summer. The island had seven slate quarries dating from the middle of the 17th century until the last slate was cut in the 1950s. These filled with rain water over time to create incredible, deep, turquoise lagoons with steep, dark-slate sides. Many locals learned to swim here and the pools are still used by intrepid wild swimmers who visit the island, and even swim from the mainland to get there. When I visited in June there was a storm gathering, rain lashed my face and the wind was fierce. I arrived at the car park after a long, bumpy single-track car journey from Oban and rang the bell to call the ferry. A five-minute crossing in a little boat takes you to the island which has a wonderful, thriving community with a welcoming, award-winning cafe and folk museum. I wandered around the various lagoons and settled on one to swim in that seemed the most sheltered – and easy to access. I was with locals who knew the site well so was in safe hands. Despite the grey sky, the water was an incredible Caribbean blue, but breathtakingly cold. With this area being visited by basking sharks, minke whales, seals and dolphins, as well as sea eagles, buzzards, golden eagles and kestrels it is an inspiring place for wildlife-spotting wildlife. While there, I saw an edible seaweed tour taking place on the shore at Ellenabeich back on the mainland, with delicious smells wafting over from the beach. It felt like a simpler way of life with a real connection with the landscape. Anna Deacon, co-author of Taking the Plunge: the Healing Power of Wild Swimming (Black &amp; White, £20) Prussia Cove, west Cornwall Writing novels is an antisocial business, so I’m always on the look out for remote, inaccessible hideaways. And while in summer the Cornish roads snarl to standstill and the chocolate-box villages and clifftop paths fill with second-home owners, during the long winter it’s easier to find a secluded spot to write or, equally, to avoid post-election ghastliness. My current favourite – and the place I’ll be editing my next novel – is a tiny house in Prussia Cove. With no connecting road and sitting close to the edge of the cliffs in the idyllic Porth-en-Alls estate, the Look Out is a former wartime coastal observation station, where the only likely disturbance you’re likely to get is the wind, which howls banshee-like around the tiny, exposed house at all times of day and night. A small windmill and solar set-up provides just enough electricity to charge a phone and a laptop and when the wind lets up there’s an alfresco bath with views over Mounts Bay, plus you have your choice of sheltered coves and bays, so your winter dips are likely to be undisturbed too. • The Look Out sleeps 4, from £132 a week, prussiacove.co.uk Wyl Menmuir, author, The Many, ( Salt, £8.99) Northey Island, Essex In the distance are the brown-sailed barges on Maldon’s waterfront. The mudflats nearby are full of wildlife: oystercatchers foraging among sea lavender and samphire, avocets, redshanks and overwintering geese. England’s oldest recorded battlefield is now peaceful green fields and wild salt marshes, recently reclaimed by the sea. Cut off at high tide, Northey’s low-lying hayfields lie opposite the (probable) site of the Battle of Maldon; in AD991, marauding Vikings landed on the island and challenged the waiting Saxon armies on the far side of the river. Like the Vikings, visitors still have to wait for the tide to recede before crossing the seaweed-slippery causeway. Northey is less than a mile from Maldon along the edge of the Blackwater estuary but feels remote. Walking the rough, uneven path around the island’s old sea wall, there are wide views and endless skies. There’s no cafe or hotel on the island. • Phone the National Trust’s warden in advance on 01621 853142 to visit (non-members should pay £2 at Northey House on the island), nationaltrust.org.uk Phoebe Taplin Bardsey Island/Ynys Enlli, Llŷn peninsula, Gwynedd Ynys Enlli is separated from mainland Wales by violent tide races. The high ridge on its eastern edge, which prevents the islands’ few tiny cottages seeing land, makes Enlli feel like it has its back to the world. A haven from human interference for countless rare species, the island also has a wealth of historical sites. It’s even said to be a graveyard to 20,000 pilgrim saints. But these are far from the only reasons to love the island. Today, Enlli is welcoming to those who brave the fierce crossing; its handful of occupants make this a productive place despite constraints of ocean and rough weather. The poet Christine Evans has lived here since 1964 and her precise, evocative work is about birth and growth in an “amniotic sea”, it shows the power of a weather-beaten place to produce clear vision on a world engulfed in very different kinds of hostile tides. There’s a tiny boat (run by Colin, the poet’s son) that departs from Porth Meudwy, near Aberdaron, and it runs regularly through the summer, but people can book places on the boats taking provisions in the winter (as long as they check Colin is doing it in advance). • bardsey.org David Gange, author and lecturer Holkham Bay, north Norfolk When I need to refresh, recharge and reset, I often head for the cleansing open spaces of Holkham Bay on the north Norfolk coast. This vast wind-scoured arena of tide, sky and sand is framed by a wood of neat dark pines. Holkham is glorious but it is also well-peopled by Hunter-wellied, SUV-driving, pedigree dog-walking folk brimming with the joys of a new Thatcherite spring. When I really need to escape, and encounter a span of time that makes five years, Brexit and even the entire edifice of late capitalism seem a ludicrous, hysterical flash in the pan, I head inland to Warham Camp. This iron age fort opens a door to a different time, and another Anglia. Its great chalky earth banks – covered in wildflowers in summer – thrum with intensity, old lives, other eras. In winter, at dusk, barn owls quarter the water meadows beyond and a buzzard drops behind the hedge. I breathe in these other lives and this special place which, empty of today, hints powerfully of a very different tomorrow. The Three Horseshoes in Warham, North Norfolk has double rooms £90-£150. Nearby Wells-next-the-Sea has pubs with rooms, and numerous self-catering cottages listed on Airbnb and Glaven Valley. Patrick Barkham Elan Valley, Powys Unlike the jagged sharp edged peaks of Snowdonia in the north of the country and the mountain bike-friendly escarpments of the Brecon Beacons in the south, the middle of Wales often gets neglected – but that makes it a true escape. Just a couple of hours drive from Birmingham or Cardiff, the Elan Valley is 120 sq km of high moorland that seems to glisten purple in late July as the heather blooms, and shine green and auburn in the autumnal and winter months. Hidden away between its hilly folds is a bothy called Lluest Cwmbach (free to stay in – but do consider joining the volunteer-run Mountain Bothies Association). There, phone reception is non-existent so the sound of texts and notifications about the latest news is instead replaced by the tweet of birds – during the day the sky is filled with them, including some of the UK’s rarest species and, come night-time, this enclave is a Dark Sky Park, so home to some of the best star gazing in the country.

          "bodyText": "Aliya Whiteley’s Skein Island (Titan, £7.99) is a fine example of understated horror, whose accumulating sense of unease is only enhanced by being set in the familiar milieu of contemporary Britain. The eponymous island lies off the Devon coast, and is a refuge for women that offers week-long stays for selected guests. The sole payment required from each woman is a written story, a personal declaration which is then lodged in the island’s library. In measured, quietly assured prose, Whiteley introduces librarian Marianne Percival who, out of the blue, receives an invitation to stay on the island; before she goes, she suffers a terrible sexual attack. Her time there is interspersed with details of how and why the community was founded, and chapters from her husband’s viewpoint, as events conspire to bring about the break-up of their marriage. Whiteley skilfully blends Greek myth with the horrors of the second world war and scalpel-sharp observations of contemporary society in a compelling, disturbing read that examines gender roles and the power of individuals to take control of their lives. Few contemporary writers have Adrian Tchaikovsky’s range, excelling at chunky far-future hard SF as well as high-fantasy epics. Made Things (Tor, £9.99) is a fantasy novel that at just under 180 pages packs in some impressive characterisation and world-building. The city of Loretz is a place of magic, and the suburb of Fountains Parish is the stamping ground of 17-year-old Coppelia, puppeteer and thief, who as a child escaped from an orphanage after the disappearance of her parents. She leads a precarious hand-to-mouth existence, staging her shows and engaging in petty theft, but her fortunes change when she makes the acquaintance of two magical homunculi who give her the gift of imbuing her puppets with life. Add to the mix a monstrous golem, evil crime lords, surprising plot twists and political revolution: Made Things is a thrilling parable about the abuse of power and the ability of the disenfranchised to effect change. After more than a dozen novels for children, Andy Briggs has turned his hand to adult SF in the fast-paced, hi-tech thriller CTRL+S (Orion, £8.99). We are in a future where global warming is a thing of the past and citizens enjoy the benefits of SPACE, a virtual reality realm in which players can live out their dreams – but all is not as it seems. Twentysomething Theo lives with his mother, works in a burger bar to make ends meet and in his spare time loses himself in VR with his friends. When his mother vanishes, he finds his life under threat from a cabal which will stop at nothing to prevent Theo from locating his mother and discovering the secret at the heart of SPACE. CTRL+S more than makes up for its scant characterisation with a slick plot and a neat resolution. Genevieve Cogman’s popular fantasy series features librarian Irene, her dragon companion Kai, and a secret society set up to collect literary texts from a plethora of alternative worlds; it has reached book six and the author’s enthusiasm and inventiveness show no signs of flagging. In The Secret Chapter (Pan, £8.99), Irene is given the task of securing a rare volume entitled “The Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor” from the Caribbean island of the villainous Mr Nemo – who agrees to give her the book only if she will team up with a rag-tag band of thieves to steal a work of art from a hi-tech 21st-century Vienna. The ensuing shenanigans are wittily told, with some great one-liners and comic set pieces, and the resourceful Irene is a delightful protagonist. This is light-hearted fantasy at its page-turning best. Scotland in Space (Shoreline of Infinity/The New Curiosity Shop, £14.95), edited by Deborah Scott and Simon Malpas, is part of an initiative to explore the future of Scotland’s relationship with space. Building on the country’s ambitious recent history – Glasgow already designs and makes more small satellites than any other European city, and Scotland has plans to build the UK’s first spaceport – the volume showcases the work of three science fiction writers, two illustrators and a broad range of academics. Pippa Goldschmidt’s short story “Welcome to Planet AlbaTM!” is a humane meditation on colonialism, in which an Arab American works on a remote Scottish spaceport that offers virtual reality tours of Mars. In “A Certain Reverence” by Laura Lam, a group of scientists and artists from Scotland are invited by a race of enigmatic extraterrestrials to visit their home planet. Russell Jones’s moving “Far” is a long prose poem about lovers who are separated by light years when Scotland is granted its physical independence and shifted to the far side of the universe. Each story is followed by essays commenting on and developing themes raised in the fiction. Scotland in Space is by turns enlightening and entertaining. • Eric Brown’s latest novel is Murder Served Cold (Severn House)."

          "headline": "Why people in Canada’s remote Arctic capital are obsessed with Amazon Prime",
          "bodyText": "﻿ Iguptaq Autut, a comedian from Canada’s Arctic territory of Nunavut, knew he had truly arrived in the territory’s capital the day he walked out of the post office with an Amazon box under his arm. “Walking down the street, I thought: ‘I’m from Iqaluit now,’” joked Autut, 47. Iguptaq had grown up in Igluligaarjuk, a town of just 500 people on the north-western coast of the Hudson Bay, so for him Iqaluit – with a population of almost 8,000 – was the big city. And among its perks was access to Amazon Prime, whose free shipping deal has become crucial to many in Canada’s remotest territorial capital. There are no roads or rail lines into Nunavut, where 40,000 mostly Inuit inhabitants live largely in coastal communities separated by immense stretches of tundra and ocean. The closest urban centres lie thousands of kilometres to the south. Goods – from groceries and household items to construction and mining equipment – can only reach the territory’s 25 communities by air, or – during the four- or five-month window when the Arctic Ocean thaws – by sea. Shipping expenses drive up prices, leaving Nunavut with a cost of living among the highest in the country – even while it struggles with the some of Canada’s highest rates of poverty. All of which helps explain why – if they can afford the C$80 annual fee – Amazon’s free year-round shipping is vital to many in Iqaluit, the only Nunavut community where the service is available. Parents especially rely on it for basics like diapers and formula – which can cost up to twice as much in local shops as in most of southern Canada. So important is the free delivery, that some locals are wary of discussing it in public for fear that Amazon may revoke it. That depth of feeling helps explain the hearty guffaws to Autut’s routine about his first Amazon package at a live event in Iqaluit: “I kept that first box for a long time. Even though it was empty, I’d walk down the street carrying it, just to feel part of the community,” he said. Amazon Canada offered some reassurance: “There are no plans at this time to make any changes,” a representative said. But that also means that Amazon Prime will still be unavailable in Nunavut’s other communities, where shipping costs can be astronomical. Last year, Nunavut airports received 14 times as much air cargo per capita as the national average, according to Statistics Canada. Canada Post, which flies all mail into Iqaluit, said the volume of their parcel deliveries have increased more than 30% per cent in the last three years. Most of those parcels are Amazon boxes. Last month a glitch on Amazon’s website induced a minor panic when Iqaluit customers were told free shipping was unavailable. Some found a workaround by altering their postal code, and soon, Iqaluit’s post office was snowed under by Amazon parcels. “There’s over 20,000 pounds of mail that can’t even be sorted yet at the post office. Please pick up any parcels you can tomorrow!” one city councillor wrote on Facebook. But while items as big as mattresses, fish tanks and wood stoves are delivered by air cargo on Amazon Prime, some things still need to be shipped by sea. Earlier this year, barges ferried 64 self-contained modular units from China for a prefabricated hotel on to the beach of Iqaluit during high tide (the town has no port). Small business owners rely on sea cargo as well. Justin Clarke owns Uasau Soap with his wife, Bernice. Their handmade soaps, shampoos and lotions feature whale blubber and tundra flora. But they also rely on materials sourced in Mississauga, Ontario – more than 2,500km away. “We’re just two little people with a small company, so we have three or four pallets. There’s other people with eight or 16 pallets,” said Clarke, whose grandfather from Newfoundland captained ships to Iqaluit. When the Clarkes’ shipment finally reached Frobisher Bay, it had to wait for days while the modular hotel units were unloaded. Locals hope such delays will soon be a thing of the past, when a new deepwater port on the outskirts of town is completed in 2021. The city currently has no recycling program, so most packaging from its deliveries currently ends up in a landfill. But that too is set to change: a new landfill and sorting facility is under construction, with a goal of eventually diverting up to 44% of household waste to be recycled after it is completed next year. Amid the change, the people of Iqaluit continue to adapt, said Autut. “People used to use CB radios to announce what they were selling – bannock [flat bread], caribou meat, clothes ... When Facebook came around, there was even more of a market for that – and then Amazon came along. “It would be really hard for a lot of people here to live without it.”"

As more of us wake up to the 1.2bn tonnes of carbon produced by the global fashion industry annually, the impact of our wardrobes on the environment is getting harder to ignore. Harder than hiding, on the back hangers, that ugly but expensive top you wore a single time. I messed about during home economics and textiles lessons at school. I messed about in most lessons, in fairness, but particularly when it came to learning to use a sewing machine. Put one in front of me and it might as well be the Enigma machine. Now, sewing and knitting are common among my fellow millennials. I am in awe of friends who conjure Roland Mouret-style dresses from their own fingers, and patch up hole-ridden sweaters, eschewing new purchases; swapping patterns online and carrying needles around in their bags like paperbacks. I remain awful at all of the above, but have come to truly appreciate the satisfaction in making and mending. Especially: fixing. I have always loved solving problems. When I moved into my flat, I refused to be beaten by a narrow doorframe when it came to a chesterfield sofa. A trial and error process of angles followed. For hours. This perseverence extends to fixing things. My solutions aren’t exactly kosher, but I don’t care a jot, as long as they have the desired effect. Sorting a loose connection in a remote by shoving the foil from a chewing-gum wrapper in there; good as new. Noticing that two loose floorboards in my kitchen are cold on the feet, and stuffing newspaper in the gaps. Similarly, folded napkins under a wobbly restaurant table. This isn’t fixing things in the traditional way, ie, properly. I’m not saying that sellotaping an extension cord to the back of a desk is the stuff of restoration experts putting together smashed Ming dynasty vases, but I’ll still stand back, hands on hips and admire my work, smacking palms together after a job well done. Actually, not well done. But done. People more skilled than I am (read: almost everyone), will no doubt take gratification from repairing punctured tyres or reupholstering a chair, saving it from the indignity of the skip. All I know is, I am a champ when it comes to my innovative ways of repairing. In my head, I build cities from ruins and there is a vast relish in that."

          "bodyText": "For 72 days, but who is counting, residents of the New South Wales town of Tenterfield have been told to boil their drinking water. Straight from the tap it reeks of bushfire smoke and heavy doses of chlorine. The community’s filtration system, built in 1932, cannot cope effectively with turbidity levels in the Tenterfield dam that have recently been measured at 60 times the World Health Organisation’s limits. The town’s swimming pool has been closed indefinitely through weeks of extreme heat. “I don’t think anybody has any idea about how bad it really is here just in this locality,” says Helen Duroux, a Kamilaroi traditional owner and chief executive of the Moombahlene Local Aboriginal Land Council. “When you get to the stage where you can’t turn the tap on and get a drink of water out of it then something is severely wrong. “It is depressing. We’ve been through a whole range of catastrophes that have brought us to this place to where we can’t drink our water. I’m not the only one asking: where is it going to end, how is it going to end?” The Tenterfield shire council began advising residents to boil water in early October when the dam levels dropped to about 18% – within months of when the town and its surrounds were expected to run dry. In late November, a storm brought hail and heavy rain and almost two months’ supply of water. The storm also badly damaged silt traps designed to prevent sediment entering the dam and swept massive amounts of ash and debris from recent bushfires into the catchment. Images sent to Guardian Australia, taken during a fishing competition held at the dam on 1 December, show large numbers of dead Murray cod, some more than 1m long, and other fish species washed on to the banks. Residents say the town water supply has at different times smelled of fish, bushfire smoke and chlorine. “You don’t even feel like having a shower in it”, Duroux says. “Everywhere I turn people are saying you can’t even turn your tap on without that smell coming into your kitchen. We’ve still got to wash up in it, we’ve still got to bathe in it. It’s the saddest situation I’ve ever been in I think. “My memories of growing up here has always been a beautiful place, beautiful fresh air, beautiful drinking water. I’m very saddened by the way everything has changed in such a short amount of time. We don’t know if it’s ever going to be like that again.” A worst-case scenario Stuart Khan, a water security expert from the University of NSW, says the combination of drought, bushfire and a one-off heavy rainfall event is a “worst case scenario” for water supply in areas where facilities are often outdated and not able to cope with extreme circumstances. “You’ve got a combination of events happening,” Khan says. “First of all you’ve got a drought which means the catchment is very dry. It also means the reservoir level is very low and there’s no opportunity to dilute new flows that come in. “Fire followed by heavy rain will wash ash into the waterways. There’s also a lot more erosion because you don’t have the trees and roots holding the ground together. Having a reservoir full of soil and sediment and ash is in itself a real problem because it makes water treatment processes more difficult.” Khan says the strong chlorine smell in Tenterfield’s tap water is probably the result of larger than usual doses being used to kill bacteria. “When you have high turbidity, that consumes a lot of the chlorine [used to treat the water],” he says. “You have to super-dose the chlorine to ... achieve a certain residual concentration. They would be ramping that up.” Khan says a fish kill in the dam is “exactly what you would expect” from the bushfire ash, which would have created a chemical reaction and taken oxygen from the water supply. He says that despite treatment processes there remains a risk to human health in similar circumstances. “These might seem like exceptional circumstances but they’re circumstances that can be anticipated to occur. There’s a very strong argument that a lot of towns in New South Wales don’t have the resilience in their drinking water supplies to get through these sorts of scenarios.” The Tenterfield shire mayor, Peter Petty, says the council is doing everything it can to resolve the situation, including ordering a temporary reverse osmosis treatment system that – combined with water from a new bore – should eliminate the smoky taste and odour within weeks. Petty says water that passes through the treatment process is tested twice daily to ensure it meets health department guidelines. “There have been some concerns and people asking for advice and what council is doing. Council is doing everything we can, plus some, to relieve the community of this problem.” He says the old treatment plant’s “use-by date has passed” and the council has plans to build a new one within two years. ‘People shouldn’t be scared’ Tenterfield holds a special place in the Australian story; the birthplace of Federation and the bush town memorialised by the entertainer Peter Allen, whose grandfather George Woolnough sat on his High Street verandah and made his saddles. There are stunning million-dollar Federation-era homes set across from places where the realities of remote Australian communities are writ large; a 10% unemployment rate and an ageing community isolated from services. Few residents question the efforts of local authorities to find an alternative water supply and fix their water problems, but many are angry that temporary measures have not been taken to bring in a supply of fresh and clean drinking water in the meantime. “If it smells, then it’s not an acceptable clean water source. People shouldn’t have to be scared of the drinking water coming out of the taps,” says Luanna Legge, a local artist who has started Tenterfield Water Relief, a charity to distribute clean water to community members. On Wednesday, Legge handed out about 2,600L of clean water to several hundred families. She says demand was overwhelming and that speaking to residents about their experiences was shocking. “I had people with five kids telling me they had to put contaminated water in their kids’ formula because they couldn’t boil or refrigerate enough at a time,” she said. The charity water scenario is increasingly familiar as towns face “day zero” – the end of their water supply – with desperate residents accessing supply brought by community groups rather than governments. Legge says she has been assisted by Russell and Sue Wantling, who started Granite Belt Water Relief across the Queensland border in Stanthorpe. The water comes from the Wivenhoe Dam, less than three hours’ drive to the north, which supplies south-east Queensland. “I’m doing my best but in the long-term I don’t think it’s a feasible option for people to be setting up charities to bring people clean drinking water, I feel like it should be a government responsibility,” Legge says. “There are a lot of children here who are about to have one of the worst Christmases of their lives and that doesn’t seem that reasonable that the reason they’re having to have such a tough time is that governments have left us high and dry. “I feel incredibly angry to be honest. I know a lot of people feel depressed and rejected at being forgotten about. After the horrific fires we’ve experienced here and all the financial burden of the drought these are taxpaying citizens. They pay their rates. These are good people. There’s no justifiable reason why governments shouldn’t be providing them water.” Legge says the United Nations and World Health Organisation guidelines say drinking water should be an acceptable taste, colour and odour, but that she had obtained legal advice that Australian law was insufficient to force government action in the circumstances. “We’ve now been living like this for 70 days and I’ve not heard the slightest skerrick of concern for people here,” Legge says. “If people in Sydney were being forced to live the way people in Tenterfield are forced to live, they would be outraged. “A town of 4,000 people who have been bathing in contaminated water every day for 72 days. Are they going to send someone to see if we’re OK? Where are they?”"

          "headline": "‘They will lock us up or just kill us’: Muslims fearful in West Bengal",
          "bodyText": "It was 81 days ago that Kamal Hussain Mondal, a 32-year-old brick factory worker from a remote village in West Bengal, took his own life. He had been a carefree man and attentive father to his two young sons, and was known throughout Soladana village for his devotion to his wife Khayrun Nahar Bibi. The pair had been married for 13 years but she spoke of their “puppy love”. He would feed her with his hands at mealtimes and on Sundays he would take her out on the back of his bicycle, telling others he loved simply riding through the fields together and chatting. “He promised he would look after us for ever,” says Bibi. “But after he heard about NRC, everything changed and he fell into a deep despair. He told me: all Muslims are going to be driven from India now. They will lock us up or just kill us. Just wait and see.” In mid-September, news that the government planned to carry out a National Register of Citizens (NRC) across India, to be implemented first in West Bengal, began to spread in this tiny village. The exercise will mean that every person in the country will have to prove they or their ancestors are citizens of India, rather than “infiltrators” from Bangladesh or Pakistan, and they will have to have the documentary evidence to back up their claim. According to the government, those who can not prove it will be sent to detention centres and face deportation. The BJP government insists that this vast bureaucratic endeavour is merely a long-overdue bid to count and identify citizens in India and to tackle illegal immigration. However the overwhelming fear among Muslims is that there is a far more sinister communal motive behind the exercise. The BJP openly subscribe to a Hindu nationalist agenda, aiming to establish the world’s largest democracy as a Hindu rather than secular state as enshrined in the constitution. The party’s past five years in power has seen the nation become divided down communal lines, with anti-Muslim hatred stirred up in the process. Since September, as several BJP politicians publicly vowed that “no Hindu will have to leave India because of NRC”, the Muslim community of West Bengal and beyond has grown increasingly worried that the NRC exercise seemed only to target them. According to multiple accounts heard by the Guardian, over the past two months in villages across West Bengal, the RSS – the Hindu nationalist organisation that spawned the BJP – has also been conducting a covert campaign using its grassroots networks to reassure all Hindu households that they have nothing to worry about with the NRC, even if they have no supporting documents. This week, the worst fears of the Muslim community were confirmed. A citizenship amendment bill (CAB), which was passed easily by parliament’s lower house on Monday and by the upper house at midnight on Wednesday, granted citizenship to migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan – but not if they are Muslim. It was signed into law early on Thursday morning. The implications of this amendment are enormous. Should the NRC be carried out, it means that Muslims found without the correct documents will face the threat of being declared an illegal alien. Hindus, Sikhs and Jains are protected. “This amendment undermines the entire secular foundations of India, it violates the constitution which states that no one can be discriminated against on the basis of identity and it threatens the very basis of Indian democracy,” says Kanhaiya Kumar, a student activist leading the charge against the NRC. “But most of all it sows communal poison and hatred by writing into law that Muslims are second-class citizens.” The climate of fear that has seeped into Muslim communities across India since the nationwide NRC was proposed is increasingly palpable. In poorer communities in particular, it is common for people to have none of the necessary documents to prove their Indian citizenship, with the paperwork lost to flooding or fires or simply carelessness. Others have documents with incorrect information on them. In Mondal’s case, it became too much to bear. While his family had only ever lived in India, he realised he was missing several key documents including his father’s birth certificate, while his own name was spelt differently across the paperwork he did have. “For almost a week he did not sleep or eat and he would stay up all night looking up NRC on his phone,” says Bibi. “He became very depressed, he would sit with his head against the wall or lie down on the floor in despair, telling me that we would certainly be driven out.” Mondal had attempted to get his documents corrected online at the local cyber cafe, but struggled due to his illiteracy, and as the week went on, anxiety began to consume him. By that Saturday he had become quiet and withdrawn, only speaking to repeat his fears of being taken away, and when he slipped out of their bed at 4am on Sunday, Bibi presumed he was going to the market for an early cup of tea to ease his restlessness. But at 5.30am she was shaken awake by her sister-in-law. Mondal had killed himself. Wiping away tears with her headscarf, Bibi said their youngest son, five-year-old Asadun, was still struggling to understand what had happened. “He keeps asking me if we get all the documents sorted, will my father come back?” she says. To date, at least 6 people have killed themselves in West Bengal over concerns related to the NRC. The concerns are not unfounded. An NRC exercise was recently carried out in Assam, which resulted in 1.9 million people being left off the citizenship list for reasons as minor as spelling mistakes on their documents, and some for no definable reason at all. So-called “illegals” are due to be sent to detention centres at the end of December. The Assam NRC was not initially designed to be rolled out nationwide; rather, it was originally based on decades-old legislation to help protect the indigenous Assamese people, both Muslim and Hindu. However, critics say it has been hijacked by the BJP as a way to sow religious discord and was reframed by the party as a means to weed out illegal Muslims. Observers note that it was only after discovering that 1.5 million Hindus in Assam had been left off the citizenship list that the BJP was prompted to introduce this week’s amendment, to ensure that if the NRC was rolled out nationwide, no more Hindus could be declared illegal. Aparajita Bhuyan, BJP state spokesperson in Assam, was adamant that the measure was “not anti-Muslim” but added that all those Hindus in Assam found to be illegal would be given citizenship, while “after the Muslim illegal immigrants are identified in Assam, the government will decide what action would be taken against them.” While 10 new detention centres are currently being built in Assam, and even more in West Bengal, questions remain over what the BJP government intends to do with the millions of detainees it will have on its hands after the NRC is rolled out. While it has publicly spoken of deportation, this will be impossible because neither Bangladesh, Pakistan nor Afghanistan has agreed to take them. It will similarly be too costly and impractical to keep everyone in prisons. One suggestion, already being proposed to companies in Assam, is that the detainees could be used as a huge cheap labour force in factories and industrial plants. Days after the citizenship bill was first passed by parliament at the start of this week, its effect in stoking communal tensions was already evident. In the small West Bengal village of Ramnathpur, home to a predominately Muslim population, villagers spoke of “simmering tension’” that had arisen lately between Muslims and Hindus. “We are panicking because India is adopting the hate politics of Nazi Germany and we Muslims are the target,” said Maruf Hossain, 25. Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP in West Bengal, said the fear in the Muslim community was unfounded. “Muslims are perhaps scared because some groups or parties are misleading them on this issue,” said Ghosh. “Our prime minister and home minister have clearly said that Muslims should not have any reason to worry. All our [BJP] party leaders are also assuring them they should not be scared. This bill deals only with the non-Muslim minorities from the neighbouring countries. The bill has nothing to do with Indian Muslims. All Indian Muslims will remain citizens of this country.” Yet it is not just those in rural communities that there is concern. One Muslim professor, who asked to remain unnamed out of fear of the authorities, said a “communal poison” had seeped into society in the past few months. “Muslims in India have a gun to their head now,” he said.

          "headline": "A-Z of election night jargon",
          "bodyText": "A Agents: Everyone standing for election has an agent who manages their spending, form-filling and communications with election authorities, and is usually the person scowling as the result is read out if they haven’t won. Angry voters: Politicians are unlikely to encounter them on election night, but you might get a bit of heckling as the results are read out, especially high-profile, unpopular government ministers. Angst: The feeling you’ve had in your stomach all day about how crucial this election result is going to be. B Bar charts: Notorious for appearing on leaflets to give a misleading impression of how close one party is to catching another. Always read the small print. The only bar charts that ultimately count are the results on the night. Boat: Do you remember when the BBC spent £30,000 hiring a boat in 2010 to have an election night party with random celebrities, who got increasingly drunk and made less sense as the night wore on? So do they, and that’s why they won’t be doing it again. C Change UK/the Independent Group/the Independent Group for Change: They’ve changed their name as many times as their number of candidates, but Anna Soubry, Chris Leslie and Mike Gapes are still standing under the banner of the new centrist party that so spectacularly failed to get off the ground earlier this year. “Chaos with Ed Miliband”: A 2015 tweet from David Cameron promised: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” Four years later, we’ve had two general elections, one EU referendum, and three different prime ministers. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Constituency: The country is divided into 650 constituencies, and each is represented by an MP. Count: After the polls close, the ballot boxes from each polling station are transferred to one central location for each constituency and counted – often overnight. By law you have to start counting within four hours of polls closing, otherwise you have to send in a report explaining why. Some of the more remote voting locations in the UK are permanently on the naughty step. D Deposit: To stand as an MP, you have to pay £500. You get it back if you secure more than 5% of the vote. If you don’t, bizarrely it goes to the Queen, via the Treasury. There are some candidates, like the anti-abortion campaigners who have been targeting Stella Creasy in Walthamstow, where people will cheer when they lose their deposit. Dimbleby: No Dimbleby this election. Huw Edwards steps into the shoes of the man who presented every general election for the BBC since 1979. You can always follow @DIMBLEBOT though if you miss him. Dogs: Expect to see a lot of pictures of dogs at polling stations in the dead hours while the polls are open. There’s really not much else to report on polling day. Bonus points if you spot a horse. You can lead it to a polling station, but you can’t make it vote etc etc. Doorstep: Politicians will frequently reference the “doorstep” when being asked: “Doesn’t the result in Flydale North show that your leader/policy/attitude is unpopular with voters?” In reply, they will confidently assert: “That’s not what I was hearing on the doorstep, Kay.” E Elites: If you are an Eton-educated son of nobility, then the “elites” are the media and the civil service and remainer business leaders conspiring against the people. If you a horny-handed daughter of the soil, then it is the latte-sipping metropolitans you have in your sights. Basically, the other side. Exit poll: At 10pm on polling day an exit poll announces the expected result. It is usually pretty accurate – hence the gasps when it emerged that in 2017’s snap election Theresa May had lost her majority. F False statements: It is a criminal offence to make a false statement about a candidate during the election campaign – not that anybody seems to take any notice. First past the post: Unlike other voting systems, in the UK it is simply the candidate with the most votes in each constituency who gets to be its MP. No second choices. No transferable vote. No proportional representation. Just winner-takes-all. G Graphics: The bigger and more ludicrous the better, the BBC seems to think. Poor Jeremy Vine will be hopping around in front of virtual No 10s, virtual Houses of Parliament, and who knows what else. Hopefully, the cowboy accent won’t return. H Hot mic moment: When a politician says something, thinking that the mics have been switched off, but which gets picked up by the media. Came of age in the election sense when Gordon Brown used the phrase “bigoted woman”. Hung parliament: When no party has won enough seats to control over half of parliament, it is described as a “hung parliament”, because it is hanging in the balance. I If: “If these exit poll numbers are correct, and I’m not saying they are Huw” will be the start of virtually every sentence between 10pm and 11:15pm until one of Sunderland or Newcastle is the first constituency to declare. Independent: There might be a couple of independent candidates returned to parliament this year. Principled anti-Brexit ex-Tory rebels David Gauke and Dominic Grieve will be hoping voters will prioritise personal loyalty to their MP over party loyalty. J Joke candidates: There is long and proud tradition of joke candidates standing against major figures. Who can forget Lord Buckethead and Elmo opposing Theresa May in 2017? Insert your own punchline about which party leader you also think is a joke this time around. L Landslide: That is what the Tories are hoping for with this election – a majority in parliament of around 100+ MPs, which would allow a government to push through its programme without having to worry about rebels on their own side forcing compromise. Lifts: Party activists will be haring round in cars trying to ferry old, vulnerable and less mobile voters to the polls to cast their votes. You’ll enjoy several people reheating on social media the old anecdote that their dad always used to get the Tories to give him a lift down to the polling station, and then voted Labour every time. M Manifesto: Long list of promises just waiting to be broken or contradicted. Maps: There will be a lot of talk about the changes to the electoral map. Someone will almost certainly produce a viral tweet that compares the voting pattern in 2019 to something or other in 1919 such as coal mines or provision of public libraries. Thinking they’ve made a great point about social history, they are basically revealing that people in Britain have mostly lived in the same major urban areas for a couple of centuries. Look out for the giant election map outside the BBC’s Broadcasting House in London. It’s December, why wouldn’t you build it indoors? Marginal seats: Parliamentary constituencies that have a history of changing hands between parties, or in which the incumbent MP has a very small majority. They are the battlegrounds on which elections can be won or lost. Eleven seats were won by fewer than 100 votes in 2017. N Non-voters: There are usually enough of them across the country that they could have completely overturned the result if they had showed up at the polling station. O “OK boomer”: Joyfully dismissive retort from millennials to the people who enjoyed free education, free healthcare, affordable housing and chunky state pensions, when they start complaining that young people these days spend too much money on avocados and that the country can’t afford any of the things Labour is promising any more. Opinion poll: An attempt to predict the outcome of the election. It usually involves asking about 1,000 people around the country how they voted last time and how they intend to vote this time, and extrapolating a result from that. Our poll tracker shows what people have been saying – that the Tories go into the election as favourites, but that a hung parliament is still a possibility. P Postal vote: If you’ve already posted your vote, it might have already been opened and verified. This sometimes gives political parties a clue as to how they are performing. Don’t mention them to Laura Kuenssberg though. Psephology: A busy night ahead expected for the Is Sir John Curtice On TV? Twitter account. Expect a lot of sightings of the legendary professor giving his view on the numbers as they come in. Psephology is the study of election results and polling numbers, and you’ll be able to follow our own Dan Sabbagh’s view on what it all means on our live blog during the night. Purdah: A much misunderstood term. Once an election is called, civil servants and local government officials aren’t allowed to announce anything that might influence the election. There’s a 41-page guide from the Cabinet Office about what they can and can’t do. It doesn’t prevent media outlets or your Insta stories from getting political. Q Queen’s speech: No, not the one at Christmas that Jeremy Corbyn couldn’t remember if he watched or not, the one in parliament. And yes, we did just have one in October. But we’ll get another one before Christmas, outlining the future plans of whoever has ended up with the keys to 10 Downing Street. Queues: “I’ve never seen queues like it at the polling station.” A regular stream of social media posts at every election since social media began. R Recount: If a vote is close, candidates can ask for a recount. All the ballot papers are checked and counted again until the election officials are satisfied with the result. Returning officer: The returning officer in each area is the person charged with running the election. They are the one who gets to read out the results on national TV. It’s a bit like when they go to the jury from Syldavia in the Eurovision song contest and someone has their 15 seconds of fame. S Safe seat: A seat where the MP has such a large majority that it is almost impossible for them to lose. Speaker: Traditionally, none of the major parties oppose the Commons Speaker in their constituency, so the new Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, can expect to be comfortably re-elected. He is, though, facing a challenge from an independent who has officially changed his name to Mark Brexit-Smith. Swing: In a two-party system, the “swing” is a measure of how much support has shifted from one party to another. If party A were 4% behind party B, they’d need a swing of a fraction over 2% to catch up ie one party loses 2% support, the other party gains 2% support, and that cancels out a 4% lead. The national level of swing has become a less useful figure now that the SNP is dominating elections in Scotland and the Liberal Democrats have established their south-west strongholds. T Tactical voting: Casting a vote for a party you don’t particularly support, because they are more likely to win in your area against a party you definitely don’t support. Tellers: Party activists hanging around outside polling stations asking you for your polling number, so they can cross you off their lists. In tight contests, parties may go round “knocking up” on the doors of people they think might vote for them, to try to propel them down to the polls. Terrible night: Have a shot every time someone says: “These numbers show it has been a terrible night for [INSERT NAME OF THE OTHER PARTY]” and you’ll be drunk and asleep by quarter-past-midnight. Turnout: The turnout figure, usually expressed as a percentage, indicates how many people out of those registered to vote did so. In the 2010s the highest was 2017, with 68.7%, the lowest was 2010, with 65.1%. It is yet to be seen how having the country’s first December election since 1923 will affect the number. U Undecided voters : A problem for opinion pollsters, who often exclude them from their headline figures, and the very people parties have been wooing in their campaigns. In a tight election, it is their last-minute decisions that will shape the next parliament. #UsePens: There’s a persistent social media conspiracy theory that if you use the pencils “they” provide, “their” secret agents come along later, rub out your vote, and replace it with the vote that “they” want. If you are voting today, use pens. V Voter registration: There was a huge push to get voters registered and 2.8m applications were filed after the pre-Christmas election was called. If you haven’t registered to vote it is too late now. But who knows, if the result is indecisive, we might yet end up with another one in April. Sign up to vote in that one here. W Westminster bubble: You’ll have heard the phrase: “Politicians needed to get out of the Westminster bubble and speak to real people.” Today is the day that the “real people” get to speak. Brush up on what that is like with our Anywhere But Westminster video series. X X: The cross you put on your ballot paper to indicate who you want to vote for. Actually a tick, or the word “Yes” or a smiley face would probably count as well. Ballot papers will generally be accepted if there has been a clear intention to vote for one candidate. In the European parliamentary elections, a vote for the Green party was counted after the voter wrote a swear word next to all of the other candidates. Do our quiz to see how much you know about being in charge of an election, which tests you on which ballot papers you would accept. Y Youth vote: Every election there is a huge campaign to get young people and potential first-time voters registered and voting. In 2017, around 57% of those aged 18-19 voted, while 84% of over-70s voted. If younger people vote in large numbers today, they could significantly swing the election. Z Zzzzz: You struggling to stay awake in the early hours of Friday 13 December, waiting for the exit poll to turn into real results. At least you’ll have Andrew Sparrow on our politics live blog for company."

          "headline": "AI expert calls for end to UK use of ‘racially biased’ algorithms",
          "bodyText": "An expert on artificial intelligence has called for all algorithms that make life-changing decisions – in areas from job applications to immigration into the UK – to be halted immediately. Prof Noel Sharkey, who is also a leading figure in a global campaign against “killer robots”, said algorithms were so “infected with biases” that their decision-making processes could not be fair or trusted. A moratorium must be imposed on all “life-changing decision-making algorithms” in Britain, he said. Sharkey has suggested testing AI decision-making machines in the same way as new pharmaceutical drugs are vigorously checked before they are allowed on to the market. In an interview with the Guardian, the Sheffield University robotics/AI pioneer said he was deeply concerned over a series of examples of machine-learning systems being loaded with bias. On inbuilt bias in algorithms, Sharkey said: “There are so many biases happening now, from job interviews to welfare to determining who should get bail and who should go to jail. It is quite clear that we really have to stop using decision algorithms, and I am someone who has always been very light on regulation and always believed that it stifles innovation. “But then I realised eventually that some innovations are well worth stifling, or at least holding back a bit. So I have come down on the side of strict regulation of all decision algorithms, which should stop immediately. “There should be a moratorium on all algorithms that impact on people’s lives. Why? Because they are not working and have been shown to be biased across the board.” Sharkey said he had spoken to the biggest global social media and computing corporations, such as Google and Microsoft, about the innate bias problem. “They know it’s a problem and they’ve been working, in fairness, to find a solution over the last few years but none so far has been found. “Until they find that solution, what I would like to see is large-scale pharmaceutical-style testing. Which in reality means that you test these systems on millions of people, or at least hundreds of thousands of people, in order to reach a point that shows no major inbuilt bias. These algorithms have to be subjected to the same rigorous testing as any new drug produced that ultimately will be for human consumption.” As well as numerous examples of racial bias in machine-led decisions on, for example, who gets bail in the US or on healthcare allocation, Sharkey said his work on autonomous weapons, or “killer robots”, also illuminated how bias infects algorithms. “There is this fantasy among people in the military that these weapons can select individual targets on their own. These move beyond the drone strikes, which humans aren’t great at already, with operatives moving the drone by remote control and targeting individual faces via screens from bases thousands of miles away,” he said. “Now the new idea that you could send autonomous weapons out on their own, with no direct human control, and find an individual target via facial recognition is more dangerous. Because what we have found out from a lot of research is that the darker the skin, the harder it is to properly recognise the face. “In the laboratory you get a 98% recognition rate for white males without beards. It’s not very good with women and it’s even worse with darker-skinned people. In the latter case, the laboratory results have shown it comes to the point where the machine cannot even recognise that you have a face. “So, this exposes the fantasy of facial recognition being used to directly target enemies like al-Qaida, for instance. They are not middle-class men without beards, of whom there is a 98% recognition rate in the lab. They are darker-skinned people and AI-driven weapons are really rubbish at that kind of recognition under the current technology. The capacity for innocent people being killed by autonomous weapons using a flawed facial recognition algorithm is enormous.” Sharkey said weapons like these should not be in the planning stage, let alone ever deployed. “In relation to decision-making algorithms generally, these flaws in facial recognition are yet another argument – along with all the other biases – that they too should be shut down, albeit temporarily, until they are tested just like any new drug should be.”"

          "bodyText": "One of the first drone deliveries was operated not by a tech giant from Silicon Valley but by small-time criminals who saw potential in the new technology. In late 2013, days before Amazon announced its futuristic plan to operate a fleet of automated vehicles, four people were arrested for attempting to smuggle contraband into a Georgia state prison using a drone. Guards had noticed a remote-controlled helicopter hovering above Calhoun prison. Later, they found the six-rotor drone in a nearby car alongside what appeared to be its cargo: pouches of tobacco and mobile phones. Five years later, Amazon still hasn’t launched its sky delivery service, while the proliferation of cheap, commercially available drones worldwide has far outpaced the ability of authorities to control them. In the past two years, non-military drones have shut down Gatwick airport for 36 hours, been used in an apparent assassination attempt against Venezuela’s president and even been flown by Isis fighters to drop grenades on their enemies. Responding to the threat, a host of companies – from state-run defence contractors to startups – have developed products that can detect, track, jam, destroy or even commandeer rogue drones. These services comprise a market that is expected to grow by between 20% and 30% in the next few years and could be worth £4bn by the middle of the next decade. “It’s a very, very big issue,” said Alex Riahi, who works for Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Israel’s major aerospace and defence manufacturer. In September IAI released its Popstar system, which can detect and track drones up to 4km away in day or night. IAI sells drone defence to foreign governments to place along their borders or around sensitive sites such as army bases or power plants to avoid spying or air attacks, and also provides equipment to shoot down military drones. But it is increasingly finding interest from other clients – airports, for example – who want to protect against shop-bought drones. Although coy about pricing, Riahi said the cost of these systems was less than the expense to a major airport of shutting down for an hour. Israel, with its history of drone warfare, has become a key producer of anti-drone products, especially as members of the military intelligence services often transfer their knowledge to start hi-tech companies after they leave the army. The booming industry has also sprung up in the US, Europe and China. A host of smaller firms are entering the market. Vorpal, another Israeli company, has compiled a database of signals emitted by 95% of drones that are available to buy, giving its clients the ability to detect most drones buzzing overhead. “There is no civil technology today that gives you 100%, bulletproof, all-cases, all-drone-types solution,” said Avner Turniansky, Vorpal’s vice-president of strategy. His VigilAir product has been tailored to work in dense urban environments where high buildings and radio “noise” often hide drone signals. During this year’s Eurovision song contest held in Tel Aviv, Israeli police bought his system and caught more than 20 people who were operating drones in no-fly zones over venues. Authorities wanted to clear the air to prevent any potential attacks, but also to make sure drones did not accidentally fall over large crowds. Turniansky said none of the perpetrators had apparent nefarious aims and in most cases they were completely clueless that they were flying illegally. Drones often have internal safeguards such as software that prevents them from flying over sensitive sites, meaning the drone will stop in midair as if it has hit a virtual wall. But Turniansky said at least one confiscated drone at Eurovision had been tampered with to block its GPS, allowing it to fly freely. Once detected, drones can be taken control of with a remote cyber-attack or, more straightforwardly, shot out the air with net guns. Radiofrequency jammers are also used, although not in airports where they could affect safety systems. “In an airport, nobody wants to jam,” Turniansky said. He said Vorpal’s system not only tracks drones but also allows users to locate the people flying them. This information is often more crucial than the location of the drone, as taking down one drone disrupting an airport is useless if the operator has more to hand. “In such cases, the ability to tell you where the operator is very valuable,” Turniansky said. Nimo Shkedy is also Israeli but his drone defence company, ApolloShield, is headquartered in New York. He sells counter-drone technology, including jamming “guns” that block drones with radio waves. In the US, these types of systems can only be sold to government agencies or with official authorisation, but the list of potential clients is growing. “We started with stadiums and public events,” said Shkedy. “But now this technology and these requirements are all over the place – airports, VIPs, prisons, borders, power plants, oil refineries, nuclear power plants, seaports, yachts,” he said. Shkedy and his business partner started the firm in 2016 after hearing that the Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli had unsuccessfully attempted to shut down the airspace above her wedding to prevent paparazzi from using drones. If she and her billionaire fiancé, Adi Ezra, had anti-drone products, they could have blocked off their area themselves. “We realised it was a big problem and it’s on the rise,” Shkedy said. “And it’s been on the rise ever since.”"

          "bodyText": "I could not keep my eyes off the graves, could not stop staring at them even as I walked away, turning repeatedly to look over my shoulder at them as I slogged my way across the gravel-strewn shore of Beechey Island until they disappeared from view. It was profoundly saddening to contemplate their presence on a low-lying, windswept outpost of the Canadian Arctic, to imagine the fear and loneliness those buried here must have felt as they faced death in the harshest of conditions, thousands of miles and a world removed from their homes. And yet, they were the lucky ones, the first casualties of an expedition that vanished 173 years ago while searching for the fabled Northwest Passage between Atlantic and Pacific, whose remaining members met their doom after their ships became frozen in never-yielding sea ice, who perished one by one waiting for a summer that never came. Not until 1906 was the Northwest Passage eventually transited by ship; the feat would not be repeated for nearly 40 years. Since then, as Arctic sea ice has rapidly dwindled, almost 300 transits have been made of the Passage, the bulk of them since 2007; 24 took place in 2019. On this day, I arrived courtesy of that most modern of intrusions into remote areas: a passenger ship called the Ocean Endeavour, chartered by a company called Adventure Canada. What was once the graveyard of Victorian explorers is now a destination for any sufficiently adventurous and well-financed tourist. The Arctic is warming, and its sea ice is melting, prompting fevered dreams of ever-easier access, and a renewed jockeying among Arctic nations for status, profit and ownership. Journeying through the Passage over the best part of three weeks in September yielded the expected fruits of an Arctic journey. A passing ice floe hosted a polar bear seemingly just minutes removed from killing a seal, the victim’s blood leaving a crimson trail on the ice. A diversion into a bay revealed first a polar bear feasting on a beached beluga carcass, then another bear on an opposite cliff and then two more, and finally an abundance of harp seals and seabirds thrashing through the water as they feasted on a banquet of Arctic cod. We stepped on the low-lying beach of the tiny Jenny Lind Island, randomly named after a Swedish opera singer, and squinted through binoculars at musk oxen in the distance. We passed through the narrow confines of the Bellot Strait, its eponymous co-discoverer a French explorer who was blown off the ice and to his death in the freezing water below, the cliffs on its southern side marking the northernmost point of mainland North America. We encountered less than a handful of other ships: a Canadian coastguard icebreaker – which, a few weeks earlier, had deployed to help the Ocean Endeavour through some stubborn summer ice – and a pair of other passenger vessels. There was nothing, at any point in the journey, to suggest that this barely trafficked waterway might be at the heart of an international dispute, let alone the subject of multiple studies into its viability as a commercial shipping route. But covetous eyes gaze upon the Northwest Passage, more so as Arctic ice retreats; establishing authority over the Passage proffers the prospect of establishing control over access, and there is no consensus as to where that authority lies. As far as Canada is concerned, there is no controversy over the matter. Citing among other things legal precedent and historic use – particularly a millennium or so of use by Inuit – Ottawa considers the Northwest Passage to be its internal waters. The United States, brandishing a different legal case and echoing its longstanding position on such matters elsewhere, counters that it is an international strait, “an area of high seas that connects two bodies of water which is open for peaceful use by a vessel from any state”. The dispute did not really flare up until the SS Manhattan, a US-flagged oil tanker, transited the Passage (with some difficulty) from east to west and back again in 1969, carrying a symbolic barrel of Prudhoe Bay oil on the return trip, accompanied by a US Coast Guard icebreaker, without seeking authorization. Ultimately, the two countries negotiated an Agreement on Arctic Cooperation, in which they effectively agreed to disagree on the matter. But as Arctic ice melts, so too does the veneer of friendly differences. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, argued in a fiery speech to the Arctic Council in May that “Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st-century Suez and Panama Canals”, and dismissed Canada’s claims to the passage as “illegitimate”. Of late, China – increasingly interested in the possibilities of Arctic shipping lanes and a relatively recently minted observer to the Arctic Council – has weighed in, last year publishing an official Arctic policy that, among other positions, gently echoed the American stance on the matter of access to polar passageways. That such disagreements are articulated at all is testament to the promise that the Northwest Passage is perceived to offer. That promise is perhaps best encapsulated in numbers: numbers such as 15,700 (the distance in kilometers from Yokohama to Rotterdam via the Passage) and 7,600 (the number of kilometers shorter that route would be relative to the Panama Canal), numbers that to some conjure a vision of the Northwest Passage providing a bustling corridor between Pacific and Atlantic and finally fulfilling a destiny centuries in the making. Queen Elizabeth is said to have waved from her palace window as Martin Frobisher set out on his first expedition to find the Passage in 1576, such was the import attached to establishing a trade route to the Pacific. But the history of the search for the Northwest Passage is a catalogue of incremental successes interspersed with misery and misfortune. In 1611, having mapped the river and the bay that are now named after him, Henry Hudson’s attempts to probe farther west into the ice and the unknown ended with his crew mutinying and sending him overboard in a lifeboat, never to be seen again. Eight years later, Jens Munk and his band of 65 men made it as far as Hudson Bay, and spent the winter near the mouth of Churchill River; racked by cold, scurvy and probably trichinosis from eating insufficiently cooked polar bear meat, none bar Munk and two others survived to see the following spring. It was in such inauspicious footsteps that Sir John Franklin, and the 128 officers and men of HMS Erebus and Terror, followed as they sailed out of the River Thames on 19 May 1845 on the most ambitious and extensively equipped expedition to the Passage yet. Whaling ships spied them in upper Baffin Bay, just east of the entrance to the Passage, on 26 July; and shortly thereafter the expedition vanished without trace. Subsequent searches turned up clues: the graves on Beechey Island, where the ships spent the winter of 1845-86; a note indicating that by 22 April 1848, the ships had been trapped in ice for over 18 months, Franklin and 23 others had died, and the remaining crew was setting out south across land in search of safety; Inuit stories of starving white men who had died, one by one, in the snow. In 2008, the then Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, launched a major effort to find the wrecks of the Erebus and Terror. The goal of the search was not, wrote author Paul Watson in his book Ice Ghosts: The Epic Hunt for the Lost Franklin Expedition, purely historical or archeological; rather it was “part of his strategy to mold public opinion”, with the Northwest Passage a powerful tool for “stirring Canadian nationalism in the twenty-first century”. Harper’s intent, Watson asserted, was to shore up support for a muscular assertion of Arctic sovereignty, laying claim “over a vast stretch of the Arctic seabed, straight up to the North Pole”. As the ice retreats, revealing a potentially resource-rich seabed below, Canada is not alone in its designs on the broader Arctic. In 2007, a Russian submarine planted a rust-proof titanium flag on the seabed at the North Pole, and in October of this year, Russia’s ministry of defense proclaimed that it had collected enough evidence to support its claims to much of the Arctic Ocean. Meanwhile, Denmark has laid down its own metaphorical marker, based on a claim that a large area up to and beyond the North Pole is connected to the continental shelf of Greenland – which, of course, the Trump administration earlier this year expressed a desire to buy. (That US interest recently prompted the Danish defense intelligence service to declare the island the country’s number one national security priority, ahead of terrorism and cybercrime). Russia actually supports Canada’s position on the Northwest Passage because it considers itself to have similar dominion over the Northeast Passage, which the country refers to as the Northern Sea Route and which stretches above Russia’s northern coast, from the Bering Strait to the Barents Sea. With a strong assist from Russian investment in ports and infrastructure, the Northern Sea Route is already proving commercially viable: it is estimated that 29m tons of shipments will pass through its waters this year, a 40% increase on 2018; Vladimir Putin has set a target of 80m tons of goods a year by 2024. And while the 800 or so vessels that transit all or part of the NSR annually is hardly enough to threaten the approximately 15,000 that transit the Panama Canal each year, it is far ahead of the Northwest Passage. The Northwest Passage remains relatively narrow and relatively shallow, and even in a warming world its twisting straits remain vulnerable to blockage from the sea ice that breaks up and sweeps down from the Arctic Ocean. The Northern Sea Route, in contrast, has no winding narrows with which to contend; there is essentially only the Russian coast to the south and the Arctic Ocean and its retreating sea ice to the north, and its waters are considerably deeper. For all the hype about its potential, for all the lives that have been lost and the ships that have been wrecked attempting to map its contours, for all the butting of diplomatic heads, it may well be not the Northwest Passage, but the Northern Sea Route that ultimately provides the Arctic pathway which so many have for so long desired. Harper’s Northwest Passage initiative did have some success. In 2014, searchers found the wreck of HMS Erebus; three years later, they also found the almost perfectly preserved wreck of HMS Terror. Two years after that, I and others from the Ocean Endeavour stood on a barge and watched as underwater archeologists explored the nooks and crannies of, and retrieved artifacts from, the Erebus wreck below us. We were the first visitors to the wreck site, and the personal nature of some freshly retrieved artifacts was jarring. I looked at the shoe that one archeologist tenderly tended to and wondered who might have worn it, and how and when he died. What would he have thought of the notion that, almost 200 years after he set sail, the Northwest Passage would still exercise the thoughts of so many? Would he even recognize it? Certainly, on this day, with ice nowhere to be seen, it would have seemed very different from the horrible place in which he had been trapped, and in which his ship had sunk. I tried to imagine his hopes and aspirations, and the life he had lived on board, as I peered over the side of the barge and pictured the Erebus in its final resting place, in the dark, turbid waters beneath my feet."

          "headline": "House judiciary committee begins debating impeachment articles – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Thursday’s blog: The House judiciary committee’s debate of the impeachment articles is still underway. Each of the committee’s 41 members has 5 minutes to deliver opening statements. Democrats have so far cast the impeachment as part of their solemn responsibility. Republicans have said that the articles are baseless. Keep an eye on The Guardian’s home page for more analysis and updates. House Democrats approved a $738bn military bill that included a provision to fund Trump’s Space Force and provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave for federal employees. The Senate foreign relations committee unanimously backed a bill to stop Trump from exiting Nato. The justice department’s inspector general Michael Horowitz testified before the Senate judiciary committee about his investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Although FBI agents made significant errors as they began looking into the Trump campaign, their investigation was justified and not politically motivated, he concluded. Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who was sentenced for violating campaign finance laws, is asking for a reduced sentence, in exchange for helping federal investigators look into the president’s business dealings. Donald Trump signed an executive order that characterizes anti-Israel sentiments and boycotts as antisemitic. A group of moderates from swing districts may break from the rest of the House Democrats set to vote to impeach Trump. According to CNN, a small group of democrats representing districts that elected Trump met this week to discuss a way to avoid impeaching Trump and censure him instead. The Washington Post also reports that lawmakers and aides expect that at least two, and as many as a half dozen defections. These Democrats worry that a vote for impeachment could affect their chance of being reelected in Republican-leaning districts where impeachment hasn’t gained support despite the public hearings. Even if 17 Democrats defect, the impeachment could still go through. The Dems outnumber Republicans 233-197 and can count the support of independent congressman Justin Amash. As committee members take the floor, one by one, to deliver their opening statements, Democrats are framing the impeachment articles as part of their solemn responsibility, while Republicans are hearing down the inquiry as a political ploy. A sampling of their words: Democrat Zoe Lofgren: “Members of the Congress all take an oath to uphold the Constitution when a president violates a constitutional order we have an obligation to live up to our oath of office to deal with that. Republican Steve Chabot: “The drafting of impeachment articles drafted solely on secret hearings closed to the media and to the American people... If Geoge Orwell had written the script no one would have believed it” [Note: the articles are based on both public hearings and closed-door hearings whose transcripts were made public] Democrat Sheila Jackson: “The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, perpetrated constitutional crimes. Why does this matter today now in this moment on the journey of America’s history? Because truth matters and where truth rests trust builds.” Republican Jim Sensenbrenner: “What we’re debating here, in my opinion, is the weakest case in history.” Doug Collins, the leading Republican on the Judiciary Committee spoke next. “This is not new. We’ve been trying this for almost three years,” he said, arguing that the articles to impeach Trump aren’t valid because Democrats have been investigating the president for a long time. It is amazing to me that we’re taking it now as such a solemn oath that we’ve made up something to now come to this point to say, ‘This is very solemn’, like it jumped up and snuck up on you. It’s about like the holiday season, it doesn’t jump up and sneak up on you when you’ve been expecting it the whole time. And that’s what we’ve been doing.” Collins also said that by pursuing impeachment, “we tear down, not only try to tear down the leader of the free world, President Trump, but we’re tearing down the newly elected leader of the Ukraine” by implying that the Ukranian leader lied when he denied he felt pressured by Trump. The Republicans have props, including posters criticizing the impeachment. One says “Coastal Impeachment Squad” with a photo of House Democrats including Nadler, Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi. Nadler: President Trump’s stonewall was complete, absolute and without precedent In his opening statement, Judiciary Committee chair Jerrold Nadler said that the debate should be framed around three questions: 1) Does the evidence show clearly that Trump committed these acts? 2) Do they rise to the level of impeachable high crimes and misdemeanors? 3) What are the consequences if we fail to act? He also began addressing some of those questions, highlighting that although other presidents have tried to evade investigations, “President Trump’s stonewall was complete, absolute and without precedent,” justifying the obstruction of Congress article. Nadler also highlighted evidence that Trump abused power. “President Trump asked for a favor,” he said, and undermined national security. Legislators are going to be editing House resolution 755, “impeaching Donald John Trump, president of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors”. Judiciary Committee chair Jerold Nadler announced that each of the committee’s 41 members will have the opportunity to deliver a 5-minute opening statement. Prosecutors say Lev Parnas hid a $1m payment from Russia Prosecutors asked a federal judge to revoke bail for Lev Parnas, who they say made false statements about his assets and hit a $1m payment from Russia. Parnas, an associate of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Guiliani, was indicted on campaign finance charges in October. He also helped connect Guiliani with Ukrainian officials who pushed unsubstantiated allegations about Joe Biden, Congress passed an annual defense authorization bill that includes a provision for federal workers to take 12 weeks of paid parental leave. House Democrats who negotiated the bill pushed for the family leave provision in exchange for establishing a Space Force. CNN has more context: The paid parental leave provision was added after a significant push from Democrats, who during the course of the negotiation saw an opening with President Donald Trump’s desire to see the establishment of Space Force as a branch of the US military. In the White House push for Space Force’s inclusion, it was made clear, aides familiar with the negotiations said, that any number of Democratic priorities were potentially on the table. Over the objection of congressional Republicans, the White House agreed to the paid parental leave for federal workers in order to ensure the establishment of Space Force, the aides said. Democrats celebrated the paid leave provision in the must-pass legislation, although the bill on the whole was met with dismay from some progressive members who felt they lost on many of their other legislative priorities after negotiations with the Republican-held Senate. The bill passed with a bipartisan vote of 377-48. Forty-one Democrats and six Republicans opposed it, along with independent Rep. Justin Amash. Adam Schiff submits more evidence to judiciary committee The House Judiciary Committee is holding a rare evening session today in order to edit and perfect the articles of impeachment against Trump. Lawmakers aren’t expected to make any major changes to the articles, which charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It appears the committee may squeeze in last bits of evidence, before finalizng and approving the articles as early as tomorrow morning. As expected, Donald Trump signed an executive order that would essentially allow the government to interpret Judaism as a race or nationality in order to extend Title VI Civil Rights Act protections to people subjected to antisemitism at college campuses. The order also expands the definition of antisemitism in include criticisms of Israel, relying on guidelines from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. For the signing, joined by lawmakers as well as New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Afterward, evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress, who in the past has said that Jews would go to hell, spoke, praising Trump as “the most pro-faith president in history”. In a New York Times op-ed, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner praised the move. “As a grandchild of Holocaust survivors, I understand the horrors of anti-Semitism. I could not be more proud of President Trump’s new policy,” he wrote. But the order has drawn criticism from those who worry that characterizing Judaism as a race or nationality is itself antisemitic. Free-speech advocates are also concerned that conflating political criticisms of Israel with antisemitism will stifle open discussion. Here’s everything that’s happened so far today: The justice department’s top watchdog Michael Horowitz testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee today. Horowitz reaffirmed his confidence in his team’s report, despite attacks from Donald Trump and Horowitz’s boss, attorney general William Barr, on the report. Joe Biden’s campaign has been swatting away rumors that Biden has been talking about capping his presidency to one term if elected. Biden said that he has not talked to aides about the matter. Michael Cohen is asking a federal court for a reduced sentence, citing the help that he has given to federal investigators into Trump’s business activities. Former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page have found themselves in the news again, thanks to constant mentions from Trump and his allies. Last night Trump said that Page had a restraining order against Strzok, which she denied on Twitter. George Conway tweeted that Strzok has a compelling defamation case against the president if he wants one. Andrew Yang responded to allegations brought up by actress Alyssa Milano who cancelled her participation at a fundraiser for the candidate due to “repeated allegations of sexual misconduct” from one campaign staffer against another, according to a tweet thread Milano posted last night. Yang said that the staffer is no longer part of the campaign “to the extent that a particular individual was in position to mistreat another employee, that’s no longer the case today.” Democracy is under attack … as are civility and truth. A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: These are perilous times. Lies infect the political discourse and hateful attacks on the media are commonplace. The US government incites fear and prejudice and undermines the judiciary. It sometimes feels like the truth is an endangered species. As we approach 2020, the need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. Many vital aspects of American public life are in play – the Supreme Court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher. In 2020, the Guardian, as it has done for 200 years, will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts, science, diversity, equality and fairness. We’re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you’ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. Michael Cohen, Trump former personal lawyer, filed documents this afternoon asking a federal court to reduce his prison sentence. Cohen’s lawyer say that attorney general William Barr did not act in “good faith” when failing to meet with Cohen after he surrendered to his sentence, even though Cohen has assisted federal investigators in their investigation of Trump’s business. Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison in December 2018 for violating campaign finance laws. Two sources told CNN that the whistleblower whose account led to the impeachment inquiry is prepping for a potential subpoena from the Senate to testify. Donald Trump and his allies have made thinly veiled threats to the whistleblower, who is still anonymous, making some question the safety of revealing the whistleblower’s identity. Here’s more from CNN: A subpoena would put the whistleblower in uncharted territory, and raise the risk that his or her identity could come out in the course of the trial in the Senate -- where, unlike in the Democrat-led House, some Republicans have expressed a desire to hear from the whistleblower. ... Depending on how senators structure their likely trial, a subpoena could compel the whistleblower to cooperate with anything from written questions to a closed-door interview in a secure location to a public hearing that would expose the whistleblower’s identity. The whistleblower’s legal team is looking at historical precedent and conducting research to see what kind of case it could mount to block the whistleblower from testifying, if it came to that. One source said the legal team is closely monitoring lawmakers’ public statements about their client and is taking note of recent reporting that some Republicans have pushed back on White House demands for testimony. Friendly reminder that the House judiciary committee’s debate on the two articles of impeachment will begin tonight at 7pm. Reports say that House Democrats plan to vote on each article separately. FiveThirtyEight went Senator-by-Senator to see who would be most likely to vote for impeachment, stick with Trump or are hanging out in the middle. They calculate that 44 Democrats are certain to vote for impeachment and three who will likely be on the fence. In comparison, the chunk of Republicans (32) are grouped into what they are calling “Pro-Trump but looking at the polls”. This includes some of Trump’s close allies like Lindsay Graham, but also ones that have kept their distance. “What ties all these senators together is that they are generally Republicans who rose to power pre-Trump. That means they are probably more interested in preserving the GOP and their own electoral standing than defending Trump himself.” Eight Republicans are “Always Trumpers”, meaning they would never break away from the president. Michael Horowitz, top watchdog of the justice department, has been reaffirming his confidence in the report that he released on Monday during a testimony in front of the Senate judiciary committee. Trump and his allies have been trying to discredit the report, arguing that it does not consider all the available evidence. Attorney general William Barr has said that the FBI acted in bad faith when it conducted its Russian inquiry, contradicting the report. Barr has John Durham, a US attorney general from Connecticut, conducting his own investigation into the Russian inquiry. Horowitz has repeated throughout the day that he showed Barr and Durham a copy of the report before it was released to the public. He said they expressed their disagreement with it, but he and his team maintain that it is accurate. “My defense of my team and my work is that we stand by the report. Nothing I’ve heard changed our view,” Horowitz said. “The department, the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, the FBI director, whomever is free to disagree with my conclusions. I didn’t take the [inspector general] job to be popular to not have my feelings hurt.” The testimony of Michael Horowitz, top justice department watchdog, is still going. Donald Trump tweeted that the FBI “spied on my campaign!” When asked whether the FBI sent any spies to the Trump campaign from Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, Horowitz said: ”We did not find evidence that the FBI sought to place confidential human sources inside the campaign or plant them inside the campaign”. In an interview with actress Olivia Wilde for the Hollywood Reporter, speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi talked women in power, 2020 and the entertainment industry. In the interview, Pelosi offered a scathing critique of the press’ role in enabling Donald Trump’s power. I’ve said to many of my friends in the press, “You’re accomplices, whether you want to be or not,” [and they say,] “If he’s saying it, then it’s news.” I don’t think it’s news, but it monopolizes the airwaves. So there is a lot of responsibility to go around in terms of the creation of whatever that is in the White House. But he has a tactic, one that is used by autocrats, which is, “Just as long as they’re talking about me, no matter if it’s bad, then you’re not talking about my opponent.” When [the press was] talking about him, they weren’t saying what Hillary was going to do about health care, to make our economy fair. What we have to do is make sure that our own message is very positive, that we assume nothing about the public’s understanding of how one candidate is not authentic. Nonetheless, if you can fake authenticity, as Jean Giraudoux has said, you have it made. I see everything as an opportunity. I see what he is as an opportunity for us to have a very sharp, sharp contrast to what that is, to bring America back to a place where our hearts are full of love, for our country, for each other, and that we do not become like him in order to gain power but instead honor what our founders taught us: E pluribus unum, from many one. And so forget about him. Joe Biden briefly answered a question on whether he talked to aides about keeping a potential presidency to one term. Rumors are circulating after Politico published a story suggesting Biden may publicly promise to keep his presidency to one term. “No, I never have. I don’t have any plans on one term. I’m not even there yet,” he said. A Republican US representative from Indiana sent a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham asking him to rethink the impeachment strategy he briefly laid out yesterday. In an appearance on Fox News yesterday, Graham said he would not recommend calling anyone, including Donald Trump himself, to testify at an impeachment trial. “When 51 of us say we’ve heard enough, the trial is going to end,” Graham told Fox News. “The president’s going to be acquitted. … Here’s my advice to the president: if the Senate is ready to vote and ready to acquit you, you should celebrate that.” The stance is in contrast to what House Republicans like Jim Banks want out of an impeachment trial, which they see as an opportunity to aggressively clear the president of accusations by having testimony from people like Joe or Hunter Biden. “It is urgent we fight fire with fire and tell them enough is enough,” Banks wrote in his letter, according to Politico. “House Republicans have done all they can to push back and expose their motives to the American people, soon it will be at your doorstep. Next year America faces an epic choice ... and the results could define the country for a generation. A message from the Guardian US editor-in-chief: These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. In the coming year, many vital aspects of American public life are in play – the supreme court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher – and the need for a robust, independent press has never been greater. As 2020 approaches, we’re asking our US readers to help us raise $1.5m by early January to support our journalism. We hope you’ll consider making a year-end gift. We also want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has supported the Guardian in 2019. You provide us with the motivation and financial support to keep doing what we do. Make a contribution. As the testimony of Michael Horowitz, justice department watchdog, continues, the New York Times published an interesting analysis of the report that argues it transgresses any political implications. At more than 400 pages, the study amounted to the most searching look ever revealed about the government’s secretive system for carrying out national-security surveillance on American soil. And what the report showed was not pretty. While clearing the F.B.I. of acting out of political bias, the Justice Department’s independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, and his team uncovered a staggeringly dysfunctional and error-ridden process in how the F.B.I. went about obtaining and renewing court permission under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. “The litany of problems with the Carter Page surveillance applications demonstrates how the secrecy shrouding the government’s one-sided FISA approval process breeds abuse,” said Hina Shamsi, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “The concerns the inspector general identifies apply to intrusive investigations of others, including especially Muslims, and far better safeguards against abuse are necessary.” CNN just released a new 2020 poll that looks at the big Super Tuesday states. Joe Biden is barely polling ahead of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in California, but he has a strong lead in Texas, where he polls at 35%, compared to Sanders’ 15% and Warren’s 13%. When put head-to-head with Trump, Biden polls close to Trump in Texas, with Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Sanders following close behind. In California, all four of the top-polling candidates held a double-digit lead over Trump. A moment from the testimony of Michael Horowitz, the justice department’s watchdog, is picking up some traction. Horowitz said that he was surprised that US attorney general for Connecticut John Durham, who is leading a separate investigation into the FBI’s Russia inquiry under attorney general William Barr, put out a statement that he did not agree with the report’s conclusions. “I was surprised by the statement, I didn’t necessarily know it was going to be released on Monday. We did meet with Mr Durham… we met with him in November,” Horowitz said. “He said he did not necessarily agree with our conclusion about our opening of a full counterintelligence investigation.” Durham and Barr have both been under criticism for publicly distancing themselves from their department inspector general’s report. Yesterday, Barr said he believes the FBI acting in “bad faith” through its Russia inquiry, directly contradicting the report. Buttigieg was not part of Canadian ‘bread scandal’ Pete Buttigieg is batting away rumors this morning after he disclosed the clients he worked for when he was a consultant at McKinsey. When Canadians heard that Buttigeg did work with Canadian supermarket chain Loblaws, rumors started flying that Buttigieg was a part of a bread price-fixing scheme. In 2017, the supermarket admitted to a 14-year scheme to increase the price of bread in its stores – a scandal that is evidently infamous to Canadians. Buttigieg’s campaign told Buzzfeed News that the candidate was instead focused on broader price cuts at the chain. Senator Dianne Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked justice department top watchdog Michael Horowitz to outline the most important takeaways from the report. Horowitz first said that the investigation was opened “with proper predicate, sufficient predication” and that it was started by someone who was found to have no connection with texts that showed political bias. He then said that members of the FBI did not follow proper protocol when going through with certain steps of the investigation. As the testimony so far has shown, each party has put their own spin to the report. Republicans see it as evidence that there is a “deep state” conspiracy against Donald Trump, while Democrats see the contrary. Judiciary committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein of California is questioning Horowitz now. Her first questions hit at getting justice department top watchdog Michael Horowitz to confirm that there was no “deep state” conspiracy behind the opening of the FBI’s investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign. “As to the opening, we found no bias, no testimonial documents on that,” Horowitz said about the investigation. Michael Horowitz, the justice department’s top watchdog, is being questioned by the Senate judiciary committee. Senator Lindsey Graham is asking Horowitz questions after giving a 40-minute opening speech blasting the FBI’s investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign. As expected, the questions from Graham are trying to prove a “deep state” conspiracy against Donald Trump in the FBI by focusing on the agency’s missteps that were outlined in Horowitz’s report. So far, Graham asked Horowitz whether the mishandling of Carter Page’s, former Trump aide, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) warrant was done out of political bias: “I did not know their state of mind at this point.” Horowitz said the DOJ did not fairly treat the Fisa warrants they were trying to get “and [Page] was on the receiving end of them”. Biden’s campaign denies one-term rumors Joe Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield just tweeted out that Biden only serving one term if elected “is not a conversation our campaign is having and not something VP Biden is thinking about”. A Politico story this morning reported that there were conversations among Biden’s advisers and top Democrats outside of his campaign about whether Biden should pledge to only serve one term if elected, addressing concerns about Biden’s age and positioning himself as a “transition leader”. The story says Biden himself has quietly talked about limiting himself to one term. One campaign adviser told Politico “he’s going to be 82-years-old in four yeras and he won’t be running for reelection.” An hour after the testimony began, the justice department’s top watchdog Michael Horowitz is giving his opening statement in the testimony. He started by saying that the report took 19 months, and his team pour over a million documents and conducted 170 interviews with 100 witnesses. He encouraged people to read the report’s text, which can be found here. “I would encourage everybody to read the report, although I understand 400+ page report can be hard to get through, we do have a pithy 19-page executive summary with it which I would encourage people to read at a minimum.” Minutes after Senator Lindsay Graham quoted texts between Peter Strzok, former FBI agent, and Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer, in his opening speech to the testimony of watchdog of Michael Horowitz, George Conway – husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president – tweeted a lengthy thread that Strzok has an “extremely strong slander case” against him for claiming that Page got a restraining order against Strzok. Trump made the claim last night at a rally, where he hyped up the crowd by mocking Strzok and Page. Page tweeted this morning that “nothing like this ever happened”. Michael Horowitz, top watchdog in the justice department, is now testifying in front of the Senate judiciary committee. Everyone’s expecting a grilling from Senate Republicans, who believe Horowitz’s report unjustly targets the president, who believes the “deep state” has a conspiracy against him. Senator Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate judiciary committee, is opening the testimony with a lengthy spiel about whether the FBI went to far in its investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Trump mocks former FBI agent and lawyer at rally At a rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania last night, Donald Trump spent a few minutes doing what has become a standard gag at his rallies: Mocking former FBI lawyer Lisa Page and former FBI agent Peter Strzok, the text messages of whom Trump says is evidence of a “deep state”. To the cheers and laughs of his supporters, Trump pretended to be Page and Strzok. “I love you so much Lisa, please” he cooed onstage as his supporters roared with laughter. Trump took it a step further and said that Page had to get a restraining order against Strzok because he couldn’t stay away from her. “I don’t know if it’s true. The fake news will never report on it,” Trump said, encouraging boos from his supporters. A source close to Page told the Daily Beast that the allegation of the restraining order “is absolutely untrue”. At a rally in October, Trump said Page’s name during a “demeaning fake orgasm”, which she said encouraged her to speak out against the president. Yesterday, Page announced that she is suing the justice department and the FBI for leaking her and Strzok’s texts to the press. Here’s the official pic from the closed-door meeting that Donald Trump had with Sergey Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister. Lavrov at a joint press conference with secretary of state Mike Pompeo said “we have highlighted once again that all speculation about our alleged interference in domestic processes in the US are baseless. There are no facts that would support that.” Check out the headline of this ProPublica story that was published this morning: “Donald Trump Jr. Went to Mongolia, Got Special Treatment From the Government and Killed an Endangered Sheep” ProPublica got its hands on records about a trip Trump Jr. took to Mongolia over the summer. Records and interviews confirmed that Trump killed an argali, an endangered species of large mountain sheep that have made their homes in a remote region of Western Mongolia. The right to kill an argali is granted via an “opaque permitting system” that experts say require “money, connections and politics.” Trump Jr. reportedly got a permit to kill an argali in September, after he left the region. He met with the president of Mongolia soon after and then left the country. ProPublica says the US and Mongolia supported Trump Jr.’s trip, including by giving him security services. “What are the chances the Mongolian government would’ve done any of that to someone who wasn’t the son of the United States’ president?” Kathleen Clark, a professor specializing in legal ethics at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, told ProPublica. Happy Wednesday morning, and welcome to the politics live blog! It’ll be another busy day on Capitol Hill: the Department of Justice’s top watchdog Michael Horowitz is expected to testify in front of the Senate judiciary committee at 10am. Horowitz released a report on Monday that found the FBI investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and Russia was justified – although it found several missteps the agency made during the investigation. Donald Trump and his allies, including the attorney general, William Barr, have condemned the report, saying it unfairly targets the president. Expect the same pandering from Senate Republicans today during Horowitz’s testimony. Here’s what else we’re looking at today: Impeachment will continue to roll, as the House judiciary committee starts to debate and vote on the articles of impeachment tonight at 7pm and continue tomorrow morning. The committee is trying to impeach Trump on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. House Democrats are expected to announce a sweeping drug pricing bill – the end result of intense negotiations between moderate and progressive leaders in the party. The bill expands the government’s ability to directly negotiate and lower drug prices. Trump will hold the ceremonial swearing-in of Dan Brouillette, the new secretary of energy who was confirmed last week. Brouillette, a former lobbyist for Ford Motor Company, was most recently deputy secretary. Stay tuned for all the latest news."

          "bodyText": "More than 70 soldiers are thought to have been killed in an ambush by suspected Islamist militants at a military post in western Niger. The strike in In-Atès near the border with Mali on Tuesday night emphasises the growing insecurity in a wide belt of poor and anarchic territory in west Africa and, if the death toll is confirmed, is the deadliest on Niger’s forces in recent memory. It came just days before a summit in France where President Emmanuel Macron is expected to meet regional leaders to discuss the future of the French military’s deployment in the Sahel, which stretches across Africa, south of the Sahara. The Nigerien military has not released casualty figures, but a senior official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the provisional toll to reporters. Local media reported that the attackers, who have not yet been identified, first targeted communications equipment at the remote base before over-running its defences. A tweet sent from the account of the president, Mahamadou Issoufou, late on Wednesday said that he was returning early from an overseas trip in Egypt following the reported attack. The violence was only 30 miles (48km) from Ouallam, where four US service members died along with four Nigerien soldiers two years ago when their joint patrol came under fire in a massive ambush. Islamic extremists with links to both Islamic State and al-Qaida have long carried out attacks across the vast desert region. The French military mission and a regional Sahel force have failed to stem the violence. This year has also seen extremist groups increase their presence in neighbouring Burkina Faso. In 2015, 46 soldiers and 28 civilians were killed in an attack by Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group, on a military post on Lake Chad. Last month, gunmen in Burkina Faso killed nearly 40 civilians in an ambush on a convoy transporting workers for a Canadian goldmining company. Two hundred and fifty British troops are scheduled to be deployed in a UN peacekeeping mission in neighbouring Mali in 2020. Weapons have flooded the region in recent years, many of which were brought from Libya into Mali after the death of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, enabling various groups to pursue different agendas."

          "bodyText": "The Chilean air force has located debris believed to be from a cargo plane that crashed this week with 38 people aboard over a remote stretch of frigid sea between South America and Antarctica. The debris, which was found 18 miles (30km) south of where the plane last made contact, will be recovered for analysis to determine if it belonged to the Hercules C-130 cargo plane, the air force said in a statement. The aircraft disappeared shortly after taking off late on Monday from the southern city of Punta Arenas. The air force concluded the aircraft must have crashed early the next morning, given the number of hours it had been missing. “We will continue the search and hope for a better result,” Gen Eduardo Mosqueira, who leads the search effort, told reporters. The cause of the crash was unknown and officials acknowledged the slim chances of finding survivors. Earlier on Wednesday, the Chilean military sent fighter jets in an expansion of its search after large rolling waves in the icy Drake Passage and low clouds had complicated the mission the day before. Mosqueira said the search area covered an area of about 250 by 280 mile (400 by 450km). He told reporters that improved visibility was helping the crews of searchers using planes, satellites and vessels from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and the US as well as Chile. The flight appeared routine until the moment it disappeared, Mosqueira said. The region where the plane disappeared is a vast, largely untouched ocean wilderness of penguin-inhabited ice sheets off the edge of the South American continent with depths of 11,500ft (3,500 meters). The military was using sonar-enabled navy ships to detect irregularities at depth, and that it had established quadrangles to help organize the search, Mosqueira said. Ships from Argentina and Brazil were assisting, he said."

          "headline": "Ian McKellen by Garry O’Connor review – from Richard III to Gandalf",
          "bodyText": "Garry O’Connor’s book about Ian McKellen is as much involved with ideas as it is with facts. It makes no claim to be an exhaustive account. O’Connor has been writing more or less experimental biographies of actors for many years, starting with his classic account of Ralph Richardson, continuing with Paul Scofield, Alec Guinness (twice) and a fine double portrait of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. A former drama critic, he is fascinated by the mystery of great acting. Of the present volume, he says, quoting Hamlet, but sounding more like a fairground barker: “Here is the height, the presumption of my endeavour: to ‘pluck out the heart’ of the Ian McKellen mystery – how such a single being could create a monumental career of such depth and span; where the ever-charging source of his energy comes from; and how his personality and character have continued to develop and change throughout his life. All in all to make it speak as it never has before, to sound him from his lowest note to the top of his compass.” There is a McKellen mystery and at its centre is his duality, his paradoxical capacity to be both/and. He is simultaneously “deeply secretive, intensely private”, as his former partner Sean Mathias says, and perhaps the most open and accessible personality British theatre has ever produced. Even his influences are contradictory, both roundhead and cavalier: on the one hand the Marlowe Society at Cambridge, where he imbibed the principles of rigorous textual fidelity and deep moral purpose; on the other Olivier, living embodiment of the theatrical. His approach is strikingly similar to Olivier’s. Both are great prose actors, resistant to lyricism and displays of personal emotion; both need to root everything in observed reality. They had opposite journeys: Olivier a beetle-browed, gap-toothed boy with huge eyes and thin lips, physically slight, a whippet who turned himself into a panther; McKellen, built like a carthorse, who, to begin with, when he was concealing his sexuality, hid his underlying power under a carapace of assumed prettiness, which made him seem rather camp. When he came out as gay, which coincided with middle-age, he stripped himself of all that and revealed his earthiness, his masculinity. Coming out, as McKellen has tirelessly insisted, is a wonderful thing: one is finally relieved of whatever mask one has been wearing and is able to acknowledge not just who one wants to sleep with but who and what one really is. And – supreme bonus – it makes for better acting. There is paradox here, though, even on the physical plane: his sizable feet are rarely still, tracing elaborate dainty patterns across the boards. His physical transformations have been extraordinary, none more so than his semi-paralysed, proto-Mosley Richard III: utterly, chillingly credible, a real threat. But here he differs from his hero Olivier, and also from Antony Sher, both of whom, in that role, created fairytale ogres, figures out of nightmare, dredged, one can only presume, from the actors’ subconscious selves. McKellen’s Richard was a different kind of nightmare, the sort whose hyper-realism is what renders it truly disturbing. Olivier created mythic figures, McKellen full-length portraits. So it was with his King Lear: characterised not by mental befuddlement but by a terrifying clarity of each individual thought, thoughts unconnected but each one perfectly coherent, Nietzschean aphorisms spoken in the glare of a lightning flash. Where, O’Connor asks, does it all come from? A remote father and a caring but not especially close mother who died early? Well, yes, but more revealing is McKellen’s remarkable comment about the autobiography he gave up writing: “I was getting too emotionally upset that I hadn’t been a good enough child, because I’d not shown enough interest in them.” A devastating assessment, but it suggests that he didn’t allow himself to be close to them because he feared their power over him, feared being hurt or rejected by them, so declared his independence of them as early as possible. His deep amorous commitments – and there appear to have been few of them – seem to have followed a similar pattern: his first long and stable relationship became stiflingly domestic, so he left; his second, more turbulent relationship, with Mathias, was too unsettling. O’Connor’s revelation is about McKellen’s passionate involvement with the actor Gary Bond, one of the theatre’s grands horizontals, with whom he seems to have fallen deeply in love. But that left him too vulnerable; it would have stopped him from doing what he wanted to do with his life, so it too ended. He briefly flirted with directing, he has been a formidable spokesman for LGBT rights, he has been close to power. But acting is what his life has been all about, and he has done it in an astonishing multiplicity of ways, on stages large and small, metropolitan and regional, in the great companies and in the commercial theatre, at the centre of a large cast and on his own. Like Maggie Smith, he is, in the end, the great actor he is because it matters so much to him. Not the event or even the play but the fact that he is more fully alive, more fully himself, on stage than anywhere else. Crucial to his art is that we are in it with him. No fourth wall illusions for McKellen: it is all shared with an audience with whom his complicity is very frank – “Did you see what I just did?” being the unspoken question. And in life, when he is not on the stage, he is in the wings – always ready, as actors are in the wings, to share a joke or to become fascinated by some fresh thought, while all the while waiting and ready for the heightened life once they step into the light. His audiences have loved him for it, though few of the characters he has played have been lovable. It is another McKellenish paradox that relatively late in his career, and on film, he should at last have found himself playing a character who has been universally loved, in a semi-Christian fantasy filled with elaborate pseudo-profundities of the sort that would normally be anathema to him. O’Connor devotes a long chapter to The Lord of the Rings, teasing out tenuous connections between Tolkien and McKellen himself, but the simple truth is that playing an embodiment of wisdom and truth and essential benevolence has made the actor very happy (and very rich). By the end of O’Connor’s fascinating voyage round McKellen, the author has, as he says, peeled away as many layers as he could. Sometimes strained, the book is a stimulating complement to the most factually informative account of his life – the actor’s own website, www.McKellen.com. • Ian McKellen is published by W&amp;N (RRP £20).

          "headline": "Hanna Cormick: the performance artist who's allergic to the world",
          "bodyText": "Hanna Cormick is allergic to the industrialised world. When the Helsinki-born, Canberra-raised actor, acrobat and contortionist is exposed to everyday items such as plastic, pesticides, cigarettes, perfumes, some food odour or even the ink in a book, she is prone to not only hives, throat swelling and anaphylaxis but “very violent” seizures too. The seizures “look like I’ve lost consciousness and my whole body is jerking and moving about on its own”, she explains. They are caused by mast cell activation syndrome, an immunological condition that forces Cormick to spend most of her life in a sealed “safe” room in her mother’s Canberra house. Anyone entering Cormick’s room has to go through a decontamination process, because many products derived from fossil fuels pose her serious danger. She lives in the house with her actor partner, and her safe room contains a positive-pressure air system, multiple air filtration devices and, by necessity, little furniture. Soon, Cormick will briefly journey to Sydney festival to perform her short, text-based show The Mermaid: both the story of her life and a metaphor for the poisoning of the planet. “I had been treating my body as something I could exploit, without expecting to meet its needs,” she recalls via Skype from her sealed room. “I realised, like the world’s reliance on fossil fuels and their impact on the planet, I had been treating my body with the same hyper-capitalist mindset.” Cormick’s performances will be staged at the Coal Loader in Waverton, a former coal plant turned into a sustainability centre on the waterfront. The Sydney trip has required detailed advanced planning. She had planned to stay in an eco-construction on a remote Blue Mountains property – the clean air of bush living is easier on her mast cells – but the bushfires sweeping through the state have presented high risks. “It’s obviously in all our minds, given the current fires, but we haven’t found a good back-up yet,” she says, when emailed a follow-up question amid the haze this week. “We will probably have to find a less immunologically safe (but more fire-safe) location, and I would need to sleep in protective gear and my respiratory equipment and oxygen – which I’ve been having to do with the smoke pollution right now anyway. “It’s really painful – respirator masks are very painful to wear for long periods – but it’s kept me breathing fine so far.” Performing in public carries severe risks to her safety, too. At the start and end of her first performance of the premiere season of The Mermaid, in Canberra in March 2018, Cormick suffered seizures while sitting on the floor in front of her audience. “It can be really confronting, and I think not just to see these sorts of medical events; they don’t always happen in the work, it is random,” she says. “The audience also has to think about the way our own actions might be impacting others.” The Sydney festival shows require audience members to be mindful of what they bring in with them – but the venue’s naturally ventilated, outdoor harbourside location lessens the risk. “There have been times when patrons have been asked not to wear fragrance, makeup or hair products, especially indoors,” says Cormick. “At other performances [such as in Sydney], they’re asked to move to the back if they are wearing any of those products.” Until 2015, Cormick had been enjoying a multiskilled acrobatic and acting career in Europe – including an arts residency in the south of France, working with circus in refugee camps on the Turkish-Syrian border, devising and rehearsing shows in Paris and performing with a troupe at the Edinburgh fringe festival. But she had been hiding a growing list of unexplained symptoms – weight and muscle strength loss, fainting and being out of breath – until “the crash” of April that year: allergic reactions to all food, great pain and an inability to walk up a flight of stairs. Forced to return to Australia to rest and seek answers, her doctor raised the possibility Cormick was suffering a form of the debilitating genetic connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This bad news was just the beginning. This syndrome impacts not only joint mobility but, in more severe cases such as Cormick’s, causes serious problems in every organ system: brain, heart, lungs, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, pelvic organs and veins. “Now, my bones are coming out of their sockets many times every day,” says the former contortionist, who was finally diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 2017. The next year Cormick was diagnosed with – among other diseases – mast cell activation syndrome, the cause of her seizures; and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a form of orthostatic intolerance which can also cause her body to collapse. Her father has the same “trifecta”, she says, and her mother has mast cell activation syndrome too. These days, when Cormick ventures outside her safe room in her wheelchair – “once a week, once a fortnight, that kind of thing, usually for an hour at a time” – she wears a respirator and relies on an oxygen tank to avoid seizure triggers. It is a “big operation”, requiring multiple helpers, to ensure she is as safe from pollutants as possible. There is no treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but physiotherapy helps prevent deterioration. For postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, Cormick is on regular IV saline infusions and is weighing up getting a pacemaker fitted. Frequent injections of a high-dose drug, omalizumab, have decreased the frequency of Cormick’s seizures, and she has the standard rescue medications for acute episodes: adrenaline, oxygen and albuterol. There are other immunotherapy medications that could help, she says, but they are restricted in Australia. “Sometimes it feels like you fight bureaucracy more than you fight the symptoms.” Part of Cormick’s motivation in creating The Mermaid was to confront her own past attitudes to disability. She says she will be forever grateful to the performer Liz Carr, who drew her attention to the concept of the “social model” of disability, which holds that disability is caused by the way society is organised. “The circus industry, the dance industry are incredibly ableist spaces, and I had developed a damaging mindset that confused my values with what I could do, with my productivity, especially my physical abilities,” Cormick says. “They are industries that foster the idea you can do anything if you try hard enough. Having the antidote of the social model was necessary for me to start unlearning that.” • The Mermaid is at the Coal Loader from 17 to 19 January 2020. Sydney festival runs from 8 to 26 January"

          "headline": "Vinnies refuses to be 'used' to promote Coalition's new religious discrimination bill",
          "bodyText": "The St Vincent de Paul Society has asked not to be “used” to promote a new Coalition proposal to allow “public benevolent institutions” to discriminate against prospective staff based on religion, stating that it has no need to do so for its commercial activities. While unveiling a suite of changes to the government’s religious discrimination bill on Tuesday, attorney general Christian Porter cited Vinnies – a lay Catholic organisation which runs charity op-shops – as an example of an institution that would benefit from extending exemptions to allow religious organisations to preserve their “religious ethos”. The new bill provoked a mixed reaction – it was praised by conservative religious groups, cautiously welcomed by employer groups which want further changes, and denounced by human rights, LGBTI groups and the Greens, which all warned it increases religious bodies’ powers to discriminate. The Sydney Anglican church – which was one of the fiercest critics of the original bill among conservative churches – welcomed the bill, with archbishop Glenn Davies crediting the government for “[taking] seriously the deeply-held views of people of faith” “In particular, I am encouraged by a number of changes in the second exposure draft,” he said. “The respect given to faith charities is an important model for the future harmony of Australian society.” The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference also welcomed the second draft bill. But Claire Victory, the national president of the St Vincent de Paul Society, said that it “does not require employees and volunteers working in the society’s commercial activities to be Catholic”. It had “never required this of people working in our shops” nor at its secretariat, she said. “Certain roles within our conferences and councils which have particular responsibility for overseeing our mission and Catholic ethos are usually filled by Catholics but may also be filled by people who share basic Catholic beliefs.” The Public Interest Advocacy Centre chief executive, Jonathon Hunyor, welcomed the “one positive, albeit limited change” – reducing the range of professions who are able to conscientiously object to providing health services and clarifying that the provision is not meant to allow refusal to particular people or groups of people. The new bill will specify that it does not give a right to medical practitioners to discriminate against individuals based on gender or other characteristics. Nevertheless, doctors, pharmacists and other limited categories of medical practitioners could refuse to perform certain procedures or dispense certain drugs – such as abortion or the morning after pill – provided they refused to do so for all patients. Hunyor said he “remains concerned that this may still allow doctors, pharmacists and others to refuse to provide specific types of services, where those services are used most commonly, or even exclusively by people from particular groups – for example, by refusing to provide types of hormone treatment that benefit trans and gender diverse people”. The chair of the Australian Medical Association ethics and medico-legal committee, Chris Moy, told the ABC that doctors “have an obligation to the patient in front of us” to treat or refer them for care and the AMA had an issue with the right to “walk away and not have anything to do with it” proposed by the original bill. The right to conscientiously object creates “inconsistency” with ethical obligations “where it’s really not required”, he said. Moy asked the government to consider scenarios such as “an individual needing a termination of pregnancy in a remote area with one health provider who suddenly says they have this conscientious objection”. Just Equal spokesman Rodney Croome said the government had “heard the LGBTIQ community say we want the bill to allow less discrimination, and it gave us precisely the opposite”. He called on Labor leader Anthony Albanese to reject the bill. Labor does not plan to elaborate on its position that the government should not “compromise existing anti-discrimination protections” unless and until the bill is introduced to parliament. Hunyor said the second draft “widens the scope for religious organisations to discriminate when providing public (and publicly funded) services”. “Religious schools, charities and other organisations are given an almost free license to discriminate against people who do not share their religious beliefs. “Religious hospitals, aged care facilities and accommodation providers are allowed to fire, or refuse to hire, people simply because of their religious beliefs.” The new bill will also narrow the so-called “Folau clause”, so that employers are prohibited from setting a rule that indirectly discriminates on religion only where the rule is “other than in the course of the employee’s employment”. Porter said the change was meant to prohibit rules regulating what employees said in their “spare time” but allow employers to continue to regulate activities connected to work, such as office Christmas parties. Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said the change “addresses a key concern” that it had raised in consultation but “more changes to the bill will be needed to address the genuine concerns of employers”."

Gündogan, speaking before Wednesday’s Champions League game at Dinamo Zagreb, offered an honest assessment as to why. “If you are successful and have won so many things sometimes you lose focus,” the midfielder said. “There’s a lack of confidence and you recognise you didn’t play as well as you can. But this is not the way you want to end up – you want to improve again. It’s now our challenge to bounce back. After two great seasons it’s even tougher to do three titles in a row. It’s normal to have this period but the only way is to stick together. “Every player has to take responsibility to reach his best level again. The sooner we can do that the sooner we’ll be successful again. We are strong mentally and we should be able to do our best. We start from zero against Dinamo, we have to prove ourselves, put in a good performance.” City have qualified as group winners and Pep Guardiola will use the match as an opportunity to give Phil Foden only his fourth start of the season. The manager believes the 19-year-old can become as pivotal for City as David Silva, who leaves in the summer. “That is our wish,” Guardiola said. “David is a legend – the amount of games and titles – but it’s our wish and we believe Phil can do it. Like David he is skilled in small spaces. Phil has pace and rhythm at 19 and he is also box to box like an English midfield player. He only needs minutes and when he has them he’ll get what he needs. “He’s growing from last season. There are still some departments in which he can improve. Sometimes he has to think a bit more about decision making especially without the ball. It’s normal with his age and his development is perfect.” Dinamo Zagreb (4-5-1, probable): Livakovic; Stojanovic, Ademi, Dilaver, Leovac; Kadzior, Olmo, Moro, Gojak, Orsic; Petkovic. Manchester City (4-1-4-1, probable): Bravo; Cancelo, García, Otamendi, Mendy; Gündogan; Mahrez, Foden, B Silva, Sterling; Jesus."

          "headline": "How Fox News drama Bombshell lets Megyn Kelly off the hook",
          "bodyText": "On a fateful Wednesday in December 2013, Megyn Kelly reached out to the children of America through her daytime cable news talk program The Kelly File with an urgent message: “For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white.” It was an odd, racist stand for an adult woman to take, but hardly a career-ender; at her then home of Fox News, casual bigotry of this sort got an anchor little more than a glorified speeding ticket. Skip ahead to 2015, a pivotal time in Kelly’s rise through the TV ranks and the start of the window during which the new film Bombshell has been set. By the time she took a boisterous candidate named Donald Trump to task during a Republican primary debate that summer, her image had already been well on the way to rehabilitation. A glossy feature in the New York Times Magazine claimed that she had “upended the popular notion of how a Fox News star is supposed to behave”, and that she represented “an appeal to the younger and (slightly) more ideologically diverse demographic Fox needs”. Her feud with the president-to-be landed her the cover of Vanity Fair in January of 2016, with the headline Blowhards, Beware: Megyn Kelly Will Slay You Now. She was supposed to be the palatable future of conservatism, an ideologue who could occupy the other side of the aisle with intelligence and civility. Slightly complicating this narrative was Kelly’s actual behavior during this time and the year that would follow, which did not paint the picture of a cool-headed, forward-thinking member of the right. In summer 2016, around the time that she spoke out against sex predator Roger Ailes and earned a new wave of respect from the general public, Kelly had actor DL Hughley on her show for a debate about the recent murder of Michael Brown at the hands of police. During this conversation, she asserted that Brown could have been the aggressor in his own killing, then attempted to dismiss Hughley’s shock at the assertion. Worse still, all this was perfectly in keeping with the person she’d always been during her tenure at Fox, a period during which the order of the day included Islamophobia, transphobia and a host of other defects of character. Most troublingly of all, she continued to question the legitimacy of sexual assault claims and express sympathy for the accused even after she became embroiled in one such story. All that notwithstanding, Kelly’s embrace by the mainstream led to her highest-profile gig yet as the host of her own NBC show, a disastrous program shuttered after she declared on-air that she considered dressing up in blackface to be no biggie. (Before the cancellation, she asked a Will and Grace fan if the program made him gay, gave Sandy Hook conspiracy-monger Alex Jones a televised platform, and needled “Hanoi Jane” about her past plastic surgeries.) The suits cut her loose to the tune of a $69m payout on her contract. The gap between Kelly’s esteem from establishment media and her abhorrent track record in real life is so wide that Bombshell and its star Charlize Theron can tumble into it like a hiker into a crevasse. The Santa moment gets a noticeable amount of screen time in Jay Roach’s modern-day period piece, both via a snippet of the oft-replayed clip as well as a quick shot of black protesters in Kris Kringle suits outside NewsCorp’s midtown Manhattan headquarters. Its presence in the film feels like lip service, an obligatory acknowledgment of the fact that Megyn Kelly did, on one occasion in the remote past, do something wrong. But her deeper, more foundational moral lapses get largely swept under the rug. Despite the fact that she calls a cub reporter “snowflake” at one point, someone with no outside information watching this film would perceive Kelly as nothing more than a newswoman who ruffles the occasional feather in her pursuit of the story. The film cannot afford to depict Kelly in all her contemptibility, because a villain of Roger Ailes’ caliber requires an equal and opposite hero. Bombshell focuses on the events precipitating the fall of the Fox godhead, tracing the expansion of the whisper network of women in the workplace that led to his deposing. Kelly leads the charge, supported by Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) as she prepares her own lawsuit against Ailes behind closed doors, with the rest of the film’s run time devoted to a fictitious newbie named Kayla (Margot Robbie). Carlson hasn’t jammed her foot into her mouth nearly as frequently as Kelly, but she still worked to keep the Fox propaganda machine well-oiled and functioning during her many years on the network. Yet in all three cases, the movie behaves as if its ethical calculus will not square unless these three women can be molded into feminist role models. (A label that Kelly shrugs off every time someone uses it to describe her, which happens on multiple occasions.) This proved a big pill to swallow for the first round of coverage that ran yesterday, as the press embargo lifted. Slate’s Dana Stevens wrote in her review, “Not even Charlize Theron can make me see Megyn Kelly as a hero,” and that she “just isn’t that exciting to root for”. BuzzFeed News’ Pier Dominguez echoed these sentiments, writing that “the movie ends up being, in some ways, an infomercial for [Kelly and Carlson’s] post–Fox News incarnations while also promoting the idea of a kinder, gentler Fox News without Ailes at the helm.” In the fine publication you’re reading right now, our own Peter Bradshaw ruled that the film “pulls its hardest punches”. It all makes for a dramatic contrast with Theron’s party line on the media circuit, where she’s told Deadline, “I had to realize that, even through all this stuff, this was a person that did something really incredible, and I couldn’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.” Albeit inadvertently, that’s an astute soundbite; “all this stuff” captures the vagary of the film’s engagement with Kelly’s failings of common goodness, just as the film certainly considers what she’s done right to be far more important than all she’s done wrong. There’s a right way to make this movie, one that confronts a truth both simple and complicated: that even the very worst people among us deserve the basic dignity of not getting sexually assaulted at the office. But this asks a lot of the viewer in terms of empathy, and it’s one of the cardinal beliefs of studio executives that people will not show up or stick around to watch a movie about someone they hate. This is hardly Orwellian doublethink, however, this notion that even the worst among us shouldn’t be violated by our colleagues. The phrase “I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy” is already common parlance. Still, Roach feels safer softening Kelly’s image to guarantee that her baseline humanity comes across. Of course the ideal Fox News woman for his revisionist scrubbing – Margot Robbie’s upstanding, go-getter career gal – would have to be imaginary. Bombshell is out in the US on 13 December and in the UK on 24 January."

          "headline": "Wind change fans blazes as Sydney hit by hazardous air quality – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "We’ll be leaving the blog here for tonight, here’s a recap of what happened today: Sydney was shrouded in smoke, as the air quality index reached 11 times higher than “hazardous” in many parts of the city. Nine fires are currently burning at watch and act level, and one at emergency level (the Little L complex fire). The Three Mile fire was at emergency level at 2pm, but was later downgraded to watch and act. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, rejected suggestions that volunteer firefighters should be professionalised, or that the federal government should do more, saying the firefighters “want to be there”. Cricketers playing in the Sheffield Shield at the SCG said the air was “toxic” and called on the sport to review its air quality policy. Buildings all over Sydney – including RFS headquarters – were evacuated as the smoke triggered fire alarms. The maximum temperature in Sydney today was 42.4C in Richmond. The dropped to 28C by 4pm, due to a sweeping southerly. An emergency warning has just been issued for the Little L Complex fire, in Yengo national park. This is the first fire to worsen this evening, after others were downgraded during the day. There is increasing fire in the Glenroy Estate area, near Putty Rd, the RFS says. Earlier today, Sheffield Shield cricketers at the SCG said it was “toxic” playing in heavy smoke. Footage was dramatically hazy but the game was not called off. Queensland captain Usman Khawaja said it was “hard to breathe” and New South Wales spinner Steve O’Keefe said Cricket Australia needed to take action and look at its air quality policy. “For someone like me who smokes 40 a day, it’s now smoking 80 cigarettes a day,” he told AAP. “The one thing they need to look at is the air quality policy. It’s not healthy. It’s toxic ... that was shocking. I don’t have kids but if I did they’d be locked up inside, and if I was at home I wouldn’t be training or playing.” That rain could fall over fires near Grafton, and the Bangala Creek fire, which is at watch and act, near Tenterfield. Still waiting on an RFS update on this. A severe thunderstorm warning has just been issued for parts of the mid-north coast and inland. That includes the possibility of hail. Doctors from some of Sydney’s hardest hit areas have spoken to Melissa Davey about the impacts they are seeing in patients. Dr Kim Loo works in Rouse Hill, which recorded some of the worst air quality ratings today. “My poor patients, many live on the margins of poverty,” she told Guardian Australia. “They live in houses that aren’t sealed. I know there are guidelines telling people to stay inside if they have certain health conditions, but that’s no good if your house isn’t sealed and you can’t afford an air filter.” At Circular Quay, ferries are severely delayed and passengers are being told they are running 30 minutes or more late. This comes after cancellations due to bushfires earlier in the day. The southerly has hit the Green Wattle firegrounds. And read this from Katharine Murphy: Dear prime minister. The country is not parched but desiccated, and it is burning like a tinderbox, and people are frightened. They are frightened about today and the terrible business of defending property and saving lives, and they are frightened about whether this is what spring and summer in Australia now looks like. NSW Health has put out a statement urging people to “take precautions to protect their health”. “NSW Health is particularly reminding the elderly and parents and carers of young children to stay inside with doors and windows shut, where possible, and postpone outdoor activities,” said the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant. “The best way to reduce exposure to smoke is to stay indoors with the doors and windows shut. People with existing lung and heart conditions can also protect themselves by following their disease management plans.” The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, has told people to follow the NSW Health advice. Sydney’s ferries are running again but there’s still a reduced service on many routes. The ACT’s emergency services agency has tweeted this map. More smoke is heading Canberra’s way. The website advises: “A change in wind direction has caused the smoke to blow across the ACT region.” If you’re wondering if you should get an air purifier – and from where – this explainer from Martin Farrer has some info. In short, they need to have a HEPA filter, but their effectiveness varies. And in many parts of Sydney, they are sold out. 5pm update from RFS: 83 fires burning across NSW, 40 uncontained. 12 are at watch and act. Tomorrow there are three areas with total fire bans (central ranges, northwestern and northern slopes). Potential respite coming tomorrow for Sydney – but not every part of the state. Temperatures have dropped across the state as a southerly change has come through in the past few hours. But that most likely will worsen fire conditions and make the job harder for firefighters on the ground. Unlucky. This is Naaman Zhou taking over the blog from Helen Davidson. Former fire chief Greg Mullins has warned that firefighters may have “nothing left in the tank” as they battle with an abnormally long and extensive fire season. He told AAP: “Everyone is getting pretty worn out and in my experience that’s where all the bad stuff happens. The troops, if they’re worn out, you get to a stage where it just overwhelms everyone, so that’s a worry. “I’m buggered ... and I haven’t done as many [shifts] as some people. People will step up. Firefighters – they are men and women who give their all – they will do whatever is asked of them and more, but I do fear for their welfare.” Last month Mullins and 23 other former fire chiefs said the government had ignored their warnings because it “fundamentally doesn’t like talking about climate change”. Mike Bowers is down in Braidwood where firefighters have been battling a large fire. It’s at a watch-and-act level. Our data team has updated their graph of total area burned in NSW. There’s a fuller story here, but it’s worth this quick explanation of what happened in 1974 when 3.5m hectares burned, and how this differs. Scientists says fire conditions today are fundamentally different, and fundamentally worse in many ways, when compared with some of the fires in the past. The director of the University of Wollongong’s centre for environmental risk management of bushfires, Ross Bradstock, says the 1974 fires burned through largely remote country mostly in the state’s far west, devouring green, non-woody herbaceous plants. The conditions were created by above average rainfall which produced ample fuel in outback grasslands. By contrast, the fires in the east of the state this year have been fuelled by a lack of rain. The extent of the fires is in significant part driven by the amount of dry fuel available, some of it in highly unlikely places, and the amount of dry fuel is linked to the record-breaking drought. Here are the new or upgraded ones: • A blaze near Cessnock, which is being referred to as the Crumps Complex fire, is burning in the Corrabare state forest, east of Wollombi. It is being controlled but has burned through more than 5,000ha and fire activity has increased on the western side of the fire, near Narone Creek. • Directly west of the large Gospers Mountain fire, at Palmers Oaky in the Lithgow council area, an out-of-control fire has gone through more than 600ha. The Bangala Creek fire near Tenterfield has been upgraded and is burning out of control after a storm cell above the fireground caused erratic winds and increased fire activity. The Palerang fire near Braidwood is “being controlled” but was upgraded to a watch and act this afternoon. Fire activity is increasing around Foxs Elbow and Watsons Road. Two grass fires have sparked at Corrys Road and Meander Street in Thurgoona, near Albury. The Three Mile fire on the Central Coast has been downgraded to a watch and act, thanks to firefighting efforts. Fire and rescue station 505 at Wyong has released some comparison stats on bushfire emergencies in recent decades. This is by far the biggest in terms of area burnt (but is a distant second after the disastrous Black Saturday fires in terms of lives and homes lost). “This information shows the sheer destruction that has occurred and could have been worse if it wasn’t for everyone doing their bit,” it said. 1994 January - 800,000ha burnt - 225 homes lost - 4 lives lost 2001 Black Christmas, 25 Dec 2001 - 7 Jan 2002 - 753,000ha burnt - 109 homes lost - 433 out (non-house) buildings destroyed 2003 January - 160,000ha burnt - 470 homes destroyed - 4 lives lost 2009 Black Saturday, Vic, 7 Feb - 14 Mar - 450,000ha burnt - 2029 homes lost - 3,500-plus out buildings destroyed - 180 lives lost 2013 October - 118,000ha burnt - 248 buildings destroyed - 40 out buildings destroyed - 2 lives lost 2019 July to December and still burning - 2.7m ha burnt - 684 homes lost - 1452 out buildings destroyed - 6 lives lost This morning Scott Morrison addressed media and dismissed calls for greater federal support of the bushfire response and of volunteer firefighters. It came after the opposition and Malcolm Turnbull called for a restructured nationally coordinated response, with the latter saying the threat was now a “national security issue”, as well as a growing concern from the community about volunteers being in the field for weeks or months with no end in sight. The Australasian fire and emergency service authorities council (Afac) said this afternoon: “Australia has never been better prepared to face natural disasters.” Afac, which counts fire and emergency management professions as members, said cross-state firefighting resources were funnelled and distributed across the country where they had been requested, by its national resource sharing centre. “While many volunteers are not available to travel far from their homes or interstate due to local responsibilities, employment or managing drought-stricken stock that require daily feeding, others are prepared to deploy,” Afac said. It said there was integrated engagement with the commonwealth and national protocols for managing incident responses and the available fleet of 140 aircraft and international personnel. “None of this comes with guarantees. However, a great deal is in place and has been practised, providing Australia with a truly national capability drawn from state and territory agencies from across the commonwealth.” A quick update from Victoria, where there are also several fires burning out of control in the East Gippsland region. From AAP: Several fires burning across Victoria’s East Gippsland region have been downgraded to advice level, but remain out of control. Firefighters are still tackling bushfires in the towns of Ensay and Timbarra, about 340km north-east of Melbourne. Fire crews are assessing the spread of the fire and developing strategies to tie it into existing containment lines. Aircraft are also monitoring the areas, as well as the nearby towns of Buchan, Buchan South, Sunny Point, who have also had their fire danger downgraded to advice level. A watch-and-act warning was in place early Tuesday morning after a blaze began during Monday’s extreme heat in Timbarra. Residents were also advised to stay indoors as a precaution. Another 10 bushfires are burning across the state, covering about 47,000ha, according to the Country Fire Authority. “The fires mainly cover remote forest regions, where extreme dryness and rough terrain is making it difficult for firefighters to reach,” a spokeswoman said. Northern and north-east Victoria remains at very high bushfire risk despite the cool change overnight. Guardian Australia photographer Mike Bowers is in Braidwood where a fire is at a watch and act level. The University of NSW has also closed some its campuses, but not all. It has clarified some reporting out there to say that only its Biological Sciences north and south campuses have shut down “to avoid further disruption”. There are many organisations involved in the bushfire response effort. Marine Rescue teams have been on standby to provide backup for the RFS and SES on the Hawkesbury for the past few days. The organisation’s volunteers know the river, and where properties are, and they can increase the radio communication coverage and coordinate resupplies. On Saturday Marine Rescue’s Peter Moore told me they sent three vessels out to where the Three Mile fire was burning along Mangrove Creek. Between them, the SES and others about 20 boats were stationed about 1km apart in case residents needed to get out quickly. “The residents along the road had no way of getting out easily – the winds are variable – so they just wanted every contingency covered,” he said. “So if we have to move people, we had the facility without too much fuss.” That part of Sydney has about 2,000 people without road access to their properties. “It’s the third time we’ve been deployed,” Moore said. “We went out on the previous two hot days. You had this feeling of impending doom. The smoke was that thick you couldn’t see the side of the river. We used radar. “Luckily we weren’t needed.” We looked earlier at the overall air quality index but the numbers for the PM2.5 particles (the ones small enough to get deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream) are pretty shocking across the state. Health department data measures rolling 24-hour averages, and in the past few hours a number of regions have bounced into the red “hazardous” zone, which is above 200. Armidale in the northern tablelands has hit 542, and to the south-west in Tamworth it has reached 428. Goulburn in the southern tablelands is also extraordinarily high at 462. Most of the greater Sydney region is also in the red, with measurements above 300 across the north-west except in Rouse Hill where it has hit 430. Sydney’s east ranges from 157 in Earlwood to 353 in Macquarie Park. Sydney University’s campuses at Camden and Molonglo are still closed to staff, students and visitors, after being evacuated last Thursday. A limited number of staff attending to the critical care of animals were allowed access to the sites this morning, the uni said, but those people had pre-approval from their line managers and security. People are being told not to return until at least tomorrow. A quick update of the current fire situation as that southerly change starts moving through the state. Emergency level: The Three Mile fore, in the central coast, has burned through more than 31,000ha. Watch and Act level: The Gospers Mountain fire, in the Hawkesbury, has burned through more than 319,000ha. The Green Wattle Creek fire, south-west of Warragamba Dam Wall in the Blue Mountains national park, has burned through more than 109,000ha. The Kerry Ridge fire, near Muswellbrook, has burned through more than 53,400ha. The Little L Complex fire at Singleton has burned through more than 65,900ha. There are 86 other fires burning. In the context of those health warnings we’ve just heard, here’s the Climate and Health Alliance - a coalition of healthcare stakeholders lobbying for climate change action as a health issued. From a NSW Ambulance Service spokesman: “In conditions like these, New South Wales ambulance is responding to between 70 and 100 instances of respiratory illness per day, from asthma to emphysema. “Today they’ve treated a 93-year-old woman in northern Sydney and a 23-year-old woman in western Sydney, both of whom had pre-existing asthma conditions. “Both of those patients did not have their asthma medication with them. To the vulnerable people in the community – that is children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions that are either respiratory or cardiac-related – we encourage them to say indoors and to have their medications with them. These conditions should not be taken lightly.” NSW Health is addressing the media, urging people to stay indoors and seek out air-conditioned environments. The air quality is up there with the worst they’ve ever seen, and the southerly change is expected to bring “some relief”. Sydney has experience poor air quality episodes before, for instance the 2009 dust storm, but this smokey period for the past month is “unprecedented”. “Most people are going to be experiencing this as sore eyes, nose and throat, or perhaps a bit of a cough, but there are other people who will find it makes their symptoms worse,” Dr Richard Bruen said. “For example, if you do have asthma or emphysema, it could your respiratory condition worsen.” Asked about the utility of face masks, they’ve said the “loose fitting material masks” don’t really have a material effect but the P2 or N95 masks are “in theory effective” but need to have a really good fit. I’m going to hand you over to my colleague Helen Davidson now. Thanks for reading. As expected, conditions are worsening as the temperatures drop along with the strong gusty winds moving up through NSW from the south. The latest air quality figures have gone live. This covers 12pm - 1pm AEDT, so it’s still half an hour behind. The maximum AQI has dropped in Sydney city’s centre (Cook and Phillip) and east (Randwick). Those were hitting over 2000 between 10-11 but are now down to maximums of 1223 and 907. That is still four to five times the hazardous level. They remain over 2000 in the west, at Richmond and St Marys. That’s up to 11 times hazardous. Parramatta North has dropped marginally to 1719. Hazardous levels begin at 200. The NSW Rural Fire Service has issued an emergency warning for the Three Mile fire near the Hawkesbury River on the state’s central coast. The RFS said the fire has merged with another Wrights Cree fire and was increasing in the areas of Central Mangrove and Kulnura. It said if you are in those areas it is now too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches and protect yourself from the heat. “Conditions are expected to deteriorate today with fire expected to spread to the east and north after a southerly change,” the RFS said. For other areas affected, the Gosford RSL Club has been set up as an evacuation centre. While the cricketers play on, the smoke has forced the cancellation of the traditional Sydney to Hobart lead-up race for safety reasons. A spokeswoman for Transport for NSW said all Sydney ferry services were suspended and vessels would remain in port until the smoke lifted. “We just don’t know when that is going to be. It will be when the smoke lifts and we get the all-clear for the ferry services to resume.” Replacement bus services are running between Manly and Circular Quay. For passengers on other routes, passengers are advised to seek alternative public transport. Steve O’Keefe still rolling the arm over despite Sydney’s big end of the world energy. From Kensington in Sydney’s south-east. In some good news, the thick smoke is preventing fire conditions from worsening. But they may worsen in the afternoon as strong winds pick up. Some live footage from today’s Sheffield Shield game at the SCG. Nearly empty stands, almost invisible players. The offices of the Sydney Morning Herald are being evacuated, after their smoke alarm went off. Sydney’s ferries have now been cancelled due to the smoke. Buses are replacing ferries. Sydney’s air quality has reached as high as 11 times the hazardous level, according to the state’s monitoring index. The worst reading is currently at Macquarie Park in Sydney’s north-west, which recorded air quality of 2,214 between 9am and 10am this morning. Any air quality index reading above 200 is considered hazardous. Prospect in Sydney’s north reached 2,075 and Parramatta North has reached 2,024 with levels continuing to rise. Liam Gallagher is in Sydney and has weighed in on the smoke. A few views of Sydney... Severe heatwave conditions combined with “grotty” smoke pollution will put stress on vulnerable people in the coming days, authorities have warned. The haze may cause breathing issues for those with heart or lung disease, while Sydneysiders have been encouraged to stay indoors and avoid exercise. NSW Health environmental health director Dr Richard Broome said Tuesday would be “very hot and very smoky”. “It’s going to be putting a lot of stress on vulnerable people, particularly elderly people who have existing heart and lung conditions,” Broome told reporters. Asked about concerns about the time that volunteer firefighters are being asked to continue volunteering without pay, and reports they’re crowd-sourcing funds for water and food on the ground, the prime minister Scott Morrison rejected the suggestion the federal government could do more. Speaking in Sydney a few minutes ago Morrison said: No, I don’t share that view because I know what the practice is and I know what the experience is and I know what’s happening on the ground and I know that whether it’s the ADF or any other agency of the commonwealth, all of those agencies, our efforts have been channelled and coordinated [into] the response of the state and territory staff on the ground. That is what is set up. That is what was intended to be set up and that is operating and I’m pleased with the way those arrangements are being worked out and if there is any other matter that would need to be addressed, it would be raised with the commonwealth, because there is a direct line to make sure that happens. He also rejected suggestions the country’s volunteer firefighting forces should be professionalised: We are constantly looking at ways to better facilitate the volunteer effort, but to professionalise that at that scale is not a matter that has previously been accepted and it’s not currently under consideration by the government. But as is the case with all fire events, or as is the case with all flood events and other natural disasters, this nationally coordinated effort is designed to constantly look at those issues, post these events. Smoke alarms continue to go off at random because of the thick smoke covering so much of Sydney and the rest of the state. Parts of the University of New South Wales have had to be evacuated, as has Fisher Library at the University of Sydney and the ABC’s Central Coast studio which has been evacuated twice on Tuesday morning. https://twitter.com/alix_thoeming/status/1204197285497733120 Elsewhere, fog horns are going off across Sydney harbour as ferries try to find their way through the thick haze. Air quality across NSW continues to decline. By 9am PM2.5 fine particle readings had reached “very poor” to “hazardous” in much of Sydney, the Hunter and central coast and Illawarra regions. The worst readings, between 262 and 337 on the air quality index over a 24-hour rolling average, have been in the north-west around Richmond and St Marys. Some parts of Sydney have recorded levels of 1789 on the index, where anything above 200 is considered hazardous. Most of the upper Hunter, and the central, southern and northern tablelands are also experiencing hazardous air quality, according to the Department of Planning and Environment. If you’re unfamiliar with what a PM2.5 fine particle is, my colleague Naaman Zhou has helpfully explained it here: The Green Wattle Creek fire burning in Wollondilly west of Sydney has now been upgraded to watch and act. The fire has already burned through about 100,000ha. The RFS says the fire is burning on both sides of Lake Burragorang and that activity is increasing across the fireground. Quite a few reports of this today, now it appears the RFS headquarters in Sydney has been briefly evacuated after smoke alarms were triggered. Sydneysiders love to refer to the glory index; that is, how glorious the city is looking on any given day. Sad to report that, like the air quality, today’s is very, very low. Meanwhile in Victoria there are still 12 bushfires burning, with evacuation warnings still in place in the state’s East Gippsland region. A watch-and-act warning remains in place for residents on the Timbarra settlement, about 340km north-east of Melbourne, after a blaze began during Monday’s extreme heat. “Don’t wait, leaving now is the safest option – conditions may change and get worse very quickly,” the warning reads on Tuesday morning. A bushfire directly south of Timbarra, in the town of Ensay, is also out of control with a watch-and-act warning in place for residents in Ensay North, Holstons and Reedy Flat. About 100 firefighters are working to put out the blaze, with an emergency warning downgraded overnight, AAP reports. Another 10 bushfires are burning across the state, covering about 47,000ha, according to the Country Fire Authority. “The fires mainly cover remote forest regions, where extreme dryness and rough terrain is making it difficult for firefighters to reach,” a spokeswoman said. Northern and north-east Victoria remains at very high bushfire risk despite the cool change overnight. The Gospers Mountain fire has already merged with the fire at Kerry Ridge further north, but as the RFS map shows there is a real possibility that it could also join with the fire at Three Mile Creek. That would create a huge fire front for firefighters. Two more blazes – the Kerry Ridge fire near Muswellbrook in the Hunter Valley and the Three Mile fire on the central coast – have been upgraded to watch and act by the Rural Fire Service. The Three Mile fire has merged with the separate Wrights Creek fire. The RFS says the fire is increasing in the area of Bloodtree Road at Kulnur. The Kerry Ridge fire continues to burn within the Wollemi national park but has now moved east into the Putty state forest, as well as west into the Coricudgy state forest. The RFS says the blaze, in combination with the Gospers Mountain fire, has moved towards some isolated rural properties. The NSW Rural Fire Service has updated the status of the mega blaze at Gospers Mountain on the central coast to watch and act, saying activity has “increased across the fireground”. There are a number of fires burning across the Hawkesbury, including at Gospers Mountain where the fire is burning between Newnes and Wisemans Ferry, Putty (St Albans) and Central Colo. The fire has burned through more than 319,000 hectares. “Conditions are expected to deteriorate today. This may see the fire spread to the east and north following a southerly change,” the RFS says. The smoke isn’t just affecting Sydney, believe it or not. Here’s two pictures of the same view across the Hawkesbury River on the NSW central coast. The first, which shows backburning operations, was taken last night. The second, which shows nothing, is from this morning. Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke to reporters from smoke-covered Sydney on Tuesday. “As we can see here, standing on the lawn in Sydney, there are fires across Australia today, particularly here in New South Wales with a mega fire to our north-west which I had the opportunity to be briefed on on the weekend when I visited Wilberforce and the control centre there,” he said. “But up in Queensland, in Victoria, in South Australia, there are heatwave conditions here on the east coast today. I would just ask, as always, these fires have been going on for months now, not just weeks, and to continue to follow the instructions of fire authorities in your respective states, to be aware of the information that has been provided.” Our Canberra photographer Mike Bowers took these shots of the sun setting through a cloud of bushfire smoke hanging over Parliament House on Monday evening. Andy Ball has made several updates to our map which demonstrates the immense scale of the bushfires. The area burned in NSW and Queensland is now a staggering 2.9m hectares, which is larger than many small countries – somewhere around the size of Albania. We also had many requests from people to add more locations for comparison, so it is now possible to reposition the map, and Andy has added a larger number of cities. NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay thanks the more than 2,000 firefighters on the ground across the state. “We know you are weary,” she writes. The bushfire smoke has delivered a haunting sunrise over Parliament House in the nation’s capital. The Bureau of Meteorology says a southerly wind this afternoon will help ease the smoke choking Sydney this morning, though it may not help firefighters battling blazes across the rest of the state. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just been speaking about the bushfire crisis. He says there are 111 aircraft working to battle fires not just in NSW but also in Victoria and Queensland. Emergency assistance payments have been running now for some time and I must say I’ve been incredibly impressed by the coordination that has occurred between our states and territories, with great support from those from overseas. We’ve had firefighters here from New Zealand, from Canada, from the United States, and they will be out there assisting in so many different roles again today. So I would ask people to take great care and to follow the advice and warnings that have been provided and to stay safe and to exercise appropriate judgment, particularly with fire conditions being the way they are today. Our thoughts are with all of those who are out there doing their job today. Sydney has again woken to a thick blanket of smoke, with officials issuing a “poor” air quality alert for the city on Tuesday morning. By 5am, air quality was graded as “very poor” to “hazardous” in parts of Sydney’s north-west and south-west as well across the Hunter and Central Coast regions. Air quality also remained “very poor” in Lismore in the state’s north. Good morning, New South Wales is staring down another difficult day of bushfire danger, with smoke pollution set to smother Sydney and temperatures to soar past 40C. The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, warned on Monday that while wind conditions won’t be as difficult as previous high fire danger days, that could be cancelled out by the high temperatures and low humidity expected on Tuesday. “It’s not as bad as the catastrophic weather we had weeks ago but it’s certainly going to be another difficult day, particularly given the scale and complexity of these fires and their proximity to so much more built-up and populated areas,” he told reporters on Monday. Almost 3,000 firefighters will be deployed to fight the more than 80 bushfires which continue to burn across the state, including a so-called mega-fire north-west of Sydney, which was formed when the huge Gospers Mountain blaze merged with the neighbouring Little L Complex, Paddock Run, Three Mile and Kerry Ridge fires. Total fire bans are in place for nine regions across NSW on Tuesday, including in Sydney, amid fears that temperatures in the high 30s to 40s and strengthening winds will fuel existing fires and potentially ignite new ones. Along with Sydney, total fire bans are in place with “severe” fire danger forecast in the Hunter, Illawarra/Shoalhaven, southern ranges, central ranges, Monaro Alpine and the ACT."

          "headline": "Why do I have to break an embargo in order to expose press lies about Labour?",
          "bodyText": "One of the golden rules of journalism is that you don’t break an embargo – a block on publication until a certain date. For the first time in my career, I’m breaking one now. The moral case for doing so outweighs the moral case for respecting it. For five months the press regulator, Ipso, which was set up by British newspapers, has been considering a complaint that could play a role in this election. It concerns an outrageous lie about the Labour party first published by the Mail on Sunday and repeated many times by other newspapers and the Conservative party. Two weeks ago, Ipso ruled against the paper, and imposed a major sanction. The Mail on Sunday asked for a review of the decision, delaying its publication. The review upheld the decision, but it still hasn’t been published. So, as far as voters are concerned, the lie stands. A key claim used to tip the balance against Labour remains uncorrected. I owe more to the truth than I do to the embargo. Last summer, I co-published a report to the Labour party titled Land for the Many. It took many months of work, drawing on a vast range of sources and expertise, to produce radical but realistic ideas for changing the way we use our most important resource. We worked hard to make our arguments as watertight as possible. We needn’t have bothered, because our opponents scarcely addressed them. The storm of lies about our report in the billionaire press gave me an idea of what it must be like to be a Labour politician. Pushing back against them all would be a fulltime job for several people. But we decided to confront one of them in the hope that it might illuminate the others. The Mail on Sunday turned our independent report for the Labour party into “bombshell plans being drawn up by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn”, then told an outright lie about what it contained. We proposed, it said, “to scrap the capital gains tax exemption on main homes”. At the moment, if you sell the house or flat in which you live, you don’t pay capital gains tax on the profit you might make. We examined the case for changing this, explained the arguments for and against, then clearly and specifically rejected the idea. But who cares, if you can terrify the living daylights out of your readership, convincing them that Corbyn is the spawn of Satan? As if to suggest that such lies are organised with the Conservative party, the article quoted Boris Johnson, who claimed “this mad ‘tax on all your houses’ would cripple every Brit who owns or wants to own their own home”. The lie was picked up on social media by other senior Conservatives, and has been used repeatedly in the party’s campaign materials, websites and Facebook pages. It was reproduced by most of the other billionaire papers, and continues to be circulated. Just last week, an article by Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun claimed that Labour was considering a “movers tax”, “scrapping the capital gains exemption on main homes”. The false claim has now been deeply implanted in people’s minds: Labour is coming for your home. One of the authors of our report, Anna Powell-Smith, made a complaint to Ipso. Had she not been determined, she might have been defeated by a process that seems designed to deter. For much of the five months this has taken to resolve, the newspaper, with its vastly greater resources, was allowed to bombard her with Johnsonian arguments, or offer tiny clarifications on a remote page. It was time-consuming and intimidating. Most people are likely to have given up or accepted a meaningless concession. Watching this process, I came to the conclusion that Ipso is not fit for purpose. Even so, it eventually bowed to the inevitable. This is a rare victory against the billionaire press, but it would count for nothing if buried until the election is over. Anyone who wants a better world finds themselves at war with the exceedingly rich people who own the media and the editors and journalists they employ. The pen might be mightier than the sword, but the wallet is mightier than the pen. News is the propaganda of the oligarch. Are we prepared to allow the proprietors of the newspapers, many of whom live offshore, to determine the course of our politics? The rewards for political lying are massive: they include winning referendums and elections. The penalties are either nonexistent or tiny. If the Conservative party is sanctioned by the Electoral Commission for any of its outrageous lying and cheating, it might, long after the election, have to pay the maximum fine of £20,000, which a friendly billionaire could doubtless pull out of his back pocket. If elections are won by lies, we find ourselves governed by liars. They won’t hesitate to ramp up their deceptions when in office. One focus is likely to be voter suppression. Already the Conservatives, learning from Republican tricks in the US, have floated the idea that people must bring photo ID to the polling booths. They know that 3.5 million people, few of whom are likely to vote Conservative, don’t possess it. The old adages – cheats never prosper, the truth will out, virtue always triumphs – are themselves falsehoods. But, futile as it often seems, one-sided as the war between truth and falsehood always is, we must fight the tide of lies. Don’t let them win this week. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Leslie Ash: ‘You go through a grieving process when you've lost your career'",
          "bodyText": "‘You see that grey building?” Leslie Ash says. We are standing at the window of her central London penthouse. “That’s Charing Cross hospital. Now, see that bit sticking out on the left? That was my room, on the top floor.” In 2004, Ash spent nearly three months there, recovering from the superbug methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), a variant of MRSA, perhaps watching her old life out of the window and wondering if she would ever get it back. She had contracted the infection from a different hospital, the Chelsea and Westminster – she believes from an epidural needle – after being admitted with cracked ribs, and for weeks it was unclear whether she would walk again. Her husband, the former footballer Lee Chapman, and her two sons, were warned that she might die. It must be strange to have her near-death experience perpetually hovering out of the corner of her eye. “Yes,” she says mildly. “It’s a bit of a shadow in the background there.” “Shadow” is an understatement, because although Ash walks well, darting around the living room in trainers or sitting as upright as a dancer on one of her enormous sofas, her ordeal, and her recovery, are never out of sight. She was 44 when she was admitted to hospital, still best recognised as the perkily luscious Debs in the BBC sitcom Men Behaving Badly. At 59, she still looks perky, but with the slightly skittish movements of a creature emerging from an unscheduled hibernation. “I really feel like I’ve lost 10 years out of my life,” she tells me as we sit down. In the years that followed her illness, Ash underwent endless physiotherapy, pilates and workouts, and swore off alcohol, but the doctors “kept upping the doses of painkillers until I actually felt like a bit of a zombie,” she says. It was her son Max who told her: “‘You’re slurring!’... I thought: ‘God, this is terrible! What can I do?’ When you’re on those pills, they are antidepressants, you don’t feel any emotion at all.” So two years ago she came off all medication. With her brain firing again, she has “woken up, like a film, like a dream”. The duration of the dream appears to be as hazy as the outline of Charing Cross hospital, because sometimes Ash says it lasted eight years, sometimes 10. This feeling of having been dormant seems to have embedded itself in Ash’s mind as a reality rather than a metaphor, because next time she refers to the experience, she says simply: “After I woke up …” And what happened after she awoke was that Ash found herself locked out of an unrecognisable industry. She had spent years broadening her range of movement, regaining her balance, waking her nerves – they grow 1mm a month, she says, giving the impression that she watched them daily. She devoted herself to her physical recovery, and wrote monologues she hoped to perform but would struggle to remember. But when she tried to find work, she was hit with a fresh and unexpected disorientation. “All doors were shut. All doors were shut.” She says it twice as if they are rebounding in her face. “When I was doing Men Behaving Badly, people were asking: ‘Can you endorse this? Would you like this job?’ I was inundated,” she says. In those days, she says, if someone broke a leg during filming, the director would say: “Let’s shoot around it!” So while she recovered, she thought, “quite pretentiously, I suppose, that my career would carry on. They would just ‘shoot around it’. But in fact, I was quite amazed at how I got dropped. Completely. It was just ... it was quite suffocating,” she says with a small gasp. “It’s like the rug being brought up from beneath your feet. No one wants to know you ... I thought, I have to start again.” It was in this spirit of a personal reset that Ash was browsing Spotlight, the casting platform, when she noticed an ad for a trailer for a pilot for a possible show. The person who posted the advert, Elaine Sturgess, is the writer of Gin and It, a short film that Ash liked the sound of, and which the two women have now made. They got on so well, they have launched a new venture, BooksOffice, a website that allows users to vote on which unpublished or self-published books Ash and Sturgess should try to bring to the screen. They have meetups for authors and actors at the bar Ash and Chapman own in Clapham, south London – once her parents’ painting and decorating shop; Michelle Collins is among those to have come along. “Everyone wants content,” Ash says, and of course she herself wants work, and BooksOffice can provide her with parts, and the chance to move into production or direction. All of this makes sense, but has it really been so hard to find work that she has had to devise a way to make it for herself? Did industry friends not check up on her, to make sure that she was OK? She gives a small laugh. “Erm. No. Not really. I can count on one hand how many people checked in. No. I was quite remote. I think a lot of people thought: ‘Give her space to sort herself out.’ And then years turned into a decade.” “I think it comes from me as well,” she says. “And I just couldn’t find a way of doing it.” She would phone people up and say: “Hi, what are you doing? Let’s meet for lunch!” But when she got there, she couldn’t push past the pleasantries. They would say: “It was lovely to see you. You’re looking really well,” she says sadly. “You go through a grieving process when you’ve lost your career. You know. And it can catch you at moments where you just feel like shit.” Ash has recently played a small part in To Be Someone, a film inspired by the Who classic Quadrophenia, in which she starred at 18, back in the days when she was buzzing around town in her little white Mini, smoking Consulates and imagining the life that lay ahead. So why can’t she get it back? During the course of the afternoon she offers at least half a dozen explanations. She still attends auditions, but is “crap at doing self-tapes”, a requirement for many roles. Being older means there are fewer parts for her, while having a disability places her in two overlapping categories of discrimination. You would think that the experience of swerving death and adapting to a hugely altered body must have added to her emotional range as an actor. “That was my thought,” she says. “But it is a very difficult business. If you’re not the whole package, they just choose someone else. It’s as brutal as that.” Social media may also have contributed to her exclusion, and to combat this she has joined Instagram “at the grand age of 59”. She has only been on it a week and already got 70 followers, she says, sounding chuffed. “I’m actually very proud of that.” She has a vague sense that during all those dormant years no one wanted to interrupt her. Which is funny since she was so desperate for someone or something to break the spell. I can’t work out whether Ash thinks people didn’t know how tough her recovery was, and that’s why they left her alone, or if she thinks they did know, and that’s why they didn’t approach her. “You know what, no one likes to speak to people when they’re not doing well,” she says, laughing. “Well, when you’re not in the limelight any more, it’s true. People don’t particularly care.” In 2006, Ash was awarded £5m compensation from the NHS for loss of earnings following her MSSA ordeal. The lawyers came up with the figure, she says, and if anything her loss has probably been greater. For years, her accountancy bill exceeded her salary. But the payout outraged parts of the media. The Daily Mail headlined with “The £5m trout pout”, a reference to the swelling of Ash’s lips caused by fillers she had in 2002. (The News of the World coined the phrase “trout pout” in her honour, but the subject is off-limits for Ash, who will only say: “It is very much in the past.”) “I was quite amazed – they made me feel like I’d won the lottery,” Ash says. “I felt that was probably the reason why I wasn’t working. Because I think people thought I was putting it on.” There is a pause. The sun has set while we’ve been chatting, and her face is harder to read in the dark. “I honestly don’t know,” she says. While Ash has made a remarkable physical recovery, there is one issue that she has never been able to fully resolve. When she contracted MSSA, she was in hospital with two broken ribs, having fallen out of bed during “energetic lovemaking” with Chapman. (This was at 7am after an all-night bender.) Chapman was later arrested on suspicion of assault, but never charged. Ash’s sister subsequently claimed that Ash was a victim of domestic abuse. Ash and Chapman have always denied this claim. The sisters remain estranged. Chapman, who is downstairs in the apartment while Ash and I talk, had previously been arrested in 1997, when he pursued Ash, after an argument, to the home of her Men Behaving Badly co-star Caroline Quentin. He was arrested after trying to kick down Quentin’s door. Ash took out an injunction against him but they quickly reconciled, and the injunction was dropped. At the time of those incidents, Ash and Chapman’s marriage was routinely described as “tempestuous” or “turbulent”. Ash doesn’t like these words. She prefers passionate. “Passion, passion … Absolute passion!” she says. “I’m a person who walks out and slams the door. Always have been, always will be.” She has spoken in the past about the time she chipped Chapman’s teeth, when she threw a phone at him during one row. Indeed, some reviewers of her 2007 autobiography, My Life Behaving Badly, objected to the degree of responsibility she took for problems within their relationship. But Ash says now that she did so because “I didn’t want everyone to think about Lee being a bad person. Because, no, it takes two to argue.” I can’t help thinking that some people’s suspicion that Ash was the victim of assault added an additional dimension to her recovery. She was suspected of suffering in silence, when silence is seen as weak or disobliging, and she was denigrated for it, her denials distrusted. And all this despite the fact that there has never been proof that an assault took place. “No!” she says. “Because there’s nothing there!” She and Chapman have been married for nearly 32 years. “We’re growing old together,” Ash says. “It’s weird. We’re just like the same person sometimes. I know what he’s thinking. I can finish his sentences. I can be somewhere, walking the dog, and suddenly he’ll come running past. I’ve got this sense that he’s always there.” I wonder how Ash feels about the #MeToo movement, which draws its strength from women speaking out and the tendency sometimes now to see a person who chooses silence as irresponsible. “That’s what worries me about social media,” Ash says. “Everyone is in this frame of mind that they have to tell everything. With #MeToo I can understand completely about horrible things that women have gone through ... But I just don’t want women to lose their empowerment.” She seems to be saying that talking frankly about a violent experience can be a double-edged sword. “Because it can make women look terribly weak. And at the moment we are trying to be strong. But at the same time you don’t want to let people get away with it,” she says. “So therefore I do agree with the #MeToo movement. But ... people have to be careful, and make sure that stories are told the right way.” She herself, she says, feels stronger now than at any point in her life. “I’ve found my voice the older I’ve got.” In the 90s, when she was filming Men Behaving Badly, she mostly sat and listened on set. “I was terrified that if I said anything, they wouldn’t find it funny at all.” And although in her 40s, in the aftermath of the MSSA, she dreaded ageing, now that her 60s are looming, the number doesn’t seem so bad. In any case, she works out four times a week, “and I know I can keep my face toned”. She runs her fingers down her cheek. “I’m going in certain areas. But I think you’ve just got to take a deep breath,” she says, exhaling heavily, “and just go with it.” So she isn’t scared of the big number? “No,” she says, and immediately adds, “I don’t know. Because my mum died at 68. So I’ve got that feeling of: ‘Oh God, have I only got eight years? So that’s a thing.” Maybe her mum is on her mind, because when she goes to the bar in Clapham, which was her parents’ old shop, Ash can picture her there, sitting on her stool, with a photo of Ash by the counter. “I’d like to live,” she adds. “You know. I just don’t know whether I will.” Ash believes she is a better actor now – all she needs is the chance. “But I am going to do it again,” she says. “Even if I have to make the shows myself.” For more information, visit booksoffice.com"

          "bodyText": "Traversing a landscape hewn by glaciers, the Overland Track passes jagged peaks, inky lakes and forbidding gorges on a journey into the heart of Tasmania’s wilderness world heritage area. The trail from Cradle Valley to Lake St Clair takes hikers across alpine plateaus, where wildflowers peep out below snowdrifts, through moors dotted with buttongrass and grazing wombats, and into majestic myrtle beech rainforests. It’s bucket-list beautiful. Palawa people have cared for this country for thousands of generations, since arriving during the last ice age. In this remote landscape, their resilience is thrown into sharp relief. While today’s track won’t challenge fit walkers, you can bet the weather will. Almost half the path is above 1,000 metres, and rain, snow, wind and sunshine can come any time of the year … or all within a single hour. Just three hours into my four-day hike, I find myself soaked, shivering and getting smashed by a hail-blasting gale that keeps knocking me off my feet, sending me crawling through knee-deep snow. In November. Half an hour ago our group of nine reached the trail’s highest point, and on cue granite clouds parted to reveal Cradle Mountain’s turrets towering over a slaty lake. But on a path circling the peak with Jill, a Tasmanian Walking Company guide who’s hauling me up when I fall, the shrieking gusts seem to be sucking the air out of me. I stack it again. “You’ve got to laugh, don’t you?” Jill says, holding out her hand. And just like that, I do. As the trip goes on, with our TWC guides merely joking that the hail was “a bit rude”, we learn from a ranger that winds of up to 100km/h have closed the trail to independent hikers. Two walkers were winched to safety. Also: just a week ago people were swimming in these lakes! Need to know: The track starts at Ronny Creek near Waldheim, a two-hour drive from Launceston airport. Some hikers take six days to reach Narcissus, then take the ferry across Lake St Clair. Others take an extra day or two to walk the length of Australia’s deepest lake. From there it’s a two-and-a-half-hour drive back to Launceston. There’s a list of transport operators at overland.com.au. Most offer luggage storage. If you don’t have enough time for the full track, it’s possible to walk for three days to Pelion Plains then exit on the fourth day along the Arm River Track to Mersey Forest. You’ll need to arrange for a shuttle to pick you up there. Self-guided hikers setting off between 1 October and 31 May must walk the trail from north to south and book in advance, paying $200 for adults and $160 concession. A parks pass is also required. For less experienced bushwalkers – and for those who can handle a little more luxury (hot showers, no tents!) – one of the private operators, TWC, offers four- and six-day hut hikes, with prices starting at $2,795 per person twin share, including meals, passes and transfers. The Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service offers a wealth of information that includes a packing guide and a checklist of the absolute minimum equipment needed. This includes sturdy footwear. On this point I felt confident. But on night one, after 11 hours struggling along slippery, snow-covered boardwalks, I confirm that the boots I bought seven years ago for two treks in Nepal have sprung leaks. (Veteran hikers will have spotted my mistake.) I place them by the fire to dry. (Ditto.) In the morning, as I’m lacing up for another 12km slog, I discover that the soles have come away. Modern boots disintegrate after five years, I’m told – and overheating mine has trashed them. But there’s freedom in knowing feet can’t get any wetter. Cable ties are applied and off we go. Flora and fauna: Look for bright green cushion plants – not one species but communities growing together to better battle the elements. But keep to the path: these mounds can take decades to recover from one footprint. Pencil and king billy pines live up to 1,200 years – if they can survive bushfires. They’re descended from plants that grew on the single super-continent of Pangaea more than 300m years ago. We spot pademelons, wallabies, black cockatoos, wedge-tailed eagles, a pink robin, a peregrine falcon and the grass-green flash of a ground parrot. Our second guide, Ziah, is an encyclopedia of information about the wildlife, stressing that being in this wondrous place and accepting its gifts creates in us the obligation to look after it. Where to sleep: There are tent platforms and public huts at the end of each day’s trek. Bunks are first come, first served. Hidden along the track are TWC’s five cosy huts. They’re designed to be ecologically sustainable, though private accommodation on public land remains anathema to staunch conservationists. Don’t miss: Take a side trip to Old Pelion Hut, a 100-year-old miners’ shelter, to read entries in its visitor book dating from the 1940s. One group of hikers describe arriving in 1960 to “contest tenancy rights with Possum who was well established in bottom right hand bunk. We won!” When to go: January to March are the drier months, with longer days and less chance of snow. That said, it’s the wild weather that really makes our trip. There are scores of spills but also thrills – when the sun comes out for whole seconds at a time, turning this wintry wonderland a dazzling white and revealing the moody yet magnificent mountains around us. • Guardian Australia was a guest of Tasmanian Walking Company and Tourism Tasmania"

          "headline": "Hard Rock Hotel collapse reminds New Orleans of undocumented workers' plight",
          "bodyText": "The sight of the collapsed Hard Rock Hotel is impossible to escape on the busy Canal Street corridor downtown. Slabs of broken gray concrete form a frozen landslide 18 stories above the ground, and the arm of a massive crane stands almost upright after a botched removal effort left it embedded in the sidewalk below. Nearly three months after the deadly collapse, the bodies of two victims – José Ponce Arreola, from Mexico, and Quinnyon Wimberly, from New Orleans – still remain inside the wreckage. After Delmer Joel Ramírez Palma was deported just days after Thanksgiving, the Hard Rock ruins serve as a stunning visual reminder of the precarious situation of undocumented workers who hold a unique place in the history of post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans. Having helped rebuild New Orleans and much of the surrounding region after the hurricane, they now face being hounded out of the place many of them call home. Ramírez Palma, an undocumented construction worker at the Hard Rock, had tried to warn supervisors of construction safety concerns but was ordered to ignore the issues, according to his lawyers and family. Two days after being seriously injured in the collapse, he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and subsequently deported to Honduras, against the protests of immigration advocates and the head of a state labor agency. He had lived in New Orleans for 18 years. For many New Orleanians, the treatment of Ramírez Palma was both a stinging rebuff to the contributions of undocumented immigrants in New Orleans over the years, and yet another example in a long history of Latinx worker abuse in the city. “It’s just unconscionable. It’s unreal how evil sometimes their policies are,” Salvador Longoria, executive director of Puentes New Orleans, said of Ice’s decision to deport the Honduran father of three. Longoria co-founded Puentes, a local Latinx advocacy not-for-profit, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to help support and assimilate the thousands of workers who came to New Orleans to rebuild the city after it was flooded by a massive levee failure. In the New Orleans area, undocumented families have had to change the way they live in Ice’s shadow, Longoria said. He knows of families that limit their outings to work and the grocery store, and of children who have memorized a plan of action, including who to call to post bail, in case their parents do not return home after work. “They’re dealing with real dystopian scenarios,” said Longoria. “After the raids and after the detention of so many other people, that’s what they’re living with every day and it really is a constant fear and tension about what could happen,” he said. Within the last six months his organization received an uptick in requests for “Know Your Rights” training from undocumented communities in neighborhoods across New Orleans to help protect themselves in case of an encounter with Ice. Latinx workers, many undocumented, were a pivotal force in the city’s post-Katrina recovery. A 2006 academic study found about half of the reconstruction workforce was Latinx, and about half of that group was undocumented. The majority of Latinx workers relocated to New Orleans from other areas of the United States. “So many of the people that were gutting the moldy buildings, and tearing walls down and doing the dirty work that has to be done in mold-infested houses were Latino workers,” said Longoria. “[They] without a doubt, reconstructed and rebuilt New Orleans.” In an effort to speed up construction after the storm, the federal government suspended enforcement of employee eligibility checks by employers and certain workplace protection measures. The result was widespread worker exploitation. “There was wage theft, there was underpayment of wages, there was abuse of the employees,” said Longoria. Reports from 2015 found day laborers were still waiting to get paid for post-Katrina work a decade after the storm. Many leading advocacy groups in the city – like the Congress of Day Laborers, an immigrant-led activism group affiliated with the New Orleans Center for Racial Justice – were created as a response to the rampant abuse of Latinx workers in the wake of the storm. Post-Katrina, the Latinx community developed a strong and growing presence in New Orleans. Since 2010, the Hispanic population has grown by 24%, outpacing 7% total growth in the metro area, according to the latest statistics from the New Orleans Data Center. Most of the area’s 114,000 Latinxs reside in the suburban areas of Jefferson Parish, outside New Orleans, and Hondurans represent about a third of the Latinx population in the area. While Ice maintained a steady rate of deportations under President Obama, the current administration’s increasingly aggressive crackdown on immigration and asylum seekers has cast a new level of fear among Latinxs in New Orleans, like so many other cities and towns across the US. Louisiana has also recently emerged as a new hub of migrant detention. Over the past year, Ice has expanded its network of detention centers across the state with eight new facilities, all former state prisons and local jails. As of today, 7,513 people, or 17% of the 44,538 national detainees, are being held in Ice custody in Louisiana, according to an agency official. While Louisiana’s converted jails are also housing detainees from out of state, the sharp rise in detention capacity and remote locations of the new facilities has alarmed local undocumented workers and immigration advocates. Bruce Hamilton, staff attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Louisiana, said he drives up to five hours to reach clients detained in Ice facilities across the state. Remote detention centers add yet another layer of difficulty to an already complicated immigration system and has a tangible impact on the outcomes of asylum cases, lawyers and advocates say. “[Asylum-seekers] are very much cut off from the resources that could help you with asylum,” said Hamilton. “You don’t have access to your papers, if they’re in the care and custody of your family. You don’t have access necessarily to an attorney. And you may have very limited access to the internet or to a law library.” A spate of controversial cases in Louisiana this year – including the detention and deportation of Yoel Alono Leal, a Cuban man with cancer, and the suicide of another Cuban, Roylan Hernández-Díaz, while in a private Ice detention facility – have prompted popular outcry against Ice policies. The ACLU is pushing Ice to stop the use of solitary confinement in detention centers and grant bonds and parole for asylum seekers on humanitarian grounds. Granting of parole requests has dropped precipitously among certain Ice field offices, from more than 90% in 2011-2013 to 4% in February-September 2017, according to an ACLU lawsuit. Ice officials did not respond to a question on parole denials but said in an email statement: “Bond decisions are based on an alien’s flight risk, and the potential threat to public safety. Each case is reviewed individually, taking into account factors like immigration history, criminal history and community ties.” While New Orleans keeps a sanctuary city policy that prevents local police from aiding Ice, in suburban municipalities – where the Latinx population is concentrated – offer no such protections for the undocumented. Still, New Orleans, which exists in the mainstream imagination along a black/white racial binary, isn’t immune to anti-Latino sentiment, says Longoria. His family emigrated to New Orleans from Cuba when he was four years old, and he noted that even while most New Orleanians are accepting of the Latinx community, he still perceives a gradual shift in racial anxieties. “I grew up here and I never felt a tension about my Latino identity and my assimilation in the city. But, as the years have gone on, when certain people see the number of Latinos increasing … they feel that for some reason or another their way of life is threatened.” Longoria still takes the long view: “I hope that most New Orleanians realize that, you know, Latinos have actually been here since the city was founded,” he said. “And it’s just a new phase of that history that has always existed in New Orleans.”"

          "headline": "Bloomberg New Contemporaries 2019 review – a vintage year for emerging artists",
          "bodyText": "Anyone who wants a vision of the future should hasten to the South London Gallery for the 70th edition of Bloomberg New Contemporaries. Only fledgling artists are allowed to qualify for this annual UK showcase. This means students in their final year, recent graduates or newly enrolled postgraduates, almost all of them striving under a dead weight of debt, trying to find a place to live and work, turning up to jobs in shops and bars, making their art at night, or on Sundays, on the underground or the bus. I’ve met students whose perpetual dread was not getting from the till job at Lidl to the studio (or the garage, or the old childhood bedroom) fast enough to give birth to their ideas. Yet there is no sense of defeat in the 2019 show. It has been there in the past, in a kind of sullen or weary laboriousness, a wilful cack-handedness, or a complete surrender to the iconography of the internet. But this year’s edition of Bloomberg New Contemporaries is the most vital in a while. It is visually strong, intellectually sharp, full of skill and ability, strong on painting and photography, lacking all sorts of defects seen in recent years – the moaning and pomposity and lo-fi crud. It is also unusually humorous. The first thing you see on entering the gallery is an array of abstract canvases, monochrome and ever so slightly awry, like an awkward pastiche of old-fashioned gestural painting. A couple of works appear to have slipped down the wall, and are stealing across the floor, as if they wanted to get away from all the art world solemnity. Behind them lies an enigmatic squiggle of black paint. Alaena Turner’s installation is called Secret Action Painting, a one-liner of a title to be sure. But this is nonetheless a work of historical subtlety, and a joie de vivre that remains in the memory. Jan Agha’s painting Pompous Prick is a stinging satire that holds its own as an image. The member in question is blue, and upright, with a face like thunder and a ludicrously outsize Dalí moustache – a cathartic Ubu Roi for the #MeToo generation. And maybe he has a priapic follower in Taylor Jack Smith’s animation Dentin, in which a bald old knucklehead grinds his teeth repeatedly (to a wincing soundtrack) as if unable to use his words. Annie Mackinnon sends up eco-capitalism with a brief and gloriously abrupt film portrait of her father (who works in the field of biodiversity conservation) wearing a “sustainable” grow bag filled with manure, and sounding off against the pious hypocrisies of the fashion industry – “full of shit!” And Cyrus Hung has made something new out of old footage of the German master Georg Baselitz and his admirers yarning grandiloquently on about his place in art history. Hung set the words to music and rapped them himself; the result is a deft and gleeful skit on all the heavy heroism. But there are other kinds of wit on show here. Stefania Zocco has looked hard at the inner life of machines – specifically the way that computer images are formed out of digital data. Her beautiful painting Looks Like a Cloud is based on a moment of raw data in all its ephemeral striations, running like a mackerel sky across the canvas – as briefly visible, it seems, as a cloud. And for pure pictorial imagination, Gabriela Giroletti’s large canvas Around and Around is a standout. Giroletti coins an organic new form that has a nearly animal force to it, a curvaceous creature arriving out of a thicket of green paint that feels so sudden as to be something other than what it is – entirely abstract. Elsewhere there are hints of painterly influence – Philip Guston, always the painter’s painter; a touch of John Currin’s archness in some of the more lurid works; and traces of Celia Paul’s spectral painting in pensive family portraits. And anyone looking for the legacy of Italian arte povera will find it lingering on in some of the floor-based sculptures in this show. Katharina Fitz’s Memory Palace makes an ancient city out of modest bits of storage and packing, captivating in all its columns, cylinders and rotundas. Emily Stollery creates a miniature skyline of rooftops and rafters using the discarded moulds from which real architectural elements were formed. The political art feels more global this year. Roei Greenberg photographs a Syrian tank from the 1970s upturned in Israel’s National Park, its caterpillar tyres visible, yet camouflaged in the undergrowth of history. Justin Apperley’s images of mysterious figures in a black-and-white landscape can hardly be photographs at all, or so it seems at first sight. In fact they are shots of an off-grid punk community in the Yukon, almost unreachably remote, hidden like snow leopards in plain sight. Some of the films here are striking for their brevity and punch, particularly Louis Blue Newby’s outstandingly eerie remake of a scene from David Cronenberg’s Crash from a queer perspective. But the outstanding film work here is almost static, and intentionally so – Louiza Ntourou’s exquisitely contemplative closeup of a single leaf pictured against a glowing sky between two trees. It scarcely moves in time or space, held aloft by the breeze like a detail in a Japanese watercolour. It’s titled Once Upon a Time, a Time That Never Was and Always Is. Ntourou is Greek. The 45 artists in this exhibition come from Russia, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Brazil, as well as Northallerton and Ipswich. Never forget how international is the British art scene. Nearly all are still in their early 20s and they come from dozens of art schools around the country. Of course there are callow and unfulfilled works in this show. And of course the range depends not just upon the taste of the selectors – in this case the artists Rana Begum, Ben Rivers and Sonia Boyce – but on those who appointed the panel. But what’s remarkable is just how rapidly you cease to think of these Bloomberg New Contemporaries as recent students at all, seeing them instead as independent minds producing compelling new art. Bloomberg New Contemporaries 2019 is at the South London Gallery (Peckham Road, London SE5 and Fire Station, SE15) until 23 February 2020"

          "headline": "US is losing the battle for Pacific power",
          "bodyText": "If anything demonstrates the interconnectedness of the 21st-century world, it is how a decision made in the Solomon Islands, population 650,000, in the remote South Pacific, can affect the behaviour of powerful countries on the other side of the globe. That, in a way, is exactly what happened last week when Nato leaders met in London. Top of their agenda was Donald Trump’s demand that Europe pay more for its defence. But why is the US so exercised about so-called “burden-sharing”? In part because, these days, it is looking west, not east. The US has identified China, not Russia, as the biggest strategic, economic and potential military rival to its global leadership. Barack Obama, who was dubbed the “Pacific president”, formalised this shift with his 2011 “pivot to Asia”, which prioritised the region. But the Solomons’ decision to throw in its lot with China, by accepting large-scale investment and cutting diplomatic ties with Taiwan, is further evidence that the US rebalancing act is failing. It is losing the battle for power and influence in the Pacific as well as Europe. Part of the reason is Trump himself. His America First outlook, by encouraging international disengagement, has created political vacuums that China is filling, not only in the South Pacific but all around the region, from Pakistan to the Philippines. Some minnows, such as Palau, push back – but they are a minority. While Trump was busy withdrawing from the now defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, Beijing has been busy building up trade and investment ties through its global Belt &amp; Road Initiative. Kiribati is another island nation that recently switched sides on Taiwan (which China regards as a renegade province). There has been speculation, meanwhile, that China plans to build a permanent regional military base. Vanuatu was mentioned as one possible location, though this was denied. Now Tulagi in the Solomons is in the frame. Worried about the defensive implications of China’s rise, the US and Australia said last year they would develop a joint naval base on Manus island in Papua New Guinea. The US has urged its regional allies, including Japan, South Korea and Singapore, to up their defence spending. Belatedly recognising the historical neglect of its small Pacific neighbours, Australia has also announced overseas aid packages, including funds to combat climate change – although total aid spending as a proportion of national income is at its lowest level ever. In contrast to the piecemeal approach of the US and its allies, Chinese policy appears focused and single-minded. Like the Dutch, the British and the Japanese in the heyday of their imperial expansion, Beijing is on a mission. Its aim: global superpower status. Defence analyst Hugh White warned recently that Australia – and, by extension, the US and New Zealand – would have to abandon any idea of preserving a South Pacific sphere of influence, because China was simply too powerful. “It might turn out that the more we try and fail to exclude China from the South Pacific, the less influence we will have there,” White wrote. More explicit forms of Chinese expansionism under the leadership of its bullish president, Xi Jinping, are raising tensions across the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan has accused China of trying to unfairly influence its national elections next month in a bid to unseat President Tsai Ing-wen, a fierce critic of Beijing. Xi has suggested Taiwan return to the fold by adopting a Hong-Kong style “one country, two systems” arrangement. But harsh measures taken against Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters, and Xi’s mass repression of Chinese Muslim minorities, have lately rendered that idea distinctly unappealing. Meanwhile, the East China Sea, including the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea stretching south towards the Philippines and Indonesia, have become the setting for increasingly dangerous naval confrontations between China and western navies, including the Royal Navy, intent on maintaining freedom of navigation. China has built artificial islands in the South China Sea that are used as military bases and missile launchpads. It is in open dispute with several neighbours over contested reefs and sea areas which Beijing claims are its sovereign territory. South Pacific island leaders say they welcome investment and assistance from any quarter, and are not taking sides. But like it or not, they are caught up in a global power struggle over which they have little control."

          "bodyText": "A group of 23 doctors from the Torres Strait and northern Cape York is demanding action to protect remote Indigenous communities from a looming health emergency caused by climate change. In a joint statement, the doctors say they are concerned about the effects of heat stress and extreme weather events, the long-term effects of air pollution, the spread of disease, lost work capacity and reduced productivity, food insecurity, malnutrition, displacement and mental ill-health. “Climate change will affect us all but our community in the Torres Strait will feel the first impacts,” Dr Ineke Wever said. “Low-lying islands, an international border, overcrowding and high rates of chronic disease, diabetes and asthma make this population particularly vulnerable to heat stress, air pollution, rising sea levels and the mental anguish [of] potential relocation from islands where people’s families have lived for thousands of years.” “We need to prepare our community to be as healthy as possible for the coming changes and reduce the amount of chronic disease we take with us into the future.” Queensland’s climate adaptation strategy in 2017 revealed a gap in policy, capacity and resources to respond to the health impacts of climate change. Little has been done since then, doctors say, but the Queensland report is still the only one to have been drafted by a state government as a standalone plan. An MJA-Lancet study published last month suggests Australia has a long way to go. “Our research found no engagement on climate and health topics in the Australian federal government for the past 10 years,” one of the authors, Dr Ying Zhang from the University of Sydney school of public health, said. “This is of significant concern, given the current impacts and projected escalation in frequency and severity of extreme weather events.” The World Health Organisation has examined the health impacts of climate change in 13 Pacific Island countries. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Former senior medical officer in the Torres Strait Associate Prof Dr Lachlan McIver was the lead author of the WHO 2015 report and heads a health charity called Rocketship dedicated to improving health in the Pacific. “I am horrified and disgusted at Australia’s neglect in contributing to and managing the impacts of climate change,” McIver said. “My concern is that there’s a huge difference between the conversation that’s happening in the conservative echo chamber in Australia and how seriously this is being taken across the Pacific region and elsewhere in the world.” McIver said Pacific Island people don’t have the luxury of being climate change sceptics. “Solastalgia [is] a particular term that describes psychological trauma from loss of land, which is certainly applicable to the Torres Strait, which has many shared vulnerabilities with island communities elsewhere in the Pacific. “One of the most tragic aspects of the discussion of action around climate change on a global scale, regional scale or a local scale is that people are completely failing to understand that this is affecting people’s health and lives now.” McIver said in 2000 WHO estimated that climate change was causing in the order of about 150,000 excess deaths a year, based on a study of climate-sensitive diseases, malaria, diarrhoea, malnutrition and extreme weather events. “By 2030 that’s expected to increase to around 250,000 per year,” McIver said. “These are avoidable deaths caused by climate change. “As doctors that should motivate us; as community members it should motivate us. “This is not some abstract minority voice, this is a clear and present danger. According to the WHO authorities, it couldn’t be clearer. “It’s nightmarish and depressing. All is not lost, but we need action now.” Dr Sam Jones, who has lived in the Torres Strait for 10 years, said the doctors hold deep worries for their children’s future. “Will there still be crayfish and turtles, dugong and sardines? These vibrant children of the Pacific, are they the canaries in the coalmine of climate change? “Their health, their culture, their future depends upon us taking positive action now, together.” The group of doctors is calling for a greater investment in primary preventative healthcare, and “a plan for rapid transition to a low carbon economy,” they said. Torres Strait Island regional councillor Ted Nai, who also sits on the Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Service Board, agreed that “courageous, visionary leadership that is of a higher order than the mere party line and politics” is needed. “We must act with moral leadership and create optimism and hope,” Nai said. “We islander people, including the people of the Pacific, who are the most at risk of these climate change impacts, must ask how do we ride the crest of the wave of this global conversation, and showcase how to build resilient and thriving communities that can live sustainably into the future.”"

          "headline": "The remote Northumberland village that asked the world to help save its beloved pub",
          "bodyText": "Having lost its post office, shop, petrol station and garage, the beautifully remote Northumberland village of Ridsdale has a paid a price for the isolation that comes with such sweeping views. But now the community is following a national trend and banding together to save the one thing it has left: the pub. Determined to prevent the Gun Inn from closing after its owners decided to sell up, Ridsdale locals have formed a group with the goal of achieving a community buyout and offering people the chance to become shareholders in the venture. The problem is that the villagers need to raise a large sum of money by a planning deadline of 22 December – and there aren’t very many of them. “Momentum is building, but we’re only 80 houses here and we need to raise £200,000 very quickly,” said John Bassett, 74, who chairs the group and has lived in Ridsdale for decades. So far the village is a long way short of this target, but if it is hopeful of its chances, it is perhaps because the phenomenon of the community pub is growing. There are about 95 across the UK, according to the Plunkett Foundation, which specialises in helping community businesses, and that number grew by 13% in 2018. The foundation says there is currently a 100% survival rate for the community pubs it knows of, with not a single one ceasing to trade – in stark contrast to the high numbers of conventional pubs closing every year. “We are living through a time when rural communities are facing tough challenges, including the widespread closures of pubs. Our figures show community pubs can often provide an answer to these challenges. In rural areas they are a lifeline to the people they serve,” said Hannah Barrett, senior project manager at the Plunkett Foundation. “The issues of isolation and loss of amenities are well known – and community pubs do so much more than just providing a pint. They offer diverse services, from book clubs and drama classes to dementia support groups and lunches for the lonely. They are breathing new life into many rural communities across the UK.” None of this is news to Graham Green, 59, vice-chairman of the Ridsdale group. “There is tremendous history in Ridsdale, and if we lose this pub we will have no hub for anyone – it will just become a live-in hamlet,” he said. “It’s about the fabric of the village and, for us, this is the glue that holds this place together. Without that it just drifts.” Shares in the Gun are being offered at £1 each, with a minimum purchase of £500. The project was given a welcome boost when the crime writer Ann Cleeves retweeted the campaign and the locals suddenly received donations from as far afield as New York, Kansas and Michigan. For Green, the case for keeping the pub in the hands of the community is clear. “There used to be a shop, there was a post office, a garage, a petrol station, a butcher, a village hall. Even further back there were tennis courts and we had a village team. Now all that has gone and we’re down to one bus a week, on a Tuesday,” he said. “So because of all that the Gun has been central and has been very successful. At New Year we’re all in the road at 5am, singing Auld Lang Syne and it all centres around the pub.” He added: “There’s still people round here who don’t drive, and this is their lifeline, their meeting point. [It’s] really important for their mental health, to be honest, and we want to expand and put a library in there and all sorts of community activities. “The key thing is that we need people to hear about this and that they can buy shares and help us keep this community alive.” Beckley, Oxfordshire In 2016, the 17th-century Abingdon Arms was saved from closure when it was taken into community ownership. The pub had previously been frequented by the authors Lewis Carroll and Evelyn Waugh. Redgrave, Suffolk The Cross Keys, which also dates back to the 17th century, reopened as a community free house and restaurant in March last year after it was purchased by a newly formed interest group for £300,000 at the end of 2017. Bamford, Derbyshire The Anglers Rest is a community pub and cafe that employs about 25 people, houses a post office and puts an estimated £200,000 a year into the local economy of the Hope Valley in the Peak District."

          "bodyText": "We are going to close this blog now. So far today, fire crews have fought back blazes, and containment lines have held. But there are still more than 100 fires burning across New South Wales and 45 in Queensland, some of them posing immediate risk to lives and homes. Crews face a difficult night ahead. There are hopes for some brief respite: a cool change on Sunday might give firefighters a chance to prepare for worsening conditions early next week. Temperatures are forecast to soar above 40C across NSW by Tuesday. The largest fire, the Gospers Mountain fire north of Sydney (larger than Sydney in area), won’t be extinguished any time soon. It is too large to fight, and will likely burn for weeks until there is decent rain. Australia’s brutal fire season will only continue I am sorry to report. But I leave with some joyous news from earlier. You may recall our post about the orphaned fawn rescued by fire crews in Queensland. They’ve given her a name: Ember. A shipping container full of fireworks? Really? This is from AAP: A shipping container loaded with fireworks has exploded and residents have been warned to flee as an unpredictable fire closes in on homes in south-east Queensland. The fast-moving blaze is burning in bushland at Bundamba, west of Brisbane, and travelling in a northerly direction from White Street towards the Warrego Highway. Police have declared an emergency situation for the area bound by Keith Street to Bognuda Street and Nelson Street to the Bremer River and Warrego Highway. Residents within the exclusion zone are being ordered to evacuate as the fire closes in. It should be noted there is significant debate in New South Wales suggesting Sydney should cancel its spectacular, but spectacularly expensive, harbour fireworks display this New Year’s Eve, and instead dedicate the millions of dollars saved to those who have lost homes in the bushfires. The NSW government has said the show will go on. Karma may have cast its vote here. This, I fear, will be the trend for the afternoon. Across the east coast of Australia, fires worsening with strengthening winds, no respite in temperatures. The Bundamba fire near Ipswich in Queensland is posing a threat to homes and lives. Police have declared an emergency situation. See here: http://bit.ly/38b6gNT Properly scary ... this is how much of Australia is burning Fire activity is increasing across a number of fires in NSW. Fires in Queensland are choking the state, hope lies in a cool change. AAP reports: Queensland is choking on NSW’s bushfire smoke as a southerly change sweeps across the state bringing testing conditions for firefighters. The south-east corner of the state is shrouded in smoke, with the World Health Quality index showing unhealthy levels of air quality across parts of Queensland. “We have seen a southerly change move up from NSW and with it bringing more smoke from the NSW fires, so we actually have seen an increase in the smoke haze,” said Rosa Hoff from the Bureau of Meteorology. Fire danger in the southeast corner continues to trouble authorities as Brisbane swelters in 39C heat with the mercury hitting 40.7C at Amberley near Ipswich. Scorching dry winds conditions have pushed temperatures up and created challenging conditions for firefighters. The hot and dry weather that has been sparking and encouraging fires has been unrelenting, but a cool change is expected on Sunday. “This southerly change means we will see temperatures ease down, however it will still be above average. It is a relief from the severe heatwave conditions, but it still not business as usual. “Our fire danger ratings will ease back to very high from severe.” Firefighters are pinning their hopes on that cool change for a desperately needed reprieve. Of the 45 fires burning across the state, fires at Redbank Creek near Esk, Millmerran on the Darling Downs and Wivenhoe remain at advice levels. A conservative estimate of 207,000 hectares of land burnt out since the start of the bushfire season is expected to rise, with 22 homes lost. This morning I travelled up the Hawkesbury river and Mangrove Creek. The smoke was incredibly thick and getting heavier with little wind yet. The Three Mile fire earlier crossed a narrow part of the creek at Upper Mangrove, and the fire front is just behind some riverside properties where we find Geoff Newlyn, who’s come up to defend his 23 acres at Lower Mangrove. “I’ve been here for two days, I came up by boat so I’d have a way out if the roads shut, but I think we’re through the worst of it,” he said. “It was looking pretty ugly yesterday evening then that wind blew up and it sounded like a freight train coming. “We’ve had weeks to prepare. Anyone who tells you, ‘Oh I didn’t know this was going to happen’, it’s not true. “We’re just smashing down stuff and clearing around structures.” He points at properties across the river where houses which were previously hidden in the trees, just as the owners liked it in this remote bit of river country, are now visible with metres and metres of cleared land around them. Had the fire hit the river here, where it can stretch a hundred metres or more across, firefighters might have been able to hold it off, Newlyn says. But it didn’t and now it’s joined with the Wrights Creek fire which still threatens homes around Kulnura. “They just can’t put it out because it’s on such a big fire front,” Newlyn suggests. “Trying to get access to the bush is impossible … and this one will backfill [around here]. “But we’re not worried at the moment because it’s so slow burning. We sort of want it. It’s going to come, so it’s better now while you’ve got a chance of controlling it … so this is actually quite a good scenario.” As Australia burns, it is worth remembering that the annual UN climate change talks are underway at #COP25 in Madrid. Australia’s record on emissions, and its role as a major exporter of fossil fuels, has not gone unnoticed by some. Community meetings for those affected by the Gospers Mountain fire... Dr Bidda Jones is the chief scientist at the RSPCA, and told me the NSW fires, which have burned through thousands of hectares of land, including national parks and adjoining forest, would have a “major impact on biodiversity”. Depending on the intensity of the fire, it will have had a massive impact on wildlife. And not just on those iconic species like koalas. You have to think of this in terms of how it affects the entire ecosystem. You have animals relying on the eucalyptus trees for their primary diet - greater gliders are another example of that. Then you have a whole range of other species living off nectar or the insects in that environment, and there’s going to be a considerable loss of insect life in those fires. You’ve got issues with nesting areas lost in fires… often [animals] prefer old trees. And then with fires that have been burning even at low intensity, leaf litter and all the understorey is gone. That’s providing food and refuge to animals there and the animals they would eat. So if you look at the overall picture… the damage has been so extensive, it’s going to have a major impact on biodiversity. Jones’s own property near Braidwood is around 600 hectares and she’s been developing large parts as wildlife reserve with Bush Heritage. It was lost to the fires this week. Her property and the bush heritage reserve joins a state forest, which joins a national park. At this point almost all of that has been burnt, all of that forest, up to 31,000 hectares. The big trees are still there, and we have greater gliders that live in the forest, as well as powerful owls. So I’m hoping that they’ll be OK. They’ll have lost nesting holes because the many big trees have fallen and it’s the big old trees that have the nesting holes. We have a huge range of birds, eastern grey kangaroos, swamp wallabies, red wallabies. We were going out and meeting kangaroos and red neck wallabies that were moving away from the fire. A lot of wombats - I’m not sure what they’re going to eat. All of the forest floor, any grass any shrubs, are gone. Jones said their rainfall records show it to be the driest in 40 years. November is normally the wettest month with more than 100ml, but this year they’ve had 18ml. “Anytime I hear ‘don’t talk about climate change’,” she says trailing off. “Anyone in my situation has absolutely no doubt these conditions are extreme and are connected to climate change.” Good news in Queensland, a string of fires being downgraded, fire crews no longer needed ... A helicopter involved in firefighting efforts has crashed on the mid north coast of New South Wales. Emergency services says the pilot was the only person on board and he is unharmed. It’s not clear at the moment if it was a water-bombing helicopter or if it was being used for surveillance, but it was assisting firefighting efforts on the Jarrah Road bushfire, near Girvan, north of Newcastle. Emergency services has grounded all other aircraft working in the area while safety checks are carried out, and more information about the cause of the crash is ascertained. It’s being reported the “hard landing” caused the helicopter’s engine to catch fire – this was put out by fire crews. The pilot has been taken to hospital. I’m out on the Hawkesbury River, where the heavy smoke has reduced visibility to dangerously low levels. The Three Mile fire - which last night joined with the Wrights Creek fire - is just up Mangrove Creek, and I’ve watched several Marine Rescue vessels head up that way in the last half an hour. There is very little wind and locals who stuck around to defend property are hoping it stays that way and the fire front burns slowly past them. NSW Fire and Rescue have set up a water pump outside the shop at Spencer, on the Hawkesbury River, for crews to refuel as the battle bushfires just to the north. Geoff Newlyn is staying to defend his 23 acre property near Lower Mangrove, NSW where a large fire is burning through bushland. Roads in bushfire areas will be affected all day. The situation can change quickly, so please check conditions before setting out. Amid the chaos and the destruction, this is just a lovely story, as told by volunteer firefighter Michael Tiley: My name is Michael Tiley and I am from the Stanmore Rural Fire Brigade. Our brigade is part of the Stanley Rivers Group, located west of Caboolture. Last Sunday 1/12/19, the Stanmore Brigade (myself and Joe Canning) together with Hazeldean (three fire fighters) were deployed to a flare up of the fires, up near Jimna. The country up there is devastated by the past fire activity. During the mopping up activity, I heard a noise that sounded like a small child crying. I turned around to see this baby fawn (a few weeks old) walking straight towards me. It was very distressed and overheated, yet I picked it up and we cooled it down with water. It was not injured, yet seemed abandoned, so we placed it in the open storage area behind the truck cab. Advice from others is that there are many lone fawn in the parched country up in the area. The female red deer fawn has now received veterinary care and advice is that it is a number of weeks old. It is now being cared for and fed formula from a bottle every three to four hours. For our brigade members, it was very satisfying to see something positive come from the utter devastation the fires have caused in the area. If you’re out there Michael and Joe, firstly, well done, such a heart-warming story. But have you given her a name yet? This was the situation early this morning in NSW: 94 fires, 11 at Watch and Alert... And a reminder on total fire bans: the Shoalhaven is the eighth region in NSW under a ban for today. My colleague Lisa Cox has written this most excellent, timely and sobering piece: climate experts bewildered by government “burying their heads in the sand” and say the bushfires on Australia’s east coast should be a “wake-up call”. If you read nothing else today (save for this blog, obviously), read this. Behind all of those out there on the firefront, there is an army of support. This vision, broadcast on ABC, demonstrates what volunteer fire crews have been up again, and will face again today. Good morning, welcome to Guardian Australia’s rolling coverage of the bushfire crisis. Australia is on fire, and the country’s east coast, in particular NSW and southern Queensland, faces a brutal day of hot weather, strong winds and no rain in sight. This morning, the NSW Rural Fire Service has warned the Gospers Mountain ‘mega fire’ north of Sydney will burn for many weeks. The fire has already burned more than 300,000 hectares and has a front more than 60 kilometres. Around 1000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by fire this season. Nearly 100 fires are burning across the state Saturday morning. In Queensland, 40 fires are burning, and temperatures are expected to soar – up to 12C above December averages – in coming days. Temperatures are forecast to reach 39C in Brisbane on Saturday, and above 40C inland, in Gatton and Ipswich. The Bureau of Meteorology has painted a grim picture for the coming week, with winds forecast to whip dangerous fire grounds and no rain relief in sight. Some fires are generating plumes of smoke that are so vast, they appear as rain on the bureau’s radar. “The massive NSW fires are in some cases just too big to put out at the moment,” the Bureau of Meteorology said on social media. “They’re pumping out vast amounts of smoke, which is filling the air, turning the sky orange and even appearing like significant rain on our radars.”"

          "bodyText": "It is Sunday evening, and my wife and I are returning from a weekend away. On the walk from the station we stop to buy two toothbrushes, because we left ours behind, and a bottle of wine, because. “It’s so cold,” my wife says. “And I’m so tired.” “Nearly there,” I say. “We’ll order a takeaway, and then I’m going to bed,” she says. “Fine,” I say. When I open the front door, a small grey head pokes out of it at about knee level. Two black, mournful eyes look up at me as if to say: well, this is awkward. “Hello, Billy,” I say. Billy is a highly self-conscious lurcher who lives in a permanent state of social mortification. He’s not our dog – he belongs to the youngest one’s friend – but we see a lot of him. This is not the first time he’s greeted us at the door looking shamefaced. It becomes clear that Billy is not alone. From inside the house there wafts the smell of cigarette smoke and the unmistakable sound of Fifa 19 being played in manager mode. Someone is laughing. Someone else is cooking. Somewhere behind the door, our actual dog is barking. “Can we come in, Billy?” my wife says. As I push the door wider, Billy takes three steps backwards, all the while fixing me with a look that seems to say: forgive me. In the sitting room, the oldest one and his friend are using a joystick apiece to revitalise the computer-generated lineup of Sligo Town. The middle one is sitting beside them, monitoring another match on his laptop while also looking at his phone. I shed my coat where I stand. “What an unexpected pleasure,” my wife says, dropping her bag. “I know, right?” says the oldest one’s friend. In the kitchen, the youngest one and Billy’s owner are making chilli, apparently for everyone. “Hey,” the youngest one says. “Hey,” his friend says. “A full house, then,” my wife says, collapsing on to the sofa. “Including Billy,” I say. Everyone turns to look at Billy, who is at that moment poised to help himself from the cat’s food bowl. At the sound of his name, he turns his head and flashes me a look that says: I promised myself I would stop doing this, oh God, I’m loathsome. The middle one and his friend fill two bowls and retreat upstairs. I pour myself a glass of wine and go in search of a place to sit. I end up watching Fifa 19 being played in manager mode for several bewildering minutes. “No!” shouts the oldest one as the opposition score. “He’s picked his pocket there, in the dying seconds of the first half,” his friend says. I point to the screen. “Can you turn that back into a television?” I say. “Yeah,” the oldest one says. “After this.” I stand up and return to the kitchen. Billy follows by my side, like a small, embarrassed pony. My wife is at the table, reading a magazine that arrived while we were away. “What are you doing back here?” she says. “I came to hang out with you,” I say. “You can’t,” she says. “I’m having some quiet time.” “But I’ve got nowhere to be,” I say. “And neither does Billy.” At the sound of his name, Billy gives me a rueful look and leaves the room. “I don’t care,” my wife says. “I need space, and you’re ruining it.” I sigh, refill my glass and return to the sitting room, where I find Billy lying on the floor, on top of my coat. He lifts his head and fixes me with a pained gaze that seems to say: this is not what it looks like. “Oh, Billy,” I say, retaking my seat. Finally, the match ends. The oldest one returns the TV to TV mode, and lobs the remote at me. I point it at the screen and press. “What’s this?” the oldest says. “Escape To The Chateau,” I say. “I’m not prepared to defend my devotion to it at this point.” “Fair enough,” the oldest one’s friend says. Billy returns his head to my coat and stares at the ceiling with a look of boundless regret."

          "headline": "Queensland ordered to release secret report on black-throated finch conservation",
          "bodyText": "The Queensland information commissioner has ordered the state government to publicly release an independent report it commissioned – then largely ignored – into Adani’s black-throated finch conservation efforts. Both the state Department of Environment and Science and Adani had attempted to block the release of the report, which was compiled by an independent panel of experts “to obtain the best scientific advice”, arguing it should remain secret. The latest unpublished ruling, by Queensland information commissioner Louisa Lynch, provides for the release of the panel’s report on Adani’s black-throated finch management plan to the Australian Conservation Foundation on the grounds of public interest. The ACF has been told it should have the document in 20 days, but its release could still be blocked or extensively delayed by Adani, which has developed a pattern of objections and appeals to the release of government-held information about its Carmichael project. Adani is in the drawn-out process of appealing a similar decision – demanding the release of documents relating to plans for the Townsville and Rockhampton councils to pay for an airport to be built at the mine site – in the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The panel that wrote the finch report, led by threatened species expert Brendan Wintle, is understood to have raised concerns about Adani’s plans and made recommendations that were ultimately ignored after the Queensland government imposed approvals deadlines. Wintle has spoken publicly and in detail about the concerns of ecologists, but not about the specific detail of the report. In her decision, Lynch says Adani complained that the report contained confidential and commercially sensitive information, and that it had “genuine concerns regarding both the independence of the review and the value of the document itself”. Adani was asked to identify specific confidential information in the report it was concerned about being released. The company’s lawyers responded that Adani “did not wish to make any further submissions”. The miner also argued that the release could have a detrimental impact on the company because it would “trigger further action from activist groups”. Lynch rejected the suggestion and said it was not reasonable. “DES commissioned the report in order to obtain ‘the best possible scientific advice’ on the potential impact of the Carmichael coalmine on the black-throated finch population,” Lynch wrote. “DES discharges, on behalf of the public of Queensland, an important regulatory function aimed at protecting the environment from harm. “[The decision to approve Adani’s plans] and all decisions and actions DES has taken in respect of the approval process for the Carmichael coalmine are taken on behalf of the community. As such a high level of scrutiny and need for accountability attaches to any such decisions, which must be as transparent as possible.” Adani’s repeated attempts to block release of public documents Adani has repeatedly sought to block access to government documents about its dealings, including a case where the miner has taken the ABC to a Queensland tribunal to prevent the release of an agreement for two coastal councils to pay for a remote inland airstrip. That case is still ongoing in the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal, where claims involving government departments or administrative appeals often take significant time to resolve. Adani claims it no longer needs the airport – which was to be built by Queensland firm Wagners – for the scaled-down version of the Carmichael mine. But it continues to fight the release of a “term sheet” that contained secret details of the deal, struck with Townsville and Rockhampton councils, for them to fund the construction in exchange for the cities being named fly-in fly-out hubs for the project. Townsville council initially refused a freedom of information request by an ABC journalist on grounds the deal was commercial in confidence. But the Queensland Office of the Information Commissioner overturned that decision in March, in an unreported judgement that ruled the public had a right to know details, given the extraordinary circumstances. In her March judgment, Lynch said Adani and similar “sophisticated commercial entities” ought to appreciate that funding awarded by government entities would be ultimately accountable to the public. “Any proposal by a local government body to contribute funding for the construction of transport infrastructure in the territory of another local government, for use and benefit of private entities, and in circumstances where the benefitting entity will, as noted, ultimately take ownership of the infrastructure, merits high levels of transparency and accountability,” Lynch said. “These public interests warrant disclosure beyond that of, say, the potential dollar amounts involved, but information as to the very structure and mechanics of the proposed deal, such as is contained in the term sheet. “Both [councils] are, as local government authorities, duty bound to ensure they steward public monies prudently, transparently and accountably. “That fact is relevant, as the availability of such public funding is likely to mean that the entity, business or enterprise standing to benefit from same can conserve its own resources, as it does not have to draw on its own funds [or commercial funding markets], enhancing the potential for the generation of private profit.” Christian Slatter from the ACF said Adani was abusing freedom of information laws to hide its coal plans from legitimate public scrutiny. “The company’s aggressive secrecy raises questions about what more it wants to hide,” Slattery said. Adani said in a statement: “The [Queensland] Right to Information Act states that it is not appropriate to disclose information that contains the commercial or financial affairs of entities or which contains personal information. Adani responds to government requests under the RTI Act in accordance with that legislation including those important non-disclosure requirements.”"

          "headline": "'It shows a nicer way of life': meet the makers of the £100 viral Christmas ad",
          "bodyText": "At this time of year business is usually steady rather than spectacular at the Hafod Hardware store in the Welsh town of Rhayader. People pop in to buy nails, screws, perhaps a replacement mophead, a mousetrap or a pot of paint to spruce up their homes for the festive period. But this week it has been rather busier for Thomas Lewis Jones and Pauline Lewis, the shop’s grandson and grandmother team. A two-minute Christmas video advertising the traditional ironmongers on East Street starring Jones’s two-year-old son, Arthur, has gone viral. More than a million people worldwide have viewed the film, which only cost £100 to make, and the phone has been ringing continuously with people keen to explain how much it touched them. “I think it has struck a chord because it’s such a simple message,” said Jones. “It’s real and it’s not saying: ‘Spend, spend, spend.’ I think you can tell it’s made by people who care about this business.” Many have said the film captures the true spirit of Christmas more effectively than the multimillion-pound efforts that normally hit the headlines at this time of year. Jones is too polite and modest to compare his film to John Lewis’s Edgar the dragon epic. “But I think it shows you don’t necessarily need CGI and a huge budget,” he said. The plot of the Hafod Hardware film is not complicated. Arthur wakes up, brushes his teeth, eats breakfast and heads to the shop. He serves customers, decorates a Christmas tree – and in the final shot magically turns into his 30-year-old dad. Jones and his friend, the film-maker Josh Holdaway, spent a few hours last Saturday making the advert. The £100 went on hiring a studio for a friend to record the soundtrack, a cover of Alpahville’s Forever Young. At a time when UK high streets are struggling, it is heartening that a simple film featuring a family hardware store in a small mid-Wales town (population: 2,000) can cause such as stir. Hafod Hardware has been in the family for just under a century. Sepia-tinted photos of some of the ancestors hang above the office door. It is hard to know what they would have made of the fuss. Hafod is a Welsh word referring to the movement of people and livestock from lowland winter pasture to higher summer grazing. Pauline Lewis and her husband, Alan, took over 20 years ago and live above the shop. As a teenager, Jones went off to university to study art but did not take to it and 10 years ago, at the age of 20, returned to Rhayader and began to work in the shop. It was supposed to be a stopgap. Jones was in a band and thought a full-time career in music beckoned. But the band broke up and Jones found that, actually, he liked working in the shop. “I like being part of the community. You know everyone in the town. People pop in and say hello even if they don’t need anything. I love it here.” He married Laura, whom he had known since primary school (she does the accounts for the shop), and he hasn’t looked back. The few downsides are the jokes about the grocery shop sitcom Open All Hours and the number of customers who like to launch into the Two Ronnies’ four candles/fork handles hardware store sketch. This year’s Christmas film is Jones’s third for the store. The 2017 one made a few headlines in the local media. The 2018 film did not garner much attention. They weren’t planning to do a third but local people encouraged them to make another. “I didn’t want to let them down,” Jones said. “And then it snowballed.” Jones’s grandmother bursts with pride. “Tom has brought us into the 21st century,” she said. Rather than contracting as the high street has struggled, the shop has doubled in size. As well as hardware staples, it sells fly fishing rods to tourists keen to try their luck on the River Wye, and maps and camping equipment for those on their way to the Cambrian mountains. Jones’s artwork – local views in the style of 1930s Great Western Railway posters – also sell well. But the ongoing success has been to provide solid old-fashioned service. They deliver free to the town. If an older person needs a lightbulb and cannot reach to fit it, Jones will do it for them. He is not a trained locksmith but if someone is locked out of their home, he finds a way to help. His gran thinks the video may have done so well because it is a break from grim everyday life in 2019. “People are so fed up with the news and the situation we are in. It speaks about different life values, it’s nostalgic – it shows a calmer, nicer way of life.” Footfall hasn’t increased dramatically since the video was posted – after all, Rhayader is remote – but Jones hopes it may encourage more people to shop locally wherever they happen to be. One of the most touching messages came in a card from a Cornish couple called Bill and Sue, who said they would be visiting Wales in the summer and planned a pilgrimage to Hafod Hardware. “To Arthur and his daddy and mummy,” they wrote. “Thank you for reminding us of the true spirit of Christmas with your beautiful film, which touched our hearts.”"

          "bodyText": "A 21-year-old woman has died after spending three nights in an outdoor “period hut”, prompting police in Nepal to make their first ever arrest in connection with the illegal practice. The tradition of chhaupadi, where menstruating women in Nepal are banished from their homes, is still widespread in remote and poorer parts of the country. Parwati Budha Rawat was found dead on Monday morning after staying in a hut 100 metres from her home. She had lit a fire to stay warm while staying in the windowless “period hut” in Achham district, Sudurpashchim Pradesh, where temperatures drop to below 10C (50F) during the month of December. Rawat, who had married 18 months earlier, was described as a happy young woman who loved children. Her brother-in-law has been arrested in connection with her death, as police investigate whether she was forced to sleep in the hut. It is understood that her husband is currently working in India. The tradition of chhaupadi, where women are forced to sleep in period huts, is illegal in Nepal but still practised by many communities, especially in the far west of the country. In January, a mother and two sons died in the Sudurpaschim region. Weeks later, a 21-year-old woman died from smoke inhalation while staying in a hut. Chhaupadi was outlawed in 2005 and carries a jail term of three months and a fine of 3,000 Nepalese rupees (£21) against the culprit. Campaigners say the law is not enforced, however. Over the past decade in Sudurpashchim Pradesh, 14 girls have died in Accham and one woman and two boys have died in Bajura. According to the tradition, menstruating women are considered impure and must be separated from others in many aspects of life. Women are forbidden from entering the home or kitchen, or from touching other people, cattle, fruit or plants. Women practising the tradition may also have restricted access to water taps and wells. Opponents to chhaupadi recently began demolishing period huts to end the practice, but menstruating women have instead started to stay in makeshift tents. “Although the supreme court made the law, the social construct is too strong to be dismantled,” said Pashupati Kunwar, a women’s rights activist based in Accham. “Effective work has not been done in outlawing chhaupadhi – by anyone. If the Nepal government takes action and punishes the culprit then, perhaps, this tradition will come to an end. It is also imperative that the local governments should step up to protect the menstruating women via influencing their psychology.” Janak Bahadur Shahi, district police chief deputy superintendent, said: “This is indeed the first time that the police have arrested someone for a chhaupadhi case on the behalf of the victim.” The brother-in-law will be held for up to 25 days while Rawat’s death is investigated."

          "headline": "Marcelo Bielsa has history on mind as he plots to end Leeds’ top-flight exile",
          "bodyText": "What do Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Don Revie’s famously formidable Leeds of the 1960s and 1970s have in common? The answer, potentially a fiendish pub quiz contender, is that all three have been recipients of the freedom of the city, with surviving members of Revie’s squad receiving this rare civic honour as recently as Wednesday. As a suited and booted Norman Hunter, Johnny Giles, Allan Clarke, Peter Lorimer, Eddie Gray et al gathered to mark an arguably overdue occasion, Revie’s latest successor was plotting the conclusion of another achingly long wait. Marcelo Bielsa does not really do social formality – he attended the club’s black tie, 100-year anniversary celebrations in tracksuit and trainers – but he does have an acute appreciation of Elland Road history and knows it is high time Leeds ended a Premier League exile now in its 16th season. They play at struggling Huddersfield on Saturday lunchtime unbeaten in eight Championship games and having won the past five yet remain two points behind the leaders, West Brom, and only five ahead of third-placed Fulham. If the scars of last spring’s late promotion stumble remain raw, there is cautious optimism it will be different this time. Even so, tricky challenges loom, most immediately at Huddersfield where Bielsa must replace the suspended Kalvin Phillips. Not only does the team’s all-important quasi-sweeper customarily fill the anchoring role between midfield and defence, but Phillips moves seamlessly into the backline when the full-backs advance as Leeds overload opposition rearguards by switching from 4-1-4-1 to a fluid 3-3-1-3. “It seems like Bielsa’s players are operated by remote control,” says Huddersfield’s manager, Danny Cowley. “You only get to that place with very good coaching.” His brother and assistant, Nicky Cowley, is equally admiring. “Bielsa manages to get his team all playing with one brain,” he says. Ben White almost certainly possesses the necessary intelligence to deputise for Phillips. The 22-year-old Brighton loanee has excelled at centre-half, confounding those who suspected Bielsa had erred in offloading the influential, if sometimes slightly rebellious, Pontus Jansson to Brentford in the summer. White’s blend of technical assurance, passing vision – his accuracy ranks in the top 20 of Championship outfield players – and crisply incisive tackling has not only tightened the defence but left him under near-constant surveillance by Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp will doubtless be intrigued to see how White fares in a new position. A somewhat bigger impending hurdle for Bielsa is the strong possibility Kiko Casilla, the team’s £35,000-a-week former Real Madrid goalkeeper, clean-sheet specialist and seemingly near indispensable sweeper-keeper, will be banned for between six and 12 games should he be found guilty of racially abusing the Charlton forward Jonathan Leko. Casilla has denied the Football Association’s charge stemming from an incident in September and his case is to be heard by an independent FA commission before Christmas. Considering his deputy is Illan Meslier, an untried 19-year-old French keeper on loan from Ligue 2 side Lorient, Bielsa may require temporary cover next month. The worry is that identifying on-budget candidates possessing the intricate footwork and high-accuracy short passing synonymous with Casilla – and the side’s build-from-the-back credo – could be easier said than done for the club’s algorithm-juggling director of football, Victor Orta. Angus Kinnear, the Leeds managing director, although fully endorsing the FA’s laudable zero-tolerance racism stance, questions the credibility of the ruling body’s justice system. “We fully support such a serious allegation – which Kiko vehemently denies – being subjected to full investigation and disciplinary process,” he says. “Our only concern is that the burden of proof for an FA hearing is ‘not beyond all reasonable doubt’ – the court standard – but ‘on the balance of probability’. We believe that, in cases of this seriousness, the higher standard of proof is more appropriate; one man’s reputation is at stake.” Back on the training ground, Bielsa’s bar is famously high but there have been times – see Athletic Bilbao and Marseille – when his teams have apparently burnt out. The way in which Leeds pass at breakneck pace while, courtesy of kaleidoscopic positional inter-changing, pressing opponents and space is wonderful but the sheer intensity involved is undeniably draining. “You come off the training pitch properly tired,” says the former Leeds forward Kemar Roofe, now with Anderlecht, as he recalls routinely rehearsing five separate formations and full-blooded 11 v 11 training games. “You’re empty, you can’t do extra finishing practice. But I learned the body can do so much more than you believe.” If the daily regimen is unrelenting – players face daily weigh-ins, skin-fold tests and strict diets – it is undeniably a meritocracy with Bielsa selecting XIs on what his eyes tell him rather than price tag, reputation or favours. This means the Arsenal loanee striker Eddie Nketiah has not been involved as much as his parent club would like and, despite Bielsa wanting to retain him, he may be recalled next month. Newcastle’s Dwight Gayle seems an obvious replacement but would cost £15m, challenging in the era of financial fair play rules. Although Liverpool are considering loaning their promising young forward Rhian Brewster, who is also interesting Borussia Dortmund, they want game-time guarantees that Bielsa declines to grant. Compromise is not a word that features in the Leeds manager’s extensive vocabulary but his preferred sole striker, Patrick Bamford, requires support, so some sort of diplomatic new year attacking accommodation may need reaching if promotion is to be secured. Then the campaign for Bielsa to be granted the freedom of the city can properly begin."

          "bodyText": "Who is culpable for the teams’ respective positions? Liverpool’s stellar form, a weakness in central defence and a group of players who before Tuesday’s 4-1 thumping of Burnley lacked an edge are key factors for Manchester City being 11 points behind the Merseyside club. Pep Guardiola rates the midfielder Fernandinho over John Stones or Nicolás Otamendi as first-choice cover for the injured centre-back Aymeric Laporte, illuminating how the failure to acquire an A-list replacement for Vincent Kompany was a serious error. The win at Turf Moor was a reminder of how energy and effervescence from the manager’s pass-and-move play had dipped: given the deficit this has to remain until May. United, seven points above the drop zone and eight off fourth, made their poorest start since 1988. Here Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, is culpable for a recruitment policy that created a malaise during the five years before Ole Gunnar Solskjær became manager. Wednesday’s impressive win over Tottenham is proof of what the Norwegian is hoping to build. Will things improve? Attempting to predict whether United will embark upon an upward trajectory remains a conundrum because Solskjær’s side are young and callow. Yet the results against Chelsea (4-0), Liverpool (1-1), Leicester (1-0) and Spurs (2-1) show how impressive United can be against the division’s toughest opponents. It has to allow optimism that given time the Solskjær project will be successful. This means he has to be in place next summer for a second close-season window. City are at a defining moment of Guardiola’s reign: can he and his champions respond despite a third consecutive title seeming remote? The manager will hope his side’s experience of losing at Newcastle in January of last season and then reeling off 14 consecutive victories to retain the championship can be drawn on. Tuesday’s win was a reminder of why City are formidable and, if Liverpool do stumble at all, Guardiola’s men will hope peak form remains to take advantage and the championship race be reignited. How have new signings fared? Guardiola’s penchant for a midfielder may have broadened to full-backs given he signed two when a centre-back was needed. Of these João Cancelo has looked shaky and though able to operate along both flanks has made only four league starts. Angeliño, re-signed from PSV Eindhoven, was in the starting XI at Turf Moor but lacks the verve of Benjamin Mendy. Rodri is City’s best close-season acquisition: the Spaniard’s elegant style masks a formidable physical presence that makes him a silkier yet still robust long-term replacement for Fernandinho as City’s holding player. Of Daniel James, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Harry Maguire the central defender has not matched his billing as the expected dead-cert successful acquisition. Maguire can be sloppy in possession, sluggish in anticipation and one-paced. James, though, has taken to Premier League football instantly and wears the United shirt – which can be “heavy” – with aplomb, adding pace and sparkle to the frontline. Wan-Bissaka also looks a natural and his “Spider” moniker is apt: not many attackers get the better him at right-back. What would make this season a success? Solskjær believes a top-four place can be achieved but if so his side will have to put a run of wins together – which they have not done since January. United strolled through the Europa League group stage so maybe this or the Carabao and/or FA Cup can be won. In short, fifth place plus a trophy is progress (not real success), top four and no cups would be success. If City cannot retain the title and fail to seriously challenge then reaching the Champions League final is the bare minimum. Guardiola publicly maintains that his team are not ready to be European kings but this is surely a ploy to ease pressure on players given that he has had three seasons and counting to construct an XI of requisite quality. City’s best run under him has been to the quarter-finals, which is a disappointment, so should they retain one or both of the domestic cups but fail to reach the final of the continent’s premier club competition 2019-20 will still rate as a failure. Who have been the stars of the season? The effervescent Raheem Sterling, peerless Kevin De Bruyne and evergreen Sergio Agüero lead the City roll call closely followed by Riyad Mahrez, Rodri, David Silva, and Ederson. Honourable mentions can also be given to Bernardo Silva, Kyle Walker and Gabriel Jesus. This collective illustrate that while City may be third they still remain Liverpool’s greatest threat. Beyond James and Wan-Bissaka for United, Marcus Rashford has nine league goals and was virtually unplayable against Spurs, Scott McTominay is becoming a genuine United midfielder and Victor Lindelöf is reliable at centre-back. Inconsistency is found in Anthony Martial (three league goals), Fred (good against Spurs) and Andreas Pereira (can be promising), while Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and the remainder of the squad – apart from the goalkeeper, David de Gea – all have to start returning eight-out-of-10 displays rather than their usual less than five."

          "headline": "Bees in Amazon 'are greatest ally to halt rainforest destruction'",
          "bodyText": "Under an Amazonian canopy of guava and Xylopia trees, Neida Pereira lifts the lid of a beehive, gently lowers an unprotected hand into the swarm, and smiles as she lifts it out unscathed but covered in pollinators and honey. For the 49-year-old educator and environmentalist, the stingless Amazonian insects are the greatest ally she has found in a decades-long campaign to halt the destruction of the rainforest and improve the livelihoods of its people. “Bees are everything to me. They help me to protect the forest. They help the trees to stand tall, to produce fruit and to be strong,” she says, tears welling. “The bees are much more important than me for the environment.” Pereira speaks not just from the heart, but from experience. The beekeeper was born in a remote forest community and has spent her life working for the training network, Casa Familiar Rural, in remote and threatened regions of Pará state in the north of Brazil. For her, Amazonian beehives are not just a hub of pollination, they are also the most economically viable alternative to the environmentally destructive traditions of slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle ranching. To have any chance of resisting soy plantations and mining companies, Pereira says local people need higher living standards, and an incentive to maintain the forest rather than cut it down. Beekeeping ticks all these boxes. The community here in the Gleba Lago Grande settlement is remote and until recently largely forgotten. Ownership of close to a sixth of the 300,000 hectare area is disputed between residents, land grabbers and distant property speculators. Local residents want the area to be classified as an extractive reserve, which would give protected status to them and the forest. Satellite images show strong forest cover in the area. But pressures are growing. The US mining conglomerate Alcoa is exploring bauxite deposits in the region. Emboldened by the rightwing president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, there has been an increase in illegal logging, fishing and hunting. The head of the residents’ association, Antonio Andrade, has received death threats for trying to stop this. “People ask me what right I have to tell them not to take from the forest and the river. I reply that I don’t do this for myself, I do it for future generations,” Andrade says. “Without us, the majority of the forest would be gone.” His T-shirt is emblazoned with an image of the murdered nun and environmental activist, Dorothy Stang, and her words, “The end of the forest is the end of our life.” Local people need better economic prospects, but according to the destructive logic of the past few decades, that means burning the forest and clearing the land for cattle or monocultures. But there is increasing interest in alternatives, which is where Pereira and the bees come in. With investment from the Global Greengrants Fund – one of the Guardian and Observer’s 2019 appeal charities – and its Brazilian partner CASA Socio-Environmental Fund, the region’s first beekeeping business opened in November at an agri-ecological training centre in the forest. In terms of land, labour and materials, the costs of beekeeping are minimal and the returns potentially lucrative. Showing the first pots of honey and pollen, Pereira estimates that each hive can generate 800 reais (£145 ) in six months. Multiply that by 40 and the returns on a fifth of a hectare of forested land are more than 30 times higher than they would be from the usual backbreaking economic activity of growing manioc (Cassava) on land cleared by fire. “People don’t realise yet how much income they could get from this,” she says. “We have to spread the word.” At this initial stage, the centre is only selling at local markets and relies largely on word of mouth. But they will apply for official certification so they can sell in markets. The main objective, however, is to demonstrate how Amazonian beekeeping works for local people, especially the young. Trainees come from across the region for courses lasting several days. Other units include seed cultivation, soil protection, how to improve per-hectare yields with non-fire land preparation; low-intensity cattle rearing; and reforestation with Amazonian fruit trees, such as pineapple and banana. The Casa Famlliar Rural centre aims to build a new dormitory and plans to create a nursery so that students can take saplings back with them, as well as, hopefully, bees. In the future, they would like to set up a new centre in one of the border areas most threatened by miners and loggers. “We want this to set an example for the region and the world,” said one of the founders of the centre, Paulo Brasil. Pereira says her biggest hope for the future is education. “We need to show the young that there is a different way to live with the forest. But of all the courses we teach, it’s the bees that I love the most. They are so beautiful. I can watch them all day.” Please donate to our appeal here"

          "bodyText": "Maybe the driving northern rain has washed away our sense of humour. Jack Hurley’s “Rubbish Seaside”, a collection of quasi-satirical railway posters, has been billed a “backhanded love letter”. To our eyes, as teachers who work with some of the country’s most disadvantaged young people, it’s “backhanded” in much the same way that an emotionally abusive boyfriend calls you fat, but it’s you who can’t take a joke. The series did feature some nuanced and humorous social criticism. Hurley’s depiction of Manchester thoughtfully contrasted the gold-plated skyline with street-level poverty. However, his treatment of towns such as Blackpool betrayed a regrettable lack of creativity and empathy. In a local authority that has the worst public health demographics in the UK – due to savage cuts from Westminster – it seems puerile to poke fun at the “matching coldsores” sported by the “small army of scallies” Hurley sneeringly refers to in his note on the piece. Every good comedian knows the rule about punching up rather than down. Maybe an educative trip to Blackpool’s Comedy Carpet is in order. You don’t get away with it by being from “the north” either. It’s not a lumpen mass; you wouldn’t allow someone from Chelsea to speak on behalf of a council estate in Tower Hamlets, so why conflate Southport and Scarborough? Depictions like Hurley’s are also mediated through – and consumed by – a predominantly southern, middle-class gaze. These posters were promoted in a “fun new art exhibition” in Gray’s Inn Square (“Please do pop in, browse and purchase!”). Funnily enough, we’ve yet to see them displayed in all their glory on the railings of Blackpool’s North Pier. In 1981, the Tory minister Norman Tebbit notoriously regaled the Conservative Party conference – in Blackpool’s Winter Gardens – with the fable of his jobless father, who “got on his bike and looked for work, and kept looking till he found it”. Forty years on, northern towns are still facing the same stigmatising blame-game. The toxic treadmill of social mobility is exposed when middle class “escapees” from poorer post-industrial and coastal towns think they have a free pass to guffaw at those forgotten by a fraudulent meritocracy. In 2017, Justine Greening, then the secretary of state for education, recalled with woe her childhood in Rotherham: “I was aiming for something better … I knew there was something better out there”. It’s as if her Yorkshire hometown were a remote planet necessitating extraterrestrial journeys to discover intelligent life. Unless the goal of social mobility is that we all eventually move to London, we need to start taking northern towns and their potential seriously. Rather than encouraging talented young people to leave and take their ideas with them, we ought to invest in entire communities. If moving out is the only way of moving up, something’s not working. And it’s not just Norman Tebbit’s dad. We have both taught extensively in schools in Blackpool and elsewhere. We know that children are quick to internalise disparaging media portrayals of their home towns. Their self esteem is inextricably linked to low self-worth at community level. We see this when they describe their towns as dirty and dangerous, and when they use “council house” as a slur. The constant media battering fosters shame and hopelessness; they can’t see a secure and fulfilling future close to home. These kids are told they lack aspiration, but also that there is nothing worthwhile to aspire to where they live. It pits them against their families and neighbourhoods. They can’t win. For every shoddy stereotype in the press, we see a missed opportunity to report on the creativity kindled in response to just these lazy tropes. You might have seen, for example, the divisive Panorama documentary in which Blackburn was publicly shamed as “segregated” (or read the Guardian’s four-star review). Blackburn Museum responded with Kick Down the Barriers, a project collaborating with artists and writers to rewrite this toxic narrative. Particularly exciting is an upcoming piece by Jamie Holman and Sana Maulvi, which takes the form of a series of letters to one another exploring the development of their friendship over the years, and reflecting on the stereotypes and cliches they remember along the way. Have you heard of it? No? The north keeps kicking. Blackpool arts programme Leftcoast commissioned Left Behind, a series of works produced in response to a miserable Financial Times article of the same name. The Manchester-based youth leadership enterprise Reclaim celebrates the diversity of the modern British working class. Hurley’s contribution only serves to perpetuate the feeling that locals need to be embarrassed about their hometowns. Surely there are more deserving targets of his satirical aptitude. Communities will always find strength from within when they are let down by those in power. Media outlets, especially those claiming liberal credentials, have a responsibility to amplify these voices. Rebecca Grant started her teaching career in Blackpool. She currently working on a PhD about educational disadvantage in Manchester, writing for Kick Down the Barriers in Blackburn and continues to teach in secondary schools.

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents. Andrew Neil has urged Boris Johnson to commit to a BBC interview with him to face questions on why people have “deemed him to be untrustworthy”. At the end of an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Neil – who was Johnson’s former boss at the Spectator – said: “It is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. Johnson has also shunned a sit-down interview with ITV’s Julie Etchingham. Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a “cast-iron guarantee” to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was “extremely remote”. Johnson has apologised “for any offence caused” by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into the issue. Labour’s Jon Ashworth pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. John McDonnell has disclosed that Labour will not negotiate with smaller parties in the event of a hung parliament next week. The shadow chancellor told The Financial Times: “We will implement our manifesto...no negotiation, no deal, no coalitions. “We’ll roll out our programme and let’s see if the Lib Dems vote against the real living wage at 10 an hour, let’s see if the SNP vote against the proposals we brought forward for ending austerity.” Business leaders are calling for a number of commitments from the next government to help firms deal with Brexit. The Institute of Directors said details on international trade must be a priority in the coming months. The group said companies should be given an “adjustment period” before any new relationship with the EU comes into effect. Meanwhile, analysis suggests that none of the main political parties have a properly evidence-based strategy to meet their ambitions on education policy. The Education Policy Institute (EPI), funded by the Nuffield Foundation, carried out an analysis of the manifesto education plans of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and the Brexit Party, assessing how their policies would affect England. Researchers found that although all parties have made bold pledges about reducing opportunity gaps and raising educational attainment, the policies in their manifestos are unlikely to deliver on these aspirations.

The SNP candidate Ian Blackford has reiterated the party’s call for another referendum on Scottish independence. Conservative chairman James Cleverly speaking about the UK’s EU membership on Question Time. More than 100 pro-EU groups have sent a letter to Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson asking her to back Labour in the Prime Minister’s constituency. The letter promises that if the Lib Dems step back in Boris Johnson’s constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in London, the grass roots groups will pile pressure on Labour to pull back in Esher and Walton in Surrey where Lib Dem candidate Monica Harding is up against Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. The 134 groups that have signed the “Boot Out Boris” letter “want to change the dynamics of the election”. The letter to Swinson says: “We know we are asking you a lot to help Labour without any reason to think Jeremy Corbyn will return the favour. But if Johnson wins a majority, he’ll drag us out of the EU. So we implore you to look to the national interest. “We also know you are already only running a paper candidate in Uxbridge. But we want you to go further and support Labour there. “A similar letter is being sent to Corbyn asking Labour to support the Lib Dems in Esher and Walton, where you can bring down Dominic Raab. “But to be clear, we don’t want you to wait for him to say yes. Time is terribly short, so we want you to take unilateral action.” Boris Johnson has written to Jeremy Corbyn accusing him of a “sly” plan to “fiddle” a second Brexit referendum. The prime minister has urged the Labour leader to reconsider his Brexit policy and his plan to give full voting rights to all UK residents with Johnson saying it would give two million EU nationals the vote in another referendum. Johnson said Corbyn’s approach has “already done serious harm to trust” in politics, adding that cancelling the result of the 2016 referendum before it has been implemented would do more damage. Labour has said it will “give the people the final say” on Brexit, that within three months of coming to power a Labour government would secure a “sensible deal”, and within six months they will put that deal to a public vote alongside the option to remain. Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement, said: “The Labour Party believes in democracy. We welcome securing a new and better Brexit deal, and putting it back to the people to have the final say. “If Boris Johnson had any confidence in his own deal, he would have let it be scrutinised by Parliament, and then put it back before the people for their verdict.” Friday’s Financial Times front page Nationalising UK energy companies would delay the UK’s move towards a zero carbon future, according to the chief executive of Scottish Power. Keith Anderson said investment by the private sector had seen the cost of renewable energy fall over the last decade and that debates about nationalisation would only serve as a distraction from preventing a climate emergency. A Labour spokesman told the BBC Anderson’s comments are “hardly surprising” as they represent “vested interests”. A Labour government would set up a network of advisers based in Post Offices to support small businesses if the party wins the General Election. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the new Business Development Agency would act as a “one-stop shop” offering advice, finance and large-scale government contracts, and is part of a “20-point plan” to support small businesses. Another Labour policy is to set up a Post Office bank, and a network of business advisers would operate out of larger Post Bank branches to give advice and guidance for local businesses on how to access support and finance. Labour is also planning a 250 billion UK national investment bank, and network of regional and national development banks, to give small businesses and the industries of the future the funding they need. The party also wants to give free full-fibre broadband to every business premises, scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with a turnover of under 85,000, and reform business rates. On the Labour proposals to support small businesses, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said: “Despite what they claim, Labour are not on the side of small businesses. “Their plans to raise corporation tax and introduce a four-day week will hit businesses hard. “SMEs don’t need a new quango, they need certainty. All Corbyn’s Labour will bring is higher taxes and uncertainty with no plan for Brexit and the chaos of two more referendums next year. “Only a majority Conservative government can provide the certainty businesses need, get Brexit done and bring costs down for SMEs by cutting business rates so that they can realise their potential.” Liberal Democrat business spokesman Sam Gyimah said: “SMEs up and down the country have made it abundantly clear that any form of Brexit - be it red or blue - will harm their ability to hire staff, make it more difficult to export to our closest partners and ratchet up the cost of doing business. “So while Labour wants to claim that it is on the side of small businesses, its support for Brexit means that ultimately these plans ring hollow. The simple fact is that you cannot be both pro-Brexit and pro-business. “It is only the Liberal Democrats who will stop Brexit and bring forward a bold vision to support small businesses in the UK, including by scrapping the outdated business rates regime.” The Liberal Democrats have pledged funding for disadvantaged pre-school children will be tripled if they triumph in the General Election. The party said funding would be boosted for children aged three and four attending nurseries and other childcare providers. Introduced by the Lib Dems in 2015, the Early Years Pupil Premium (EYPP) gives childcare providers up to 302 extra a year for all disadvantaged children aged three and four they look after, the party said, adding that around 99,000 children a year benefitted from the extra funding. The Lib Dems said they would triple the EYPP to 1,000 per child, costing between 65 million and 70 million in 2024/25. It has also pledged to support families on low incomes by investing one billion a year in children’s centres, improving the quality of staff in early years settings by requiring all providers to have a staff training programme, and providing 35 hours of free childcare from the day parents go back to work to the day their child starts school. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said: “The achievement gap between richer and poorer children can best be closed in the early years. “But under the Conservatives, it’s widening. We cannot allow disadvantaged children to be left behind before they have even started school. “Liberal Democrats will transform the lives of families with a massive expansion of free, high-quality childcare. “At the same time, we’ll give nurseries more money dedicated to supporting children from the poorest families and children in care. “By investing in the early years, we can give every child a great start in life.” Friday’s Metro front page focusing on Andrew Neil’s challenge to the prime minister Tomorrow’s Telegraph splash Friday’s Times front page focusing on the Brexit party Labour has complained to the BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of “slanted and biased” election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour’s leadership and policies have faced “more negative treatment” and “harsher scrutiny” by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour’s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson’s “failure” to be interviewed by BBC’s Andrew Neil. A BBC spokesman said: “The BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.” Here is the letter in full from Gwynne: “I am writing to raise the Labour Party’s serious concerns over the BBC’s coverage of the General Election campaign, which we believe has repeatedly shown bias in its reporting of the Labour Party and its leadership, and demonstrated a worrying failure to meet the BBC’s obligations to fairness and impartiality. “That bias has been reflected in the framing, content and balance of BBC reporting during the campaign. We have recorded numerous examples of more negative treatment, harsher scrutiny and slanted editorial comment about Labour’s leadership, policies and record, as compared with those of the Conservative Party, and submitted them to the BBC. “Up to this point, there has been no substantive response, even though the time to address the evidence of bias is fast running out. “In terms of balance and fairness, we have particular concerns over the Andrew Neil interviews. “It now appears that the BBC has accepted the Conservative breach of the debates programmes package, agreed with both parties, and allowed the Conservative leader to choose an alternative interviewer. “Despite our concerns about Andrew Neil’s well-known conservative political leanings, we agreed to Jeremy Corbyn’s participation on the clear understanding that Boris Johnson had agreed the same terms: namely, a four-programme debates package, including a Neil interview, designed with legal oversight to ensure fairness, balance and impartiality across the campaign period. “Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability. “This clearly broke the agreement the Labour Party made with the BBC in good faith. “But despite raising this repeatedly with BBC editorial management, no proposal has been made to redress the imbalance that has been created. “This imbalance is compounded almost daily by the fact that a significant amount of BBC content, on TV, radio and online, including bulletins, commentary and newspaper reviews, draws on the content and political agenda of the Conservative Party-supporting press. “The BBC does not have a role as a protagonist in the General Election. “If the Conservatives are allowed to ‘play’ or manipulate the BBC, and this behaviour goes unchecked, then the corporation will have effectively been complicit in giving the Conservative Party an unfair electoral advantage. “I would therefore urge you to ensure that this unfairness is urgently corrected, and that the Labour Party is treated fairly and even-handedly, in relation to the governing Conservative Party in particular, in what is left of this campaign. “I attach our previous letter to your colleague Fran Unsworth, and an updated set of examples of your slanted and biased coverage of the campaign.” Friday’s Guardian front page Addressing a rally of party faithful in Birmingham about Labour’s manifesto pledges, Jeremy Corbyn appeared to mimic a line of questioning he received on Andrew Neil’s BBC show. Speaking to a room of 800-1,000 people, the Labour leader said: “So when people say to me, ‘how are you going to pay for all this, Mr Corbyn?’ “’How are you going to pay for it, Mr Corbyn? Come on, answer it, answer it, answer it!’ he added, drawing laughs from the crowd. “’You’ve got no answer for it, have you?”’ He said: “We’ve got our grey book and every single line of our manifesto has been read through, carefully, and fully costed.” Corbyn also insisted there was “no place whatsoever” for anti-Semitism within Labour. He said: “I remember when Enoch Powell was in the West Midlands, I remember the viciousness of that whole period. “I simply say this: in our society, in our moment, there is no place whatsoever for anti-Semitism, Islamophobia or racism. “So in the last weeks of this election campaign, when everything will be thrown at us by those that are rich and powerful, we’re going to be out there on every street, every town, every city, with our message. “A message of hope, a message of inclusion, a message of a society that is based on the needs of all of us and of social justice for all.” Donald Tusk, the former European Council president, told The Guardian the Brexit campaign is an example of “the unprecedented readiness to lie” in modern politics. He said Brexit has been “one of the most spectacular mistakes” in the history of the EU and “the most painful and saddest experience” of his time in office. Labour has complained to the BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, accusing the broadcaster of “slanted and biased” election coverage. The party claims to have examples of where Labour’s leadership and policies have faced “more negative treatment” and “harsher scrutiny” by the BBC compared to those of the Conservative Party. Labour’s co-campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne also raised concern about Boris Johnson’s “failure” to be interviewed by BBC’s Andrew Neil. Gwynne said the party agreed to Jeremy Corbyn’s interview with Neil based on the “clear understanding” that Johnson had agreed the same terms. “Instead, the BBC allowed the Conservative leader to pick and choose a platform through which he believed he could present himself more favourably and without the same degree of accountability,” Gwynne said in the letter. A BBC spokesman said: “The BBC will continue to make its own independent editorial decisions, and is committed to reporting the election campaign fairly, impartially and without fear or favour.” At The Custard Factory, Jeremy Corbyn said he is “inspired” by the ambitions of the children he’s met - but also saddened by the difficulties they and their “stressed-out” teachers have faced as they struggle with a “lack of funds”. “None of this is necessary, none of this is right,” he added. All of this is part of Labour’s promotion of education proposals which include capping class sizes by recruiting 20,000 extra teachers. Nigel Farage has criticised the three MEPs who abandoned his Brexit party today seven days before polling day in an interview with Andrew Neil. Annunziata Rees-Mogg – sister of the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg – Lance Forman and Lucy Harris all resigned the whip to back Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. Ahead of Jeremy Corbyn taking the stage at the Labour rally in Birmingham, the singer Jamelia spoke about how her daughter almost died as a newborn but because of the NHS, she is alive. The television presenter said her daughter is nearly two and “all she wants for her birthday is a Labour government”. Jeremy Corbyn is due to speak shortly at The Custard Factory in Birmingham. Andrew Neil said the prime minister tells us he has always been an opponent of austerity but we would ask him for evidence of that. In the final part of his monologue, he said: “And we would want to know why an opponent of austerity would bake so much of it into their future spending plans. “We would ask why, as with the proposed increase in police numbers, so many of his promises only take us back to the future, back to where we were before austerity began. “Social care is an issue of growing concern. On the steps of Downing Street in July he said he’d prepared a plan for social care. We’d ask him why that plan is not in his manifesto. “Questions of trust. Questions we’d like to put to Mr Johnson so you can hear his replies. But we can’t, because he won’t sit down with us. “There is no law, no supreme court ruling, that can force Mr Johnson to participate in a BBC leaders’ interview. But the prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China. “So it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.” More from Andrew Neil on his intervention which came after his interview with Nigel Farage. He said: “Can he be believed when he claims another 34 [hospitals] will be built in the five years after that? “Can he be trusted to fund the NHS properly, when he used a cash figure of an extra £34bn? “After inflation, the additional money promised amounts to £20bn. “He vows that the NHS will not be on the table with any trade talks with America. But he vowed to the DUP, his unionist allies in Northern Ireland, that there would never be a border down the Irish Sea. “That is as important to the DUP as the NHS is to the rest of us. It is a vow his Brexit deal would seem to break.” Here is the full transcript of Andrew Neil’s challenge to Boris Johnson to commit to an interview with him with just one week before polling day. Talking about his leader interviews, the veteran broadcaster said: “There is of course still one to be done - Boris Johnson, the prime minister. “We have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, a time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming. “No broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed. But leaders’ interviews have been a key part of the BBC’s prime-time election coverage for decades. “We do them on your behalf to scrutinise and hold to account those who would govern us. That is democracy.” Neil added: “We’ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate. And in every election they have. All of them. Until this one. “It is not too late. We have interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say. “The theme running through our questions is trust, and why at so many times in his career, in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those close to him have deemed him to be untrustworthy. “It is of course relevant to what he is promising us all now. “Can he be trusted to deliver 50,000 more nurses? When almost 20,000 in his numbers are already working for the NHS. “He promises 40 new hospitals. But only six are scheduled to be built by 2025.” Reaction to Andrew Neil issuing a direct challenge to Boris Johnson to face him one-on-one, and the prime minister yet to agree a date for the BBC interview. Jeremy Corbyn did not directly respond to the question over whether he would resign if Labour does not win next week’s election. It comes after Lord Falconer called for him to resign if Labour are unsuccessful while Len McCluskey, from the Unite union, said Corbyn should remain. Corbyn told ITV: “I am leading the party to win the election, I am utterly determined to win the election.” At a Liberal Democrat campaign rally in Edinburgh, which featured a “topple Boris” coconut shy, a “Swinzone” selfie area and rather unseasonal free ice cream, Jo Swinson told activists she was glad to be back in Scotland and attacked the government still sitting just down the road at the Holyrood parliament. “The SNP try to pretend that if you’re against independence, you’re somehow against Scotland. They are wrong,” she told the audience, before taking the SNP government to task for their record on health, education and policing. “It’s been a tough week for the SNP headline-wise, with the ongoing infections crisis at Glasgow’s flagship hospital, poor results in the Pisa schools study, and the resignation of the chair of the Scottish Police Authority, Susan Deacon, as she criticised police accountability and governance as ‘fundamentally flawed’.” To laughter, she added: “Boris Johnson says he is committed to our family of nations. But we all know that he’s never been much of a family man.” Corbyn was asked by ITV what his stance on Brexit was. He responded: “A credible leave option maintains credible trading relations with Europe, the sale and manufacture of goods, a customs agreement that protects the Good Friday agreement. “We would support either remain or leave with the economic relationship with Europe intact.” The Labour leader added he would not support Scotland having a second referendum on independence. Corbyn has reiterated his apology over the antisemitism allegations that have engulfed his party. He told ITV: “Antisemitism is a vile evil. I have spent my life campaigning against racism. “Where there has been a delay in processing [cases], I apologise to the people who suffered as a result of it.” On safety and security following the London Bridge attack last week, Jeremy Corbyn told ITV “what concerns me is automatic release” for people convicted of serious offences. He added his priority is a “properly funded prison service and probation service” which is able to intervene. In an interview with ITV’s Tonight programme, Jeremy Corbyn responded to his standing in the opinion polls. He said: “I never comment on opinion polls. “I behave as leader of the party. Yes, I have had a lot of attacks from the media. “I don’t indulge in personal abuse.” Andrew Neil has urged Boris Johnson to commit to a BBC interview with him to face questions on why people have “deemed him to be untrustworthy”. At the end of an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, Neil – who was Johnson’s former boss at the Spectator – said: “It is not too late. We have an interview prepared. Oven-ready, as Mr Johnson likes to say.” Neil said Johnson was the only party leader who had not agreed to be interviewed, adding: “We have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, time ... as of now none have been forthcoming. “No broadcaster can compel a politician to be interviewed but leaders’ interviews have been a key part of the BBC’s primetime election coverage for decades … to hold to account, on your behalf, those who would govern us. That is democracy. “We’ve always proceeded in good faith that the leaders would participate and in every election they have - until this one.” Talks between trade unions and the Department of Health to prevent industrial action have ended without agreement. Health workers in Northern Ireland have been taking part in action over pay and staffing levels. There has been strike action as well as work-to-rule across the week, causing thousands of operations and appointments to be cancelled. Negotiators from four trade unions which represent health workers and nurses held a three-hour meeting with the Department of Health in Belfast on Thursday. The Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, who met the unions before their talks with the department, welcomed its fresh offer. But speaking on behalf of the unions, Anne Speed from Unison said it was “insufficient”. “Despite the tweet from the secretary of state earlier this evening in the middle of discussions before the meeting concluded, our position is as follows: The department has presented a new position, trade unions have jointly agreed this remains insufficient and falls short of our members’ requirements and mandate that they have given us,” she said. “Industrial action continues and joint planned trade union action remains in place for December 18.” Nigel Farage has criticised the MEPs who left the party today to campaign for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. Farage said Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister to the Commons leader, Jacob, and one of those to walk out, was “wrong” to suggest the Brexit party could put Britain’s departure from the European Union “at risk” by contesting Labour-held seats. He countered by arguing it was the Tories that were guilty of potentially splitting the leave vote, by contesting constituencies such as Doncaster, Barnsley and Hartlepool where voters were “unlikely” to go blue. Lance Forman and Lucy Harris also left the party while John Longworth lost the whip on Wednesday for criticising the party’s election strategy. One of the big developments of the day has been three MEPs leaving the Brexit party and urging voters to back the Conservatives . One of them, Lucy Harris, said her decision was based on her belief that only Labour and the Tories could win next week’s election. She told the BBC that Labour’s policy to deliver a second EU referendum would mean making a decision between a “botched-up Brexit deal” and remaining in the EU and that it was therefore “too risky” to do anything other than vote for Boris Johnson. Earlier, the Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage, pointed to links between the three MEPs and the Conservatives. Boris Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans - despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents. He was confronted on the issue by reporters because overnight the Conservative party released a briefing saying that, if it won the election, a budget in February would “cut taxes for hard-working families”. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden is set to rise in the first Tory budget, according to CCHQ’s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. For example, he told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: We’re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I’m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We’re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he didn’t, and instead he just implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue what amounted to a clarification – always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly. Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Asked about this at his Q&amp;A, he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen. This evening it has emerged that he definitely won’t be doing a sit-down interview with ITV’s Julie Etchingham either. Jeremy Corbyn has given interviews to both Neil and Etchingham – although both generated multiple negative headlines, which of course explains why Johnson is evading this level of scrutiny. Four Brexit party MEPs have held a news conference to explain why they are leaving the party and urging people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. They worry that by continuing to stand in Tory target seats, Nigel Farage’s party could be helping Labour. Last month Farage said he would not put up candidates in 317 Tory-won seats because he was worried about a minority Labour government eventually cancelling Brexit, and the rebel “gang of four” argued that backing the Tories everywhere was the logical extension. Farage has rejected this, claiming there are seats where the Brexit party is actually helping the Tories by standing. Students of Farage’s career will recall that the last party he led, Ukip, also ended up riven by splits. Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year - but refused to give a “cast-iron guarantee” to that effect. In an interview this morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was “extremely remote”. Johnson has apologised “for any offence caused” by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into the issue. Labour’s Jon Ashworth has pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel. That’s all from me this evening. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is in charge of the blog now. There is a Jeremy Corbyn rally at 7pm. The Andrew Neil interview with Nigel Farage is going out at 7pm too. And Julie Etchingham’s interview with Jeremy Corbyn is being broadcast at 7.30pm. My colleague Hilary Osborne has written a Factcheck piece on who is responsible for the increase in homelessness, following comments made by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. On Boris Johnson not appearing on the Tonight programme, a spokesman for ITV said: “The ITV News team making the Boris Johnson Tonight film made the original bid for the prime minister when the election was called. “They have contacted his press team on repeated occasions with times and dates offered to film an interview. “Boris Johnson’s team have today confirmed he will not be taking part. “The programme will instead feature a profile of the prime minister using fresh interviews with other contributors and archive footage.” My colleague Jim Waterson’s reaction to the news that Boris Johnson will not be following suit and taking part in an interview with ITV News. ITV said: “Every other leader of Great Britain’s main political parties that has been approached has done an interview for Tonight.” The prime minister has faced mounting criticism of his refusal to be interviewed by Andrew Neil on the BBC. Nicola Sturgeon has said she believes tactical voting could be key to stopping Boris Johnson getting a majority and that “people are thinking very carefully” about how to vote. Scotland’s first minister said she felt there may be more tactical voting at this general election than ever before as she urged voters to oust Conservative MPs in Scotland by voting for the Scottish National party. She said: “The way to escape that mess and to focus on building a better Scotland is to make sure that the Tories and Boris Johnson don’t get that majority they’re looking for. “In this election people are thinking very carefully, I think there will be potentially more tactical voting than we’ve seen in previous general elections, and in Scotland if you want to vote tactically to stop the Tories, then the way to do that is to vote SNP - we’re the challenger in all the Tory-held seats.” More on the controversy over Boris Johnson taking a selfie with This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby using a Huawei smartphone, despite security concerns around the Chinese company. Schofield has waded in on Twitter in response to criticism. Responding to fans who asked whether he had challenged Johnson over comments which some claim are Islamophobic, the host replied: “YES!!” Ofcom said it had received 31 complaints about the interview as of this afternoon. Earlier in the comments bagillt was asking for some more detail of what Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, said in his LBC phone-in this morning. Ever keen to oblige, here are some more quotes. Khan criticised Boris Johnson’s response to the London Bridge terror attack, saying it was not the Tories’ finest hour. There were two possible explanations for the Conservative response, he said: One is, is just shameless politicking? But two is, Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are going on the offensive because of some of the things they’ve done in last nine years? Let me give you just a couple of examples. One, it was a Conservative government that removed the powers that judges had, for example, when there’s a violent and serious offender, to give them an indeterminate sentence to protect the public. The government did this to reduce prison numbers, to save money. Secondly, it is the case that there is far less rehabilitation in prisons and far less supervision because of massive cuts made by a Conservative government. So, you can understand why a Tory standing to be the prime minister again wants to turn a defensive posture to an offensive one. But just pause and reflect how [the victims’ families] are feeling. Just pause and reflect how the three people so seriously injured last week are feeling, to see people in positions of power and influence trying to seek political advantage out of this. On reflection, Boris Johnson and his team will think it wasn’t their finest hour. He said Labour should have the “humility” to accept that Jewish people felt there was a genuine problem with antisemitism in the party. He said: I’m meeting friends who are Jewish Londoners on a daily basis who feel we are a racist party and we’ve got to accept that. We can’t project an anti-Jeremy Corbyn or an anti-London animus towards somebody who feels we’re antisemitic. They feel we’re antisemitic and I accept that and I think we’ve got to have the humility to realise that a small community in London – and the Jewish community is relatively small – feels really upset, feels really scared and feels really anxious. I think it’s really important that we address that. He said Jeremy Corbyn had campaigned against racism all his life and had never been racist in the way Boris Johnson had. He said: I can point to things on the record that Boris Johnson has said about people of colour and people with different faiths: on the record, overtly, proudly, being paid for it. [Can] you point to examples where Jeremy Corbyn has said things on the record, in articles, in speeches, for a cheap joke, about people of colour or people of different faiths? The Conservatives received donations of more than £3m in the third week of the general election campaign - far outstripping the other parties, PA Media reports. The Electoral Commission said the Tories reported donations of more than £7,500 totalling £3.59m in the week from 20-26 November. In contrast, Labour received £521,909, the Liberal Democrats £509,998 and the Brexit party received no donations over 7,500 at all. The Green party reported donations of £100,000, and the Alliance party of Northern Ireland £15,000. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has criticised Boris Johnson for “evading scrutiny” in the general election campaign. At an event in South Queensferry she said: Boris Johnson has ducked and dived, evading scrutiny throughout this whole campaign and no wonder because everybody knows that if he gets his way he drags Scotland out of the EU against our will, out of the single market and the customs union, plunging us into the next round of Brexit chaos that could cost every person in our country £1,600 and a process that could end with a no-deal Brexit later next year. She has also unveiled the Scottish National party battlebus. Given that “Stop Brexit” is also a Lib Dem slogan, this is probably the design the Lib Dems should have chosen for their battlebus. (Instead the Lib Dems opted for an enormous picture of Jo Swinson, which was probably a mistake because she has turned out to be less of an asset than the party expected.) The Conservative party has put out a statement clarifying its position on taxes - ie, saying what Boris Johnson would have said in his Q&amp;A earlier if he had been more honest about the party’s plans. (See 3.57pm.) A spokesman said: Our manifesto does not propose increasing taxes on UK resident companies and would not put up personal taxes for hard-working Brits. We have been very clear that we are pausing future corporation tax cuts, and will invest this money into our NHS. We will also introduce a surcharge on those buying UK property from abroad, increase the immigration health surcharge so everyone contributes to our NHS and put up taxes on plastic bags to help our environment. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson’s Q&amp;A in Matlock. Johnson refused to accept that the Conservative party’s own costings show the overall tax burden will increase under their plans. (See 3.57pm.) He rejected claims that his pledge to “get Brexit done” by 31 January was misleading because 2020 would be consumed by Brexit negotiations with the EU. This point was put to Johnson twice, but he refused to accept it. He said the situation would be different after January because the “parliamentary wrangling and bitterness and feuding” would be over. For a good explanation of why Johnson may be wrong, and why 2020 could end up being dominated again by news about a possible no-deal Brexit, do read this Twitter thread from the Economist’s John Peet. It starts here. Johnson insisted he would get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year, but refused to say he was giving a “cast-iron guarantee” to that effect. Asked if he would “absolutely promise” to get a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period, Johnson said he thought he could. We already have a deal. And we can come out on January 31 in a state of perfect equilibrium and grace with the rest of the EU because we have a zero-tariff, zero-quota position now, and I’ve absolutely no doubt at all that we’ll be able to make sure that the EU protects its own interests and has a deal with us that ensures that continues for the future. If you say, ‘can I absolutely guarantee that we’ll get a deal’, I think I can and I’ll tell you why – look at what we achieved ... in three months with the new deal that I did. We did it and it’s a great deal and it will take this country forward and I’m very proud of it. But when he was asked if that was a “cast-iron guarantee”, Johnson said: “The possibility you allude to simply will not happen.” Johnson refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil for the BBC. Asked about this, he said: I’m the first prime minister to have done two, or about to do two one-on-one leadership debates, several hours’ worth of phone-ins, endless press conferences and interviews with all sorts of BBC people called Andrew. And I will continue to submit to the interrogation of the media. He also said that his communications director, Lee Cain, was the person to speak to for details of his media appearances, but the tone of his answer implied that he did not want, or expect, to do the Neil interview. Johnson defended plans in the Conservative manifesto to pass a law restricting strikes on public transport. He said: I do think it’s absurd that critical transport mass-transit systems should be capable of being put out of actions by strikes, and other countries around the world have minimum service requirements for public transport - and that’s what I want to see. He said people would be “outraged” if Labour were to allow EU nationals to vote in a second Brexit referendum. He said: I think the whole proposal from the Labour party is bizarre. I think people will be outraged by the whole thing and ... to think that it is going to be rigged in some way by getting in millions more voters who’d be very likely to vote one way rather than another, I think that would cause a great deal of public disquiet and I don’t think it’s the right way forward. Earlier I posted some Press Association copy about Boris Johnson taking a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on ITV’s This Morning. (See 1.56pm.) The Press Association has subsequently filed this addition. A Conservative spokesman subsequently denied the phone was the prime minister’s. But on the show Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview and “he whipped his phone out and he took a selfie” to which Schofield replied: “But he didn’t know he had to press the button …” The most awkward questions for Boris Johnson today came on the subject of tax. Overnight, the Conservatives briefed out a story about how they would hold a budget in February “which will cut taxes for hard-working families” and this morning the Daily Telegraph and the Times both splashed on stories about the Tories offering tax cuts. But the Tories have already published details of their tax plans, and they show that, although personal taxes would go down in their first budget, the overall tax burden would rise because they have cancelled a planned cut in corporation tax. (In budget terms, that counts as a tax rise.) Overall, the cuts and the increases for 2020-21 effectively balance out, but the tax increase total (£3,320m) is bigger than the tax cut total (£3,195m), making a net increase in the tax burden of £5m. This is perfectly defensible. You can argue that the personal tax burden is not the same as the overall tax burden. You could also argue that a tax cut forgone is not the same as a tax rise (although economists will tell you that it is). But Johnson did not do either of these things. Instead, when asked about these figures, he claimed not to know what they were, and refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise. The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, first raised this point. She put it to Johnson that he was saying he would cut taxes in February, when overall his manifesto said taxes would go up. Johnson did not accept this. He said: I don’t know what you are talking about ... We’re cutting taxes on business rates, we’re cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country, everybody paying NICs. When Kuenssberg pushed him on this again, saying that overall taxes would go up, he claimed not to recognise the data. He told her: We’re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I’m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We’re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes. Later Liz Bates from Channel 4 News made the same point, and asked Johnson why he was not willing to admit that taxes would go up when it said so in black and white in his manifesto. He replied: Because it’s absolutely not right. We have got a manifesto that commits us to cutting national insurance contributions for everybody in the country. Here is the chart from the Tory manifesto costing document (pdf) showing the party’s proposed tax cuts. And here is the chart from the same documents showing the proposed tax increases. In an article with the Sun about his daily routine during the campaign Johnson joked that, when he needed to relax at night, he resorted to “a few quadratic equations”. But you don’t need to be able to do quadratic equations to know that £3,320m is more than £3,195m. Q: What will you say to a voter next year who says, ‘You said Brexit would be over, but I keep hearing about it on the news.’ Johnson says he does not accept that will happen. Q: Why won’t you admit that taxes will go up under your plans? Johnson says his priority in his first budget will be cutting taxes, not raising them. That’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: If there were a second referendum next year, would it be right to give EU nationals the vote? Johnson says the Labour plan is bizarre. He says Jeremy Corbyn cannot find anyone in his shadow cabinet who would vote for the deal he will negotiate. And he says that trying to rig the referendum would be wrong. Q: Will you do an interview with Andrew Neil? Johnson says he would be “very happy do interviews with all manner of people”. He says he has submitted himself to lots of interviews. He says he is the first PM to do two one-on-one debates. As for questions about the Neil interview, he says the questioner should ask his communications director, Lee Cain. Johnson refuses to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Q: We have not heard anything from Jacob Rees-Mogg during the campaign. Will he be in your cabinet? Johnson says questions like that come under the category of measuring up the curtains. He wants to focus on winning the election. Q: Do you want to ban strikes on public transport and the tube? Johnson says it is absurd that critical, mass transport systems can be put out of action by strikes. He wants to have minimum standards for them. That happens in other countries, he says. He says that idea is in the Tory manifesto. Q: Did the previous Tory governments cut too much? Johnson says he was running London at the time. He says the Tory government had a mess to sort out. He wants to invest. Q: So did it cut too much? Johnson says that is idle speculation. He says Labour would start with an economic crisis, not end with one. Q: Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will negotiate a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year? Johnson says the prospect of not having a deal won’t arise, but he refuses to give a cast-iron guarantee. Q: You say today that you will present a budget in February that will cut tax. But overall your plans will raise tax. And you say you will get Brexit done. But the talks will still go on. How can people trust what you say? Johnson says he does not understand the first point. He is going to cut taxes, he says. And he says taking the UK out of the EU on 31 January will end the parliamentary wrangling. When pressed on the point about taxes, Johnson says he does not know what Laura Kuenssberg, who asked the question, was referring to. Johnson obviously missed these tweets from the Financial Times’ economics editor, Chris Giles. Johnson gets presented with a scarf saying get Brexit done. Q: Can you guarantee that the NHS will not be vulnerable to other countries or outside bodies? Yes, says Johnson. He says his charge often comes up. But the NHS is a fantastic thing. He says he is building 40 new hospitals. They will be there in 10 years’ time, as a result of the decisions he is taking. And he wants to have 50,000 more GP appointments. A healthier population will make for a happier, richer country, he says. Johnson is now taking questions, from workers first. He says he will take media questions later. A woman says she sent Johnson an email some time ago. She lives at the top of Matlock, where people want to build 400 homes on a flood plain. There have been floods there, she says. Why is this going ahead? Johnson says he has met a huge amount of people who suffered during the recent floods. “We have got to stop building on flood plains,” she says. The government is investing in brownfield sites, he says. He says he will pass this on to Sarah Dines, the Tory candidate for Derbyshire Dales, so she can take this up with the planners. Q: When Brexit is over, are you going to pull the country back together? Yes, says Johnson. He says the wrangling in the country has got worse. But in the Conservative party people are coming together. If Brexit is delivered, people will come together, he says. He now tells an anecdote from his visit to the Red Bull Racing centre yesterday. He says he was told they had managed to reduce the engine size from 2.6 litres to something smaller. But the engines were more powerful. That leads him on to claiming that this parliament has been holding Britain back like a punctured tyre. Johnson is now doing his familiar riff about how remarkable exports are. But there is a new, or newish, joke. Britain is the only country to export music to the United States, he says. That’s why they call it One Direction, he says. Boris Johnson says he is at the John Smedley factory. He says he has some John Smedley garments himself. He starts by explaining why he is having an election. Parliament is “broken down, jacknifed”, he says. It is the standard stump speech ... Boris Johnson is holding a campaign event in Derbyshire. He is at a factory where he is due to take questions from workers. The former chancellor George Osborne and his former opposite number Ed Balls will reunite for ITV’s election night coverage, the Press Association reports. Since leaving frontline politics Osborne is, among other things, now the editor of the London Evening Standard, while Balls transformed his public image as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016. ITV has confirmed that the pair will join the former Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson, as well as the former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson. Andrew Neil has already recorded his interview with Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader. It will be shown on BBC One tonight. In a clip released in advance, Farage said the three MEPs who announced they were quitting today were all linked to the Tories. He said: One of them is a sister of a cabinet minister, another one has a boyfriend working for that cabinet minister – fact, and another one is a personal friend of Boris Johnson’s. Farage was referring to Annunziata Rees-Mogg, Lucy Harris and Lance Forman respectively. Farage also claimed that Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal was unacceptable. He said: And I’ll tell you something, Boris Johnson’s deal unamended is unacceptable and I certainly stand by that. That is not what Farage implied when he announced last month that he would not be standing candidates in Tory-held seats. In its submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party (see 7.35am and 9.20am) the Jewish Labour Movement claims Jeremy Corbyn has made the party “a welcoming refuge for antisemites”. Corbyn was asked about this claim on a campaign visit to Peterborough earlier. He rejected it firmly. Asked about the allegation, he replied: I completely reject that. When I became leader of the party there were no processes in place to deal with antisemitism. We introduced an appeals procedure to deal with it and we introduced an education process, so that party members understood the hurt that can be caused by antisemitic remarks or antisemitic behaviour. I think we’ve got processes in place that have improved it a great deal. I’ve posted it already, but I will post it again because it is the most arresting picture of the day, and you could write an entire treatise about celebrity culture, daytime TV and the impartiality of the media on the basis of its implications: Boris Johnson posing for a selfie with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby after his appearance on their programme, ITV’s This Morning. But there is another issue thrown up by the picture too; Johnson is using a Huawei phone. This is from the Press Association. Boris Johnson has appeared on television using a Huawei smartphone, despite ongoing security concerns around the Chinese company. Following an interview on ITV’s This Morning, the prime minister used what appeared to be a Huawei P20 – understood to be his own – to take a selfie with presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. Willoughby said Johnson reappeared after his interview on the programme and “he whipped his phone out” in order to take the picture. The incident comes in the midst of a heated debate around the company and allegations of its close links to the Chinese state - critics have argued that Huawei’s telecoms equipment could be used to spy on people in the west - something the company has always denied. It insists it abides by the laws of each country in which it operates. The US, which has placed trade restrictions on the firm, has previously suggested that future co-operation with other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partnership – the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand – could be jeopardised if the Chinese company was given a role in the UK’s 5G infrastructure. On Wednesday, Johnson said he would not compromise Britain’s national security over whether to give the telecoms firm a role in building the UK’s 5G network. The Conservative party refused to comment on the incident. Boris Johnson is due to hold a campaign event shortly. But, as the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports, there’s been a problem. The academic Simon Usherwood has an interesting Twitter thread on the Brexit party resignations. It starts here. And here are some of his posts. Q: What would you say to Nigel Farage if he were here? Forman says he would invite Farage to join them, and to stand down his candidates. Q: In all but about 20 seats? Forman suggests it would be better to stand down everywhere. Sometimes you have to swallow your pride, he says. He says Farage could be seen as a great statesman if he were to do that. And that’s it. The press conference is over. Q: Do you feel Brexit party supporters are now lions led by donkeys? Longworth says he hates personal attacks. For him, this is all about Brexit. He says it is wrong that the Brexit party is now putting the party ahead of Brexit. Q: Do you think Nigel Farage’s tactical decisions have jeopardised Brexit? Rees-Mogg says all four MEPs on the panel have raised concerns about Farage’s strategy. She thinks he wants an independent UK. But she thinks he is going about it the wrong way, and risking the election of a remainer government. Q: The Brexit party response to your move has been vicious. (See 10.06am.) Have they always had their suspicions about the four of you? Longworth says he does not think so. He says the problem only started when Nigel Farage decided the party would oppose Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. It would have been better to work with Johnson on improving it, he says. He says he does not think a formal alliance with the Tories would have worked. But at this point he says he thinks, if you support Brexit, backing the Tories is the only option. Q: Will you stand down as MEPs? And will you work together as a group? Harris says they won’t stand down. She says they want to be in the European parliament to vote for Boris Johnson’s deal. The Brexit party will vote against it, she says. Q: [To Longworth] Did the Brexit party strip you of the whip yesterday because they knew you were going to do this? Longworth says he does not know. He says the Brexit party refused to tell him directly why the whip was being withdrawn. But he says he was in Brussels yesterday for an internal committee vote. He said he was not allowed to tell the Brexit party about what happened, and he thinks that may have been why he was disciplined. Q: You said you have not discussed this with the Tories. But have the Tories discussed this with you in the past? Longworth says he has never had any approach from the Conservative party. He says Nigel Farage keeps alleging this, but it is not true. Annunziata Rees-Mogg says she has had no offers from the Conservative party at all. She says she gets annoyed when people suggest she is acting on behalf of her brother. She isn’t. I have had no approaches from the Conservative party in any description and I am, frankly, finding it really quite disturbingly old-fashioned that people are suggesting that my brother gets to tell me what to do with my political views – he doesn’t. We have completely independent views from each other and I am only concerned about Brexit. I haven’t spoken to anyone about it - they wouldn’t be able to bribe me. This is purely, purely about Brexit. Harris and Lance Forman both say they have never had offers from the Tories either. The panel are now taking questions. Q: Have any of you been offered jobs or honours by the Tories? John Longworth says they have not even discussed this move with the Tories. Q: Are you planning to join the Conservatives? Lucy Harris says this is what they are saying for the moment. But, if invited to campaign for a Conservative candidate, she would. Annunziata Rees-Mogg MEP is speaking now. (This is one Rees-Mogg that CCHQ will be happy to see on the news. Her brother, Jacob, the leader of the Commons, has been invisible during the campaign since he suggested that the Grenfell Tower residents lacked the common sense to ignore the advice to stay put.) Rees-Mogg says she joined the Brexit party earlier this year, when it looked as if Theresa May was going to deny the country a proper Brexit. But the party’s success ensured a Brexiter became Tory leader. When Boris Johnson unveiled his Brexit plan, the Brexit party immediately decided it was unacceptable. Rees-Mogg says that was a mistake. And she says the fact that the party is standing now in Tory target seats means it could split the Brexit vote, and let in Labour candidates. The Brexit party are now “the very party risking Brexit”, she claims. John Longworth MEP is speaking at the press conference now. He says he was always a Eurosceptic. He recalls sitting on a government taskforce on deregulation when Margaret Thatcher was PM, and realising how resistant some government departments were to deregulation. He says he publicly came out in favour of Brexit during the referendum campaign. At the time he was the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. He says he was infuriated by the scaremongering coming from the remain campaign about the consequences of Brexit. He says he joined the Brexit party to ensure Brexit happened. He says if the Brexit party had not been formed, and won seats in the European elections, Theresa May and Philip Hammond would have pushed through a watered-down version of Brexit. He says, since then, the Brexit party has morphed into something else. It has non-Brexit goals. But Longworth says he is only interested in Brexit. He says Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has “the potential to be a great deal”. I would say it equates to being a little bit better than the Norway deal - but it has the potential to be a great deal. It is also “the only game in town”, he says. All the alternatives would lead to article 50 being revoked. That is why he thinks people should vote Conservative in the election, even if they have to “hold their nose”. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, was on LBC this morning. As LBC’s Theo Usherwood reports, Khan said that Boris Johnson’s record on racism was far worse than Jeremy Corbyn’s on antisemitism - not least because Johnson has been paid for what he had said in his journalism. Lance Forman, the London MEP, is speaking at the press conference. He says, if it is acceptable for the Brexit party to stand down in 317 Tory-held seats, it makes sense for the Brexit party to back the Conservative party everywhere. He says his decision is not prompted by opposition to Nigel Farage. He pays tribute to Farage, saying he has achieved a huge amount. He also says he is worried about antisemitism in the Labour party. The four Brexit party MEPs who have left to back the Conservatives are now holding a press conference in Westminster. There is a live feed here. And this is from the Brexit party MEP Michael Heaver. These are from the Brexit party MEP Alexandra Phillips on the four defectors. Here is the video message from the Brexit party’s “gang of four” explaining why they are now backing the Conservatives. This is from Lucy Harris, one of the four Brexit party MEPs who has left the party to support the Conservatives. One measure of the dismal state of our politics is the way political interviewing at this election seems to consist mostly of demanding apologies. With Jeremy Corbyn, it’s for antisemitism. With Jo Swinson, it’s for her record in coalition. And with Boris Johnson - well, there is quite a choice, but racist, homophobic or otherwise offensive comments made by him in newspaper columns tend to come at the top of the list. (Note to younger readers: election campaigns didn’t always used to be like this.) Johnson was on ITV’s This Morning a few minutes ago. Two days ago the presenter Phillip Schofield managed to get an apology out of Corbyn. Today he managed the same with Johnson. Here are the main points. Johnson apologised for describing women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. Unlike many of the other comments in previous newspaper articles for which he is being criticised, Johnson wrote this relatively recently, in the summer last year. Asked whether he would say sorry for the offence caused, he replied: I have already said sorry for any offence that I’ve caused, and I say it again. Johnson has not always been willing to apologise for these comments. When Fiona Bruce asked him to apologise for these comments in the BBC Question Time leaders’ special two weeks ago, he refused. But on Friday last week, in a phone-in on LBC, Johnson did issued a generalised apology. Asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative party, he said: I apologise ... Many people who will point out I have said things that have caused offence. Well, I’m deeply sorry for the offence that I caused. Johnson said claims that the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US was as implausible as stories about UFOs. When it was put to him that there was a dossier showing the NHS had been discussed in talks, he replied: And there are photographs that purport to prove there are UFOs. But it is complete nonsense. Asked to give a “rock-solid guarantee” that no part of the NHS would be sold off, Johnson said he could, repeating the words “rock-solid guarantee”. Johnson said he could promise that Brexit would happen on 31 January if he won a majority. On ITV’s This Morning Holly Willoughby asks about crime and safety. A lot of people feel unsafe, she says. Boris Johnson says he massively reduced crime when he was mayor of London. He says that Usman Khan, the London Bridge attacker, had to be released. It is always worth trying to rehabilitate people, he says. But there are some people incapable of changing, and Khan was probably one of them, he says. Q: Does it help for a PM to use terms like bank robber and letterbox to describe women who wear the burqa? Johnson says he has already said sorry for any offence caused, and he says it again. Johnson apologises for any offence caused by his article comparing women wearing burqas to letterboxes. He says it is worth looking at what the article using those words said. He is proud of his Muslim ancestry, he says. He says he will have an inquiry into prejudice and xenophobia of all kinds. Q: You also branded single mothers as irresponsible, and working-class men as feckless, in an article in 1995? Johnson says this is not the time to talk about any offence given by an article written a long time ago. Boris Johnson is giving an interview to ITV’s This Morning. He says he loves the NHS. He can give an absolute guarantee that no part of the NHS will be sold off, he says. Phillip Schofield puts it to him that companies part-owned by Americans already play a big role in providing NHS services. Johnson says this was a process that happened under Labour, when contracts were outsourced. According to the Press Association, the other two Brexit MEPs who are resigning are Lance Forman and Lucy Harris. Forman is an MEP for London and runs a smoked salmon business. And Harris is an MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, and an opera singer. And Press Association also quotes the MEP Annunziata Rees-Mogg explaining her decision to leave the Brexit party. She said: We need a strong leave-supporting government to deliver the Brexit 17.4m voted for. The Conservatives are the only option for Brexit supporters and democrats alike. The defection of four Brexit party MEPs (see 9.47am) still has not been formally announced, but the Brexit party itself has issued a response. It says three of its MEPs are resigning the whip. It says John Longworth already had the whip removed yesterday. In a statement Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said: Whilst we are disappointed that four of our MEPs don’t seem to understand that we both saved the Conservative party from large-scale losses to the Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of England but we are also hammering the Labour leave vote in its traditional heartlands, making it much easier for the Conservatives to win many of those seats. The only vote on the leave side that is currently being split is in areas such as Barnsley, the South Wales Valleys, Doncaster and Hartlepool, where there is a risk that the Tories will split our vote. As proof of his claim that the Brexit party will make it easier for the Tories to win Labour seats in leave-voting areas, Farage cited the Survation poll for the Economist two weeks ago, which shows the Tories on course to win the previously safe Labour seat of Great Grimsby ostensibly because the Labour vote has collapsed by 18 points, which is almost exactly what the Brexit party is polling in the constituency. In the statement, a Brexit party spokesman added: We also note that one of the MEPs is the sister of a cabinet minister, another has a partner who works in the office of the same cabinet minister and yet another is a personal friend of both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. In the case of John Longworth, who was for years the firmest advocate of WTO withdrawal that we have ever met, he underwent a metamorphosis into being a supporter of the new EU treaty following two days of meetings in London. We hope that Mr Longworth is well rewarded for his actions. That means Annunziata Rees-Mogg is expected to defect; her brother Jacob is the leader of the Commons. According to a report by David Wooding for the Sun, four Brexit party MEPs will today announce that they are quitting their party and urging people to vote Conservative instead. One of them is John Longworth, the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce and former Leave Means Leave chairman who yesterday had the whip removed because he had publicly criticised the election strategy being pursued by Nigel Farage, the party leader. In his report, which Brexit party sources are not denying, Wooding says Longworth and his colleagues fear that the Farage strategy could be putting Brexit at risk. He writes: Mr Longworth was unavailable for comment last night but an insider said: ‘We can’t support a party that jeopardises Brexit. ‘Too many people are concerned about their own egos rather than the cause we have all been campaigning for: to leave the EU. ‘It has become increasingly clear that unless the Tories win next week, Brexit is doomed. But some of our team are so wrapped up in their own self-interest they can’t see that.’ Wooding says the split follows weeks of infighting among the Brexit party’s MEPs. The walkout follows weeks of vicious infighting among the Brexit party group in the European parliament. It was described by one as ‘a toxic battle between the old Ukippers and the old Tories’. Tempers became even more frayed in October when the party hierarchy decided to oppose Boris Johnson’s deal – within minutes of it being announced. The Brexit party, which was only properly launched this year, won 29 seats in the European election, making it the biggest single party represented in the European parliament. It triumphed because Theresa May’s failure to pass a Brexit deal, and her decision to accept a Brexit extension, made it hard for Brexiters to vote for the Tories. But at this election the Brexit vote has swung back to the Conservatives, a process that has been encourage by Farage effectively endorsing Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and refusing to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is a link to the Jewish Labour Movement submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry into antisemitism in the Labour party mentioned earlier. (See 7.35am.) A member of the Scottish National party’s conduct committee, who was due to rule on antisemitism allegations against its former candidate in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, has herself resigned from the party after being challenged over alleged antisemitism. Denise Findlay, an SNP activist who tweets as @GraceBrodie, said she had resigned yesterday after SNP officials confronted her over her stance on Israel, shortly before a Channel 4 News report on her tweets. In a tweet saying she had resigned, she said: “There are tweets where I’m arguing that Israel=Nazi should not be part of the definition of anti-semitism.” That tweet no longer appears in her timeline but she later confirmed on Twitter that was the topic. Findlay was a prominent supporter of Neale Hanvey, a former leader of the SNP group on Fife council who was sacked as the party’s candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath late last month after two allegedly antisemitic posts came to light. Hanvey’s membership was also suspended; Findlay had been elected to join the conduct committee which would rule on his membership in October. Hanvey is still contesting the seat, running as an independent, with many local members ignoring Nicola Sturgeon’s demand that they campaign for the SNP in other seats. Findlay has been backing his decision to continue campaigning, and donated to his election crowdfunding appeal. The controversy, which has divided the party in Fife, increases the chances of Labour retaining the seat. It is being defended by Lesley Laird, a Corbyn ally who is Labour’s shadow Scottish secretary. Labour is averaging 18% in the polls in Scotland and, until this split, Hanvey was widely tipped to win the seat. In a statement on Wednesday night, the SNP said: There is no place for antisemitism in Scotland or in the SNP. All political parties have a duty to show leadership, and we will always take tough action in order to reassure the Jewish community that these matters are taken seriously. When challenged on her actions, Denise Findlay resigned from the SNP. The views she expressed are entirely at odds with the ethos of this party. Findlay apologised in a statement to the Courier newspaper in Dundee: When I tweeted about Israel and compared them to Nazis, I did not know that was antisemitic. I am profusely sorry and I now fully understand that what I said was hurtful to the Jewish community. I still believe you should be able to criticise the Israeli government for their actions in Palestine. I am not a politician and was not aware of the IHRA definition. I do know now and realise I made a mistake. I am really sorry. Here’s some reaction to Javid’s remarks on the prospects of a free trade deal by the end of next year. The chancellor has also refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit at the end of next year. Javid was repeatedly asked on the Today programme whether there was a chance of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at the end of 2020. He said the chances of the that were “extremely remote” but dodged several opportunities to rule it out. He claimed that outline of a free trade agreement had already been worked out. He said: By the end of 2020, we will have agreed and finalised the trade deal, a very ambitious, deep, comprehensive free trade agreement. And we will get that done also by the end of 2020. In the time that we’ve been negotiating over the last 100 days or so, it wasn’t just the exit agreement ... we are also negotiated and worked and agreed the outline of the ambitious free trade agreement. There is no a single doubt in my mind that it can be agreed within months, and we can get it through parliament by 2020. Asked what tariffs the car industry would pay under such a deal, Javid said: Because it’s a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, it’s zero tariffs, zero quotas, not just for the car industry, an agreement on services, having equivalents on financial services. We’ve set all this out. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, claims that Boris Johnson could still do that interview with the BBC’s Andrew Neil. Speaking in a round of broadcast interviews on his 50th birthday, Javid told Sky News that “negotiations are still ongoing”. Neil’s head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn created days of negative headlines for Labour over antisemitism and funding for Labour’s spending plans. Corbyn’s team are furious that Johnson appears to be trying to avoid being put under similar scrutiny, insisting they were assured the prime minister had signed up for a similar interview before agreeing to put up their candidate. A lawyer representing the Jewish Labour Movement has accused Labour of not fully investigating all cases of antisemitism within the party. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, James Libson, a partner at the Mishcon de Reya law firm, said he had prepared 70 sworn testimonies from Labour party staffers past and present as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into allegations of antisemitism in the party. Libson, when asked whether the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn’s assertion that every case of antisemitism had been dealt with was incorrect, said: “Very much so.” He added: There are many, many outstanding complaints, many examples of interference and many examples of double-standards in the way in which complaints are processed. Asked whether there was evidence that the Labour leader’s office was “interfering” in the investigations process, Libson said: There has been interference and that interference has unfortunately become institutional. Institutional in the sense that people affiliated with the leader’s office – and now in the actual unit that are investigating – and that at a more basic level, information is passing between the leader’s office and investigating unit. He added: “Passed by USB sticks, by WhatsApp groups, secret WhatsApp groups.” The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said Labour had “toughened up” its approach to tackling antisemitism. He told Today: Having been too slow and too weak at the start, the action being taken now has been toughened up. An in-house lawyer, special appeal panels to deal with complaints, new fast-track expulsion powers that are being used. I’m confident that cases coming in are being dealt with and if they are coming in they will be dealt with.” Healey apologised to the Jewish community who he said “feel let down” by the way Labour has handled cases of antisemitism in the party. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has tried to get Jeremy Corbyn out of a hole with royalists, by suggesting he may watch the Queen’s speech on catchup. Corbyn appeared to be caught out by ITV’s Julie Etchingham when asked whether he watched the Queen’s Christmas broadcast. He said: “It’s on in the morning, usually we have it on some of the time.” The speech is broadcast at 3pm. Challenged about the apparent gaffe, which made the front page of the Daily Express (see below), Rayner told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “That doesn’t mean to say he watches it on Christmas Day. He said he watched it in the morning. He said he also visits a homeless shelter.” Asked whether Corbyn meant he watched the speech on Boxing Day, Rayner said: I don’t know, I’m not with Jeremy Corbyn on Christmas Day. What I’m saying is from my own experience sometimes I watch programmes on catchup, sometimes on the time it’s at. Most kids, including my kids, watch [programmes] on YouTube. So it can be confusing about which times people watch something. You don’t have to watch it at the time that is specified in the TV guide. Asked whether she would be watching the Queen’s speech, Rayner said: “I always do. My kids are named after kings and so I’ve got James and Charles.” What the papers said Joe Biden’s team clearly loved the footage that appeared to show world leaders laughing at Trump. The day ahead Boris Johnson will head to the Midlands, where he will have a tour of a mill shop and inspect some knitwear. Jeremy Corbyn will also be in the Midlands, where he will visit several schools before hosting a rally in the evening. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, will visit a care home in Edinburgh before appearing at a rally alongside colleagues from the Scottish section of the party. It’s Nigel Farage’s turn to face off against Andrew Neil. The interview will be broadcast at 7.30pm. Good morning everyone, it’s a week until election day. After the brief but amusing distraction that was Nato, all attention is back on to the vote and Boris Johnson will resume campaigning today. Johnson survived the summit relatively unscathed. There had been concerns in the Conservative camp that Johnson’s proximity to the US president might be damaging, stoking voter fears that the NHS might be on the table in US-UK trade deals. But the prime minister managed to avoid almost any public meetings with Trump, though he was caught on camera apparently joking about Trump with other world leaders, something Johnson astonishingly has no memory of. After the video of the interaction did the rounds, Trump called Justin Trudeau “two-faced” and then announced he was leaving early and would not be giving a press conference. Don’t miss Marina Hyde’s or John Crace’s take on yesterday’s events. Now that all the Nato shenanigans are out of the way, normal programming can resume. Johnson has launched his plans for the first 100 days after he takes office if he wins on 12 December. He says his main focus would be passing the withdrawal agreement to ensure Brexit happens on 31 January. Other priorities include bringing in legislation to end the automatic release of serious violent and sexual offenders at the halfway point of their sentence – which the family of murdered student Jack Merritt have condemned as a kneejerk politicisation of the London Bridge terror attack – and increasing the amount that new immigrants pay to use the NHS. Labour will be talking about education today as Jeremy Corbyn visits schools, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will pledge to recruit 20,000 more teachers, cap secondary class sizes at 30, and spend £7bn on repairs and upgrades to England’s crumbling school buildings. They will also promise free, healthy breakfasts for all primary-age children as part of a multibillion pound plan to “poverty-proof” England’s schools. OK, thanks for reading along, we’ll be with you all day, so keep hitting that refresh button."

          "bodyText": "Johnson refuses to accept tax burden will rise under Tories Boris Johnson has refused to accept that the overall tax burden would rise under Conservative manifesto plans – despite the fact that the party says so quite openly in its costings documents. He was asked about it after the Conservatives released a briefing saying that a Tory budget in February would “cut taxes for hardworking families”. When reporters put it to him that the overall tax burden was set to rise in the first Tory budget according to CCHQ’s own figures (mostly because a corporation tax cut has been abandoned, and that counts as a tax rise), Johnson claimed not to be aware of this. He told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “We’re cutting taxes on national insurance contributions and on business rates, and I’m certainly not aware of the data you describe. We’re cutting taxes. And in our first budget we propose to do more to cut taxes.” It would have been reasonable to say there is a difference between personal taxes going down and the overall taxes going up. But he did not, and instead he implied the journalists were wrong. Later, the Conservative party had to issue what amounted to a clarification – always a sign that a media appearance has not gone smoothly. PM declines to do pre-election interviews Johnson has refused to commit to doing an interview with Andrew Neil. Asked about this at his Q&amp;A, he did not say he would refuse to do the interview, but he gave the strong impression that it is never going to happen. It later emerged that he won’t do a sit-down interview with ITV’s Julie Etchingham either. Jeremy Corbyn has given interviews to both Neil and Etchingham – although both generated multiple negative headlines, which of course explains why Johnson is evading this level of scrutiny. Brexit party MEPs go rogue Four Brexit party MEPs said they are leaving the party and urged people to vote Conservative. They are Annunziata Rees-Mogg (whose brother Jacob is a Conservative cabinet minister), Lance Forman, Lucy Harris and John Longworth. They worry that by continuing to stand in Tory target seats, Nigel Farage’s party could be helping Labour. In November, Farage said he would not put up candidates in the 317 Tory-held seats because he was worried about a minority Labour government cancelling Brexit, and the rebel “gang of four” argued that backing the Tories everywhere was the logical extension. Farage has rejected this, claiming there are seats where the Brexit party is helping the Tories by standing. Students of Farage’s career will recall that the last party he led, Ukip, also ended up riven by splits. Meanwhile Johnson has insisted he will get a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year – but refused to give a “cast-iron guarantee” to that effect. In an interview on Thursday morning Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit happening at the end of 2020, although he said the prospect was “extremely remote”. Johnson has apologised “for any offence caused” by his article describing Muslim women who wear a face-covering veil as looking like “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s investigation into the issue. Labour’s Jon Ashworth has pulled out of the final pre-election episode of BBC Question Time, after the programme was criticised for featuring an all-male panel.

          "headline": "'Someone has declared war': Brazil activists fear crackdown after arrests",
          "bodyText": "For Brazil’s embattled civil society activists, the government’s distortion of truth has taken many forms since the ultra-right militarist Jair Bolsonaro took power at the beginning of this year. But it has hit a menacing new level after last week’s police raid on an Amazonian NGO and the arrest of four volunteer firefighters who are accused of setting alight the forest they risked their lives to protect. Even by the standards of the past 11 months, the detentions in Alter do Chão, and the confiscation of equipment at the headquarters of Saúde e Alegria, or the Health and Happiness Project, in Santarém have proved shocking for those involved – and those who fear they may be next. Until recently, Brazilian NGOs’ greatest fear was being publicly smeared by a president who has baselessly accused Greenpeace of creating oil slicks, environmentalists of starting forest fires and Leonardo DiCaprio of bankrolling the arson. Now activists worry the powers of the state are being used to criminalise their activities. “The executive has been investing in new tactics of repression,” Camila Marques from the free-speech watchdog Article 19 said during a webinar of NGOs this week. “We have never seen intelligence agencies, police and services so active in monitoring and surveillance of social movements. We are facing a scenario of arbitrary imprisonments.” The case in Santarém is seen as a bellwether. Shortly after dawn last Wednesday, half a dozen federal police armed with semi-automatic weapons showed a warrant and demanded entry to the premises of Health and Happiness Project – a long-established NGO that has worked with Prince Charles, Caritas, Coca-Cola and many other international partners. Staff turned up for work expecting to organise medical assistance, sanitation or solar power for remote forest communities – but instead found state agents examining documents and hauling off computers and files. “I was afraid at first, then angry,” said Jarine Reis, who is responsible for projects related to gender, tourism and traditional art. “I could taste the wrongness in my mouth.” Members of the group felt the raid was politically motivated – and part of a broader assault on civil society by the government of Bolsonaro. “It’s completely unacceptable in a democracy. This show of force is disproportionate. We feel violated and disrespected,” said Paulo Lima, a senior coordinator. “Unfortunately, though, at this moment in Brazil, political polarization is leading to a criminalisation of civil society.” The mood of disbelief and fear grew stronger as news came in that one of Health and Happiness’s chief logistical officers, Gustavo Fernandes, had been arrested, along with three other men. The four had set up their own volunteer fire brigade to help the authorities tackle forest blazes in Alter de Chão, one of Brazil’s beloved resort towns and a mecca for artists and nature lovers. The riverside community is also a heartland of the environmental movement in Brazil. The four men were initially denied bail and their heads were shaved. Families and friends believe they were targeted to reinforce Bolsonaro’s claim in August that environmental activists were responsible for the worst Amazonian fires in a decade – rather than his own government, which has weakened forest protections and encouraged loggers, miners and land grabbers. Bolsonaro and the environment minister, Eduardo Salles, praised the detentions. Civil police said the suspects were under investigation for arson. Local media alleged – without proof – that they started a huge fire in September so they could take photographs for fundraising from the WWF and others. But the fragility of the case was quickly apparent. Federal prosecutors challenged the validity of the investigation, saying they looked into the allegations in September and found nothing to suggest any causal link between the fires and the volunteer brigade. In a public statement, they said the evidence pointed instead to land grabbers and property speculators, who use fire to clear forest and drive up its commercial value. The case was further weakened when the suspects provided alibis that showed they were far from the fires when they started – in one case, on a plane. As doubt grew, the governor of Pará replaced the chief investigator and a judge ruled the men should be released until their court hearing. Friends of the arrested men say all four left jobs in São Paulo so they could live closer to nature in Alter do Chão and work with tourism, permaculture and forest protection. They said the founder, Daniel Gutierrez – a 36-year-old photographer and tourist operator – worked with the authorities, received training from the state fire brigade, and went out of his way to be politically neutral. “Everybody is in shock. Nobody can believe it,” said Priscila Cotta, who has known the men for several years. “Why would those who fight fires start fires? Everyone knows they devote themselves to the forest.” Others, who are reluctant to give their names due to fears of retribution, believe the raid and arrests may be linked to land speculation. Gutierrez was planning to start an organisation that would create a deforestation firewall that would prevent a sprawl of tourist resorts along the bank of the Tapajós River. Members of Health and Happiness – which has no formal links with the volunteer brigade – have not been charged with any crime, but the police confiscation of computers and files has paralysed the group’s operations, including a hospital boat that was due to carry 40 doctors and nurses and 14 tonnes of medicine and equipment to a remote community on the Arapiuns River. Other NGOs warn this could be just the start of a crackdown. With the government planning to tighten restrictions on public protests and relax regulations on the police, the space for civil society looks set to shrink. The Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations said the government was pursuing a strategy to delegitimize civil society. Amnesty International’s executive director in Brazil, Jurema Werneck, said Bolsonaro’s tactics echoed similar moves in Russia, India and Hungary. “The rhetoric of the president and other government officials creates an environment of extreme vulnerability for NGOs, activists and human rights defenders,” she said. Those already in the midst of this assault say they have been living a nightmare. “Each day seems 100 hours long, we never have time for anything, and we feel that someone has declared war on us,” said Caetano Scannavino, a co-founder of the Health and Happiness Project. But he retained faith in Brazil’s institutions to right a wrong, and expressed gratitude for the many people who have given support. “We have received huge solidarity from all sides. They can take our documents, but they cannot take our joy.”"

And we will get that done also by the end of 2020. “In the time that we’ve been negotiating over the last 100 days or so, it wasn’t just the exit agreement ... we have also negotiated and worked and agreed the outline of the ambitious free trade agreement. “There is not a single doubt in my mind that it can be agreed within months, and we can get it through parliament by 2020.” Asked what tariffs the car industry would pay under such a deal, Javid said: “Because it’s a deep, comprehensive free trade agreement, it’s zero tariffs, zero quotas, not just for the car industry, an agreement on services, having equivalents on financial services, we’ve set all this out.” Tory ambitions to pass a tax-cutting, post-Brexit budget within 100 days of taking office have been dismissed by opposition parties, who cast doubt on the feasibility of the timetable. The Liberal Democrats described the plan as “pure fantasy” and accused Boris Johnson of lying to the public. It was put to Javid that Johnson had only managed to secure a new Brexit deal by agreeing to a customs border in the Irish Sea – which had previously been a major red line – but he did not respond to that point. Painting a stark choice between a Tory majority government and a “chaotic” coalition following a hung parliament, the chancellor also restated his party’s key pledges to increase spending on the NHS and schools, recruit more police officers and raise the threshold at which people begin making national insurance contributions. Asked whether he would have written an article comparing veiled Muslim women to letterboxes, as Johnson had, Javid refused to criticise his party’s leader. “I don’t write articles,” he said. “He was a journalist and he’s written lots of articles, as he’s said himself, people can pick one word out or another but what matters is the kind of prime minister he’s going to be.” His comments came a day after it emerged that Johnson had claimed that children of working mothers in low-income families were more likely to “mug you on the street corner”. Javid, a former Deutsche Bank director, was also asked whether the Conservatives were ashamed of rising homelessness under the party. He sought to deflect blame towards Labour, which had claimed government policies had been “directly responsible” for people living and dying on the streets. “I care deeply about the worst off in our society,” Javid told Sky. “Homelessness reached its peak in 2008 under the last Labour government, since then it’s down by almost a half. There’s still a long way to go, we’ve still got work to do, but it’s Labour that was responsible for the massive rise in homelessness.” However, later on Thursday, Javid was roundly criticised and accused of lying by the chair of a leading thinktank. “Javid is lying. The number of people sleeping rough has increased by nearly 300% since the Tories came to power in 2010,” tweeted Tom Kibasi, from the Institute for Public Policy Research. The fact-checking charity Full Fact said in a statement: “This morning on Sky News, Sajid Javid claimed that homelessness had fallen by half following a 2008 peak under Labour. “This does not seem correct. Homelessness in England was about the same in 2017 as in 2008, and has risen since 2010, by the main measure.” The housing charity Shelter also said it was wrong to claim that homelessness had gone down. Javid also restated Tory plans to introduce an Australian-style points-based system for immigration. “We have a right to control our borders and that’s what you’ll get with the Conservatives, is this Australian-type system,” he said. “It will mean we will have immigration, of course we will, and immigration – I say this as a second-generation migrant myself – has benefited our country immensely in so many ways.” • This article was amended on 6 December 2019 to remove an inconsistency in a date reference."

          "headline": "UN refugee agency condemns medevac repeal – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Rightio. Stick a fork in me. Done. The House and the Senate have adjourned. That’s the end of another sitting year. It’s been a rollercoaster. Thankfully, I’ve only been trapped on it for the past week. That’s been more than enough, let me assure you. Loyal readers, thank you so much for sticking with us throughout. Just want to pay tribute to the incredible Amy Remeikis, Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. Feeding this beast is an almighty effort. This week’s blog will have been a window into the steady disintegration of my mind. But it’s only been four days. Amy and co do it all year. Just to recap the day’s events. Angus Taylor decided to double down on his fight with *checks notes* Naomi Wolf, calling for her to apologise for inferring he was antisemitic after he inferred she was at war with Christmas during their Oxford years. Wolf also doubled down, saying Taylor had his facts wrong and was peddling divisive lies about her. The government rammed its union bashing bill through the lower house this morning, gagging debate, and causing outrage all round by not letting the opposition speak on the bill. Anthony Albanese likened it to totalitarianism. Scott Morrison said unions were full of thugs, so who cares. There was continuing fallout to the repeal of medevac. Human rights groups continued to criticise the decision and Labor and the Greens continued to demand an explanation of Jacqui Lambie’s deal with the government. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said her offer of resettlement was still on the table but said Australia had not approached her government for talks in recent days. Morrison announced a raft of machinery of government changes, reducing the number of departments from 18 to 14 and getting rid of five departmental secretaries. The overhaul was criticised for concentrating power and undermining the cabinet system. It also saw the promotion of Andrew Metcalfe, Morrison’s old immigration secretary. Thanks again. Merry Christmas from the blog. Stay safe. The UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has released a statement expressing its disappointment at the repeal of the medevac legislation on Wednesday. It has also urged the government to accept the New Zealand offer to resettle refugees. “Since its commencement earlier this year, the medevac mechanism had proven to be a timely, effective and often life-saving safeguard,” the agency said in a statement. “After more than six years of uncertainty regarding solutions, UNHCR is extremely concerned that the health situation of asylum seekers and refugees will continue to deteriorate. “In the absence of the now repealed medevac mechanisms, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to continue utilising pre-existing legislative processes in a good faith effort to evacuate individuals in need of urgent medical treatment. “As Australia retains responsibility for people forcibly transferred under its offshore arrangements, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to find appropriate solutions including taking up the longstanding offer by New Zealand to resettle refugees and to prevent further harm.” In spillover Senate estimates, jobs department officials have revealed that businesses which take a jobseeker on in a PaTH internship do not need to host for the full four weeks to be paid $1,000 for the placement – only five days. The top five businesses providing PaTH internships are: Yacoub family trust, AHS hospitality, Coles, Woolworths and Hog’s Breath Café. Officials said the employment rate (that is, the proportion of interns who get proper employment at the end of the placement) for those five businesses is 53.8%, compared with 60.8% for all providers offering more than 10 internships. Anthony Albanese gives his version of the love-in speech. He signs it off with: As Naomi Wolf would say, have a lovely Christmas. Better things are happening in the Senate. Trust me. Scott Morrison is summing up the year in the lower house as we reach the end of the sitting year. He thanks the public for returning the Coalition to government and speaks of the great challenges Australians have faced in terms of natural disasters this year. This is the time when everyone pretends to be nice to everyone else. So that we all leave with warm fuzzy feelings in our hearts. Yay. Scott Morrison says to Anthony Albanese: It is also fitting of this time of the year to extend to the leader of the opposition and his family my very best wishes for Christmas and the holiday season. Whether he’ll be watching re-runs of old footy games or I’ll be, who knows. But I do hope he has a wonderful Christmas and New Year period with his family... and a bit of rest. Haha, yeah. Who knows? No one’s watching old footy re-runs. Don’t be ridiculous. Labor’s Mark Butler is pointing out the bizarre nature of Angus Taylor’s statement on Naomi Wolf in parliament today. He tells the ABC: I’m not sure who knows better than her where she was in 1991. Instead Angus Taylor doubled down, he not only said she was there in 1991. He told question time that she’d been there since the mid-1980s until a few years ago. The Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman and the Labor MP Anne Aly are on the ABC. They’re asked whether they think question time today was an edifying display. Spoiler alert: nah, it wasn’t. Zimmerman says it’s the name calling and the heat that people object to. I think question time generally is something most Australians struggle to come to terms with. Aly says it fails at its core objective of actually getting answers. I’m in that category of people who had never watched question time before I came to parliament. I went into my first question time with a pen and paper thinking we were actually going to get answers. Wolf says she had never heard of Taylor before three days ago. I’ve never met this man. I didn’t know who he was until three days ago when I was alerted to these lies about me. Particularly at the time of her book’s release: Respectfully to Mr Taylor, I wasn’t paying attention to him, whoever he is. She’s asked if there’s a stalemate. I didn’t pick this fight, [he] decided to say things about me that are simply and categorically not true. It’s up to him as an elected official to correct the record. Wolf: As a woman, I find it objectionable that I’m having to document my entire life.... he should apologise and more importantly, this is not about me, he should correct the record. She sticks to her guns on the charge of antisemitism. I do think that’s antisemitic. I stand by what I said. She says the comments were clearly religiously divisive and false. Wolf responds to Taylor’s statement that his grandmother is Jewish. I mean, respectfully, I’m glad he comes from such a diverse family. As I said earlier, I have no argument with his family. I do think it was inappropriate to say I was somewhere I wasn’t, doing something I wasn’t doing. She insists she was not in Oxford, despite Angus Taylor’s repeated claim that he remembers meeting her there. She holds up a list of the bookseller list for that year, and it shows her book at No 13. She also refers to a friend who can confirm she was not in Oxford that year. I shouldn’t have to identify where I was. He has said things that are completely, provably wrong. There are multiple eyewitnesses. Naomi Wolf has conducted an interview with the ABC. She said her phone call with Angus Taylor’s office was not “heated”, but was firm. I think that I was firmly requesting a correction because Angus Taylor has made statements about me in very public forums misstating that I was among graduate students at Oxford in 1991 who were campaigning against Christmas. She says a profile in the Australian Financial Review on Taylor, which repeated the claim, is currently being corrected by the newspaper. I wasn’t there in 1991, I was in New York, I had written what many people think is a very important feminist text. I was touring all over the world with it... and I’ve never campaigned against Christmas. She continues: I really object to my name and reputation being misused by an elected official to tell a false story. Wolf responds to Taylor’s attack in parliament today. Taylor asked her to apologise for calling him antisemitic. She says: I have to say I’m quite taken aback by what you’re telling me. I think it’s very inappropriate, and very wrong. The government’s plans to merge the family court have hit a bit of a snag. The proposal to merge the federal and federal circuit courts was condemned by the Law Council of Australia and other legal groups which warned earlier this week that it risked “victims of family violence falling through the cracks”. The Senate has set a reporting date on the legislation by November 2020. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, says this has “effectively put a one-year hold” on the plan. Dreyfus: Mr Porter stunned many in the family court sector in May last year when he announced plans to destroy the family court on the basis of a six-week desktop review by a firm of consultants. Earlier this year, a comprehensive report by the Australian Law Reform Commission – which the government commissioned and is still to respond to – totally contradicted the attorney general by recommending the creation of an entirely new court system and greater specialisation in the family law system. The Morrison government has not responded to that ALRC report. Instead Mr Porter reached agreement with One Nation to hold yet another inquiry into the family law system. Albanese moves on to Angus Taylor. He wonders whether the Naomi Wolf scandal might “get up on TV tonight”. I think it might, I think it might. Because the extraordinary attack on Naomi Wolf, who was in New York, not a roomie, at college in the United Kingdom at the time. At that very year she had the number one bestselling book in the world! Like, this wasn’t someone obscure, and what did he do? He ripped into her. Nothing to see here. She should apologise. To him! to him! Like he’s the victim... and this prime minister keeps running a protection racket for this bloke. It is the witness protection program that this man has. Question time ends. Anthony Albanese leaps up to speak. He says Scott Morrison is acting as though he’s been on a “victory lap” since the election and had won 100% of the vote. We’re not a one-party state, he says. This is a democracy. This is the greatest jackboot administration that we have seen, and today in sacking five departmental heads, what they have also done is centralised power at the centre. Because when you have multiple cabinet ministers with a single department... all power gets centralised to prime minister and cabinet. The fact is that this government regards democracy as an inconvenience, one that can be dismissed at any time. Things are deteriorating here. Lots of anger, lots of bile. Lots of insults followed by withdrawals. Urgh. Pull the plug already. Mark Butler turns the attack to Angus Taylor. He asks a question that mentions allegations Taylor lied about going to Oxford with the US author Naomi Wolf, who Taylor spoke about in the context of students warring on Christmas and wanting to remove a Christmas tree from their common room. Taylor comes out swinging. He reckons he did see Wolf at Oxford, despite her saying she was on the other side of the world at the time. Of course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there. She began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago. Now my speech to the parliament six years ago did not say she was involved in the war on Christmas. I want to say this, her accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations. The fact that the Labor party has attached itself to antisemitic accusations shows just how low they’re prepared to go. The last bit provokes uproar. Anthony Albanese wants him to withdraw the accusation that Labor is antisemitic, which didn’t really make any logical sense. Taylor withdraws. Morrison continues: I understand the leader of the opposition is very angry, Mr Speaker, and he’s angry because the government is standing up for those who don’t want to see thuggery and bullying in their workplace, particularly against women, Mr Speaker. He accuses Labor of attempting to attack his faith, which prompts uproar from Labor. Morrison: That’s what you did, that’s what you did. Tony Burke is furious and says that attack is “very personal” and should be withdrawn. Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, asks Scott Morrison why he doesn’t believe in integrity and accountability, before rattling off a series of examples. The treatment of the union bill this morning, misleading parliament, his phone call over the NSW police investigation into Angus Taylor, why he was sacked as chief executive of Tourism Australia, and why he invited Brian Houston to the White House. The question prompts shouts of “smear”, “smear”, “no policy” and “muckraking” from the government benches. Morrison repeats a line from earlier this week. This is question time, it’s not smear time. Tanya Plibersek asks why Scott Morrison has lied about reducing funding for Tafe. He responds: As the member would know, funding for Tafe is provided by state and territory governments ... so the member can’t come and say things that are simply untrue. Scott Morrison is asked a question on what he is doing to increase the number of nurses in aged care facilities. I will take that matter up, and make sure I get an answer, Mr Speaker. He speaks about the aged care royal commission. It is very distressing what was reported in that report, and as that report reflected this deals with issues that have been endemic that have been in the aged care sector for a very long time and the government is seeking to address the issues in aged care, which are serious and substantial. Morrison says they are increasing the number of aged care places, and reducing the use of chemical restraints and the number of young people ending up in care. A couple of economic questions from Labor. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, asks why we have falling investment, a weakening economy, flat wages and rising unemployment, when the government promised to build a stronger economy. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg: The shadow treasurer referred to investment. I can confirm that under the Coalition that investment outside of the mining sector has increased 34% since we’ve come to office, or over 5% per year. Now under the Labor party, investment outside of the mining sector fell by 10% during their time in office. Heaps of gesticulating for the dixers. Andrew Laming giving it a red hot animated go with his “down, down, Labor debt down” line to Josh Frydenberg. Albanese asks again about the government’s rushing through of the union-busting bill this morning without debate. Why does this prime minister not respect the democratic process? Morrison says the bill was debated extensively last week. This issue, this matter of dealing with thuggish, militant unionism is something the Australian people wanted us to address. We stand up for what we believe in. This matter has been through this place before, it’s been up in the Senate before. It went through some 15 or 16 hours of debate in the other place, Mr Speaker. He continues: I will stand up against thugs, Mr Speaker. The Labor party stands up for thugs. Last day of school vibes going on here. Couple of Labor MPs have been booted, including Joel Fitzgibbon. Michael McCormack leaps up. He’s had a running war with Fitzgibbon all week. Well the average IQ of the chamber just went up, see you Joel, have a nice Christmas mate. Albanese asks the prime minister, Scott Morrison, why he has failed to bring on legislation following the banking royal commission but broke precedents to ram through the union-busting legislation this morning. Morrison said: I introduced the laws that ensured the banking executives who did the wrong thing should be punted forever. That’s what I did, Mr Speaker, and those opposite sought to frustrate it. He said “ugly militant unionism should have no place in this country”. Morrison gets a tough one from his backbenches. Australia is the best country in the world, as we all know, so tell us why you’re so great etc etc. Question time is upon us. Anthony Albanese says the government won’t support freedom of speech, won’t support freedom to protest and now won’t support debate in parliament. He refers to the union-busting legislation that was pushed through the lower house without debate. When the prime minister talks about quiet Australians, doesn’t he actually mean silent Australians? Morrison says: On the night of the election, I thanked all those Australians who go about their lives honestly decently with their aspirations. They’re the Australians our government spoke directly to, Mr Speaker. Morrison says Albanese has spent his political career focussed on the “bubble of this place” and the “tawdry drama of Canberra”. The mystery of the missing bills, by Mike Bowers. OK, I’m calling it. Speech of the week goes to Tim Watts. Hands down. Watts is the Labor MP who last week tweeted about Angus Taylor’s first speech and its references to Naomi Wolf and a plot to remove a Christmas tree from their Oxford common room. The US author has since slammed Taylor’s speech as wildly inaccurate and ethnically divisive. “The response was, well, unexpected,” he says. “It was a cautionary tale straight [from] Aesop’s Fables that summed up the minister’s career to date. You could call it: the boy who cried Wolf.” I’ll let Watts, who read from a mock book of fairy tales, do the rest. Here’s how it goes. Once there was a grasslands boy who wanted to be prime minister. One day for no comprehensible reason, the boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted ‘Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, there’s a Wolf trying to steal Christmas’. But when people looked, there was no wolf. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again ‘a man from Yass, a man from Yass, a man from Yass asked me to protect my grasslands from meddling environmental regulation’. But when the people looked, there was no man from Yass. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again ‘a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor spending millions of dollars on flights’. But when the people looked, there was no junketeering mayor. One day, the boy who wanted to be prime minister was lying in his grasslands when a taskforce Garrad came upon him. The boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted ‘a smear, a smear, a smear’. But when the people looked, there was no smear. One day, the boy who cried Wolf will tell the truth. But well, that bit hasn’t happened here yet. But if you believe in fairy tales, maybe one day it will. Labor is moving a motion saying the government’s attempts to push the union-busting bill through without debate was “anti-democratic”. Better still is this bit of the motion: This is a prime ministerial tantrum, with the prime minister of Australia behaving like a juvenile schoolyard bully just because he didn’t get his way last week. Yeah, dunno, but not sure the government will go for this one. We’re now moving through the votes for the government’s union-busting bill. The Community and Public Sector Union, the main union representing public servants, said the changes announced by the prime minister today will do nothing to enhance service delivery. The union says the major review of the public service, conducted by David Thodey, did not suggest creating new super departments, and instead suggested the opposite. The CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said: It is clear that the prime minister is out of ideas. First he borrowed Services Australia from the NSW government, now super-departments. Moving buildings and merging departments does not fix the service crisis created by his own government. We know that since 2013 18,908 or 11.4% of public service jobs have been cut under successive Liberal governments, causing enormous damage to the capacity of the commonwealth to deliver policy and essential services that all Australians rely upon. This change will not do anything to address the 48 million unanswered calls to DHS in 2017/2018 or the further 5.3 million calls abandoned out of frustration. These are not the actions of a good government. This won’t change the delays in the family court, and it won’t change the challenges our CSIRO face. Rightio. Well, now the speaker has done a bit of digging. And it turns out there were in fact copies of the bills in the House, despite all of that. Speaker Tony Smith says: I’ve been able to ascertain some facts, I realise emotions are running high. I can report that notwithstanding the view ... that there were no bills present. That was not correct. I have checked. There were bills present. I’m not going to have an argument about this. Prior to the ringing of the bells there were 25 copies, Smith says. Another 40 copies were being brought in. More were being printed. Enough for everyone! Mike Bowers captured the government benches as they attempted to gag debate and pass union-busting legislation on the last sitting day of the year. He’s still in the chamber and tells me the clerks and attendants are running around, pointing at to a pile on the desk, and saying they were there all along. Anthony Albanese is responding to that mess in the House as we speak. This is a prime minister who doesn’t want scrutiny from the media, he doesn’t want scrutiny from the parliament either. And we’ve seen this today. Albanese likens the government’s actions to a “totalitarian state”. We have now had the parliament shut down because the government is incapable of running a basic democratic process. Here they run in, they gag debate, they refuse to allow anyone to speak, to push through legislation. To what end? So that they can make a point that even though they lost in the Senate last week, they won in the House today. Right, well, that was a bit of a circus. My head is still spinning. Just to recap: the government sought to move quickly on its union-busing legislation this morning, suspending usual business to get straight to it. then it tried to gag debate in a way Tony Burke described as “unprecedented”. then the vote was called. But the opposition said it had not seen a copy of the bill it was supposed to be voting on. The government said there were copies in the chamber, but Labor insisted it hasn’t seen them. it prompted uproar. Labor are and were outraged. All the while, MPs are unable to stand to speak during the division, so they’re sitting down with pieces of paper or books on their head as a signal they have the call. Speaker Tony Smith considers the issue momentarily. He decides that, yes, people probably should have access to copies of the legislation they are voting on. Fair, I would have thought. He suspends the vote for 15 minutes to get copies. Anthony Albanese has called a press conference. The vote is being called off momentarily so we can all cool our heads. We’ve suspended sitting for about 15 minutes to sort it all out. We’re now stuck in the lower house in a very bizarre situation. Labor are saying they do not have copies of the union-busting legislation they are voting on. The government says it brought 60 copies in yesterday. The speaker, Tony Smith, initially demands legislation be brought in. Then there’s confusion because he receives updated advice saying the copies of the legislation were previously in the chamber. Stay tuned. There’s an interesting development in the Senate. Labor has moved (with government support I gather) to establish a new select committee into foreign interference in democracy through social media. Chris and I (and other colleagues at Guardian Australia) have been very attentive to this fake news/misinformation phenomenon having looked deeply into the death tax campaign on Facebook during the May election. Here’s the meat of the motion that’s about to be moved by the Labor senator Jenny McAllister. (1) That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, be established to inquire into and report on the risk posed to Australia’s democracy by foreign interference through social media, with particular reference to: (a) use of social media for purposes that undermine Australia’s democracy and values, including the spread of misinformation; (b) responses to mitigate the risk posed to Australia’s democracy and values, including by the Australian Government and social media platforms; (c) international policy responses to cyber-enabled foreign interference and misinformation; (d) the extent of compliance with Australian laws; and (e) any related matters. (2) That the committee present its final report on or before the second sitting day of May 2022. This inquiry will be one to watch in the new year. Incidentally, Labor has also asked the JSCEM (the joint parliamentary committee on electoral matters) to look at the role of misinformation on the platforms as part of the inquiry it does every election cycle into the conduct of the last federal election. Strange scenes in the lower house. Members are unable to stand to speak, so are signalling they want the call by placing a book or paper on their head. Drama down in the house. The government is returning its union-busting “ensuring integrity” bill, which was defeated on Friday after a shock last-minute switch by One Nation. The bill is currently before the lower house again. But the Coalition is trying to gag debate. It prompts uproar in the chamber. Labor leader Anthony Albanese says the government is attempting to use gag orders that were never intended to limit debate for partisan or party political reasons. It is my view that the government is using this provision to shut down democratic debate in this parliament and it is an abuse of our democratic processes. Tony Burke says the government’s actions are unprecedented. What is happening right now is a change in the role of this house... as to whether it is a parliamentary debating chamber or whether it is only here for the voice of the prime minister and his chosen ministers. Albanese says Labor is being asked to vote on legislation it hasn’t seen. We are being asked now to vote on legislation which I don’t have, there are no copies anywhere. how can we possibly do that. is it within standing orders for us to be voting on legislation, I don’t know what it is. It is appropriate for us to be voting on this without having copies of it? Reports in the Channel Nine newspapers this morning confirmed the government is pressing ahead with plans to privatise Australia’s visa processing services. The shadow assistant immigration minister, Andrew Giles, was out on the hustings this morning, saying the position leaves 2,000 workers going into Christmas in fear of losing their jobs. This is isn’t good enough we know that this is a terrible idea. We know this because everyone has been saying so. This is an absolutely friendless proposal. Former secretaries of the immigration department have referred to the risks to the integrity of our system, risks also to national security. The Community and Public Sector Union has warned that this could be the new robodebt implemented. And we know what will happen in Australia, because we’ve seen what has happened in the UK with their visa system that has been privatised. We’ve seen massive cuts to services and the creation of a two-tier system, where people who can afford to pay get a fast track system. In Australia we’re not hearing enough about why the government is doing this. The United Firefighters Union was at Parliament House this morning speaking out about the effects of climate change and the extending and intensifying the fire season. From their statement: The United Firefighters Union of Australia passed a unanimous resolution at its national council in Canberra demanding a national approach that would allow firefighting to operate seamlessly across borders, improving the compatibility and capacity of different state and territory services, and boosting the number of professional firefighters. The national council of the UFU passed the resolution calling for an “urgent phase-out of coal, oil, and gas” because they are “driving more dangerous and intense fires”. The UFU national president, Greg McConville, said: Now is absolutely the time to talk about climate change and the ever more intense fires being fought by our members. We are stretched to breaking point. The fire season is longer and more intense than ever. We need to begin work now to boost the nation’s firefighting capacity and make it truly interoperable. Interesting point on the machinery of government changes from Markus Mannheim. Stephen Jones, the shadow assistant treasurer, is on Sky News saying Morrison should accept the New Zealand deal to get children off Manus Island and Nauru. He rejects the government’s insistence that there are no more kids there. Jones urged Morrison to be “pragmatic” and take the NZ deal. The politics of it are toxic and the humanity of it gets left out when the politics gets injected into it. The PM announcing an overhaul of the public service, courtesy of Mike Bowers. The PM’s office has just released a more detailed list of those changes. They will take effect from February. Here’s the full list: The creation of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, which will consolidate the current Department of Education; and the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, which will consolidate: the current Department of Agriculture; and environment functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy. The creation of the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, which will consolidate: the current Department of Industry, Innovation and Science; energy functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy; and small business functions from the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, which will consolidate: the current Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development; and the current Department of Communications and the Arts. The Department known as Services Australia (formerly known as the Department of Human Services) will be established as a new Executive Agency, within the Social Services Department. Just to recap on those machinery of government changes: the education and employment departments are being merged the agriculture department is combining with the environment department energy will be merged with the industry, innovation and science department The communications and arts portfolio is being merged with infrastructure and transport department A few interesting tidbits there. Energy is being decoupled from environment. But emissions reduction stays with energy. Just to reiterate, the PM is proposing no costs savings and no job losses, aside from the five departmental secretaries. Morrison is asked whether the government will consider New Zealand’s offer to take refugees from Manus and Nauru. We’ve always been very aware of the New Zealand government’s offer. The government will continue to implement its policies as we’ve set them out. Scott Morrison says he has full confidence in Angus Taylor. What Angus has done in the past six months to get the big stick legislation through, to ensure the dodgy late payment fees that are charged by energy companies, they’re all gone. The policy performance of Angus Taylor is not under question. Morrison says this is not a “savings measure”. So department secretaries and others will undertake the normal things that they do in managing their budgets. This isn’t about any cost saving measures. I expect frankly all departmental secretaries to be maximising efficiencies. Morrison says there will be no change to ministerial portfolios. I’m very pleased, very pleased, with the performance of all my ministers. Morrison announces we’re losing five departmental secretaries as part of the shake-up. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking to the media. He’s speaking about changes to the public service. The Australian reported this morning that he was “poised to put an axe through the public service today with plans to dramatically cut the number of government departments with another round of mandarins set for the chopping block”. Morrison announces he will reduce the number of government departments from 18 to 14. He says the APS will need to provide services more “efficiently and effectively”. This sounds very much like a standard machinery of government change. Departments being renamed and subsumed into others. You know, the type we do every few years for some reason. Every time this happens, I can only think of all the corporate merchandise that’s suddenly become redundant due to departmental name changes. I’m weird, I know. But what do they do with it all? So many spare pens. We could use them over here at the Guardian, just FYI, if departments are feeling charitable. So far he’s named changes to the education, agriculture, environment and industry portfolios. We’ll have a full list of changes shortly. Morrison says he wants a public service that “is very much focused on implementation”. They [public servants] should expect from us clear direction, and we should continue to expect from them being able to continue to discharge their duties in the incredibly professional way they do. Mick Keelty, the inspector general of the Murray-Darling basin water resources, spoke to ABC radio a little earlier about just what the government has asked him to do. Keelty was tasked with a review of water sharing arrangement amid damaging protests for the Nationals in Canberra this week. He’s asked precisely what he’s actually going to do: In plain speak, whilst there’s been a lot of attention focussed on the Murray-Darling basin plan, what the federal minister David Littleproud was able to broker this week, and to his great credit ... without jumping to a conclusion is what is happening now is the inquiry will actually properly define what the problem is. Is the problem the Murray-Darling basin plan and the operations of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, or is it something deeper than that? Were the plans [the water sharing agreements] developed at a period of time where the inflows, particularly from the northern basin, were actually happening? And of course for the past two years, they haven’t been happening there’s nothing in the northern basin coming through and feeding into the system. Keelty is asked how the protesters, previously furious at Littleproud and the Nationals, came away feeling comfortable with the result. He said the protesters were not promised any additional water as a result of the review. Nobody has promised more water. There is no more water to give under the current rules. That has been exhaustively examined by both the commonwealth and the individuals involved. But there is water around. The prime minister has just called a press conference for 10.30am. Stick with us. On the Murray Darling, Nationals MP Damian Drum is saying the water-sharing agreements between the states are outdated. He hopes the review by Mick Keelty, the Murray-Darling inspector general, will improve them. These agreements have been in place for over 100 years. But the water regime that now exists ... so much of the water used to be used next to the storage, now the users of the water are 400km away from the storage. Drum was out the front of parliament with Barnaby Joyce a little earlier this week, copping an earful from farmers. He says: The Nationals have got to lead the way because people expect us to fix it. they don’t expect the Liberals to fix it, they don’t expect Labor to fix it, and they know the Greens will only make it worse. Greens senator Nick McKim urges the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to pick up the phone and talk to Jacinda Ardern for the “sake of humanity”. In regard to prime minister Morrison, I think he needs to pick up the phone. Make the arrangement with New Zealand. There is no need for him to wait until the US arrangements have concluded. You can walk and chew gum at the same time. I’d urge him to do that for the sake of humanity. Ardern is asked whether New Zealand would consider preventing asylum seekers who go to NZ on resettlement would be prevented from later coming to Australia. She says: If that was a scenario to be created, it would be created by Australia and ultimately it would be in their own domestic policy ... It would be a matter for them. During the interview, Ardern mentions multiple times the deportation of New Zealand citizens from Australia, an issue that has caused much angst across the Tasman. Ardern is asked whether she would want something in return for accepting refugees. She says: That is not how we operate our relationship. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has spoken to Sky News. She said NZ’s offer was still on the table. Yes, that has not changed, but as I say the ball is obviously in Australia’s court. She says Australia has not approached NZ about the deal recently. No discussions at that level and as I say ... as far as I’m concerned we are still in the same status quo. On to other things. Adam Bandt is planning to move to suspend standing orders in the lower house. He wants the house to note that the medevac repeal deal was done in secret. Naomi Wolf is really going after Angus Taylor on this one. I’ll let her tweets do the talking. My colleague Helen Davidson has just filed on further developments in the unlikely stoush between Angus Taylor and the US author Naomi Wolf: Naomi Wolf has reignited her stoush with Australia’s energy minister, Angus Taylor, publishing what she said was a transcript of a phone call with his office. On Thursday morning the US author said she had recorded a call to Taylor’s parliamentary office requesting a “formal correction” to the Hansard record of his maiden speech, asking that Taylor “tell Parliament please that I was not campaigning against Xmas in any way?” Taylor referred to Wolf in his maiden speech to parliament in 2013 while recounting an anecdote about “political correctness” and a dispute over a Christmas tree at Oxford University in 1991, when he was a Rhodes scholar. When Wolf was alerted to the speech on Monday she pointed out that she was not at Oxford in 1991 and accused the minister of “antisemitic dogwhistling”. On Thursday Wolf said Taylor’s staffer had told her that all media who had reported on the story had been given the advice that she was not campaigning against Christmas. “Can I have evidence?” Wolf said. The spokesman responded: “I’m sorry, obviously we can’t prove that has been provided.” The fallout is continuing from the Australian government’s repeal of medevac laws. Australia is now being urged to take New Zealand’s offer to accept 150 refugees from Manus and Nauru a year. We mentioned earlier that there is speculation that Jacqui Lambie was pursuing resettlement when she gave her vote to the government. David Manne, executive director of the Refugee &amp; Immigration Legal Centre, said there was no logic to the government’s refusal to accept the NZ offer. He described suggestions that it would create a “pull” factor for people wanting to come to Australia as “spurious”. “It doesn’t make any rational sense,” he told Sky News. Manne also dismisses the government’s figures showing that most of those who came to Australia through medevac are not in hospital. We’ve reported already that medevac is designed for assessment and healthcare, not just acute hospital care, so it’s not surprising. Manne makes a similar point: When someone is sick, sometimes they’re in hospital, sometimes they’re not. You don’t measure whether someone is in need of healthcare ... by whether they are in hospital. So what exactly are we expecting from today? Well, it’s another day of parliament, so of course we can expect another Angus Taylor controversy. And lo and behold, it’s not yet hit 8.30am, and there’s already something unfolding. Naomi Wolf, the well-known US author, is on the warpath against the minister over his misrepresentation of an alleged encounter they had at Oxford University in their student days. That encounter happened, in Taylor’s telling, at a time when Wolf was on the other side of the ocean. We’ll bring you a bit more about that in a moment. On another Taylor front, there were reports yesterday naming the staffer said to have obtained and distributed the document with dodgy figures about the City of Sydney council’s travel expenditure. Expect more of a pursuit on that from Labor. We’re also anticipating more fallout from the medevac repeal yesterday. The critical question remains: what did Jacqui Lambie secure from the government in exchange for her crucial vote? There’s been some suggestion that she’s won an agreement from the government to pursue the resettlement of refugees from Manus and Nauru. But she’s staying silent on the whole thing, and the government is insisting there is “no secret deal”. The Murray-Darling basin is continuing to cause headaches for the Nationals. The government has announced a review of water sharing in the Murray-Darling. The protesters have left Canberra with a sense of victory. But the question remains: what will the review actually achieve? How will it deliver more water for those without any? Have the Nationals actually resolved the issue? The poor school results out yesterday are still prompting reaction this morning. Tanya Plibersek has been out this morning saying the focus must be on teacher investment, through professional development and mentoring. The government says throwing more money at the problem is not working. There’s another report out this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald about Gladys Liu, reporting that she asked the Liberal party to give her back a donation of at least $100,000. The report claims Liu says the donation she gave was a loan. Happy last sitting day of the year! It’s a momentous occasion. Who knows what else parliament can achieve today? It’s already denied doctor-led medical care to those we’ve condemned to remote islands for daring to seek asylum. Hard to top, even for this bunch, you’d think. But I digress. Alongside the fallout from medevac, there’s plenty of issues on the boil. Angus Taylor. The Murray-Darling basin.The fallout from medevac. Chinese government influence. Stick with us and we’ll get through it all together."

          "headline": "Plastic pollution kills half a million hermit crabs on remote islands",
          "bodyText": "More than half a million hermit crabs have been killed after becoming trapped in plastic debris on two remote island groups, prompting concern that the deaths could be part of a global species decline. The pioneering study found that 508,000 crabs died on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean, along with 61,000 on Henderson Island in the South Pacific. Previous studies have found high levels of plastic pollution at both sites. Researchers from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (Imas) at the University of Tasmania, the Natural History Museum in London, and the community science organisation the Two Hands Project, found one to two crabs per metre squared of beach were being killed by litter. They surveyed sites across four Cocos Islands and Henderson for open plastic containers, with the opening sloped upwards in a way that would prevent the crab from leaving, and counted the number of entrapped crabs in each. They then extrapolated their results across another 15 islands in the Cocos archipelago. The problem is exacerbated as hermit crabs use the odour of recently deceased crabs to track down newly available shells, leading to multiple crabs becoming trapped in the same area – in one instance, 526 crabs were found in a single plastic container. Dr Alex Bond, a senior curator at the Natural History Museum and one of the report’s researchers, said: “The problem is quite insidious really, because it only takes one crab. “Hermit crabs do not have a shell of their own, which means that when one of their compatriots die, they emit a chemical signal that basically says there’s a shell available, attracting more crabs … essentially it is this gruesome chain reaction.” Hermit crabs are an important part of tropical environments as they disperse seeds and aerate and fertilise soil, so their decline could have a significant impact on surrounding ecosystems. The Cocos Islands and Henderson Island are highly polluted, with 414m and 38m pieces of debris respectively, found on their beaches and in nearby vegetation. Bond said the potential for plastics to cause damage on land was under-acknowledged: “In the ocean, it entangles and is ingested by wildlife; on land it acts as a trap, as we’ve seen, but can also be a physical barrier to species moving along the ground.” The Imas researcher Dr Jennifer Lavers, who led the study, said: “These results are shocking but perhaps not surprising, because beaches and the vegetation that fringes them are frequented by a wide range of wildlife. “It is inevitable that these creatures will interact with and be affected by plastic pollution, although ours is one of the first studies to provide quantitative data on such impacts.” The research team say their findings show the need for an urgent investigation into the death rate of hermit crabs worldwide."

          "headline": "The cultural pioneers bringing oral storytelling to the next generation",
          "bodyText": "When Brett Leavy recently showcased his digital renditions of pre-colonial landscapes in Australia, one Aboriginal man in the audience started to cry. “I get tears [from the Indigenous audience] because they feel a sense of loss ... And then there’s also anger,” he says. Leavy is a Kooma man and founder of Brisbane-based Virtual Songlines: a First Nations interactive design agency whose output ranges from video games to virtual reality. “I’m doing this in a fun way – it’s a bit gamefied – but the question I’m asking is: who are the sovereign custodians of the land?” For millennia, Indigenous Australian communities have been passing down histories, knowledge, language and customs, largely through oral storytelling. But in a world of digital addiction, where even the most remote parts of the country are being infiltrated by smartphones, telling stories via screens is the new necessary: a way to both preserve tradition and reach out to the young. And arts organisations are taking note: Indigenous digital storytelling forms a key part of major exhibitions ranging from Linear at Sydney’s Powerhouse Museum – an exploration of Indigenous culture, lineage and storytelling across science, VR, technology and design – to the new permanent exhibition at Acmi in Melbourne, opening in 2020. And for many pioneers in the digital space, harnessing the tools of a new virtual world is a critical way to ensure Indigenous people retain control over their own stories. “There is massive intellectual capital in our community. There is this whole untapped resource,” Mikaela Jade, founder of the Indigenous augmented reality app Indigital Storytelling, said at a talk in Sydney in 2017. “Don’t wait for it to be built and then be given it to us.” Stephen Page, creative director of Indigenous dance company Bangarra, is taking this idea seriously. This week, to celebrate its 30th anniversary, Bangarra will open a free immersive installation, Knowledge Ground: 30 Years of Sixty-Five Thousand, at Carriageworks, Sydney. Visitors will navigate between thematic “worlds” – costumes, artefacts, video, photographs and soundscapes – to explore the history of Bangarra, and the Indigenous concepts of “country, language and kinship” that inspires it. The event will also herald the launch of the company’s new digital archive site of the same name, which contains interviews, photographs, videos and essays about Bangarra’s productions and processes. Both the website and the installation aim to take a deeper dive into the stories behind Bangarra’s dance performances, which have covered everything from the non-fiction Indigenous book Dark Emu to historical Indigenous figures. “It’s in our Indigenous DNA to take oral stories, to pass that on as a way to carry culture,” Page says. “The digital platform is another way to seduce – not even seduce, to inform – the next generation.” Of course simply putting content up online – or placing it on a screen in an art show – does not mean it will automatically make an impact, or find an audience. Torres Strait Islander filmmaker John Harvey, 44, sees this harsh truth every day at home on the Sunshine Coast with his two children, aged four and 13. Kids, he sighs, are brutally honest. If online content doesn’t “feel authentic to them in a way that they can relate to, they will stop straight away. It doesn’t matter if it’s been made by an Indigenous person or not – they will just stop.” Harvey is in the process of creating a work for the new permanent exhibition at ACMI, which opens in Melbourne in May 2020. Inspiration came from seeing the first-ever footage of Indigenous people in Australia: a four-and-a-half minute sequence shot by British zoologist AC Haddon during a Cambridge University expedition to the Torres Strait in 1898. Locals were portrayed as anthropological subjects. In his artwork, Harvey wants to counteract this by filming intimate moments at home. Rather than white rich outsiders holding the camera, he’s using his own phone to capture his own people as he sees them, from the inside. It is, as he says, about “democratisation of stories and storytelling.” “As we have increased our capacity to make [films] cheaper and by ourselves, it gives you more autonomy,” he insists. “In this country we see black men reflected in a particular way and it can often be a negative portrayal. [Smartphones] give the power to people who may not be known.” In the Northern Territory, artists and storytellers are turning to virtual reality. One project developed by senior Anangu women and the Uti Kulintjaku team of ngangkari (healers) – in association with UNSW and the Big Anxiety festival – tells the tjurrkupa, or Anangu story of waumananyi: the song on the wind. In the story, a hunter becomes trapped in a large log, and relies on his two wives to feed him. He oscillates between wanting the women to abandon him and to care for themselves, and wanting them to stay with him. Eventually, a traditional healer breaks open the log. “They are using this story as a way to describe how addiction can trap people, but also how the support of family and healers can set trapped people free,” says Angela Lynch, manager of the Ngangkari program at NPY Women’s Council. The embedded video below gives an idea of the story and its soundtrack – the man sings the inma, the traditional song of this story – but you need the right gear to get the full experience. Virtual reality was not an obvious tool to tell the story. But many of the senior women observed young people “increasingly engaging with screens and technology, and so wanted to capture their attention and interest,” Lynch says. “They strongly believe that traditional culture and Anangu law holds the answers to the issues and problems of contemporary life in remote communities.” Digital storytelling, however, has its challenges. Harvey – who is filming his own family for the Acmi project – warns screens can become a burden, or an invasion of privacy: “By filming something on your phone and sharing that online, you have to realise that you are then sharing that with a much broader audience than you might have thought about. Communities have to be aware of that and what it means.” “You go to a rock concert and they will say: ‘No cameras. [The experience] is just for the people here.’ Do we do that in our communities?” he asks. But Leavy wants his Virtual Songlines to reach as wide an audience as possible. Many of his projects enable visitors to enact a cultural survival game; others involve a knowledge-based quest. That little bit of competition, he believes, keeps interest piqued, creating a far wider appeal than historical texts or paintings. It has worked. When Leavy presented a showcase at Customs House in Circular Quay in 2011, the City of Sydney council recorded visitor numbers in excess of 300,000. And this January, Virtual Songlines will showcase Virtual Warrane 1788 – a VR experience of Sydney Cove prior to the arrival of the First Fleet. As Leavy puts it: “We’re really trying to time travel. We’ve got a big story to tell.” Knowledge Ground: 30 Years of Sixty Five Thousand is open at Carriageworks, Sydney, until December 14; Indigital Storytelling can be downloaded from the Apple store; Virtual Songlines’ Virtual Warrane 1788 will show at the Overseas Passenger Terminal in Sydney on 26 January"

          "headline": "No Time to Die trailer review: Bond baddie channels your granny in 1987",
          "bodyText": "The trailer for the new James Bond film, No Time to Die, has arrived, and not a moment too soon. There is a weird lack of excitement about the instalment arriving next April, partly down to how immensely boring Spectre was, and partly down to Daniel Craig’s reluctance to ever star in a James Bond film ever again. If even 007 doesn’t want to be 007 any more, we’re all in for trouble. So the No Time to Die trailer is the Bond franchise’s big chance to show that it can still compete. In a world where people only watch Disney movies, how are we going to cope with the further adventures of a posh British drunk with a limp? There’s only one thing to do: dive into the trailer. Let’s start with the good news: the No Time to Die trailer opens with Craig doing more acting than he has in the last three Bond films combined. Look at his face – that’s anger, an identifiable emotion. Better yet, he’s in the car having an argument with Léa Seydoux. This is perfect news for anyone who’s ever wished they were the children trapped in James Bond and Madeleine Swann’s loveless marriage. However, that first shot appears to be nothing more than sizzle. Now we’re treated to what seems to be the opening scene of the film itself. “Where’s 007?” asks M impatiently, before we cut to the most incredible and remote lake-house known to man. What an idyllic holiday spot for Bond – no wonder he isn’t answering the call any more. He must be having the time of his life. No, as it turns out, James Bond hates lakes. You wouldn’t think it was possible for someone to hate lakes as much as he does, but here we are. It’s a shame this will be Daniel Craig’s final outing as 007, because there goes my brilliant idea to give Bond 26 the title Lakepuncher. “The world’s moved on, Commander Bond” says Lashana Lynch. She’s the newest 00 on the block, and she means business. Yes, every Bond girl for the last 50 years has said something along the lines of “The world has moved on” to demonstrate the franchise’s understanding of social progressiveness. And, yes, James Bond has almost exclusively responded to this by aggressively skirting the lines of sexual consent with them in the very next scene. She’ll be fine, this one. She’ll definitely be fine. Hey, it’s Christoph Waltz! You forgot he was a Bond baddie, didn’t you? Well here he is again, only horribly disfigured to prove that he’s evil. He’s here to tell James Bond that Dr Madeleine Swann has a secret. This is why Bond was so angry at her in the car. He left the service for her, and she broke his heart. Here we are in the middle of the heartbreak, as Bond slowly realises he junked his entire career for a woman who actually wanted to go on holiday to wherever they shot Mamma Mia. We still haven’t met the Big Bad for this film yet, have we? Here’s a hint: he wears too much makeup and he’s apparently hiding behind the front door that your granny had in 1987. Just kidding, here he is. It’s Rami Malek from Mr Robot, dressed in the anorak that your granny had in 1987. He’s definitely the baddie, by the way. You can tell by how horribly disfigured he is. Remember kids, facial disfigurement means evil. It always means evil. Finally, here’s Bond being shot at in a car for no reason. I hate that I’m excited about this stupid film."

          "headline": "So Long, My Son review – exquisite, agonising Chinese family saga",
          "bodyText": "Wang Xiaoshuai navigates an ocean of sadness in this film. It can finally be watched only through a blur of tears and with a terrible, futile need to reach into the screen and hug the two ageing lead characters. So Long, My Son is an epic generational drama of two families in China, from the 1980s to the present day; directed and shot with clarity and calm, audaciously structured in terms of flashback and flashforward – and acted superbly. There is also touch of melodrama in it, if such a thing can be said to exist in the unshowy walking pace of Wang’s storytelling style, with some influences from classic Japanese family drama perhaps, and gestures of soap-operatic melancholy, largely in the repeated (and unexpected) use of the plaintive tune Auld Lang Syne. This is a film that doesn’t signpost its relevant facts very emphatically and you have to stay alert for shifts in the timeline, and for important details that are only revealed later. But, once you have mentally readjusted away from traditional linear expectations, this movie opens up like a flower. It is about the terrible burden of grief, rage and guilt, and the greater burden of forgiveness; it is also about an emotional wound that only gets worse with the years. That wound has been inflicted on two levels: by the ordinary, arbitrary heartbreak of life and by the malign agencies of the Chinese state, with its draconian one-child policy to control population and boost economic growth, begun in the late 70s and not completely abandoned until 2015. Liyun (Yong Mei) and Yaojun (Wang Jingchun) are an obedient, hardworking married couple in the big city with an eight-year-old boy Xingxing. Their best friends are fellow factory hands Haiyan (Liya Ai) and her husband, who have an eight-year-old son of their own, Haohao; their kids are best friends. But, when Liyun gets pregnant with an (illicit) second child, she discovers just how much of an apparatchik party-zealot her friend and neighbour Haiyan actually is. She reports Liyun to the authorities and gets her dragged off to the hospital for an abortion she doesn’t want, while Yaojun impotently rages at the government and at himself for failing to stand up for Liyun. And then Haohao boisterously chivvies and bullies Xingxing into going swimming at a dangerous reservoir with the other, wilder neighbourhood kids, despite Xingxing’s timid complaints that he can’t swim. The catastrophic result (all the more painful for never being explicitly shown) inflicts a crippling psychic blow to all four adults and to Haohao, who is to grow up with a need to go into the medical profession and save lives. As the new millennium dawns, fate provides a new twist to the suppressed guilt suffered by Haiyan and her family by making them wealthy in the new Chinese world of adventure. Meanwhile, wretched, lonely Liyun and Yaojun move away, to a remote coastal town where they adopt a boy, Xing (Roy Wang), who senses that he is second-best and becomes a tearaway delinquent, breaking his adoptive parents’ already shattered hearts. Moreover, Haohao’s glamorous aunt Moli (Xi Qi) forms a tendresse for Yaojun, which creates its own refinement of pain. At the centre of the film are the wonderfully compassionate and tender performances from Yong Mei and Wang Jingchun as the ageing, lonely pair whose unexpressed agony, by the end of this film, feels unbearably intimate. For me, the tragedy of their relationship is revealed in the closing act when they return to their hometown, grey old little country mice that they now are, silently goggling at all the glitzy new buildings and video ad hoardings – signs of that commercial triumph that the one-child policy was there to deliver. Yaojun appears to wave cheerily at something outside the car. It turns out to be a statue of Mao waving, almost dwarfed amid the steel and glass, and Yaojun turns his placid smile at his wife as if to explain: that is what I was waving back to, you see? Isn’t it silly? And how absurd to shed a tear now after all this time? Apart from everything else, this film reveals a terrible, simple truth: those who have endured the terrible agony of losing a child are not a separate tribe (that is: separate from the luckier ones) destined or earmarked for tragedy from the beginning. Neither are they people who have endured this blow in return for the expectation of some mysterious compensatory gift from the cosmos. Their fate is arbitrary and they are just like us; our current happiness used to be theirs. So Long, My Son is a piercingly, profoundly moving picture that peels and exposes the senses. • So Long, My Son is released in the UK on 6 December."

          "bodyText": "An ophthalmologists group has hit back at claims the organisation at the centre of an internal complaint in the office of the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, charged double the market rate for its services. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Australian Society of Ophthalmologists said it was “extremely proud” to be associated with the Indigenous and Remote Eye Health Service (Iris), which was treating blinding eye disease among the most disadvantaged populations in Australia. Wyatt has also defended the $2.2m contract, which was awarded without a tender process to an organisation linked to the former Liberal candidate Bill Glasson. The contract became the subject of an internal complaint, according to Tuesday’s report in the Sydney Morning Herald. Dr Ashish Agar, vice-president of the ASO, said the organisation asked eye surgeons to take time away from their city practice to operate on Indigenous Australians in the remotest locations. “It is hard work, difficult surgery on complex cataracts, and most city surgeons are not willing to commit to such time in these difficult conditions,” Agar said. He said it was “utterly incorrect” for the report to state that the $4,000 fee was double the going rate. He said that fee referred to the whole service provided, including pre-operative clinic and post-operative care, consumables and operative eye fluids, intra-ocular lens implant, medical and nursing team and a concessional surgeon fee. The figure also covered the cost of air transport for people and equipment, staff accommodation and meals for up to a week, a charter plane for very remote locations or other transport to pick up Indigenous patients from remote settlements and bring them into town, and a team trained in cultural sensitivity onsite up to a week before surgery to locate, prepare and care for patients. “By comparison, the NSW government statewide cost price for cataract surgery used in NSW public hospital budgets is $4,823.” Agar said. The president of the ASO, Peter Sumich, also defended the directors of Iris, Bill Glasson and Kerry Gallagher. Glasson, who ran as the Liberal candidate against Kevin Rudd at the 2013 federal election, was a director of Iris between 2016 and 2019, along with Gallagher, a lobbyist. “Dr Bill Glasson AO is a respected peer leader and has for decades performed cataract surgery from Longreach to Birdsville and in other Indigenous communities. His reputation is totally beyond reproach,” Sumich said. “Mr Kerry Gallagher, AM likewise, is a distinguished war veteran who has dedicated much of his time to running Iris at very little personal benefit. Dragging these two upstanding Australians into what is essentially a politicised employment dispute within Minister Wyatt’s office is deplorable,” Sumich said. The ASO said the Iris program was started in 2009 by the Rudd Labor government and had been supported by both sides of politics since then."

          "bodyText": "I read Jane Harper’s The Lost Man (Little, Brown) in February, the height of Australia’s summer but the depths of the English winter. The central image at the heart of the novel, of a man who has perished in the punishing heat of Australia’s outback, hours from anywhere, has stayed with me ever since. Just as good – perhaps even better – than Harper’s excellent thrillers The Dry and Force of Nature, this follows a small cast in a vast, terrifyingly empty setting, as the dead man’s eldest brother tries to determine whether his sibling deliberately walked out to his death or if a malign third party was involved. Aussie noir – or as it has also been dubbed, “bush noir” – is my new favourite genre, and if you like Harper, try Chris Hammer’s Scrublands (Wildfire), in which a community permanently threatened by bush fires tries to understand why its young priest turned a gun on his congregation. Continuing the theme of thrillers that pit protagonists against the implacable dangers of the natural world, but shifting the action to the Maskwa River in northern Canada, is Peter Heller’s The River (W&amp;N). The novel follows two students who take the summer off to canoe the remote waterway, only to find themselves trying to outrun a forest fire – “they didn’t say a word but the silence of it and the way it seemed to breathe scared them to the bone” – as a man they think is a killer follows in their tracks. The prose is glorious, Heller’s evocation of the natural surroundings stunning, but, most important, the tension is razor-sharp. Adrian McKinty’s The Chain (Orion) is an ingenious realisation of a horrible premise. When Rachel’s teenage daughter Kylie is kidnapped, the only way to get her back is to kidnap another child, with her victim’s parents then forced to abduct their own hostage. “That’s how The Chain works and goes on for ever.” McKinty explores what parents will do when a child is in danger, forcing the reader to ask at every turn just how far they’d go themselves. It’s impossible to put down until you reach the denouement, nails bitten to the quick and eyes wide in horror. Denise Mina is always brilliant, but Conviction (Harvill Secker) is, I think, her best yet – joyously dark, comic, loads of fun. The main character, Anna, is devastated when her husband announces one morning that he is leaving her for her best friend, and taking the kids too. Anna’s reaction? She gets stuck into a true crime podcast – wouldn’t we all? – and becomes obsessed with the fact that she used to know one of the victims. So begins a wild and wonderful journey to the truth at the heart of the podcast, and at the heart of the lies on which Anna has built her family life. Months after reading it, I remain obsessed with Michelle Paver’s Wakenhyrst (Head of Zeus), set in Suffolk in the early 1900s and featuring a historian, Edmund Stearne, who slaughtered “the first person he came across in the most bizarre and horrible way”. There are many layers to this thriller: did Stearne really awaken an ancient evil when he found a painted devil in the local churchyard? What is the medieval mystic Margery Kempe’s role in the affair? And what will Stearne’s daughter, Maud, a lonely child growing up between superstition and religion amid the glorious fens, that “last stretch of the ancient marshes that once drowned the whole of East Anglia”, discover about her father? Spooky, twisted and unforgettable. • To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over £15"

          "bodyText": "Many Christmases ago, I campaigned successfully for a Super Scope: a shoulder-mounted ersatz missile launcher to plug into my Super Nintendo. It was approximately 15ft long and in retrospect had no good games designed for it. The Scope wound up the way of all console peripherals: propped in the corner of the lounge, useless, like a piece of pipe a plumber had forgotten to clear away. Until we had guests and my parents implored me to keep my bazooka in the bedroom. I still think about it, so was intrigued when I saw a new Nintendo console and peripheral on the market. This one targets the fitness crowd and I can justify playing it as part of what I insist on calling my job. The Ring-Con looks like a steering wheel in search of a car and wants to get you moving. It is the controlling device for Ring Fit Adventure (£69.99), a first-person platform game on the Nintendo Switch. The company has previous in attempting to fuse these natural enemies, exercise and video games. Wii Fit on Nintendo Wii was plasticky and unsatisfying, and came with a weird balance board to lean on that never got you fit at all. Still, the company shifted a gajillion copies – a commercial miracle it will be hoping to repeat with Ring Fit. The Switch itself is heavy and handsomely built, with two dinky, removable controllers. I slot one into the handheld wheel and place the other into a holster as directed, strapping it to the front of my thigh. It will measure how high I lift my knees when jogging and how low I drop a squat (all the way to the floor, baby, for a quick nap). I turn it on and I am confronted by an endless boardwalk that needs running down, apparently. Hmm. Yet considering we’re talking about a pilates ring and a remote control stuck to my leg, I’m surprised at how expansive the possibilities are. You control the character onscreen by running in place and squeezing the ring in and out to hoover up coins, bust open crates and leap chasms. You can shoot weaponised air puffs, too. Are these farts? Probably not, although I am exerting myself a lot. There are about 100 levels, over 20 different worlds, and attack moves based on knee lifts, ab crunches and the like. I’m getting a full, hard workout, which I didn’t expect and don’t look good doing. Is there anything less attractive than a grown man playing computer games in the afternoon while heavily sweating? There are addictive little standalone games included: air go-karting, being a human pinball or parachute, or the most bizarre of all, sculpting a clay pot via chair poses. Squatty pottery aside, where I anticipated gimmickry and tedium, the main game provides a legitimate, varied workout and complex gameplay. I was feeling fairly positive about its health potential until I invited my genuinely fit friend Chris to give the game a go. It’s hypnotic to watch, an athletic man tippy-tapping the carpet on besocked toes, trying to trick the computer into thinking he is running quickly. He looked like a cartoon raccoon stealing a custard bun. Thanks to the eagle-eyed thigh sensor, he wasn’t getting away with it, either. It was a vision of the ridiculous, which led me to understand there is little dignity to be had playing this game. Also, after playing Ring Fit for several days, I realised that I had been missing fresh air. I don’t really want a “fun workout”. I don’t want any workout at all. I’m too lazy and proud for Ring Fit. And I don’t think hardcore gymnasium-rabbits will be replacing their daily reps with this childish game, either. But, for the casually fitness-interested, it’s probably the most exciting way to get into resistance training. Whether you’re inclined to log on or jog on, Nintendo deserves respect for that. For a more epic adventure The Switch’s screen is small, so this workout would be intensified if enlarged on a TV. I recently got rid of mine, in an attempt to restore my pre-digital personality. Turns out I was never that interesting. And I can’t watch Friends any more. Wellness or hellness? One ring to rule the mall. 4/5"

          "bodyText": "Elsewhere, by Rosita Boland Doubleday Ireland, £8.99 It’s not entirely a travelogue nor is it a memoir. Rather, it’s the point where the two intersect, and that for me is the essence of enlightening travel. How exactly does meeting new people and seeing new places affect you, change your attitudes and increase your self-knowledge? Sometimes it’s faraway and exotic travel (in New Zealand: “it fascinated me that people had Antarctica as a word in their ordinary, everyday lexicon.”) and sometimes it’s time spent for work in a city nearer home. Boland is an observant and thoughtful traveller, who is also grateful for and aware of what her own “home roots” have given her. Over several years as an enthusiastic amateur traveller, I’ve tried to keep a journal of experiences and journeys. Boland’s determination to write diaries and notes, instead of taking hundreds of photographs, resonates with me. Do I ever look back at old holiday photos? Rarely. But I get pleasure from re-reading my own notebooks. I’d say to anyone who likes to travel, please read this book and start “noticing” your own journeys – even if you can’t be persuaded to put down your phone and write notes! Chosen by Linda Murray, owner, Books Paper Scissors, Belfast Between Stone and Sky, by Whitney Brown Constable, £9.99 This beautiful memoir really got under my skin. At 26, Brown is studying for an MA in the US and thinks her career path is mapped out – until chance brings drystone waller “Jack” from Wales to Washington DC. Fascinated by his craft, she accepts an invitation to visit his home in Wales. Mere months later, she is working alongside him. Delighting in the physicality of the job and the shifting beauty of the Welsh countryside, Brown discovers that she doesn’t need to be on native soil to feel a sense of homecoming. She deftly sketches the local topography by listing the gear changes required to navigate its valleys, revels in the local language and discovers the joy of elevenses. Her quest to build a life from her craft takes her to Italy, North Carolina, Virginia’s Blue Ridge mountains, and back to rural Wales. Her evocation of place is pitch-perfect, from mist-shrouded hillsides to the “gorgeous throb” of the thick summer air of North Carolina. This is a tale of finding harmony between body and soul, between the heft of stone, the inspiration of good friends and the joy of travel. Jenny Tattersall, bookseller, Cogito Books, Hexham Footnotes: A Journey Round Britain in the Company of Great Writers, by Peter Fiennes Oneworld, £16.99 Jostling to the front of a rather crowded pack of recent nature writers, Fiennes’ 2017 Oak and Ash and Thorn was justly revered for its lyrical prose and literary bedrock. Honing his easy-going and often witty style in this new book, Fiennes takes us on journeys of writers from 12th-century cleric Giraldus Cambrensis to Beryl Bainbridge, by way of Enid Blyton and Charles Dickens. Though literary travelogues aren’t a wholly novel genre, there’s an infectious enthusiasm and self-deprecating authority to Fiennes’s insights and he’s a most agreeable companion. Recounting a visit to a Welsh barber, he talks of “my scalp being kneaded and delicately teased by an early middle-aged, handsomely coiffed blond man from Neath”. Likewise, there’s a neat line about the invention of the footnote, in a footnote. There will be many nature titles vying for a place on Christmas lists this year, and no doubt a cornucopia of literary anthologies and travelogues to boot. This one should be towards the top. Tim Batcup, owner, Cover to Cover, Mumbles, Swansea Travellers in the Third Reich: the Rise of Fascism through the Eyes of Everyday People, by Julia Boyd Elliott &amp; Thompson, £10.99 In the 1930s, Germany was the most popular tourist destination in Europe. Yet few travel books were written about it at the time. Julia Boyd has tracked down those accounts and, together with descriptions from private letters and diaries and from public archives, produced a fresh view of between- the-wars Germany. This is land of friendly people, beautiful countryside, vineyards, forests, medieval villages and impressive culture. A female journalist notes how a woman could do what she liked in Weimar Germany. A New Zealand Rhodes Scholar writes of “the emergence of a new type of person, sunburnt, wearing sensible clothes and of splendid physique”. Other accounts, especially those from journalists, politicians and diplomats, convey a sense of unease, of menace. Chilling stuff. This book will earn a permanent place on people’s bookshelves, rather than being shipped out to a charity shop to make room for next year’s batch. The hardback, already out of print, is becoming scarce with secondhand copies for sale on Amazon at almost twice the original price. Evelyn Westwood, co-owner, Westwood Books, Sedbergh, Cumbria Love of Country: A Hebridean Journey, by Madeleine Bunting Granta, £9.99 The first thing to say, and this is important in the book world, is that it has a terrific cover. The second is that old classic of it just being “a good read”. Bunting writes evocatively about the Hebrides and, for the most part, gets the details and description right. The best thing about it is that it made me want to revisit the islands I know, as well as visit the ones I haven’t been to yet. The book has a lovely balance of autobiography, literary references, history, politics, religion and culture. I opened the shop in September 2018 – this is my retirement project – and though we don’t carry many new books (we focus on secondhand), I’ve had to restock this a number of times because it’s so popular. Ruth Anderson, owner, Well-Read Books of Wigtown, Dumfries and Galloway This Tilting World, by Colette Fellous Les Fugitives, £13 Translated from French by Sophie Lewis, this beautifully elusive book mixes biography, travel memoir, fiction, essay and journalism to weave a lyrical account of identity and its ambiguity. Fellous’ writing carries an innate intelligence that never feels contrived. With it she observes the rituals and language that fabricate an identity, focusing on what happens when these things dissolve or become fragmented. It is punctuated with photos taken on a phone and infused with poetic descriptions of Tunisia, Paris and Normandy, among other places that the author has passed through and allowed to pass through her. This piece of autofiction has a strange and perfectly balanced duality of softness and seriousness. The text is melancholic and nostalgic, but also urgent and of its time. Perhaps it is the value of living within such paradoxes that I took from this novel, memoir, text – whatever it is. Callum Churchill, store manager, Stanfords, Bristol Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands, by Judith Schalansky Penguin, £16.99 My favourite travel book is As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning by Laurie Lee. It’s beautifully written and filled with adventure and hope, though Robert Louis Stevenson’s Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes is also high on my list. His language is surprisingly modern for a Victorian and we discover he invented the sleeping bag! I know a lot of the travel writing stuff I like is rather old, so how about, for gift-giving, Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands: Fifty Islands I Have Not Visited and Never Will by Judith Schalansky. It’s a gorgeous wee book and the perfect thing to browse through in a spare hour. Tom Hodges, owner, Typewronger Books, Edinburgh Waymaking: An Anthology of Women’s Adventure Writing, Poetry and Art, edited by Helen Mort, Claire Carter, Heather Dawe and Camilla Barnard Vertebrate Publishing, £17.99 This is a collection of musings, poems and illustrations from a wide range of women worldwide, all of whom share a great passion for the outdoors, adventure and the wild. Their pieces will transport you on incredible journeys from the majesty of the Cairngorms through to the glacial domes of southern Chile, from capturing underwater photographs in Fiji to shivering through a blizzard in Canada’s Baffin Island. These amazing, intrepid women have captured the beauties of our world through their pens, brushes and lenses. The elegantly designed book includes both colour and black-and-white artwork to accompany the text. Enlightening and hugely inspirational, this is a book to treasure. Cate Simmons, bookseller, News from Nowhere, Liverpool Ghostland: In Search of a Haunted Country, by Edward Parnell William Collins, £9.99 After a family tragedy, this author turned for comfort to British literature, particularly literature that involved ghost stories. This inspired him to travel to haunted places mentioned in stories and, in turn, be inspired by them. Ruins, fens, seaside, forests and waters all have mysteries and ghosts. Folklore and natural history come to life as Parnell travels the country in search of the mystery, loneliness and strangeness the British countryside has to offer – if you know where to look. This is a wonderfully evocative book, creating a sense of place and invoking the power of literature and nature. Adam, bookseller, Hewson Books at The Kew Bookshop, Kew The World, by Michael Poliza teNeues, £225 Michael Poliza’s new book is, for me, this year’s outstanding travel book. Four hundred pages of beautifully detailed photography are an eloquent answer to the notion that the coffee-table book has no place in an Instagram world. The book is physically huge, and the photography – of landscapes, people and animals – is so good that the effect is truly immersive. The sense is always of a traveller making personal discoveries – a beach where swimmers share the pristine water with sharks, or a stunning azure ice cave. Manmade vistas and patterns attract Poliza too - in his hands a car park becomes a beautiful pattern, and a ring of Vietnamese fishing boats exquisite. Poliza, who made his name photographing Africa, has created a dazzling testament to a disappearing world. At £225 for a limited edition, £265 signed, The World is not cheap – but it is very special indeed. Brett Wolstencroft, manager, Daunt Books, London Looking for a holiday with a difference?

          "bodyText": "Lilawati Awasthi is used to the risks that come from living in a remote mountainous district in the far west of Nepal. Floods, landslides and treacherous roads are a part of daily life. But this year she faced a new hazard: mosquitoes carrying a mystery illness. When she began to feel sick in September she was not overly concerned at first. “I thought it was a simple fever, but it wouldn’t go away,” says the 50-year-old. “We went to the hospital and it turned out I was suffering from dengue.” Awasthi is one of more than 14,000 Nepalis who have been diagnosed with dengue fever since May, in an unprecedented outbreak that has left health professionals and the government reeling. Some experts believe the actual number of infections to be closer to 140,000. Six people have died. Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection with symptoms similar to severe flu, first appeared in Nepal in 2004. Minor outbreaks have occurred periodically, largely restricted to the country’s tropical southern plains and some urban areas. This year’s outbreak has been remarkable both in its scale and reach. Dengue has been found in 67 of Nepal’s 77 districts, including those at higher elevations, a trend experts say is linked to the climate crisis. “The role of climate change in poor countries where the health system is not robust is very big,” says Meghnath Dhimal, chief research officer at the Nepal Health Research Council. “There has been a rapid geographical expansion of dengue, especially from the lowland to the highland.” Almost 2,000 cases have been recorded in the Kathmandu Valley, which at 1,400 metres sits higher than Britain’s tallest peak, Ben Nevis. A combination of factors are behind this year’s outbreak: prolonged and heavy monsoon rains and rising temperatures, alongside rapid urbanisation and population movement. Road expansion has created opportunities for the virus to move to higher altitudes, spread by infected people and mosquitoes carried in vehicles. Once mosquitoes reach higher elevations where they would normally perish, rising temperatures enable them to survive, says Dhimal. “We have found that mosquitoes are now able to establish a population at up to 2,000 metres.” Awasthi is the first person to contract dengue in her village, says her husband, Ram Dutta. “It really worries me that new diseases like dengue are becoming common. This area is getting hotter each year. There used to be very few mosquitoes before, but they are becoming common these days.” The growth of dengue in Nepal follows a global trend that has seen the number of infections grow rapidly to an estimated 390m a year, according to the World Health Organization. The UN body says about half the world’s population is now at risk. At the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease hospital in Kathmandu, the director, Basu Dev Pandey, is worried about the future. “It could be a disaster. During the peak of this year’s outbreak it was so difficult: 10,000 people came to the hospital. There was dengue-phobia.” Pandey says the number of recorded cases in Nepal this year is a “gross underestimate” because the symptoms of dengue are similar to a typical fever. “Many people just visit the local pharmacy for treatment, and in Kathmandu the majority of patients go to private hospitals, whose data is not included in the government’s statistics.” At the height of the outbreak the hospital was overrun with patients. “People were lying on the ground all over the place. They just collapsed on the spot,” says Lal Bahadur Waiba, who works in the outpatient department. “The crowd was so big we had to open at 7am and set up stalls on the street outside.” Waiba and 13 other hospital staff contracted dengue themselves. “You get headaches, pain in the back and joints, nausea. The pain is intolerable,” he says. At the same time, mass migration to urban areas has resulted in overcrowded cities with poor infrastructure and haphazard waste management. A weak health system and a lack of public awareness combine to create the conditions where dengue can thrive. Without access to piped water, many urban dwellers get their water from communal pumps and store it in buckets indoors, which makes an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. “Even a discarded noodle packet can hold enough rainwater for the larvae to breed,” says Pandey. A huge public awareness programme is needed, says Dhimal. “There may be a big outbreak in the future. The message is clear, we have to start right now.”"

          "bodyText": "Otherwise, I suppose that’s us. New Zealand win 1-0, so congratulations to an excellent and likeable team. However the combination of flat, slow pitches, along with the Kookaburra ball, made for a relatively dull series between two teams who should be anything but that – and that was a shame. Still, cricket is better than no cricket and we’ll be back extremely soon for the SA series. Thanks for your company and comments over the last fortnight or so – ta-ra! Here’s Ali Martin’s report... Finally, he thinks a lot has been learnt about the group. Ideally, that would’ve happened in the context of a 2-0 win, but it didn’t happen like that. On the plus side, the series in SA is for championship points and he thinks his team will be better for it. As for the batting, Root says Pope showed great maturity to play within himself and manage situation, getting the team into a situation where England could dictate and he could play his natural game. He says that Sibley will have learnt a lot, and that Pope is adequate as a deputy keeper. Wood and Anderson are both in South Africa getting overs in; both should be ready to go if selected. Bairstow is out there too, and Root needs to speak to Moeen and Ed Smith about his availability. He says he’s a fine player and will be back but doesn’t know if it’ll be for the next series. On himself, Root says he’s felt close to proper form for a while and once he got set wasn’t going to give it away, so is pleased to make the most of a flat track. Root tells Sky that it feels like England tried everything today but dropped a couple of chances. He says England are learning a lot and learnt from New Zealand, namechecking Wanger’s engine and perseverance. He says his team need to take more chances, but there was a vast improvement this week, and laughs that Denly is a bit sore. Root thinks it was the right call not to play a spinner, and it was an opportunity to try something outside of the Test championship. He says Archer has found that Test cricket is hard and you can bowl well without getting rewards; he has a lot of learning to do but has to stay mentally and physically resilient. He’s a fast learner and will be better for this experience. He praises Woakes and Curran, saying Woakes is better with the Kookaburra ball now, and Curran is always there to get stuck in. Williamson accepts the trophy, and his team join him for photos. Like Wagner, he seems an absolutely superb bloke. Kane Williamson is up next and praises a great fighting effort despite losing both tosses; I like his hoody, which is grey with orange detail. He says this surface was a tough one and didn’t break up as expected, but his players kept wanting the ball in their hand when nothing was happening. His team have good challenges coming up, and he praises Daryl Mitchell on debut along with Matt Henry, while hoping Trent Boult and Colin DeGrandhomme will be ready for Australia. Er, Root’s back. He thinks the pitch might’ve deteriorated quicker without the rain and his team would’ve batted differently at the end of their innings. His team want to learn quickly - unlike those who don’t - and make big totals which put opponents under scoreboard pressure. The group have learnt a lot and he’s learnt a lot about them, he says, and is looking forward to South Africa. He thanks the fans who’ve supported his team, and he’s off again. Neil Wagner is man of the series, and that’s richly deserved for top bloke and a developing top bowler. Joe Root is man of the match and says he felt good following a tricky period at the start. Simon Doull tells him he felt the criticism of him was “unwarranted” - I really could not tell you why - and Root says he was working on some little technical things, trying to get movement back into his hands and a solid base. The pitch didn’t break up as he’d hoped - I’m sure his spinners would’ve taken advantage of that - and he says he’s proud of how his team came back and learnt the lessons of the first Test. They’re shaking hands and such. So there we go. “I think he could,” says Benjamin Macintyre of Santner. “It does depend on many things we can’t predict though. If it’s stifling hot the week leading up to Boxing Day in Melbourne the groundsmen will not be able to stop it getting dry quickly. If it’s a fast bowler’s wicket though, I’m not sure any spinner would be able to hold an end down on days 1 and 2 - not just Santner. This is, of course, all academic as Sodhi is going to make a surprise appearance and rip through everyone.” This was the glory of Graeme Swann, who not only held down an end but found a way to get people out. The more I think about it, the more he was the key to that great England side. You cannot see that Denly drop enough times, and they’ve just blessed us with it yet again. Sensational. It’s stopped raining but is extremely wet. I can’t see anyone’s arsed to keep on with this, but we can hope. On which point, I absolutely loved this. Mark Wood is such a great interviewee. I mentioned him taking us through the final yesterday, because they played it at lunchtime, and I’m still enjoying it now I’m seeing it a second time. He’s just informed us that the dressing room “was literally flying”. Back to Santner, Sydney might spin, but they’re not playing at Adelaide. And maybe he’ll get fourth-innings wickets if NZ bat first, but are we really saying he’s good enough to hold down an end on days 1 and 2? Hmmm. And he’s back! “As a Kiwi, your retelling of England’s world cup tie-umph is giving me flashbacks,” he says. Cricket was the winner. I deadpanned that. “I think it’s harsh to suggest that NZ doesn’t have a quality spinner when they have Mitchell Santner,” says Benjamin Macintyre. “His Test stats don’t show the progress he has made this year and whilst he doesn’t necessarily rip through sides in the manner of legendary spinners such as Warne he is the perfect option when you need to quieten a batting pair hitting their strides and even get one or two of them to nick off. If the Australian summer sun starts to really dry up the surface I can see Santner doing some real damage in the upcoming Australia v NZ series.” Fair enough. I’ve not seen that yet, and I’d expect Warner, Smith and ilk to go after him. But I’m often wrong. We’re seeing pictures of umpires and captain chatting. It’s still raining, but England can still pull this off... I cannot believe what I’ve just seen! According to Cricinfo, there’ll be a final decision made at the hour. We know what it’ll be, but that’s when it’ll be. “If I were a betting man, I would say that the upcoming series against Australia has got the potential to be one of the best in recent times,” says Abhijato Sensarma. “With the exception of Raval, the Kiwi batting has never been in better form. If flat pitches are the order of the day, they’ll feel right at home. As for the Aussie bowling threat, they did seem to lose the plot at certain times on the field against Pakistan in the recently-concluded affair, but their great returns nonetheless speaks volumes about the threat they possess. This might be the first time New Zealand has a favourable chance of winning a series Down Under. I, for one, will be following with a keen eye.” I’d love to see that, but I’m not sure. Taking 20 wickets in Australia, where medium pace gets whacked, if extremely difficult. New Zealand lack a quality spinner, and will be needing plenty from Ferguson and Wagner. It’s possible, but probably not likely. ...or, put another way, we’re almost done. Inspection in five minutes... Stokes has just played a glorious dive for six. What a player! This World Cup final wasn’t bad yano. I think I’m about ten to tears. “If Australians ridiculed Mike Brearley’s long jumpers,” says Ian Forth, “what are they to make of David Warner’s (image, over 48)? I mean a lesser man than me might say ‘What is he hiding in there?!’, but fortunately I’m much, much better than that.” I don’t mind him wearing it, but not with trousers. “I’ve worked in education for many years,” confesses Noel Sheppard, no relation of Dr from the Murder of Roger Ackroyd. “Mainly primary, with some secondary and a smattering of university thrown in. And for the last several years I’ve been teaching 11-year-olds, and every morning we would have a discussion of any news that caught their fancy. One morning Teddy came in, to tell us he’d just heard the Admiral in charge of the Danish Navy on the news. He was on to announce the completion of a lengthy program to barcode every vessel in the Danish sea-force. When asked why, he replied, ‘So we can Scandinavian.’ To this day, Teddy remains a source of some of my best jokes!” My six-year-old’s friend told her the following: What’s a cow’s favourite subject? Moosic. So she has come up with the following: What’s a turkey’s favourite subject? Geography. What’s a pirate’s favourite subject? Aaaaarrrrt. And a niche one: Why was Gru upset on Saturday? Because he couldn’t find a minyan. Thanks Tanya and greetings all. On Sky, they’re showing the Borg-McEnroe tiebreak World Cup final, which tells you all you need ta kna. Anyhow, we can chat, for as long as we can pretend this isn’t over – send me your thoughts to the addresses which will appear above when you hit the re-fresh. Kim Thonger scrambles brains from a distance. If Schrödinger took up cricket, and was stationed at deep square leg, and was under a skied hook, at the moment the ball landed in his hands, would it be Schrödinger’s Catch, but also would we not know whether it was held or dropped? And, with that, I’ll hand over to my colleague Daniel Harris. Thanks for sticking with us, and thanks for all the emails, tweets, jokes and more over the series - it’s been a blast. What riches! Another message, this time from Sebastian Bloomfield. I’m enjoying The Guardian’s commentary all the way down in NZ. Do you think Jeet Raval should be replaced by Martin Guptill in the Australia series? Surely more opening experience would warrant a draft into the squad for Guppy, especially considering the Australian pitches. What are your thoughts on a Guptill/Latham opening combination? Kane Williamson may not have to open (as he is doing, essentially) anymore. I learnt today, that the NZ selectors had already picked the squad for Australia before this series. In that case it would be quite a statement to drop Raval from the squad - though he’s in the middle of a rotten run. According to NZ stuff: “Since Raval’s maiden, and sole, test century against Bangladesh in Hamilton in February, he has scored, in a limited mix of first-class and test matches - 3, 33, 4, 0, 7, 3, 14, 19, 5; 88 runs at an average of 9.78. That’s lessened his test average to a still respectable but not overwhelming 33.27.” Guptill and Latham sounds interesting. The Aussies have just named their squad btw: Tim Paine (c, wk), Joe Burns, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, James Pattinson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner Sky chat away in the studio, but we break briefly to look at the ground. Whoops, apocalypse, as they say. But an email to warm our cockles, from Hugh McCarroll: As a local, my condolences regarding the weather. Please, don’t apologise, I live in Manchester. Do you remember a radio program called ‘Tales from the long room’ or something like that. I remember it was very very funny, and quite outrageous. Cricket generates much good material because of the unforgiving minutes you lot have to fill with words. It rings a bell, and google is helpful - it was by the playwright Peter Tinniswood and concerned the cricket-loving Brigadier from Witney Scrotum and his Uncle Mort. And you’re right, cricket writers are very well acquainted with filling empty minutes with hot air... There’s someone out there! AJ Hunter writes: As an American watching, why is this series not considered part of the ICC World Test Championship? Is it so each teams series count even? Or something else? Hi AJ. Yes, there’s no conspiracy, it is just that the World Test Championship was designed after this series was already in the bank. Each team in the Championship will play six series between August 2019 and June 2021 (three home and three away). They all count - (excluding games against non WTC counties Ireland, Zimbabwe and Afghanistan) except this one! This looks like a long rain delay, though the crowd haven’t left the ground yet. Do send me your thoughts, on this or that, on New Zealand’s chances in Australia, or England’s in South Africa. 75th over: New Zealand 241-2 ( Williamson 104, Taylor 105) Taylor sniffs the air and smells rain. Four, six, six, thanks very much, his 19th Test hundred, and just on cue, the groundstaff zip up their jackets and the rain starts to fall . 74th over: New Zealand 225-2 ( Williamson 104, Taylor 89) Denly whizzes through another over. 73rd over: New Zealand 220-2 ( Williamson 103, Taylor 85) A barmy quick single, saved only by an off-target throw by Sam Curran, is followed by a sweep down on one knee as Williamson reaches his 21st Test hundred. He removes his helmet and the wind ruffles both hair and beard in celebration. He’s given a few chances, and ridden out the Ben Stokes storm, but classic Kane. 72nd over: New Zealand 213-2 ( Williamson 97, Taylor 85) Williamson drives Denly through the off-side to shuffle closer to three figures. The heavens have indeed opened here in Auckland....and it looks like Hamilton won’t be far behind (according to the rain radar on the Met Service website) writes Andy Goulden. Will Captain Kane get his ton? You’d think they could forgo the sarnies for half an hour as the weather is closing in but I suppose that’s one reason we love the ever logic defying game of test cricket. 71st over: New Zealand 211-2 ( Williamson 96, Taylor 84) The umpires’ black slacks undulate in the breeze and the floodlights are on. Root thinks he might as well keep going and Taylor plays out a maiden. He and Williamson are second and fourth in the list of all-time leading New Zealand run-scorers. We see Root giving his troops a pep talk before they all stroll back onto the pitch. The sky is grey, but not black. The heavens have opened in Auckland about 70 miles away... 70th over: New Zealand 211-2 ( Williamson 96, Taylor 84) Ben Stokes bowls the last over before lunch. Williamson considers the forecast and pulls him twice, quite beautifully to the square leg boundary. They all potter off for sandwiches and we catch a glimpse of the sky, which is darkening. A bumbling morning for England, with those two drops by Ollie Pope and meme creator Joe Denly. The game drifts towards its natural end. Time for a quick stretch, back soon. 69th over: New Zealand 202-2 ( Williamson 88, Taylor 83) Time for some Joe Root. He brings the fielders forward, he urges them back with his long conductorial fingers. Sleeves buttoned down, he twirls; Taylor plays him with nuff respect, then a nudge down to square leg to reach 7000 Test runs, only the second New Zealander to get there. Then Root turns one into Taylor’s pads, big appeal turned down, but decides not to review. 68th over: New Zealand 201-2 ( Williamson 88, Taylor 82) Against the run of play, a little Christmas sparkle . Stokes fires one in short, Williamson misjudges as he swivels to pull and the ball pings into his helmet and sprays behind where Pope catches it. A half-hearted appeal from both Stokes and Pope and Root decides to go for the review. And why not? He’s not out - there’s no contact with the swooshing bat, and Lockie Ferguson brings out a new helmet. Taylor and Williamson continue to get their eye in for the battle ahead across the Tasman. New Zealand’s lead is 100. 67th over: New Zealand 197-2 ( Williamson 87, Taylor 80) Curran heads wide of the crease to send the ball in. Williamson eases a couple of runs and starts to think about lunch. 66th over: New Zealand 195-2 ( Williamson 85, Taylor 80) Ben Stokes, to bowl for your life? He digs six short balls into unresponsive soil, undaunted by the lack of reward. He laughs in the face of pancakes. 65th over: New Zealand 190-2 ( Williamson 84, Taylor 77) Nowt of note. Speaking of Gatting, writes Tom from North London, watch this. 64th over: New Zealand 186-2 ( Williamson 80, Taylor 77) Denly. Two singles. Lots of school kids in maroon t-shirt and shorts frolic on the grass. 63rd over: New Zealand 184-2 ( Williamson 79, Taylor 76) The Christmas perfume ads have hit - though none as memorable as the one years ago for L’egoiste that involved lots of people opening and closing shutters loudly whilst shouting. It made quite an impression at a sensitive age. Not that I ever bought it. Curran skips through a maiden with a smile on his face and a lolly in his pocket. 62nd over: New Zealand 183-2 ( Williamson 79, Taylor 75) Denly whizzes through his over, as if he might fast-forward through the day so fast that it disappears. 61st over: New Zealand 179-2 ( Williamson 75, Taylor 75) Woakes strides actively to the crease. Williamson trots through for a single. Would it be too harsh to say the most interesting thing that is going to happen before lunch is the race to see who reaches their century first? Though when I say race, I mean it in its broadest possible sense. Antnie writes from across the channel. I am following, avidly, I promise, in deepest France, though I’m having trouble picturing pink stains on bowlers trousers. I hope your hottie bottle is under control tonight. No hot water bottle yet - that’s for the 1.40am shift. Perhaps Daniel has got his ready and waiting by the kettle right now. 60th over: New Zealand 178-2 ( Williamson 74, Taylor 75) And with a single to mid-on off Denly, that’s the 150 partnership between Williamson and Taylor, off 306 balls. They reach out, and shake hands. 59th over: New Zealand 176-2 ( Williamson 72, Taylor 75) A bearded Chris Woakes is rather discombobulating , he starts to look like all the other bearded warriors, a bit of Mark Wood, with a touch of Virat Kohli. Beards have definitely got better though. Compare Mike Gatting’s to the 2019 versions. 58th over: New Zealand 175-2 ( Williamson 72, Taylor 74) Denly is bowling with his shades on, as Root polishes the ball for him on the back of his trousers. Not much happens, but the odd brain cell starts to disengage. 57th over: New Zealand 172-2 ( Williamson 70, Taylor 73) And a maiden from Woakes, as the wind ruffles the players’ shirts. And some more appreciation for Steven Finn pops into my email box. Good evening, Tanya, writes Peter Stoker. Not much to cheer about in this series other than, perhaps, the emergence of Steve Finn as a splendidly genial and good-natured pundit on TMS (although I appreciate, of course, that you have to follow the Sky telly feed). Let’s hope the lad has a good few years left steaming in from the Pavilion End at Lord’s. But after hanging up the size 16s... 56th over: New Zealand 172-2 ( Williamson 70, Taylor 73) Denly again, Taylor and Williamson are untroubled, Taylor laying into a crisp cut for four off his last ball. 55th over: New Zealand 164-2 ( Williamson 68, Taylor 67) Time for a bit of Chris Woakes, who takes long, brisk strides back to his mark and unfurls a tidy over. Surely if the DRS was applied to Schrödinger‘s Cat, writes Kim Thonger, we’d find out once and for all if the ruddy thing was dead or alive and put an end to the uncertainty? 54th over: New Zealand 163-2 ( Williamson 68, Taylor 66) Nice little bit of captaincy here, as Root throws the ball to Denly - let him try to make amends, or at least not mull over the drop isolated in the field. The wind is getting up, and rattling the trees surrounding the ground. 53rd over: New Zealand 161-2 ( Williamson 66, Taylor 66) Fortified by drinks, Archer rolls through another over. It’s free entry today by the way, so if you’ve got time on your hands in Hamilton, why not mosey down. Joe Denly should never have gone to the Marnus Labuschagne catching school, snorts David Markham. while Dave Harris wonders, “Do you think Mrs Denly’s going to be letting Joe hold their little’un (https://mobile.twitter.com/joed1986/status/1172466162761908225) uunsupervised when he gets home? 52nd over: New Zealand 157-2 ( Williamson 65, Taylor 63) Good old Stuart Broad runs yet another over into those tired old legs. Enthusiasm undimmed. Three not particularly memorable singles and that be drinks. This seems a bit cruel, but here you go, to accompany your coffee/cocoa. 51st over: New Zealand 155-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) A maiden from Archer. Trouble at the last ball when Taylor sends Williamson back and he only just makes his crease via a sprawled dive. 50th over: New Zealand 155-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) A maiden from Broad, as poor ostracised Denly trudges around the field unloved. Give him a hug someone. 49th over: New Zealand 154-2 ( Williamson 62, Taylor 61) Oh dear. Cover your eyes. Joe Denly has just dropped the sitter of all sitters. Archer bowls to Williamson, one of those balls where he doesn’t use his front arm, Williamson tips it straight into Denly’s hands at short midwicket, and I mean straight, Denly doesn’t move his feet an inch, and just waits for the ball to come into his hands, which it does, and then falls straight back out. Broad covers his mouth with his hands , Archer, who was already celebrating, puts head to his hand and then laughs. 48th over: New Zealand 151-2 ( Williamson 59, Taylor 61) There’s a scattering of bare-footed crowd on the banks either side of the sightscreen as this game meanders away. A steady over from Broad. 47th over: New Zealand 149-2 ( Williamson 59, Taylor 61) Archer again, nothing too steamy, but on the button. Just a couple from the over. Geoff Wignall offers this up: Knock, knock Who’s there? Schrödinger And you expect me to.open the door? 46th over: New Zealand 147-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 60) A double-switch as Broad replaces Stokes. Nothing much to report except for Zak Crawley tripping over himself in the covers, like a British rom-com hero negociating unexpected ice. 45th over: New Zealand 143-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 56) So Root turns to Archer. They have a man to man at the top of the mark and Root shuffles the field. Taylor swivels and pulls a short one, 117kph, for a single, then Williamson ducks, like a leapfrogger. I think if we’ve learned anything it’s that New Zealand are good enough to beat England, and that the groundskeepers should be more adventurous in preparing pitches for a result, writes Joe Harvey, wisely, This second test has been disappointing. As an England supporter, I worry that we haven’t learned much- we’re still trying to figure out if Root is cut out for Captaincy, and if the Bowling attack needs a more aggressive shuffle. I don’t think our bowling hand is too bad: Broad, Archer, Curran, Woakes, Stokes - then throw in Anderson and Wood with Mahmood sculling around in a florescent tabard. 44th over: New Zealand 143-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 56) And fifty for Taylor too, a more chunky, risky, effort but very entertaining. He jumps off the ground to swish a Stokes wide one over gully for four, then next ball sends him through the covers for successive boundaries. Taylor and Williamson stroll together, shoot the breeze, and touch gloves. 43rd over: New Zealand 134-2 ( Williamson 58, Taylor 47) Beautiful from Kane Williamson, first a dreamy extra cover drive, then he drops the hands and kisses Curran down to third man for another four. I like him too. And Ramprakash, they both add something new to the squad. 42nd over: New Zealand 124-2 ( Williamson 49, Taylor 46) Taylor decides to lay into Stokes with a swift-handed slap through backward point for four. Lots of muscle but no reward yet for Stokes. 41st over: New Zealand 115-2 ( Williamson 45, Taylor 40) Curran goes through the motions, all effort and sweaty hair. Williamson plays him poker-faced until stealing a couple down to long-off. A cracking email from John Starbuck. Good evening. 1) You’d think that a sport more obsessed with stats than perhaps any other (OK Baseball, but that’s just a sort of rounders) would place more trust in meteorological forecasts and start even earlier on the final day; 2) We seems to be selecting players for the next but one series at the moment and even later given the chance to select youngsters who need overseas experience; 3) Mince pies should, properly, be accompanied by glasses of Madeira now we’re in December. Boast: since the early 1980s I’ve been buying an extra bottle of Madeira each year to lay down for my retirement and, now it’s arrived, I’m very pleased to say it was all worthwhile. The problem is that word has got about and I now have to take a 40-year old bottle to every Yuletide family party. Note to the uninformed: Madeira in bottles is known to mature fabulously well for longer and varied treatment - in my case, several house removals, which isn’t the same as multiple trips across the Atlantic but it’ll do; 4) Here’s hoping you’ll sign off this series on a high. 40th over: New Zealand 113-2 ( Williamson 45, Taylor 40) A Stokes tester, he torments Williamson with variations of length and bounce. You could say that, or it just means he’ll be a more confident captain with some form behind him, and can grow into the job while other candidates develop/secure their place in the side. 39th over: New Zealand 113-2 ( Williamson 43, Taylor 40) Two contrasting boundaries for Taylor off Curran, a cover drive, all smooth hazelnut, then a Toxic Waste outside edge, down through third man. Good evening Tanya Good evening Damian Clarke. My nephew also has a new joke book. His favourite so far? Knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock. Who’s there? Mr. Octopus. Very Good. 37th over: New Zealand 103-2 ( Williamson 43, Taylor 32) A drop! Stokes shoves one short and Williamson gloves it down the leg-side only for a porridge-legged Ollie Pope to drop it . To rub salt into the wound, Williamson then pulls Stokes with pizazz for four and New Zealand go into the lead. 37th over: New Zealand 99-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 32) A smart shy at the stumps from Sam Curran could have had Taylor in trouble, but his foot was comfortably back over the crease. Curran completes a neat maiden. William Hargreaves drops a line. What do you feel will be the outcome, how fair a reflection of two teams’ capabilities would this be, and how do you think this will influence two teams going forward, please? Gosh. I think that deserves two sides of A4. But briefly: a draw, a fairly true reflection (of England abroad) and I think it will give NZ some confidence going into the Australian series and reveals England’s weaknesses to be where they knew they were anyway. Incisive spin, Spots 2 and 3 in the batting order, and the killer instinct with the ball out of English conditions. 36th over: New Zealand 99-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 32) I was wondering whether Archer might get the ball from the other end, but Root has plumped for Stokes who toyed with Taylor yesterday evening. Again he seems to get Taylor in two minds, with the odd ball behaving unexpectedly off the pitch. Taylor pulls, inconclusively. 35th over: New Zealand 98-2 ( Williamson 39, Taylor 31) Sam Curran is handed the ball and scampers in from the Barmy Army end where a half-cut rendition of Jerusalem assaults the ears. And out the players come - for perhaps the last session of the series. An early joke, for our more mature readers, care of James Debens. Someone’s stolen the Trotters’ Reliant Robin van and sold it to the US. “Delaware?” No, but Rodney’s bloody livid. Another James, Butler this time, thinks Mike Atherton has forgotten the lesson of the near past. It feels a bit ironic to now be saying that Sibley is ‘a bit limited’. Personally I would have given away my most treasured cricketing possession (a signed copy of ‘Angus Fraser’s Tour Diaries’) during the Ashes if we could have found a ‘limited’ player who could have ground out 20 between lunch and tea in the face of Pat Cummins. Mark Butcher fancies Moeen Ali to rejoin England for the South Africa tour. I do hope so. Then they move on to Jofra Archer - Atherton says he’s an absolute diamond, but has realised how difficult Test cricket is away from England and the Dukes ball. Says we need to dampen expectation a little, but he’s a wonderful player. An interesting tale here: My son has a new joke book. This is his favourite. Bill: I’m letting my pet pig sleep on my bed. Jenny: What about the smell? Bill: He’ll just have to get used to it. In the Sky studio they’re having a selection chat for the South Africa series. Mike Atherton think Dom Sibley might not be right, for now, and looks a bit limited. He suggests they might shove Denly up to open and thinks Ollie Pope looks the best English batsman since Joe Root. Butcher would keep Sibley for the tour to South Africa and see what happens. The England touring staff, according to Atherton, are both quite optimistic about Sibley and Crawley because of the way they are shaping up in practice. It’s not raining by the way, looks quite nice actually. So, here we are, two mince pies into December, with just one day left of the first tour of the new regime. Downpours are due, probably by lunch, so any hopes of England levelling the series, or New Zealand pulling another rabbit out of the hat, seem remote. It’s all about the little presents left unobtrusively at the foot of the tree. In foil, England’s longest Test innings for four years. With raffia, Ollie Pope’s debut fifty and Tom Latham’s century. Gift-boxed, Joe Root’s double ton. And finally, busting out of a too-small envelope, Neil Wagner’s five wickets. On Saturday New Zealand fly to Australia, where they need to hit the ground running. The first of the three Test series starts at Perth, before moving on to Melbourne on Boxing Day and Sydney at New Year. Their last Test win in Australia was in 2011 , but you have to travel back to the era of big hair and pixie boots to unearth their last series win, when Richard Hadless was in charge way back 1985-86. England have a couple of warm-up games before the first Test against South Africa which starts at Centurion on Boxing day. Three more Tests, three ODIs and three T20s follow. But we’ve still got today. Something to play for, even if it is Williamson and Taylor knocking themselves into form before the rain . Play is due to start at 10.30am NZST or 9.30pm GMT. See you soon!"

          "headline": "Ken Wyatt defends awarding of $2.2m contract to organisation linked to Liberal candidate",
          "bodyText": "The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has defended awarding a $2.2m contract without a tender process to an organisation linked to the former Liberal candidate Bill Glasson. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday revealed an internal complaint was made about the process that awarded the contract to the Indigenous and Remote Eye Health Service (IRIS) for the delivery of ophthalmology services in remote areas at twice the market rate. It came after a former chief of staff to Wyatt, Kate Johnson, went public with allegations that the minister fostered “a culture of bullying in his office”, which became the subject of a Department of Finance investigation. Glasson, who ran as the Liberal candidate against Kevin Rudd at the 2013 election, was a director of IRIS between 2016 and 2019, along with lobbyist Kerry Gallagher. The holding company of IRIS is called Vanguard Consulting. Vanguard Health has donated at least $21,000 to the Liberal National party of Queensland since 2009. In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for Wyatt said the contract to Vanguard was awarded “following advice provided by the Health Department” on 1 August 2018. Initial briefs were signed by Wyatt on 9 August, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, on 15 August. The contract was approved on 24 August. “The Australian Society of Ophthalmologists – through Vanguard Health – was provided funding from the previous Labor federal government in 2010/11, to plan and develop a four-year plan for eye services (IRIS 1.0),” Wyatt said. “The IRIS proposal was assessed by the Indigenous Health Division, in line with the standard process for unsolicited proposals under the Indigenous Australians’ Health program, and was assessed as suitable for the funding on the basis it would meet the unmet need for cataract surgery. “Given the pending delivery of the ‘roadmap’ for Indigenous Eye Health and relative value for money considerations, the department recommended the IRIS initiative be funded as a two-year trial, with an independent evaluation in the second half of year two to assess effectiveness and efficiency.” The spokesman said that the department’s advice was that “the initiative would deliver 500 eye procedures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the two years”. To date, more than 300 remote operations have been carried out. According to the Herald’s report, a staff member in Wyatt’s office complained that “the company [Vanguard] has party connections” and they “contacted every man and their dog” over the contract. The staff member, who has asked to remain anonymous, told the Department of Finance that that “just because you’re connected to the party doesn’t mean you get written a blank cheque”. Labor’s assistant minister for Treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the issue was a “matter of scrutiny” for the Morrison government. “And when it’s a matter of scrutiny – whether that’s scrutiny for the big banks, scrutiny for George Christensen, scrutiny for Ken Wyatt – they pull the covers over,” Leigh said on Tuesday. “They say there’s nothing thing to see here. A doona is the best metaphor for the Morrison government that anyone can come up. They’re either asleep or pulling the covers over.”"

          "headline": "Wild seed collectors turn Indiana Jones in the search for resilient crops",
          "bodyText": "The seeds of more than 370 wild crop species have been collected as part of a six-year Indiana Jones-style mission to widen the gene pool of staple crops and ensure future global food security in increasingly unpredictable growing conditions. A hundred scientists from 25 countries travelled by horse, canoe and even elephant to reach remote corners of the world in search of wild species of common agricultural crops such as rice, barley, beans and potatoes that billions of people rely on for basic nutrition. Domesticated crops are generally selected for their high yield and nutritional value but this means they have dangerously low genetic diversity. Their wild relatives – many of which are at risk of extinction – are sturdier because they have evolved to survive more challenging conditions. Without adaptation, the climate crisis could reduce agricultural production by up to 30% by 2050, according to a report produced by the Global Commission on Adaptation. Breeders want to create new crops that look and taste like domesticated varieties but that are more resilient to drought, flooding and temperature extremes. “These wild plants are related to a wide range of important crops,” said Hannes Dempewolf, a senior scientist at the Crop Trust, which ran the project in partnership with the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens’ Millennium Seed Bank project. “They hold the genetic diversity which breeders will need to improve those crops so we can feed 9 billion people with nutritious food.” For centuries scientists have travelled the world collecting plants – initially to grow in gardens – but increasingly they are looking to save seeds and store them in sub-zero vaults to ensure long-term survival. Collectors working on the Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) project spent a total of 2,973 days in the field and saved 4,644 seed samples from 371 crop wild relatives, according to a report published by the Crop Trust. They found seeds from 28 globally important crops, including nine species of banana, 21 of wild barley, two species of wild potato and four of wild aubergine. Researchers examined gene banks across the world and identified which had dangerously low diversity before setting out on expeditions to far-flung parts of Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. They used GPS to tag the location of their discoveries and silica gel to preserve the seeds. In one of the most treacherous expeditions, collectors in Nepal travelled on elephants to ward off tigers and rhinos. They found a species of wild rice (Oryza meyeriana) that is resistant to bacterial blight and collected a relative of the sweet potato (Ipomoea cairica) with high resistance to insect attack that can grow in salty soils. In Ecuador, collectors wore long plastic boots with metal tips to protect them from snakebites while collecting an elusive variety of high-yielding rice (Oryza grandiglumi) that is endemic to tropical America and tolerates flooding. Security concerns caused by al-Shabaab prevented collectors reaching their targets in the Lamu district of Kenya. Missions to north-eastern Nigeria were abandoned in 2015 and 2016 due to the Boko Haram insurgency but collectors were able to access the region in 2017. Dempewolf said: “The expeditions were not a walk in the park. They were perilous at times and physically demanding, with heat, dust, sweat and danger from wild animals – from blood-sucking leeches to tigers. The stories these seed collectors brought back from the field often resemble scenes from an Indiana Jones movie.” Seeds are only ripe for a narrow window of time and if collectors were too early they had to visit the site again. If they were too late they had to wait until the following year. Nicola Ardenghi from the University of Pavia in Italy spotted a type of pea with edible tubers while looking out of a train window between Piacenza and Milan – his team had almost given up hope before it was found. Many of these crops are already threatened with extinction due to deforestation, urban sprawl, conflict and the climate crisis. In some cases, wild crop relatives were already lost. For example in Costa Rica, land which was once home to wild rice has been turned into sugarcane plantations and tilapia ponds. Scientists say this work is more important than ever. “If we are to feed a growing population, we need to make our food crops more resilient. And crop wild relatives can help breeders develop new ‘climate-proof’ varieties,” said Marie Haga, the outgoing executive director of the Crop Trust. “We have made incredible progress tracking down crop wild relatives that could hold the key to food’s survival but there is more to be done, and as threats to the world’s biodiversity mount, this work is more urgent than ever. [This project] offers hope and a guide for future efforts to save and use the diversity we rely on for our food security,” she said. The wild relatives of crops share a “gene pool” which means that although they may be different species they are close enough relatives to exchange genetic traits. The collected samples are available to breeders and farmers everywhere and can be crossed with domesticated varieties. Work is already under way to develop 19 new crops with international partners in 38 countries. More than a dozen farmer seed clubs in the Mekong delta of Vietnam are testing rice derived from crosses with wild cousins. “This project has only succeeded thanks to the dedication and hard work of individuals in organisations around the world working towards a common goal, to safeguard crop wild relatives, that previously were overlooked and disregarded, but probably hold the key to the world’s food security in the years ahead,” said Chris Cockel, Crop Wild Relatives project coordinator at Kew."

          "bodyText": "There are the politicians – depressing, I know. There are “the people” – that movable feast that includes the lost souls in retail parks who “don’t trust any of them” and the passionate public sector workers who occasionally break through in phone-ins or Question Time to talk expertly of their experience. Then there are the journalists, apparently as untrustworthy as the politicians, dictated to by our evil overlords. Add to this bonfire of the vanities the spark of social media, where everyone lives in their own cocoon of self-righteousness, cancelling, blocking, or piling in on someone who must be evil since they vote differently. It often seems as if this election is happening elsewhere. I did get a leaflet but, outside of the media, I don’t hear much talk about what everyone knows is so important. The disconnect between knowing about the election and feeling it is what interests me. Johnson is a joke – the unfunniest joke ever. I don’t need films to tell me about child hunger. I have gone on enough school trips and, sure, I see Labour has a radical programme, but shilly-shallying around antisemitism is not radical. Maybe the fervour will hit me, but I wonder at my own profession’s failure to reflect the reality of what is happening. What happened to being less London-centric? What happened to listening? We are now post-truth, post-integrity and post-politics in a sense. A manifesto of wishful thinking versus a nonsensical slogan. Trust has evaporated because what is on offer is fantasy. The old journalistic codes are no longer viable. Speed versus veracity? Speed wins. Accountability? From who to whom? Protection of sources? Come on! Audience engagement is low because younger people are not getting their news from “trusted sources”. The BBC’s famous impartiality is not fit for purpose. None of this should surprise us. We have already seen the media bow and scrape before Trump, parsing his word salads as sentences, acquiescing to his tantrums in return for access. We now have the UK’s prime minister avoiding a tough interview, and debates with various mediocrities. Facts and stats are reeled off, but no one is properly challenged. Listen to Joe Rogan getting stoned with his guests on YouTube if you want that kind of truth. Accountability is to be achieved not by empty-chairing people but by much more relaxed interviews. Slow it all down: the need for speed is satisfied by the Twitter stories that implode within an hour or so. The confrontational approach of interviews, where media-trained politicians lie to well-informed presenters, backfires. Everyone is worried about division and polarisation while feeding these beasts raw meat. There is little attempt to persuade voters to change lifelong voting patterns, even though this is what the main parties need. Corbyn likes to be among those who already love him. Johnson bowls up at a hospital where polite medics barely hide their contempt. Why are journalists reporting these tired stunts? Are press conferences useful? No. The lobby system is corrupt and always has been. Journalists should stop using unnamed sources. Above all, they should treat the people as if they know what is happening – because they do. The Marxist notion of false consciousness is detrimental, as warrior/activists believe that only if some smart person (them) explains to ordinary folk the true economic situation, will the scales fall from their eyes and their enslavement to capitalism end. Show me the evidence for this, please. In reality, the media has lost trust in the people. People are complicated and contradictory – the changing view on immigration is an example of this. Simplification may be the job of the politician, but it is not that of the journalist. The media loses if it cannot engage “the people”, and the people think we are one and the same as the political class. Too often this is true, I am afraid. As the French theorist Guy Debord put it: “The spectacle presents itself as a vast inaccessible reality that can never be questioned. Its sole message is: ‘What appears is good; what is good appears.’” This is the passivity that both the spectacle and the media demand. But the people are no longer mesmerised. Pass the remote. They want to see something else."

          "headline": "Drones used to deliver parcels to remote Alpine villages",
          "bodyText": "France’s postal service has begun using drones to make parcel deliveries to a remote Alpine village. La Poste’s subsidiary, DPD, says flying packages by remote control is more reliable, quicker and safer than driving a van up narrow mountain roads in winter when they are often icy or blocked by snow. The delivery by drone, which flies at around 30km/h, takes eight minutes for a round trip, compared with 30 minutes for a vehicle. Launched during a normal postal delivery round from a special launch-and-landing platform that emerges from the side of a vehicle, the drone is guided to a “secure terminal” near the village where it releases the package to be collected by the customer using a code. DPD began researching the possibility of using drones to make deliveries in 2014 and has been honing the technology ever since. La Poste was given permission by France’s civil aviation authority to begin using the drones, which have six electric rotors that can be charged using solar panels, and a inbuilt GPS system, for deliveries in the Isère region of south-east France. They will carry small parcels between Fontanil-Cornillon to Mont-Saint-Martin, which is 760m above sea level and north of Grenoble in the Chartreuse mountains. “There are many benefits to drone delivery in the mountains as compared to delivery by van. For the driver, in addition to the time saving, there is reduced risk on roads that are dangerous and sometimes blocked especially in winter,” DPD said. “For the customer, it guarantees that they will receive their parcel even if the road is impassable. Finally, as the drone is electric-powered, it does not emit any CO2 into this protected natural environment,” it added. DPD says the drone has numerous safety features, including an “autonomous parachute”, an anti-collision system, camera and flight recorder, in case anything should go wrong. However, it can only carry parcels weighing under 2kg and measuring less than 31cm x 15cm x10cm. La Poste has been using drones to make deliveries in the Var region of southern France, but this is the first time the technology has been used in the mountains. “We’re heading for the winter period and in the Alps there are regular snowfalls that can stop traditional deliveries to Mont-Saint-Martin,” Jean-Luc Defrance DPD director told Le Parisien."

          "headline": "Bolivia has been promised elections. But will they be fair?",
          "bodyText": "As the dust begins to settle following weeks of upheaval in Bolivia, fresh elections are being promised in the new year by the self-appointed interim president, Jeanine Áñez. They offer a glimmer of hope for the restoration of the country’s badly battered democracy – but only if they are free and fair. Meanwhile, her possible successors are beginning to jockey for position. Carlos Mesa, Evo Morales’ chief rival in the 20 October elections, has announced he is running, while Morales’ party Movement for Socialism (Mas) has said it will put forward “young candidates” in the place of the former president. Mesa’s opposition on the right will be an upstart contender who only burst on to Bolivia’s national scene in the past month. Luis Camacho is the president of the powerful civic organisation in the city of Santa Cruz, Bolivia’s “economic powerhouse”. He emerged as a key player in the deposition of Morales and the subsequent installation of Áñez. Camacho is an ardent Roman Catholic conservative who openly bribed the police to mutiny against the Morales government, with promises of increased retirement pay. In doing so, he pushed aside both Mesa and the Organization of American States, which urged a democratic transition that would have allowed Morales to complete his term. Instead, Camacho and his followers forced Morales’ immediate resignation. Widespread protests rocked the country for 10 days after Áñez’s takeover. Several cities faced shortages of food and gas because of the many roadblocks. “We think her government will bring back the racism we suffered in the past,” said an indigenous demonstrator who didn’t want his name used. “We denounce the coup she has carried out without any authority whatsoever.” On 15 November, the police and military opened fire on indigenous protesters outside Bolivia’s fourth largest city, Cochabamba, killing nine and wounding more than 120. “We were marching peacefully and they began shooting off tear gas and firing on us,” a crying woman told the Andean Information Network. “They treated us like animals.” Four days later, in El Alto, police and military opened fire again on indigenous demonstrators, leaving eight dead and more than 30 wounded. An uneasy equilibrium returned last week, following these violent showdowns between the police – accompanied by the army – and pro-Morales protesters. But how long can this reprieve last, and is Áñez the right person to lead the country through this transition period, and ensure a return to some form of stability? Áñez’s government initially behaved as if it had a mandate to transform the country and wreak revenge on those who supported the Morales administration. She was sworn into office holding a Bible, in a country that is constitutionally secular. Áñez has also been accused of publishing racist tweets against Bolivia’s indigenous majority. The tone she set has been reflected in a resurgence of Bolivia’s deep-seated racism, something that had eased under the 14 years Morales – Bolivia’s first indigenous president – was in power. In response to his government’s promotion of the indigenous wiphala flag, police mutinying against Morales ripped the wiphala off their uniforms. Racist graffiti, such as “Evo, shitty Indian”, in a country where Indian is still a pejorative term, appeared on city walls. Among Áñez’s first moves were recognising Juan Guiadó as Venezuela’s president and throwing out of the country Cuban doctors who were working in impoverished, remote areas. Not long afterwards she exempted the military from any consequences from deploying force against demonstrators, and then provided it with an additional $35m in funding. But Áñez’s government has recently backed down from its initial aggressive stance, and negotiations with the former government’s legislators have resulted in a law authorising new elections within 120 days. An agreement has also been reached with social movement organisations opposed to Áñez. This has led to the lifting of over 90 blockades that have paralysed the country, in exchange for the withdrawal of the military from non-strategic locations, and the revocation of a law granting the military impunity for its actions against protesters. These steps signal some hope that the government is moving closer towards acting as a true transition government, although faith in the promise of fair elections remains thin. “Should we support the new elections?” an El Alto-based Mas supporter asked me. “With all that they have done to us, can we trust that they will respect our vote?” The international community has committed extra assistance in conducting and monitoring the results of the new elections. Mas remains the single largest political force in the country, but its opponents are getting organised. As head of the transition government, Áñez is unable to run herself, but is expected to support Camacho, who announced last week that he intends to run as the leader of a united opposition, with his Potosí equivalent Marco Pumari at his side. This move to consolidate opposition to Mas, by a right wing that has not respected Bolivians’ human rights, feeds uncertainty over the possibility of peaceful and fair elections. The key question remains: if Mas were to win, would the Bolivian right accept the results? • Linda Farthing is a journalist and researcher who has co-authored three books on Bolivia"

          "bodyText": "There is something retro and subterranean about the maze of narrow corridors ahead of us. Exposed steel pipes run along the ceilings, the floors are shiny linoleum and the doors are moulded wood. It looks as if it has barely changed since it was built back in the 1950s. Welcome to the European Organization for Nuclear Research, better known as Cern, home to the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Beyond the design, what is more retro, liable to make you misty-eyed for a bygone era, is how it all came into being. In a burst of idealism after the war, scientists petitioned the UN to open a research centre where countries, including Britain, could work together in a spirit of peace, harmony and progress, collaborating and sharing data on how the universe is made. “Science isn’t interested in religion or borders,” says our guide for the morning, particle physicist Dr Conor Fitzpatrick. “You’ll see Palestinian physicists working alongside Israeli ones.” Dr Fitzpatrick pauses for a moment and points to a small, unassuming plaque hanging on the wall that reads: “Where the web was born.” Here in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee came up with the idea as a means of sharing information with scientists in different universities and institutes.” Cern, near Geneva, is the holy grail for physicists. There isn’t really anywhere else quite like it, which is why I’m here with my son, an A-level physics student, who is thrilled as we walk through the corridors of the theoretical physics department. He nudges me to look into some of the small offices either side of us, as if we are on a physicists safari. There they are, theoretical physicists in their natural habitat, sitting at desks deep in contemplation or scrawling indecipherable formulae on whiteboards, trying to figure out where all the dark matter is hiding. The pinnacle of any visit here is, of course, to find out more about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which, as Dr Fitzpatrick explains simply, is two hollow pipes that contain two beams of protons, insulated like a giant thermal flask. The LHC is huge, around 7km in diameter and 27km in circumference. You cross the French border several times if you go around the ring. The most exciting time to be here, says Dr Fitzpatrick, was 4 July 2012 when they shared the news that they had observed a new particle “consistent with the Higgs boson”, otherwise known as the “God particle”. “The atmosphere was incredible,” he recalls. “There were queues outside the auditorium; people had heard the rumour and they were sleeping in queues to get in.” Dr Fitzpatrick’s natural passion for his subject is infectious – at some points I think I even understand what he’s talking about. At first it sounds simple enough and I wonder how I could possibly have failed my physics O-level. “We’re interested in the area before the Big Bang, when energy was high and that energy allows us to form fundamental particles. As we collide particles, it allows us to create ones that didn’t exist at this time – 13.8bn years back when energy was last this high.” Uh-huh, I see. “Everything we see and touch is matter. For every matter particle there has to be an antimatter particle. During the Big Bang, antimatter was produced but what happened to it? Did it disappear over time?” The more you learn, the more weirdly wonderful it is. There’s an artistic element to it, too. Fitzpatrick shows us something called the wire chamber: golden and gleaming with layers of tungsten wires, it looks like a measuring instrument straight out of His Dark Materials. “Resident artists record what they see here because some of the designs are so beautiful,” he says. People were in tears, he says, when it was taken out of use. It’s time for lunch, and we sit in Cern canteen with Dr Fitzpatrick and his wife, who between them have matter covered. He specialises in antimatter and she is an assistant professor in dark matter. So what’s the difference between the two? Patiently they explain. Antimatter is produced by lightning and cosmic rays, and is predicted by standard particle physics theories. Dark matter cannot be seen using light, which is why no one has found it yet. “Ah, I see,” I say. Afterwards I feel quite pleased with myself, but my son is mortified, telling me this is easily the most embarrassing question I could ask a particle physicist. At least I tried, I tell him. Cern is easy to visit. It’s 20 minutes by bus from Geneva train station, which is a three-minute walk from where we’re staying. 9 Hotel Pâquis is a great value design hotel with a bijou pool. We’re in an area that is more lively and interesting than the Geneva I had expected. Instead of wall-to-wall banks and designer watch shops, the streets are lined with cafés and bars. We enjoy a delicious Lebanese kebab and mezze after midnight on crowded tables spilling out on to the pavement. When I meet my walking guide the next morning, she isn’t overly impressed. “You do realise you’re in the middle of the red light district?” she says, and leads us briskly through the narrow streets towards the Geneva I imagined: remote, elegant and icily exclusive, with sweeping boulevards and grand fin-de-siècle hotels overlooking the lake. We take a river boat on Lake Geneva and spot, in the hills, Villa Diodati, where Mary Shelley, Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley famously spent three rainy summer days in 1816, creating stories to tell each other – one of which became Frankenstein. She points out one of the hotels on the waterfront, where Dostoevsky stayed, gambling so heavily he had to sell his wife’s wedding ring. But we’re not here for literary anecdotes; my son is restless for more physics. So we head for Bern and the Einstein trail – a two-hour train trip from Geneva. Bern is a fairytale city, one of the smallest capitals in Europe, with medieval spires and cobbled streets. Threading through it like a green ribbon is the star of the city, the river Aare, where people swim, paddleboard and kayak in its opal waters. Einstein moved to Bern in 1903 for two years, living with his wife Mileva Marić and son Hans Einstein. In a modest apartment on the third floor of a narrow house, he developed the theory of relativity. Einstein was certainly in the right place to contemplate the nature of time. From his sitting room window he would have heard the Zytglogge clock tower striking the hour. Built in the early 13th century, the clockwork mechanism was the pride of Bern and one of the most advanced in Europe. It still has to be wound by hand each day. A 20-minute walk across the city from his apartment is the Einstein Museum. Small but informative, it features pages of his febrile scrawl, formulae and equations. There is more about the man himself, too, his interests and passions: social justice, civil rights, pacifism and… falling in love. Those he loved, along with his two wives, included, apparently, a physicist, a spy, a librarian and “perhaps” a nightclub dancer. We wander back along the river to our hotel, Hotel Allegro, which has lovely views across the old town. My son stays put and I’m sent on an errand, a trip to McDonald’s instead of a pricy supper – barely a saving at 20 Swiss Francs (£16), and that’s only for him. The next evening is more opulent: mushroom soup and rosti in the candlelit baroque splendour of Kornhauskeller, an old wine cellar with frescoed vaulted ceilings. Early the next morning, we take a tour of the clock tower, climbing the steep medieval stairs for an impressive view across the ancient tiled roofs of the city, then a look at the clock mechanism itself. An intricate structure of cogs and wheels, it is powered by a pendulum that has marked each second for the past 800 years, the perfect point to end our adventure in time. Way to go One-way flights on Swiss International Air Lines start from £74 to Zurich and £83 to Geneva. The Swiss Travel System provides a range of travel passes and also includes the Swiss Museum Pass, with free entrance to 500 museums and exhibitions. Prices from £185 for 3 days in second class.

          "bodyText": "Many years ago, while wearing a Navajo jacket, I was accused of cultural appropriation. I told the zealot harassing me the jacket was a gift from a Native American shaman-clown, under whom I had studied. She backed down, humiliated, like Major General Arthur St Clair before the forces of Little Turtle and the Potawatomi, at the Battle of a Thousand Slain, on 4 November 1791. My accuser and I began a short but tempestuous relationship, based on the thrill of committing ever more offensive ideological thought crimes. One sick night, I imagined a public library with deliberately inadequate disabled access, while she made a scale model of a unisex toilet and then vandalised it. Within weeks, our imaginary atrocities exhausted, our twisted affair ended. But I realised there may have been some truth in my ex-lover’s accusations of cultural insensitivity. Luckily, I still had the receipt for the jacket and so I returned the racist garment to Camden market, where I had bought it while shopping drunk months earlier. The idea of “cultural appropriation” is a minefield, especially in the “political correctness gone mad” times that we live in now, in today’s “politically correct” world of “so-called” “political correctness” “gone mad”. But I don’t doubt for a moment that Michael Gove’s decision to quote the rap singer Stormzy in a tweet on Tuesday was without malice. If Gove isn’t a Stormzy fan how would the blotchy foundling know that the rapper’s hit Shut Up included the phrase “I set the trends dem man copy”? Daniel Hannanananananananan’s decision to reply to Gove’s tweet with the emphatic urban phrase “Big man ting!” is less easy to justify. As the words do not relate to a specific Stormzy lyric, one can only assume Hannanananananananan thought them appropriate simply because Stormzy is black. It would be interesting to see if Hannanananananananan felt comfortable saying “Big man ting!” in person to a black person – Sir Trevor McDonald, Lizzo, Anthony Braxton, or Michelle Obama for example – while explaining his views on Brexit. “Absolutely nobody is talking about threatening our position in the single market. Big man ting!” In short, would a “Big man ting” in the mouth of Daniel Hannanananananananan seem uncomfortable, or would it be a perfect fit, as if it had always belonged there? In the interests of full disclosure I must confess that I sing some Stormzy in my current show, Snowflake/Tornado. A line from Crown, “heavy is the head that wears the crown”, helps the audience understand the pressures I have faced since the Times declared me the “world’s greatest living standup”. But no one has suggested that I am racist quoting Stormzy, perhaps because I do not work for a man who has called black people “picaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”. Minds immeasurably superior to mine have suggested that Gove’s controversy-generating tweet was manufactured on his behalf by culturally savvy Conservative content providers, primed to cause plausible online distractions while dog-whistling to the coveted Arsehole Vote, historically a key part of any Tory victory. But Dominic Tosser Raab explained last week he thinks “people don’t give a … er … toss about social media”, which is why his party doesn’t spend money on re-editing news footage to smear their opponents online. Except that it does. Never mind. Tosser is probably confused, like when he didn’t know the difference between sea and land. And anyway, if the Conservatives wanted to woo arseholes, they could just let Jacob Rees-Mogg open his mouth, instead of hiding him on a remote Somerset fen, like the flesh-eating recluse played by Don Henderson in The Ghoul (Freddie Francis, 1975), who said his hitchhiker victims deserved to be cooked and eaten because they lacked the common sense to not be cooked and eaten. It is likely that Gove, however, feels a genuine connection to Stormzy. Both men, for example, have been accused of using class A drugs, a charge Stormzy denies. But a young black man accused of class A usage would face the full force of the law, whereas an elderly white Conservative politician like Gove can admit to having snuffled as much cocaine as he likes and the offence is soon forgotten. Least said soonest mended, I always say. Gove was further traduced for saying Stormzy, who supported the Grenfell fire victims and funds scholarships to Cambridge University, should leave politics alone because he is “a far, far better rapper than he is a political analyst”. Black people, it seems, need to carry on singing and dancing for their masters and leave the thinking to big brains like Michael Gove. But is this interpretation of Gove’s words unfair? What if Gove is such a Stormzy fan that he is afraid he will lose his idol from music to politics, and then there will be no more of the rap music that he loves? Is Gove trying to put Stormzy back in the black box simply because he loves him too much? If the online comment sewer is flowing beneath this piece this week, doubtless readers will ask why this column isn’t questioning the Labour party’s ongoing open-goal antisemitism shambles. This is a legitimate criticism, except that we have the entire rest of the media to ask that question repeatedly while, as usual, the Conservatives’ relentless top-down racism remains relatively unexamined. It’s a startling fact that 25% of the prison population is from a BAME background, whereas none of it is from parliament, perhaps due to the unequal systems of punishment Gove’s non-conviction proves are in play. Had Gove been imprisoned for his drug offences, as he should have been, his fluency in urban slang would have been a great asset inside. “Ah! Stop it!! It hurts!!! My haggis nozzle!!!! Big man ting!!!!!” Extra London dates of Stewart Lee’s latest live show, Snowflake/Tornado, have just been announced at the South Bank Centre in June and July, and it tours nationally from January"

          "bodyText": "* * * Jojo Moyes Shortlisted for novel of the year at the British Book awards for Still Me I often find it hard to remember what I’ve read, but Three Women by Lisa Taddeo (Bloomsbury, £16.99) scorched its way into my consciousness. A journalistic deep dive into the desires and love lives of three women over eight years, it turns on its head much of what you think about how we learn to love. Kate Weinberg’s debut, The Truants (Bloomsbury, £8.99), took eight years to write, and it shows in the multilayered characters and plot. It contains an image, a hearse in a wood, that stayed with me. If you’ve ever wanted to disappear from your own life, this book will speak to you. You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, £16.99) is another debut, but you’d never know it from the lean, beautiful prose. I was afraid this novel about violence through generations in South Africa would be too dark, but it pulls you in, breaks your heart and then ultimately repairs it. * * * Bernardine Evaristo Joint winner of the Booker prize for Girl, Woman, Other Taking Up Space: The Black Girl’s Manifesto for Change (Merky Books, £12.99) by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi is a groundbreaking and essential book about how it feels to be a young black woman studying in Britain’s white academic institutions. Zawe Ashton’s entertaining, fictionalised account of her life as an actor in Character Breakdown (Vintage, £16.99) is funny, revealing, shocking and inventively structured with conversations presented in script form. Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss (Granta, £8.99) is a slim novel about an iron age-obsessed man who takes his wife and daughter on a re-enaction holiday. It begins weirdly, ends badly and I loved it. * * * Casey Cep Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud and the Last Trial of Harper Lee I visited New Orleans for the first time on my book tour and was so grateful to have Sarah Broom’s The Yellow House (Little, Brown, £14.99) with me for the journey. It’s such a beautiful memoir, and it gives you a rich and complex portrait of the city. Her book, which will be published in the UK next year, has something in common with another nonfiction book I loved this year: Patrick Radden Keefe’s Say Nothing (HarperCollins, £9.99), which also uses one family’s story to tell a broader history – in this case, of the Troubles and all the disappeared. One of Keefe’s gifts is dramatising the individual decisions that collectively shape global history. I admired that same gift in Miriam Toews’s extraordinary Women Talking (Faber, £8.99), which is a fictional treatment of a horrific series of sexual crimes in a remote religious community. The novel is an understated but powerful look at how everyday people make sense of evil and violence – a truly beautiful, challenging portrait of moral discernment. * * * Mark Haddon Shortlisted for the Goldsmiths prize for The Porpoise Friday Black, a collection of short stories by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah (Quercus, £8.99), has the thrilling strangeness of George Saunders but driven by a deep and justified anger about the racism and violence that constitute the bedrock of American society. That makes it sound worthy. It isn’t. It’s a rollercoaster ride. Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport (Galley Beggar Press, £13.99) is usually described as “eight sentences of 1,000 pages”, which conjures an image of a forbidding avant garde doorstop in the manner of Thomas Bernhard. On the contrary, it is very funny, very readable and one of those novels that expand the possibilities of what a novel can be and do. Chris Ware is one of the great writers of our generation whose graphic novels make most novels (both the graphic and the regular kind) seem thin and simplistic. I spent 20 minutes reading the cover of Rusty Brown (Cape, £25). Buy it. Buy all his work. Make your life larger. * * * Raymond Antrobus Winner of the Rathbones Folio prize for The Perseverance Choosing three books from such a great year, particularly for poetry collections, is hard but there are three politically and lyrically compelling books that I think will remain relevant in the years ahead. The first is Surge by Jay Bernard (Chatto &amp; Windus, £10). Partly influenced by dub poets such as Linton Kwesi Johnson and Jean “Binta” Breeze, it is a book for the air and the page, speculating on the complicated history of the New Cross fire and Grenfell. The next is Deaf Republic by Ilya Kaminsky (Faber, £10.99), a book for our times and all times. A high lyric cautionary tale of fascism, which is part poetry, part fable, part play. Finally, After the Formalities by Anthony Anaxagorou (Penned in the Margins, £9.99), which speculates on race, family and immigration. * * * William Feaver Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for The Lives of Lucian Freud: Youth 1922-1968 William Dalrymple’s stupendous The Anarchy (Bloomsbury, £30) propels into focus the story of the East India Company’s takeover of Mughal India, an exercise of opportunism, violence, shamelessness and, at times, heroic greed. More immediate is Edna O’Brien’s Girl (Faber, £16.99), an unflinching parable: Heart of Darkness revisited with Boko Haram horrors recounted as incipient legend. For me, Michael Bird’s Artists’ Letters (White Lion Publishing, £20) has proved ideal dipping. Letters reproduced, transcribed and annotated yield rare insights: Leonardo (“I will assemble catapults”) with (Edward) Lear’s spelling (“fewcher thyme”) and Mondrian’s sore tooth. * * * Lucy Ellmann Winner of the Goldsmiths prize for Ducks, Newburyport Three Muslim women have surreal adventures in Leila Aboulela’s latest novel, Bird Summons (W&amp;N, £16.99), her wildest yet, full of her own take on myth, religion and womanhood. Aboulela, based in Aberdeen, deserves as big a following here as she has in Africa. Or bigger. Not strictly new, perhaps, but still terrific: Faber &amp; Faber has republished five Thomas Bernhard novels, shamefully out of print in the UK for 20 years. If you haven’t read Bernhard, you will not know of the most radical advance in fiction since Joyce. Bernhard’s influence is pervasive and his style riskily contagious. My advice: dive in. As for my third choice, am I allowed to choose a book I guest edited this year? It is the fourth and final volume of The Evergreen, a beautifully designed anthology of poetry and prose published by the Word Bank (£15), an indie based in Edinburgh’s Old Town. The latest issue, dedicated to the “future”, is devoted solely to writing by women and is international in flavour. Suzy Romer discusses the vital role of grandmothers in Spain, Kylie Grant revels in Glasgow’s litter and, in Monica Datta’s astounding Zus!, three young Dutch sisters decide to rustle up a canal system for the US. * * * Olivia Laing Winner of the James Tait Black memorial prize for fiction for Crudo Being increasingly future-averse, I was gripped by the title of I’ve Seen the Future and I’m Not Going by Peter McGough before I tracked down a copy (it’s only published in the US), but this memoir is truly fascinating; a rags-to-riches rollercoaster about the 1980s art boom in downtown New York. McGough wanted to escape the ugliness of the 20th century by retreating to the past; meanwhile, in Mother Ship (Vintage, £14.99), novelist Francesca Segal celebrates the technological innovations that kept her twins, born 10 weeks prematurely, alive. It’s a song of praise to the beleaguered, indomitable NHS, with writing at such a pitch that it lingered with me all year. Speaking of enviable phrase-making, I was also smitten by music critic par excellence Ian Penman’s It Gets Me Home, This Curving Track (Fitzcarraldo, £12.99), a collection of dazzling, singular essays on Prince, James Brown, Sinatra, Elvis that gets to the heart of why music exerts such a strange power in our lives. * * * Hilary McKay Winner of the Costa children’s book award for The Skylarks’ War For me, 2019 has been a year of fantasy and folk tales, both new and retold, in every age group. For children, Lampie and the Children of the Sea (Pushkin Press, £12.99) by Annet Schaap stood out. Lampie, the daughter of a lighthouse keeper, is a girl of great and grumpy courage, with a salty way with words. One day she forgets to buy matches and the lighthouse lantern doesn’t shine. So begins a dark-and-stormy-night of a fairytale that I absolutely loved. For adults, my choice is poetry: The Women Left Behind (Dempsey &amp; Windle, £10) by Imogen Russell Williams. Rapunzel’s witch; Blodeuwedd, who was shaped from flowers; and Romeo’s Rosaline, among many others – English literature forgot them, closed the door and turned away. Now at last we have their voices: wry, lamenting, vengeful, witty, bright, magnificent. Last, a book for everyone: Deeplight (Pan Macmillan, £9.99) by Frances Hardinge. A stunning new ocean mythology of friendship and lost gods, it’s complex, engrossing and gorgeously written, and kept me reading until past 3am but was worth it, over and over. * * * Melissa Harrison Winner of the European Union prize for literature for All Among the Barley I was dazzled by Sandra Newman’s The Heavens (Granta, £12.99), which had a time-travel premise (and a noteworthy cameo) that really shouldn’t have worked but absolutely did. How she pulled it off is anyone’s guess, but it left me hugely envious of her confidence and skill. Into a stagnating UK marketplace for memoirs about place came Jessica J Lee’s beautiful Two Trees Make a Forest: On Memory, Migration and Taiwan (Little, Brown, £16.99). Lee is editor of the Willowherb Review, publishing nature writing by writers of colour, including Nina Mingya Powles, winner of the inaugural Nan Shepherd prize. Lisa Taddeo’s Three Women (Bloomsbury, £16.99) dives deep into the erotic lives of three women, using source material collected over hundreds of hours of interviews. The resulting account of the awakening, distortion and expression of desire in three very different lives is insightful, devastating and utterly unforgettable. * * * Lindsey Hilsum Winner of the James Tait Black memorial prize for biography with In Extremis: The Life of War Correspondent Marie Colvin It’s been a year of disinformation, but Peter Pomerantsev has given us a guide in This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality (Faber, £14.99). By dissecting the techniques governments use to create myths and sow confusion, he shows how the freedom of expression his parents sought when they fled the Soviet Union is now used to justify twisting the truth. No such tricks in Our Women on the Ground: Essays By Arab Women Reporting from the Middle East, edited by Zahra Hankir (Harvill Secker, £14.99), which showcases journalism at its bravest. Determination, grit and humour shine through the writing of reporters who frequently face opposition from their own families. Maybe fiction is the best respite from strife and the ever more difficult daily task of telling facts from falsehoods. Mark Haddon’s The Porpoise (Chatto and Windus, £18.99) reworks legend with the compelling force of a thriller. Here, myth is not a distraction, but the key to a deeper truth. * * * Muhammad Khan Winner of the Branford Boase award for I Am Thunder Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas by Adam Kay (Picador, £9.99) is a fun-size follow-up to the wildly popular This Is Going to Hurt. More stories from the frontline of the NHS that will hit you in the feels and also have you ho-ho-hoing over the festive season. Patrice Lawrence’s Rose, Interrupted (Hachette, £7.99) is a marvellous novel that explores what life is like for a pair of siblings after they are excommunicated from a strict religious sect. Rose seeks freedom, while her brother Rudder seeks redemption. Rounding out my top three is Fearscape: Vol 1 by Ryan O’Sullivan (Vault Comics, £15.99) – a comically dark and witty graphic novel with a narrator who is unreliable, delusional and downright despicable. Once a generation the Muse travels to Earth to take our greatest storyteller back with her to battle fear-creatures. But then she mistakes Henry, a shameless plagiarist, for the best and all hell breaks loose. * * * Sally Nicholls Shortlisted for the Carnegie medal for Things a Bright Girl Can Do My eldest started school in September, so education has been very much on my mind. I devoured Kate Clanchy’s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me (Picador, £16.99) therefore. Covering everything from uniform to off-rolling, this is an incredibly readable memoir of 30 years as an English teacher and poet. I also enjoyed Emma Darwin’s This Is Not a Book About Charles Darwin (Holland House, £14.99), an exploration of her failure to write a novel about her famous ancestor and his illustrious family. Finding the spaces in real history to tell a fictional story is a problem I am very familiar with. Recommended. Finally, I’ve never read a Hilary McKay novel I didn’t love, and The Time of Green Magic (Macmillan, £12.99) was no exception. This story of blended families and a house where books come to life would make a perfect Christmas present for any bookish nine- to 12-year-old. * * * Bart van Es Winner of the Costa book of the year award for The Cut Out Girl Over the last few years I have become fascinated by so-called autofiction: books that read like novels (with dialogue, metaphors and precise descriptions) but which are also, at some level, memoirs or autobiographies. Rachel Cusk is a master of the genre and her collection of sharp, provocative essays, Coventry (Faber, £14.99), the follow-up to her Outline trilogy, had me transfixed. I also loved Will by the Flemish author Jeroen Olyslaegers (Pushkin, £14.99), which tells the story of Antwerp under Nazi occupation. The narrator, a policeman who both resists and collaborates in the Holocaust, is a brilliant, morally complex creation. Will is now out in a fine translation and is a compelling read. Finally, Greta Thunberg’s collection of speeches, No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference (Penguin, £2.99), is simple and truthful. She inspired me to join the Extinction Rebellion protests earlier this year. * * * Elizabeth Acevedo Winner of the Carnegie medal for The Poet X For Black Girls Like Me by Mariama J Lockington (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux Inc, £13.99) is a story about a transracial adoptee that had me tearing up, gasping and rooting for the main character, Makeda. It stretched my imagination about the kinds of tough topics a young person can handle reading about. I am so thankful for this honest, gorgeous book. Natasha Diaz’s novel Color Me In (Penguin Random House, £13.99), about a black Jewish poet in Harlem undergoing her bat mitzvah, is such a good book focused on faith, race, rites of passage and the way that young people have to learn not only to stand up for themselves, but also for their communities, especially when they belong to communities that wield power over others. Jacqueline Woodson’s latest novel, Red at the Bone (W&amp;N, £14.99), is a beast of a book; a masterclass on pace, characterisation and how a writer can be flexible. You’ll find yourself rooting for every character, and hurting for them as well. * * * Elif Shafak Shortlisted for the Booker prize for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World One of my favourite books this year has been Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism (Profile, £10.99). It is a stunning research on “information civilisation”, concentration of power and the sinister exploitation of our data at the expense of our freedom, which are no doubt some of the most pressing issues of our times. But more than that, this is a fascinating and wise and honest exploration of what it means to be human in the digital age and why we need to fight back. Technology is way too important to leave it to tech companies, which are clearly becoming tech monopolies. We all need to become part of this important discussion, and for that to happen, we need to ask the right questions. This book is a brilliant way to do that. I loved Helon Habila’s Travelers (Penguin, £12.99). Such a wonderful gem. The book is composed of several stories of people from completely different backgrounds – students, academics, outcasts; these are heartbreaking but equally life-affirming tales that might seem separate at first, but then beautifully connect and intertwine in the end, leaving us longing for more. Where is home, where does exile start or does it ever end? I would also wholeheartedly recommend Lemn Sissay’s My Name Is Why (Canongate, £16.99). This powerful and unflinchingly honest memoir has so much to say about the failures of our system and the silences of our society – being black, being in foster care, the struggle for identity, belonging, equality and dignity... A must-read book for anyone who refuses to be “defined by darkness” and injustice. James Clarke Winner of the Betty Trask award for The Litten Path Elizabeth Hardwick’s shimmering melancholia Sleepless Nights was given a crisp reissue in 2019 (Faber, £8.99), 40 years after it was first published, and it’s my book of the year. It’s a dream slideshow, part memoir, part missive, part fiction, a work of lasting beauty that guides you through the mysteries, and tragedies of people the narrator has known and loved: the literary equivalent of polished onyx. This Is Pleasure by Mary Gaitskill (Profile Books, £7.99) tells the story of an influential publisher brought down in a sexual misconduct scandal. It’s a stunningly written, arch look at transgression and our need to feel understood and confided in, and in an age of calling out groping men who think they can hide behind their money, it’s of the moment too. Nobber by Oisin Fagan (John Murray, £12.99) is the book about medieval Ireland I never knew I wanted. Plague-ridden, trippy and violent, it’s uniquely told and full of startling images. * * * Diana Evans Winner of the South Bank Sky Arts award and shortlisted for the Orwell prize, the Women’s prize for fiction and the Rathbones Folio prize for Ordinary People Hair is no small subject for the African diaspora, indeed for the history of colonialism and imperialism, which pretty much includes all of us, so I’ve been pleasantly engrossed this autumn in Emma Dabiri’s excellent nonfiction debut Don’t Touch My Hair (Allen Lane, £16.99). Part memoir, part spiky, thoroughly researched sociopolitical analysis, it delves deep into the painful realities and history of follicular racism while offering useful maintenance tips in the process. Of the poetry I’ve been reading this year, Anthony Anaxagorou’s second collection, After the Formalities (Penned in the Margins, £9.99), stands out for its sharp and beguiling, imaginative scope and the endlessly surprising electricity of its language: “I can fit my childhood into a fist”; “there’s a kind of shaking the living perform”. And speaking of imaginative scope, there are few writers who possess quite the boundless daring of Irenosen Okojie, whose second collection of short stories, Nudibranch (Little, Brown, £14.99), is dazzling, a feast for the senses, as well as a lesson in both creative and existential bravery. * * * Stuart Turton Winner of the Costa first novel award for The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle Let’s start with The Hug by Eoin McLaughlin and Polly Dunbar (Faber, £6.99), because it’s utterly lovely. It’s a children’s book I read to my young daughter, and it makes her face light up every time she hears it. Reading to give somebody else pleasure isn’t a thing I’ve done before, but it’s surprisingly wonderful. The Porpoise by Mark Haddon (Chatto &amp; Windus, £18.99) is the book I’ve recommended the most this year, because it’s the one I had the most fun with. It kept shifting as I read it, changing from action to romance to science-fiction. It’s dizzying. And then there’s A History of the Bible: The Book and Its Faiths by John Barton (Allen Lane, £25). I was brought up Roman Catholic and I’m fascinated/annoyed by the way religion still entangles itself in my thought processes, long past the point I stopped believing in any of it. This book has helped unpick some of my mental knots. * * * Chigozie Obioma Shortlisted for the Booker prize for An Orchestra of Minorities Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport (Galley Beggar Press, £13.99) stretches the imagination and brings to the universe it seeks to recreate such intensity of purpose and flamboyance that one would be hard-pressed to think of any other word other than “original” to describe it. I very much admired Yiyun Li’s Where Reasons End (Hamish Hamilton, £12.99), a highly unusual novel in which a writer confronts one of life’s deepest sorrows in losing her child. It is a conceptual novel that challenges the form, but the exchanges between the mother and son are funny, touching and profoundly moving. Perhaps one of the most underrated novels of the year is Novuyo Rosa Tshuma’s House of Stone (Atlantic, £8.99), an expansive tale that celebrates a nation through a central character. Were it written about any western country, this novel would have been much talked about, but we are talking Zimbabwe here. It is an ambitious and daring novel from a promising writer. * * * Will Eaves Winner of the Wellcome book prize for Murmur. Also shortlisted for the James Tait Black memorial prize for fiction The Library of Ice (Scribner, £9.99), Nancy Campbell’s essay on art, science and life in the Arctic, has the direct seriousness of the early Pelican nonfiction list. It’s wittily arranged, too: one section segues from Bill Jacklin’s Rink mural at Washington airport to Noel Streatfeild’s White Boots, and thence to Torvill and Dean’s 1980s figure-skating routines. With a similar associative light touch, Ian Sansom’s September 1, 1939 (4th Estate, £16.99) invokes Vladimir Nabokov and Ed Sheeran to illuminate WH Auden’s famous poem. The book is also a homage to Auden’s aphoristic prose, and such identification with another has its own point to make: an artistic persona, necessarily half borrowed, can take you so far, but the work itself must stay truthful. These distinctions are caught, beautifully and unexpectedly, in novelist Paul Bailey’s first collection of poems, Inheritance (CB Editions, £8.99), about age and self-consciousness, in which the shedding of one literary skin reveals another. Claire Adam Winner of the Desmond Elliott prize for Golden Child Here are three recent books that, once opened, I couldn’t put down. I came across the essay collection Constellations by Sinéad Gleeson (Picador, £16.99) in the bookshop of the British Library: I’d put aside the day for my own work and ended up standing by the display table, getting in everyone’s way, turning page after page, quite unable to tear myself away. Self-Portrait, Celia Paul’s memoir (Jonathan Cape, £20), I read on my Kindle, until two in the morning when I should have been asleep; it was the photograph of the artist in a bare room that drew me in – how I wished my life afforded me that bare room. Finally, Lemn Sissay’s memoir, My Name Is Why (Canongate, £16.99), which I read in one compulsive sitting: a book that reminds me, as it should remind us all, that the state of childhood is a state of profound vulnerability. * * * Tommy Orange Shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio prize for There There The three books I enjoyed reading the most in 2019 are Ocean Vuong’s On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous (Vintage, £12.99), Valeria Luiselli’s Lost Children Archive (4th Estate, £16.99), and Samanta Schweblin’s Mouthful of Birds (Oneworld, £12.99). Ocean’s novel because it is just so very full of beauty and power. Also, grace. Valeria’s novel because it is exquisitely smart, funny and thrilling, and Samanta’s stories because they are so new and strange and good. Her collection makes me want to use the trite and overused descriptor Kafkaesque, but I won’t. * * * Hallie Rubenhold Winner of the Baillie-Gifford prize for The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed By Jack the Ripper Top of my list is Lisa Taddeo’s Three Women (Bloomsbury, £16.99). The best stories are often true ones; an intimate examination of three women’s sex lives is a seductive subject in itself, but the sumptuous and visceral writing made this book an enthralling read. Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments (Chatto &amp; Windus, £20) provided the perfect escapist pleasure, cleverly knitting together strands from both her novel The Handmaid’s Tale and its television adaptation. Observing Atwood work with two storytelling mediums has been an education. Lara Maiklem’s Mudlarking (Bloomsbury, £18.99) is testimony to the beauty of micro-history and how small objects and unknown figures are capable of telling large, panoramic stories. In this case, the author has constructed a history of London from artefacts found on the Thames foreshore. * * * Julia Lovell Shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford prize for Maoism: A Global History I’ve chosen three books that make us see the world in new, connected ways. William Dalrymple’s The Anarchy (Bloomsbury, £30) tells the extraordinary story of how the East India Company became a ruthless colonising power that throughout the 18th century effectively ended Mughal control of India. The book is a powerful, timely reminder of the dangerous power of corporate excess. Toby Green’s A Fistful of Shells (Allen Lane, £30) uses a global archive – in Africa, the Americas and Europe – to explore the complex, flourishing and connected economy of West Africa existing long before a European capitalist system established itself on the continent. Extraordinarily written and researched, the book paints a huge, complex canvas, filled with individual detail. Azadeh Moaveni’s Guest House for Young Widows (Scribe UK, £16.99) brilliantly illuminates the transnational lives and choices of women who joined Isis. Resting on interviews across Europe and the Middle East, it subtly, carefully explains how such women took the path they did. * * * David Keenan Winner of the Gordon Burn award for For the Good Times The most incredible book I read this year was Paul Kingsnorth’s Savage Gods (Little Toller, £14), a dramatic self-accounting that explodes “nature writing” to strain at the limits of language itself. Kingsnorth charts the breakdown of his faith in words, in nature as an uncomplicated restorative, in the idea of “progress”, while fearlessly tracking his conclusions to their very ends. This is a writer – and a writer that burns – attempting to cure himself of writing, on the page, and it leads to some profound, and just as often jaw-dropping, insights. Kingsnorth’s two novels, The Wake and Beast, were masterpieces. But it’s hard to imagine where he might go after this. Nowhere, perhaps. My favourite novel was Bindlestiff by Wayne Holloway (Influx Press, £9.99), a riotous, high-energy vision of future America and contemporary Hollywood that is dizzying in its imagination as it jumps between prose and film script and tears through modes and genres with a high modernist glee and a rock’n’roll swagger. My favourite short story collection was Wendy Erskine’s Sweet Home (Picador, £12.99). The prose is amazing, the dialogue perfect; Erskine is attuned to the momentous surrealism of everyday life in contemporary Belfast, where different rules continue to apply. * * * Lesley Nneka Arimah Winner of the Caine prize for African fiction for Skinned Sabrina &amp; Corina by Kali Fajardo-Anstine (Random House USA Inc, £22.50) is a gem of a short story collection that evinces enviable skill and a broad range as Fajardo-Anstine unfolds both sweeping and intimate stories of indigenous and Latin experiences in the American west. House of Stone by Novuyo Rosa Tshuma (Atlantic, £8.99) is a literary, historical page-turner - a tall order that Tshuma achieves in this exceptional debut. There are several gasp-out-loud twists and a narrator who charms and offends in equal measure, even as the novel thoughtfully examines a brutal period in Zimbabwe’s history. Tressie McMillan Cottom is a genius. In Thick and Other Essays (New Press, £13.99) she articulates America’s social dimensions in regards to race, gender, education and class with a studied consideration born of intensive research, shored with the digestibility of personal experience. I have long been a fan of her work and Thick delivered beyond my already high expectations. * * * Caroline Criado Perez Winner of Books Are My Bag readers’ choice award and Royal Society insight investment science book prize for Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men This has been a bumper year for dog-related memoirs and while obviously I loved them all (all dog memoirs are good girls), Lost Dog: A Love Story by Kate Spicer (Ebury, £16.99) was my favourite. Funny, touching and absolutely right about the redeeming power of the pooch. A doggy page-turner: I read it straight through in two days. Fleishman Is in Trouble by Taffy Brodesser-Akner (Wildfire, £18.99) was a minute, unsparing examination of the breakdown of a marriage. I kept having to stop to take pictures of passages (some of which ran on for pages) to send to friends because it was just too accurate. Sad, mad and funny. Also features a bonus dog. The bombshell revelation of Becoming Beauvoir (Bloomsbury, £20), Kate Kirkpatrick’s excellent biography of Simone de Beauvoir, is the bowdlerisation of The Second Sex by the man who translated this seminal feminist text into English. HM Parshley cut De Beauvoir’s analysis of housework and references to women’s anger, along with 78 women’s names from the women’s history section. He kept in references to men’s feelings, though. * * * Leila Slimani Winner of the British book awards fiction debut award for Lullaby Muhammad Abdelnabi is one of the most brilliant Egyptian authors today and rightly received the Arab literature prize for La chambre de l’araignée (In the Spider’s Room) (the American University in Cairo Press, £9.99). He is the first Arab writer to explore homosexuality so sincerely and extensively. His novel was inspired by a very famous case in Egypt: in 2001, 52 men were arrested in a nightclub because of their sexuality. The author adopts the point of view of one of them so the reader becomes effectively embedded in the gay community of a country where homosexuals are systematically persecuted. This beautifully written and poetic book moved me to tears; it is an ode to freedom and a real act of bravery. The Sport of Kings by CE Morgan (4th Estate, £16.99) was translated into French in January 2019. It tells the story of a redemption and is a declaration of love to horses. I was really impressed by the author’s style and lyricism and the way she described violence inside a family and between social classes. The Other Americans by Laila Lalami (Bloomsbury Circus, £16.99) is probably one of the most powerful books I’ve read these past few years on immigration and the US. I experienced the same pleasure reading it as I got from the great classical novels I read as a teenager. Its variety of characters and scenes makes it hard to categorise. The former seem so real, so alive, you can almost touch them; Lalami has a wonderful, very tender way of exploring their souls. * * * Tayari Jones Winner of the Women’s prize for fiction for An American Marriage One of my favourite novels of 2019 is You Will Be Safe Here by Damian Barr (Bloomsbury, £16.99), which is almost like two novels at once. The first half is an unflinching look at the second Boer war at the turn of the 20th century. Be warned; this is a demanding read. Any war, even one known as “the last gentlemen’s war”, is marked by unchecked brutality and Barr never lets us lose sight of the toll of the inhumanity inflicted on the Boers and that they inflict on the indigenous people of South Africa. Then, with grace and artistry, he weaves this story with that of a modern-day gay conversion camp that bears far too close a resemblance to the conditions of war. There is pain on these pages and poetry too. I left this book bruised yet somehow better for it. I also loved Patsy by Nicole Dennis-Benn (Oneworld, £16.99). It’s a story about mothers, daughters and the high price immigrants pay to change their lives. My final pick is a gorgeous collection of poetry by Jericho Brown. The Tradition (Pan Macmillan, £10.99) spins poetic gold from the exquisite pain and pleasure of being black in America."

          "bodyText": "Ice is just cold, solid water, of course; essential for cocktails, and the survival of the planet. One-tenth of Earth’s land surface is covered in it, and up to 15% of the ocean for part of the year; one quarter of the land has ice buried in it year round. This unique substance – volatile, ancient, quick, slow, frightening and beautiful – creates spaces at the reaches of the earth and of the imagination that we can’t resist returning to. It invites simile. It slips out of our grasp. Tarjei Vesaas’s unsettling and lovely novel The Ice Palace, translated from the Norwegian by Elizabeth Rokkan, tells the story of an intense, half-understood bond between Siss and Unn, two schoolgirls. Full of longing and desire, “full of the unknown”, it is as dream-like and powerful as the frozen waterfall at its centre. Unn is lost, enchanted and disoriented by the chambers of this palace, by turns hostile and magnificent, and far too cold. Another short, strange novel of the 60s, Anna Kavan’s Ice is more nightmare than dream. It is set in a world of nameless, ruined cities, freezing seas and dark forests, in which some obscure disaster has precipitated environmental collapse. Communication is failing, the media can’t be trusted, conflict is rife, and ice is closing in, destroying everything in its path. The book falls somewhere between compelling spy thriller and cold war Kafka – there are overcoats, paranoia, police states and a white-haired girl that the narrator is senselessly pursuing … Accounts of polar expeditions are typically preoccupied by the impossible task of describing the infinite forms and variety, as well as the overwhelming magnitude, of the ice. The poles are the perfect realms in which to find the sublime. Francis Spufford’s first book, I May Be Some Time, traces the history of polar exploration and its place in the cultural imagination, in particular the attempts by explorers such as William Parry, John Franklin and Robert Falcon Scott to capture their experience. The book moves towards a vivid and chilling re-creation of that fateful expedition and those famous last words. Joanna Kavenna’s The Ice Museum is another work of non-fiction that pursues the idea of a remote, half-imagined north. Kavenna writes brilliantly about bleak, inhospitable places, and about the dangerous ideologies that can be written on the seeming blank page of a lost northern land – Thule has a place in Nazi mythology as the home of the Aryan race. She meets people who are struggling at the edges of the ice: displaced Inuit in Greenland, and environmental scientists on Svalbard, who measure the melting ice. Barry Lopez’s seminal work of nature writing Arctic Dreams finds his exacting, luminous prose focusing on the landscape of the north, the animals that live there and the peoples who populate it, on the complex beauty of the ways that life and landscape co-exist, and the fragility of that compact. The magnificent chapter “Ice and Light” is a study of the formation, appearance and varieties of Arctic ice. Written in the 1980s, this is a gorgeous yet austere, unsentimental book, which offers a prescient warning about human complacency towards Earth’s remaining wilderness. • Painter to the King by Amy Sackville is published by Granta."

          "bodyText": "Bill Shorten rose in the House on Thursday, immediately after another bruising question time focused on the Angus Taylor imbroglio, and just before Pauline Hanson theatrically stiffed Scott Morrison on the union integrity bill, to ask a simple question – Who is responsible for this mistake? Who will own the consequences of this botch-up seems a quaint sort of question to ask in politics these days. It implies that people in public life remain accountable for things, despite the steady erosion in standards, despite the tendency of some in politics to manufacture their own facts when the truth gets uncomfortable. Shorten was speaking in this particular instance about robodebt, which in many respects is the most gobsmacking story of the political week. A quick recap in case these events flew under your radar. The Morrison government on Wednesday settled a landmark challenge to its robodebt program, conceding a $2,500 debt raised against Deanna Amato, a 34-year-old local government employee, was not lawful because it relied on income averaging. As a prelude to the main event, the week before the government suddenly abandoned sole reliance on income averaging to calculate debts, in the process dismantling a central plank of the robodebt program’s controversial automation which has seen tens of thousands of welfare recipients overcharged for their alleged debts. Just in case you’ve never grappled with robodebt before, if you’ve missed the litany of horror stories about systemic indignities visited on our fellow, often vulnerable, humans (and the case studies are truly horrible), at the simplest level the scheme works like this, in two parts: the government sends benefit recipients letters claiming there’s a discrepancy, which escalates to a debt; but a number of these alleged debts have been over-egged because of the income-averaging formula. The Australian Council of Social Service is one of many advocacy groups that has been trying to tell the government for yonks there are two fundamental flaws in the scheme: the income averaging, which inflates debts; and reversing the onus of proof, meaning people hit with debt notices have to prove their innocence rather than the commonwealth proving that money is owing. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Just a bit more background about the system quickly before we move on (and this one is a mind-focusing statistic): Acoss says before robodebt commenced, the government would typically investigate and pursue around 20,000 overpayments each year, but once the semi-automated scheme took effect, debt collection increased to 20,000 overpayments each week. Back to Shorten now. The former Labor leader has grabbed the robodebt cause with both hands since losing the election in May and taking the shadow portfolio of government services. As I’ve flagged, concerns about the scheme aren’t new. There has been a persistent chorus of very respectable voices, including a former administrative appeals tribunal senior member, Terry Carney, pointing out for some time that robodebt is likely unlawful – that the commonwealth has been raising money that it is not entitled to raise. Shorten’s specific contribution to the mounting pressure was strapping some booster jets to those arguments, rustling up a class action by Gordon Legal challenging the legality of the scheme. When he launched the class action, Shorten said it was time to test “the legal foundations of robodebt, because my own research in the last couple of months has led me to believe it is almost certainly illegal”. When he spoke to parliament on Thursday, Shorten pointed out that if the transgressor was a major bank, if the bank sent customers hundreds of thousands of letters demanding money unlawfully, the government in Canberra would be outraged. There would be calls for the chief executive, or the chairman, to go. But if the government was actually the bank in this analogy, then things obviously become more complicated. If the government screws up, does it chastise itself? Does it become outraged by its own ineptitude and cruelty? Does it write a thunderous opinion column in the Daily Telegraph, flogging itself? Well, no, it doesn’t. Shorten then directed a bunch of practical questions to government MPs across the chamber. These would have been uncomfortable, in the event anyone was listening rather than wondering how quickly they escape to the airport after the final sitting day of the penultimate sitting week. “What are you in the government going to tell people who have been served notices which may be unlawful; what are you going to tell them to do? Are you going to tell them to seek a refund? Are you going to tell them to join a class action, or are you going to tell them, go away, I’m not apologising for anything. These are the questions now arising out of this case.” There are other questions too. The most obvious one to ask is how long have senior figures in the government known robodebt is a house of cards? Given the voices critiquing the scheme were respectable, persistent, and loud enough to have registered, did anyone listen? Did anyone (minister, ministerial adviser, bureaucrat) think, bugger me, that Carney bloke from the AAT, that emeritus professor, might actually know something about social security law, perhaps we ought to check this out just to be prudent? Is it actually possible nobody listened, or checked properly, until the legal actions started piling up? It blows my mind that this could have happened, because I have a deep respect for the institutions of government in this country. They give every appearance of being competent. But if no one listened or acted in this case, that’s negligent. What will be the costs to taxpayers of any wilful deafness in officialdom? Astonishingly in the circumstances, rather than embarking on a defensive retreat, my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes revealed in August the government was actually looking to push forward with this system, targeting thousands of pensioners and other “sensitive” welfare recipients under a proposed expansion of the wretched scheme – an expansion that was needed to chase $2.1bn in budget savings. In contemplation was chasing people aged 65 and over, people living in remote areas, people who were homeless, and people with disabilities. According to the documents Henriques-Gomes obtained, the department was chasing the money. It needed to carry out an additional 1.6m income reviews over the next three years to reach the promised savings from the scheme, including 350,000 debt-recovery reviews among “sensitive” or vulnerable groups. The minister currently responsible for this debacle, Stuart Robert, has been arguing, Black Knight style, that the setbacks of the past fortnight are just a flesh wound, that only a “small cohort” is affected by what is obviously a colossal botch-up. But my colleague Paul Karp has reported that human services staff have been told that up to 600,000 of the 900,000 robodebts that have been issued used income averaging. As a consequence, those cases will need to be reassessed, and more than 220,000 may require refunds or waivers. Given this, Shorten wondered on Thursday whether the government would have to rehire public servants bundled out during various efficiency rounds to review the suspect cases. Let’s land this weekend by cutting to the chase. The first thing to say is it’s an entirely uncontroversial principle for a government to pursue debts in cases of overpayment. We all need Australia’s welfare system to be fair, transparent, targeted and fiscally sustainable. But robodebt was hatched for a simple, clinical purpose: to return money to the budget at a time when the budget was firmly in the red. Viewed through the lens of the budget papers, robodebt was about supplying magic billions to the bottom line so the government wouldn’t have to cut spending or raise taxes in ways that might have cost it votes. Brutal, but true. Better to go after people you like to characterise as spongers on the public purse than people who might get angry enough with you to vote for someone else. With that heart-warming, life-affirming thought in mind, here’s my last observation. It is possible that a scheme that was meant to be a hollow log in budgetary terms, a vacuum cleaner for hoovering cash into the commonwealth coffers, could actually end up being a drain on the budget. Imagine that: a scheme hatched to be a money printing machine for the commonwealth winds up costing taxpayers. It’s hard to know whether that is ironic, or just unconscionable. I strongly suspect it’s the latter. Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"

          "headline": "University of Western Australia lashed for partnership with fossil fuel companies",
          "bodyText": "The University of Western Australia is facing criticism over a partnership with fossil fuel companies that promises to help the gas industry expand into remote fields that have so far been too costly to develop. Western Australian premier Mark McGowan praised the creation of what is known as the Centre for Long Subsea Tiebacks, a partnership between the university and Chevron and Woodside, which are contributing $600,000 a year. A statement posted on the state government and the university’s websites says the centre will focus on how to improve “tiebacks” – connections between new oil and gas fields and existing production facilities – in hostile deep-sea conditions. It follows the establishment of other recent university-industry partnerships designed to help the state’s liquified natural gas (LNG) operations, which have grown rapidly over the past five years to be a significant employer and major export industry. The LNG expansion has been repeatedly blamed for increasing national greenhouse gas emissions. A report released this week by Climate Analytics, a Berlin-based science and policy organisation, found emissions from the industry in WA had more than tripled since 2005 and, unless they were addressed, were likely to have risen by a factor of six compared to that year by 2030. Launching the centre, McGowan said bringing more oil and gas projects online would position the state as a global energy leader. It would also mean more jobs for Western Australians. “That’s my government’s number one priority,” he said. The Conservation Council of Western Australia said the centre would be damaging to global efforts to tackle the climate crisis and at odds with the McGowan government’s commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. Piers Verstegen, the council’s director, contrasted the announcement of the partnership with the release this week of the United Nations Environment Programme’s annual emissions gap report, which found global CO2 needed to be reduced by 7.6% a year over the next decade to limit industrial global warming to 1.5C. “The technology this program aims to develop will not only breach our own carbon emissions goals here in Australia, but will aid the development of extreme and remote fossil fuel deposits globally, ensuring that global temperatures are pushed far beyond safe levels,” he said. Alex Gardner, a professor and environmental lawyer at the University of Western Australia, said the centre was just part of what was broad backing from the university sector for the petroleum industry. He said he acknowledged universities and academics should be free to research and teach according to their choices. But he said there did not seem to be a discussion about how the continuing expansion of the LNG industry fit within Australia’s emissions budget if it was to play its part in meeting the goals set at the UN Paris conference in 2015. “My concern is that I don’t see a framework, either by the government or by the university sector, that considers how this research and project investment will affect Australia’s capacity to meet its Paris agreement commitments,” Gardner said. Climate Analytics’ chief executive, Bill Hare, said up to 75% of the WA LNG industry’s climate pollution over the next 30 years could be avoided, but it would require the state to regulate to ensure that at least 80% of emissions from gas wells were captured and stored. He said the industry also needed to replace natural gas used in manufacturing LNG with renewable energy over the next decade. “These things are possible now, but will not be implemented by the LNG industry without a carbon price or direct regulation by the state government,” Hare said. The announcement of the centre comes as Woodside leads plans to develop the long mooted Scarborough and Browse gas projects in northern WA. The WA government earlier this year rejected guidelines proposed by the state’s Environment Protection Authority that would have required new and expanding LNG projects to be carbon neutral. The state’s emissions have increased 24% since 2005. Announcing the centre, Dawn Freshwater, the university’s vice-chancellor, said it fulfilled the institution’s aim of serving the community and improving people’s lives. “Not only will it enhance Perth and WA as a centre of offshore engineering excellence, it aligns with [the university’s] plans to expand and strengthen global partnerships,” she said. Woodside’s chief executive, Peter Coleman, said: “We believe this partnership will play a crucial role in unlocking new gas resources off Western Australia’s north coast in support of our growth activities.” Chevron’s managing director, Al Williams, said the company was proud to partner with the university on the centre. In August, Williams announced that a carbon capture and storage project at Chevron’s Gorgon LNG development had begun operating after repeated delays stretching back to 2016. The company has previously estimated between 3.4m and 4m tonnes of carbon dioxide, about 40% of the emissions at Gorgon, could be buried each year. Government data released on Friday found national emissions dipped 0.1% in the year to June after drought and floods reduced greenhouse gas from agriculture. Emissions from LNG continued to rise."

          "bodyText": "20. Knight of Cups (2015) Terrence Malick films are never entirely without value, but this comes pretty close: a tiresomely self-indulgent and male-gazey homage to LA life, tricked out with Malick’s late-phase tics (whispery voiceovers, tremulous closeups, whirling cameras) that only restate the obtuseness of it all. From the poster and publicity material, you would think that Portman plays a key part here, but no: she’s one of the gallery of women with whom a writer, Christian Bale, attempts to find meaning in his life. Portman does quite a bit of moody frisking, from art gallery to hotel room to beach, but there’s not much to it. 19. V for Vendetta (2005) This has acquired quite a bit of lustre since its underwhelming reception on release: the adoption of its mask gag by the Occupy protesters was unexpected, as was its prescience in warning about a future fascist takeover (which seemed a remote prospect in the wholesome mid-oos. Presumably, the project’s political slant appealed to Portman’s liberal-activist side, but she is miscast as a British TV company minion who is rescued by – then becomes complicit with – the righteous terror-spreader, V. 18. The Other Boleyn Girl (2008) Portman and Scarlett Johansson: the 00s dream casting – somewhat thrown away, it has to be said, on this hey-nonny-nonny adaptation of Philippa Gregory’s history novel, which sought to establish Mary Boleyn as the slinkier of the two Tudor-era-entrancing sisters. Portman is queenly enough as the crafty Anne, but her charm doesn’t really come across in corset pictures; she never seems to merge effectively with historical backdrops. (For more evidence, see Goya’s Ghosts.) 17. Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) Having made her mark as a teen, Portman stepped up to the big leagues as Luke and Leia’s future mum, Padmé Amidala, in George Lucas’s revival of his space-opera trilogy. Probably the most eagerly awaited film of all time, this – as history records – turned out to be a serious embarrassment, for which Lucas has still not been forgiven. Despite having to cope with cumbersome kabuki-style costuming (and even more cumbersome dialogue), Portman survived the wreckage – even if Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith only prolonged the agony. 16. Song to Song (2017) Malick’s follow-up/companion piece to Knight of Cups is slightly less annoying than his earlier film: its female characters are less obviously ciphers, for one thing. Portman’s role is considerably more substantial: she plays the world’s most glamorous waitress, who is drawn into record producer Michael Fassbender’s sleazy world. Portman does quite a bit more moody frisking than in Cups; her character, though, has a decently weighty arc. 15. Léon (1994) Portman has spoken articulately about being the repository of problematic sexual fantasies – a “paedophile’s dream”, as the Guardian writer Simon Hattenstone bluntly put it – and this hitman thriller from Luc Besson is Exhibit A. Portman was 13 when she was required to prance around in slinky outfits and claim she was the lover of Jean Reno’s monosyllabic “cleaner” – and that was after her parents made Besson take out Portman’s original scenes of nudity and violence. In fairness to the wider world, Besson took a lot of flak at the time for sexualising the character; and it has to be said that, despite it all, Léon is undeniably exciting, and beautiful-looking, too, with everything glowing if slathered with irradiated sun cream. Portman is great as well, if a bit callow compared with what came later. 14. Beautiful Girls (1996) And we come to Exhibit B. Portman’s second underage-fantasy figure is a 13-year-old “old soul”, on whom the jaded 29-year-old played by Tim Hutton develops an enormous crush. Creepily, Portman’s character, Marty, is made the initiator, with a preternatural sophistication that glosses over the age difference. The thing is, though, despite its nauseating title and its fully male perspective, this is a dramatically rich and nuanced film – and really not the gormless sexist mess it might have been. 13. Garden State (2004) Few Portman films have dated as much as this hipster-deadpan comedy written and directed by Zach Braff, then hot off TV show Scrubs. Much has been written about Portman’s role as one of the first modern incarnations of the manic pixie dream-girl trope; these days the role looks like a compendium of the most irritating cliches possible. A “pathological liar” – of all the most comedically convenient psychiatric conditions – Portman’s Sam is a ditz on steroids, lurching from one quirky moment to another. That Portman carries it all off is a lasting tribute to her ability to construct a coherent on-screen persona. 12. Closer (2004) Portman “grew up” with this role in the film adaptation of Patrick Marber’s knotty play of relationship infidelities set in mid-00s London. Her self-confessed “waif” – mysterious, impulsive, changer of hairstyles and sexually provocative – is not a million miles away from her Garden State persona; just with Damien Rice on the soundtrack rather than the Shins. 11. Brothers (2009) Portman paid a few Hollywood dues with this serious-minded war-at-home movie, adapted from Susanne Bier’s Danish drama of the same title. Tobey Maguire is the straight-arrow serviceman who goes missing in Afghanistan; Jake Gyllenhaal the delinquent brother who takes the opportunity to comfort the distraught wife back home. Portman’s performance is one of measured dignity rather than particularly fireworky; although, trier though she is, it’s a little difficult for Portman to pull off suburban ordinariness. 10. Vox Lux (2018) Portman was presumably attracted to this to work with writer-director Brady Corbet, whose Childhood of a Leader had proved his anti-fascist credentials. As executive producer, Portman was no doubt compelled to act as well, and had the slightly thankless role of a singer on the comeback trail after – unfairly or not – her career is tainted by association with an act of terrorism. It’s an interesting film, with Portman acting out – a little bit Gaga, a little bit Madonna – more than usual. But in truth it’s Raffey Cassidy – playing a dual role of Portman’s younger self and her daughter – who gets the most attention-grabbing material. 9. Anywhere But Here (1999) Portman got a lot of awards heat – and deservedly so – for the role of a prickly/sulky teen in this mother-daughter relationship film; it proved she could hold the screen away from the dubious fantasy figures. She plays an unhappy kid forced to move from Wisconsin to California with her mum, Susan Sarandon, and permanently mortified by the latter’s midlife-crisis shenanigans. Portman is really good in the role: believable and empathic; it was a sign of greater things to come. 8. Jane Got a Gun (2016) We can only speculate how this would have turned out if Lynne Ramsay hadn’t left this revenge western after she clashed with “producers” – one of whom was Portman. Ramsay’s replacement was Gavin O’Connor, who turned in a perfectly watchable film, although well short of the inspirational vision everyone assumed Ramsay would bring. Portman does a commanding job as the tooled-up avenger of the title, taking on Ewan McGregor’s vicious outlaw with the help of reluctant Joel Edgerton. It’s decent stuff, but hard to get away from the idea it could have been a lot more. 7. Thor (2011)/Thor: The Dark World (2013) Having steered clear of blockbusterdom since the Star Wars prequels, Portman joined the Marvel roster to play the girl-empowering role of an astrophysicist – mostly, she said afterwards, on the strength of Kenneth Branagh’s participation. Thor, amazingly, turned out to be funny and watchable – largely, it has to be said, because of Chris Hemsworth’s comic timing and Tom Hiddleston’s neurotic intensity. Portman ended up playing the straight-(wo)man role, and was given a more substantial part in the sequel – although that had most of the fun surgically removed. 6. Hotel Chevalier (2007) It is only 13 minutes long, but this hotel-room short film directed by Wes Anderson is a masterwork of the genre, and considerably better than the feature – The Darjeeling Limited – for which it was intended as a prologue. Portman – playing well within her range as a mysterious, sexy woman – turns up to rekindle some sort of past relationship with room-occupant Jason Schwartzman. Portman injects genuine empathy into her role (more so than Schwartzman, whose glib Andersonisms don’t always work). And the welling up of Peter Sarstedt’s 60s Euro-ballad, Where Do You Go to (My Lovely)?, only increases the pathos. 5. Planetarium (2016) An intriguing and rather impressive French film, which solves the perennial Portman problem of how to shoehorn her always-evident film-star glamour into more earthly personas by making her character … be discovered as a film star. She plays a bespectacled nightclub performer in prewar France whose sister (Lily-Rose Depp) may or may not be a genuine medium; but none of this seems to matter after a major film producer (based on the real-life Holocaust victim Bernard Natan) puts her to work as an actor. Directed by Rebecca Zlotowski, this is an easily overlooked entry in the Portman canon, but it shouldn’t be. 4. A Tale of Love and Darkness (2015) Portman has used her industry clout to get some unlikely projects off the ground: none more so than this adaptation of Israeli novelist Amos Oz’s memoir spanning the early years of Israel’s foundation. Portman took the extra step of making her feature-directing debut, as well as playing the film’s Hebrew-speaking central character of Oz’s mother, Fania. Very much an exploration of her own Israeli roots, this is a moving attempt to reconcile the ramifications of the Middle East conflict with a backwards-looking plea to get over the hurts of the past. An admirable achievement. 3. Jackie (2016) The role Portman was born to play, and she goes all in for the bouffant hairdo, Chanel suits and pillbox hats with Audrey Hepburn-ish enthusiasm. Portman also worked on the Jackie intonation and mannerisms with studious exactitude, and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for what is an undeniably heavyweight performance. The key sequences, obviously, are the ones surrounding John F Kennedy’s assassination and its aftermath, with Portman eerily convincing in her numbed pain. For all her efforts, however, the film seems a trifle overwhelmed by its own subject matter; perhaps the counterintuitive hiring of the Chilean director Pablo Larraín (No, The Club) wasn’t such a smart move. 2. Annihilation (2018) It may have seemed a slightly odd move for Portman to get involved in this slow-burn body-horror sci-fi directed by Alex Garland, whose previous directorial effort, Ex Machina, had turned out a cult hit. But the stars really aligned for this: Garland turned in a dread-fuelled nerve-shredder that borrows as much of its DNA from Solaris as from The Thing. And Portman, physically roughed up after her epic encounters with nameless, terrifying interstellar phenomena, brings her A-game to the film: evincing tough intellectualism and emotional fragility to her role as the biologist who joins an all-female mission to find out what is going on inside a mysterious zone termed “the Shimmer”. We can only hope she does more of this sort of thing. 1. Black Swan (2010) It all came together for Portman in this exhilaratingly trashy ballet movie, directed by Darren Aronofsky, which runs the gamut from creepy psychological manipulation to full-on jump scares to (more) oh-my-God body horror. Portman, as Nina, the ingenue who is unexpectedly elevated to principal dancer for a production of Swan Lake, is simply irreplaceably brilliant: her trademark emotional fragility allied to new areas of psychosexual disturbance and self-harm. In the #MeToo era, we may not be so complacent about a controlling figure using sexual assault as a directing technique; but the film makes the damage it causes a central plank of Nina’s ordeal and breakdown. Portman’s Oscar win was well deserved; this is still amazing to watch."

          "bodyText": "My brother has a motorhome with comprehensive breakdown cover with the RAC. However, when it broke down on the M1, the RAC sent an independent contractor who took one look and said that the vehicle was too long and heavy for him to tow, before departing. After failed promises by the RAC, my brother had to find and pay a commercial tow firm £340 to take the vehicle to a garage. Ten hours elapsed between his initial call to the RAC and the rescue. Under normal circumstances that’s inconvenient, but his wife has regular seizures, which made the wait positively dangerous. IB, Cambridge Complaints about roadside assistance have increased 71% in the last financial year and are rising again, according to Martyn James of complaints-handling website Resolver. The most recent reviews on Trustpilot report waits of up to 12 hours for rescue by the RAC, which has been accused of reducing its staff and increasing premiums since being bought out by a private equity firm in 2011. Last year, I reported the ordeal of a camper van driver who was stranded on a remote Welsh hillside for more than 30 hours after RAC subcontractors were unable to tow his vehicle. The RAC says that your brother was abandoned because his motor home exceeded the maximum length allowed under his policy and that he should have bought a specialist “Arrival” policy that covers vehicles more than 6.4 metres long. However, it admits that it failed him. “We should have informed him that his policy didn’t cover large vehicles when he first rang us and let him know he would have to pay for recovery. As a result of this, it led to delays in being able to make his own arrangements. “As a gesture of goodwill, we’ll be refunding the cost of the tow he paid for. We also offered to upgrade him to our specialist motorhome breakdown service, but instead he has chosen to cancel his policy with a full refund.” Tedious as small print is, it pays to slog through it when buying cover. Motorists who are left impotent at the roadside are left stranded again when it comes to mediation because, unlike other insurance, roadside assistance was omitted from the Financial Services Act, so customers can’t complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service if their policy doesn’t deliver.

          "bodyText": "Party leaders took part in Channel 4’s climate debate, while Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage refused to attend. With Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage refusing to take part (and getting replaced by melting ice sculptures), the leaders of the Greens, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Labour took part in a relatively straightforward debate. While there were some barbs over the records of the Lib Dems, SNP and Labour in government, the debate mostly focused on how each party would out-bid the other in the fight against climate change. You can read the Guardian’s analysis of the event here. Conservatives and Channel 4 row: Tories threaten Channel 4 after it replaced Boris Johnson with an ice sculpture . In an ongoing and worsening row between the Conservative party and Channel 4 News, the Tories have threatened to review the channel’s broadcasting remit after it replaced Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture following his failure to attend the leaders’ climate debate. Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear then took to Twitter to accuse the Conservative party of behaving like Donald Trump, following Tory party chairman James Cleverly claiming that “this is not a presidential election”. Read the full story from the Guardian’s media editor Jim Waterson here. Michael Gove attempts to attend the leaders’ debate on behalf of the Conservatives, and gets confronted by a 15-year-old climate activist. Michael Gove and the prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, turned up at the Channel 4 climate debate to ask if Gove could speak on behalf of the Conservatives. The broadcaster declined, as the debate was for party leaders only. Gove was also confronted by 15-year-old climate activist Izzy Warren, who challenged him on the Tories’ record on the environment in government. SNP suspends election candidate over alleged anti-Semitism. Neale Hanvey, who was set to contest the marginal seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath currently held by Labour, has been stripped of his candidacy and suspended from the party. BBC demands the Tories take down a Facebook ad featuring its presenters, arguing that the footage could damage the perception of impartiality. The paid-for advert uses selective footage of the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg and News at Ten host Huw Edwards to argue that chaotic debates over Brexit can be avoided if people vote Conservative. The BBC said its footage had been used without permission and asked the Conservatives to stop using the material in this manner. Labour to launch regional manifestos in England under plans to hand ‘wealth and power back to every community’, which include several pledges on housing, transport and green jobs Tory HQ warns party’s supporters against election complacency following predictions that Boris Johnson will reap a comfortable majority. “If the polls are wrong by a few points, and they have been wrong before, we end up with a hung parliament. Our team know that, and now we have to convince the public. There should be no complacency or let-up or change of direction. We will continue with our central messages: get Brexit done, more hospitals, more nurses, more police,” a senior party source said. That’s all from me tonight. Labour will launch a manifesto in every region of England under plans to hand “wealth and power back to every community”. The manifestos will include pledges on transport, housing and jobs. The manifestos will be launched alongside further details of the party’s £250bn Green Transformation Fund, which the party said is an “investment blitz” on a scale unseen since the Second World War. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the announcement will “bring our country back together”. The pledges include a number of transport projects, such as: Northern Powerhouse Rail - improving connections between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Hull, and Newcastle, and cutting journey times Investment in the Midlands Mainline railway Electrification of lines around Bristol Temple Meads There are also several pledges on green jobs, including: Three new steel recycling plants in Redcar, Workington and Corby, which Labour says will create over 1,000 jobs in each town Nine plastics remanufacture and recycling sites - one for each region Three electric vehicle battery plants in Stoke, Swindon and South Wales - creating 5,000 jobs in each location Investment in green energy manufacturing supply chains for eight ports Emma Barnett grills Lib Dem deputy leader Ed Davey on the “toxicity” associated with Jo Swinson’s record in government with the Conservatives, and who the Lib Dems could realistically support to be prime minister. On whether the Lib Dems underestimated the “toxicity” associated with Swinson’s role in the coalition government, Davey said that she is “going down really well in the seats that we need”. Admitting that it is “unlikely” the Lib Dems win a majority, he refused to answer who the party could plausibly support as prime minister. “You will get Liberal Democrat MPs voting issue by issue,” he said, adding that the Lib Dems would not support Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson. He added that he believes there will be “a lot” of parliamentary movement following the next election, and that the parties may change leader. “People aren’t looking for a bowel movement, they’re looking for a prime minister,” Barnett responded. Emma Barnett asks Labour’s Lucy Powell on BBC Newsnight how she would campaign in a confirmatory referendum - something that is in Labour’s Brexit policy. Powell said that she will “probably vote remain”, but thinks “we are some way off that”. She added that she has spent the last few months “trying to get a compromise deal through parliament” as she believed it was “the best way of bringing the country together”. This comes after Labour’s Clive Lewis was unable to say what percentage of the shadow cabinet would campaign to remain. Emma Barnett asks Charles Walker, vice-chair of the Conservative’s 1922 Committee, what the prime minister is afraid of, in reference to his refusal to attend several televised debates between party leaders and his failure to secure an interview date with Andrew Neil. “If you ask me, I wouldn’t do Andrew Neil,” Walker responded. Emma Barnett rebuts: “Andrew Neil isn’t a criminal, he’s a journalist.” Walker continues: “Boris will do what he wants to do. He is the prime minister.” He later adds that if he himself were to be interviewed by Neil, Neil would tear him “to pieces”. Emma Barnett responds: “Let’s not demonise journalists, shall we?” Labour’s shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis tells BBC Newsnight that he couldn’t say what percentage of the shadow cabinet would campaign for remain in the instance of a second referendum. Krishnan Guru-Murthy has now taken to Twitter to respond to Michael Gove’s claim that Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon refused to debate a Conservative, in an ongoing row between Channel 4 News and the Conservative party: The Twitter spat between the Conservatives and Ben de Pear, the editor of Channel 4 News, continues: Labour’s Deputy Leader Tom Watson says it is “deeply concerning” for Boris Johnson to threaten Channel 4 with its public service broadcasting licence for replacing him with an ice sculpture when he failed to turn up to tonight’s climate debate. Tom Watson has written to Ofcom to urge the regulator to “call out this meddling”. His letter adds: “Boris Johnson has banned the Daily Mirror from its battle bus, ducked the Andrew Neil interview and now attempted to bully Channel 4. “It’s simple. If the Prime Minister didn’t want to be embarrassed by being replaced with an ice sculpture, he should have turned up to the debate. “The truth is, Boris Johnson is in hiding because his record of failure on the climate emergency is indefensible.” The campaign group Grime4Corbyn has claimed a Conservative win at the general election could lead to people “dying from austerity cuts” and “freezing to death in their homes”. Co-organiser Sofia Mason, 34, described the Tory party as “racist and harmful for our communities” and urged voters to opt for Labour in December. The Grime 4 Corbyn campaign group was inspired by grime artists expressing their support for the Labour leader at the 2017 election, and works with musicians to put on events. More on the story of the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, Neale Hanvey, who was stripped of his candidacy following alleged antisemitism: In a statement issued via his Twitter account, Hanvey issued an “unequivocal apology” for posting two items which he now realised were offensive and inappropriate. He said he fully supported the SNP’s decision to remove him as its candidate and suspend his party membership pending investigation. He confirmed one was a Sputnik article which pictured Soros holding two world leaders as puppets, but did not realise that was an antisemitic trope. “I did not give any thought to Mr Soros’s faith. [I] fully accept that this was wrong,” Hanvey said. The second post drew parallels between the treatment of Palestinians today with the “unconscionable” treatment of Jews in Europe during the second world war. “This was insensitive, upsetting and deeply offensive”, Hanvey said. Both posts were “dreadful errors of judgment,” he said. “I accept there may not be the words to express my regret for those I have offended but I am genuinely and deeply sorry.” The BBC is demanding the Conservatives take down Facebook adverts featuring footage of its journalists Laura Kuenssberg and Huw Edwards, arguing that their inclusion could damage perceptions of the corporation’s impartiality. The paid-for advert uses footage of the BBC’s political editor and the News at Ten host to argue that chaotic debates over Brexit can be avoided if people vote Conservative. The move is in common with other intentionally provocative stunts pulled by the Conservatives during this campaign, such as rebranding their press office Twitter account as a fact checker. Read more from the Guardian’s media editor, Jim Waterson, below: 15-year-old Izzy Warren, the climate change activist from West London who confronted Michael Gove as he arrived at Channel 4 earlier, has spoken to the Guardian. “I just saw a really good opportunity to find out why Boris Johnson, the current prime minister, doesn’t view my generation’s future as a priority, why he doesn’t think it deserves his time,” she said. “I asked Gove why, if the Conservatives think this is a priority, the prime minister wasn’t here today,” said Warren. He told her that it shouldn’t matter who was there to speak and that they had the most ambitious manifesto ever on climate change. “This is a party that has been in power for ten years and we haven’t seen climate action,” she said. Asked if he looked surprised, she added: “I think older men, quite frankly, aren’t used to being challenged by teenage girls. Which makes it all the more fun when you get to do it.” Here is video footage of Michael Gove getting confronted by Warren outside the Channel 4 studios in London: Green party deputy leader, Amelia Womack, echoed Gruffydd’s frustration with the main parties. Speaking backstage, she said that it was frustrating to see parties who had been in government and opposition and who had previously taken no action, “feeling the time is now” to say it is their priority. She acknowledged that it was a welcome development that there was a TV debate on the subject. “It was only 2017 when [Green MP] Caroline Lucas was walking around Westminster with a big green question mark asking where the environment was in the public debate and just a few years later it’s become a central topic that parties are going to get held to account for.” Llyr Gruffydd, a Plaid Cymru Welsh assembly member for north Wales, was watching the debate from backstage. “It always riles me to hear Jeremy Corbyn making these promises when we’ve had twenty years of Labour governments in Wales,” he said. “They are getting away with that all the time. In places where they have the power to affect that change, we’re just not seeing it.” He repeated criticism by the party’s leader Adam Price of Labour’s plans to nationalise the gas grid. “They are going to pump tens of billions of pounds into buying infrastructure that they are effectively going to mothball and that’s money that they could actually invest in renewable energy. That’s questionable.” Gruffydd described the suggestion that Channel 4 had conspired with Jeremy Corbyn to block the Conservatives from the debate as nonsense. “It’s so Cummings-eque,” he said. “It’s exactly the kind of thing we’ve learned to expect from the Tories. If they can’t engage in the debate then it’s toys and prams stuff.” Conservative party chairman James Cleverly and Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear have shared a frank exchange of opinion on Twitter: A Conservative party spokesperson has accused Channel 4 of bias. “We are deeply disappointed that Channel 4 News has conspired with Jeremy Corbyn to block the Conservatives from making the case for tackling climate change and protecting the environment in this evening’s debate,” they said. “Under this Government the UK was the first advanced economy in the world to legislate for a net zero target and we’ve reduced emissions faster than any other advanced economy while continuing to grow our economy. Broadcasters have important responsibilities to present a balanced debate representing all parties, and Michael Gove was well qualified to represent the Conservative position at this evening’s debate.” Michael Gove was turned away from the debate, which was for party leaders only, after Boris Johnson refused to attend. The Conservatives are now threatening to review the channel’s broadcasting remit after it decided to replace Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate. This from Holly Gillibrand, a 14-year-old FridaysForFuture activist in Scotland on the climate debate: Michael Gove, who attempted to replace Boris Johnson in the Channel 4 climate debate, was confronted at the channel’s London studios by a 15-year-old climate activist. As he was turned away from the debate after being told it was for party leaders only, he was confronted by Izzy Warren, who lambasted the prime minister’s failure to attend. She told him: “What young people think is Boris Johnson’s showing up to discuss Brexit, he’s showing up to discuss all these other issues. “And actually he’s not here to talk about the climate. He’s not here to talk about what is ultimately the most pressing issue.” Michael Gove - a former environment secretary - replied: “I’m here. I can talk about it.” You can watch the exchange in full below: An update on the attempt by the Conservative party to have Michael Gove take Boris Johnson’s place in the Channel 4 leaders’ climate debate, which was rejected: Watching the debate in “the spin room” the prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, insisted that Gove had been “absolutely geared up to represent the Conservative party and the prime minister”. “Michael Gove would have made a big, big contribution,” he said, adding that he suspected the other party leaders had realised that the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster “would have wiped the floor with them”. Moving away from the climate debate, the SNP candidate for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, a key SNP target seat defended by Corbyn ally Lesley Laird, has been stripped of his candidacy over alleged anti-Semitism. Neale Hanvey, who was widely expected to win the seat, has been stripped of his candidacy and suspended from the party pending disciplinary action. Read the full story from our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, here: Channel 4 News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said the invitation for Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come and debate the climate emergency “remains open”. In concluding the climate debate, Mr Guru-Murthy said: “Thank you to all our party leaders who came tonight. Thank you also to Michael Gove from the Conservative Party who did come here, but sadly, as we made clear from the start, this debate was for leaders only and our leaders were only prepared to debate other leaders. “Our offer to Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come here and discuss the climate emergency remains open.” The Tories have threatened to review Channel 4’s broadcasting remit following the channel’s decision to replace Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during the debate. Asked about his own personal resolution in relation to climate, Corbyn said: “I’m always the last one to turn the heating on. In fact, we turned it on for the first time last week in my house, and that was very low temperature anyway, and I turned it off pretty quickly after that. “I’m quite miserable actually on this basis, because I don’t like to see the waste of energy that goes with it.” Corbyn also said he grows plants in his garden and allotment. Berry was the last leader asked, and she said that so many pledges “end up on a dusty shelf”, adding: “I just cannot sit back and watch this happen again. Greta Thunberg is only a teenager, she’s already sick of hearing broken promises. “Think how I feel at my age.” The leaders were asked what their personal climate change resolutions are. Sturgeon said that at home, her energy provider is one that gets all its energy from renewable sources, adding that she is trying to fly less. “Sometimes it’s inescapable in the job that I do, but trying to use the train much more when I come to London, as I did today for example,” she said. Sturgeon also said she is “much more conscious” about what she eats and where her food is sourced from. Swinson mentioned a keep cup and recycling, and pointed out that her campaign bus is electric. Price said he plans to start cycling and will shift to an electric vehicle in the new year, adding: “I convinced my partner as well we’re going to give a go with reusable nappies as well to make our own small but important contribution.” Sturgeon said Scotland’s transition away from fossil fuels needs to accelerate. She said: “We’re in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that transition has to accelerate.” On the need for decarbonisation of the gas grid, Sturgeon added: “There’s not enough priority being given to that by the current UK government and I hope that changes after the election.” Price also pledged that Plaid Cymru would invest £5bn in retrofitting homes. Factcheck Claim: Jeremy Corbyn is promising to plant 2bn trees by 2040 Reality: The government must already adhere to the Committee for Climate Change target of 1.5bn trees by 2050. Jeremy Corbyn’s pledge is for more trees in 20 rather than 30 years. This means 100m trees must be planted a year to expand woodland and make up for losses. This is ambitious, but is not impossible and not out of synch with what experts say. Factcheck Claim: Nicola Sturgeon said that last year 85% of the UK’s tree planting took place in Scotland. Reality: That is correct but the Scottish government has repeatedly failed to meet its national tree-planting targets, set at 10,000 hectares (24,700 acres) a year from 2010. Official data shows that from 2010 to 2017, Scotland’s planting rate averaged 6,800 hectares a year, well below target. Of that, only 820 hectares was planted annually by Forest Enterprise, the government-funded forestry agency, and the rest by private companies or charities. The overall target was met for the first time last year, when 11,200 hectares were planted. Sturgeon’s government has agreed to greatly increase tree planting in line with recommendations from the UK committee on climate change, which says Scotland can reach net zero five years early than the UK as a whole partly because it has much greater scope for tree planting. However, the Scottish government has yet to decide on how to do so. Mr Corbyn said everything possible must be done to reach a 2030 net zero emissions target. The Labour leader said: “I think we have to do everything we can to get to a 2030 net zero emissions target and we do that by investment in green energy jobs, solar, wind and wave power, we do that by creating jobs and transforming our energy consumption, by retrofitting homes to make them environmentally sustainable.” He added: “I want to host COP26 next year to go further than Paris, so we can be leaders on the world stage in setting the agenda of achieving this degree of sustainability by 2030.” Ms Sturgeon added that Scotland’s targets are “the toughest in the world” and that they are going “beyond what the Committee on Climate Change has said”. Also calling for the 2030 target, Mr Price said it was a shame that Labour’s manifesto only pledged to get “the majority” of emissions down by 2030, and called on a future UK government to “show the same level of ambition” as other countries. Ms Swinson said Liberal Democrats “believe it is absolutely possible to get there by 2045”. Factcheck Claim: Siân Berry, co-leader of the Green Party claims that pasture land used for meat need to be changed to reach carbon neutrality. Reality: The government’s advisory Committee for Climate Change says a 20-50% reduction in beef and lamb pasture could release 3-7m hectares of grassland from the current 12m hectares in the UK. Plaid Cymru’s Adam Price claimed that this did not mean fewer cattle because grass can bank carbon. But the CCC found that un-needed grassland could instead grow forests and biofuels that would help to soak up CO2. Price said farmers are “custodians of the environment”, adding that they should be seen as “allies” and not “enemies”. He added: “We need to be buying more locally, we need to create local food systems.” Swinson: We need to make sure that we have a target for all new build homes to be zero carbon. The Conservatives scrapped those plans. We would pay for low income homes to have insulation fitted. Corbyn: We can and do retrofit homes. We don’t have to destroy the countryside with fracking. We don’t have to carry on in this way. Labour’s manifesto sets out large green transformation fund. Social housing will get that done. We will pay for low income houses. Everyone else will be offered an interest-free loan. People will get the benefit of it in lower bills. Berry: Is this realistic? You’ve got to do it in a comprehensive way. More than half of UK emissions are from our buildings and homes. “It’s not sexy” going around putting insulation in people’s homes so successive governments have ignored it. Of £100bn a year in our Green New Deal, £38bn needs to go into homes. We need a deeper retrofit than what Labour are proposing. We can change everyone’s boilers to a heat pump, but only if we insulate first. Sturgeon: We must prioritise transport and heat. We in Scotland already have a home energy efficiency programme. Already put hundreds of millions into helping people insulate their homes. Some people will have to pay, but government has a big part to play. Scotland cannot de-carbonise the gas grid on its own. Transition away from fossil fuels must accelerate. If we were to stop oil production tomorrow we would make ourselves more reliant on imports. We must also focus on the justice of transition - can’t do this in a way that leaves people behind and decimates peoples’ jobs. The legacy of deindustrialisation is still there and we can’t make the same mistake. Price: Wales can be there at the start of this new industrial revolution if we tap into that potential. We can reap the benefits of de-carbonisation and get there first. Jeremy Corbyn insists there must be better bus services across the country, rather than just in London, in order to reduce air pollution through car use. Siân Berry accuses other parties of “abstaining” on climate change over aviation, arguing that the focus must be on targeting frequent flyers. Adam Price calls HS2 a “vanity project”, saying that Plaid Cymru do not support a third Heathrow airport runway either. Siân Berry emphasises that the Greens want to cancel HS2, arguing that people want better public transport. Jeremy Corbyn argues that many people in the UK are hungry or obese due to food pricing, saying that we must extend biodiversity in UK farms. Adam Price of Plaid Cymru rejects the premise that we must reduce our dairy and meat intake, insisting that we need to be buying locally rather than importing. Nicola Sturgeon reminds the audience that half of international flights are taken by less than 10% of the population. “We’ve got to make sure that industry and government are leading by example, rather than focusing on individuals,” the SNP leader said. Jo Swinson mentions the Liberal Democrats’ policy of an international frequent flyer tax for those who take over three return flights a year. Green party co-leader Siân Berry has accused Labour of “weakening” the goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030. Jeremy Corbyn responded to say that Labour are not weakening the 2030 goal, but that the UK is only one country and it must be a global effort. Nicola Sturgeon insisted that the best way to tackle the climate crisis is not to be squabbling with one another. Jo Swinson emphasised the significance of remaining in the EU to tackle climate change. The climate debate on Channel 4 has now started. Clive Lewis, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, has called the prime minister a “coward and a bully” in response to the Conservative party’s threats to Channel 4 over its broadcasting remit. He said: “Boris Johnson is a coward and a bully. He thinks he is born to rule and is so used to getting his own way that he turns nasty when anyone dares challenge him. “Britain deserves a prime minister that has enough of a backbone to face up to scrutiny.” The Tories are threatening to review Channel 4’s broadcasting remit if they win the general election, after the channel decided to replace Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture during its climate change debate tonight. Our media editor, Jim Waterson, has the full story: Michael Gove and the prime minister’s father, Stanley Johnson, have turned up at the Channel 4 event, with Gove wanting to speak in the climate debate on behalf of the Conservatives. The broadcaster refused him entry on the basis that he is not a party leader. Ben de Pear, the editor of Channel 4 News, tweeted: Hayley Barlow, Channel 4’s director of communications, said Gove was offered drinks and nibbles, but has now left the building. Jeremy Corbyn, Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Sian Berry (Green party) and Adam Price (Plaid Cymru) are preparing for Channel 4’s climate change debate which starts in less than half an hour. Both Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are to be replaced with melting ice sculptures after they refused to attend. We will be keeping you updated on the debate via the live blog. Georgina Hayes is now taking over the live blog for the rest of the night Jeremy Corbyn has sought to play down reports that Labour is going to switch to fighting a more defensive campaign, putting more stress on policies that might appeal to leave voters. News of the change of tack emerged after the publication of the most-eagerly awaited poll of the campaign, a YouGov MRP analysis that suggests Boris Johnson is on course for a majority of 68. Speaking at an event in Southhampton, where he published Labour’s environment manifesto, A Plan for Nature, Corbyn dismissed suggestions that this meant he would now have one message for leave voters, and another for remain voters. He told reporters: Our campaign is in every part of the country. I am travelling all around the country. I say the same thing at every place I go. I don’t have one message for one group. I say the same message everywhere. Vote Labour in order to get a government that will deal with the inequalities and poverty and injustice austerity has heaped on this country. But the Guardian has been told that Labour is planning to change its approach, and having pursued a relatively offensive strategy (focusing on Tory-held seats), it now plans to concentrate more on shoring up the Labour vote in constituencies the party already holds. There have been reports saying that the party’s private polling shows it is vulnerable in leave seats but - as ever - private polling mostly replicates the results of polling that gets released to the public, and the YouGov survey highlighted this exact point. Here is an extract form the write-up from YouGov’s Anthony Wells: If the election were held today we project that the Tories would win 359 seats (a gain of 42 from 2017), Labour would win 211 (down by 51), the SNP 43 (up eight) and the Liberal Democrats 13 (a gain of one). Plaid Cymru would retain their four seats, the Greens would keep their single seat, and the Brexit party would not take any seats at all. As it stands, the swing to the Conservative party is bigger in areas that voted to leave in 2016, with the bulk of the projected Tory gains coming in the North and the urban West Midlands, as well as former mining seats in the East Midlands. At this point in the campaign, the Liberal Democrats have not made any real breakthrough – with our current projections showing that while they would pick up four seats they would lose three elsewhere. The survey has been acquired near-gospel status in the Westminster political system because in 2017 the YouGov MRP (multilevel regression and post-stratification) model (explained here, if you are interested) was about the one polling exercise that predicted a hung parliament. Perhaps this one will turn out to be accurate too, but there is no guarantee of that, and of course the campaign has another fortnight to run. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has attacked the spending plans of the UK’s two main parties, saying neither election manifesto “is a properly credible prospectus”. As my colleague Larry Elliott explains in his analysis of the IFS verdict, its judgment was “brutal and even-handed: a plague on both your houses”. There is a summary of what it said about the Tories’ plans here, Labour’s here and the Lib Dems’ here. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has sought to put Boris Johnson’s character flaws at the heart of the election campaign by using a speech to argue that he is “not fit to be prime minister” because he is selfish, dishonest and divisive. Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader and Sîan Berry, the Green co-leader, have been preparing for a Channel 4 News leaders’ debate on the environment starting at 7pm. Boris Johnson has refused an invitation to appear, and reportedly Channel 4 is planning to replace him with an ice sculpture that should melt under the glare of the studio lights. There will be full coverage here. Conservative candidates in the general election have been issued with a detailed 17-page dossier on how to attack Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals which contains numerous rehashed and potentially misleading claims, the Guardian can reveal. You can read the full dossier embedded in our story here. Medics have called for guarantees that health will not be put at risk for profit after Labour released official documents that it said proved the NHS would be “on the table” in trade talks with the US. Labour has deselected its candidate for Falkirk over alleged antisemitic posts on Facebook, leaving the party unable to contest a seat it once held for decades. An academic whose research was championed by the prime minister’s key adviser Dominic Cummings has revealed he voted remain in the EU referendum and has hit out at the Conservatives’ Brexit plans. That’s all from me for tonight. My colleague Georgina Hayes is now taking over. From the Mail on Sunday’s Harry Cole Earlier in the comments MerlinUK was asking why the Guardian had not published the full text of the Tory briefing document, advising candidates how to attack Labour and Lib Dem rivals, mentioned in a story by my colleagues Hilary Osborne and Richard Partington. Well, we’ve listened, and now we’ve uploaded the whole document. It is embedded in the story, which is here. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has said he thinks Labour now accepts it cannot win the election. Speaking at a campaign event at a golf driving range earlier, and referring to reports that Labour has changed its campaign strategy, Farage said: I think the truth of it is, they realise they are now fighting a defensive battle, they know they can’t win the election. This is now a defensive strategy to try to hold the seats that they have held for decades, it’s almost an acceptance that they have lost the election. Wintry sun is shining in East Renfrewshire, but the cold not discouraging the canvassers. This constituency, south of Glasgow, was once a safe Labour seat for Jim Murphy. It is home to Scotland’s largest Jewish community, returned a high remain vote in the EU referendum, and – according to last night’s YouGov poll - will be one of only two seats which the SNP will win from the Scottish Conservatives next month. At a hustings organised by the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council on Wednesday night, the Labour candidate Carolann Davidson was blunt with the audience, reportedly telling them: I won’t ask for your vote. We don’t deserve it. The Labour party from the leadership down has failed you ... I am here tonight to reassure your community. Paul Masterton, for the Tories, described Jeremy Corbyn as “a threat to this community”, while his SNP challenger Kirsten Oswald described the Labour leader’s handling of antisemitism as “disgraceful”. Today Labour activists described Jewish voters telling them directly that they could not support them while Corbyn remains leader, while more broadly they are losing votes on two fronts: unionist voters to Tories and anti-Tory voters to the SNP. But SNP activists also note that the race remains very tight, and worry about people’s exhaustion with Brexit impacting on turnout. Meanwhile, local Jewish groups welcomed the Labour candidate’s honesty, but emphasised that the the party leadership had to be held to account too. They told the Guardian that anxiety and nervousness remained around the prospect of a Labour government. At the DUP election manifesto launch this morning Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s deputy leader, called for an inquiry into the handling of the Brexit negotiations. He said: After this is done there should be a full proper inquiry set up at a high level into what went wrong with the British government negotiations. How can we have such a catastrophic conduct of negotiations in the most important issues of our time? There are remainers who would also like to see an inquiry into Brexit, going much further, but there is no sign at the moment of either man party expressing an interest in the idea. Labour received the most money in political donations in the second week of the election campaign, according to figures published by the Electoral Commission. Donations of more than £7,500 have to be reported and in the period between 13 November and 19 November more than £9m was donated in this way – up from £6.5m the previous week. Labour received the most at £3.5m, ahead of the Conservatives with £3m and the Brexit party with £2.3m. The Liberal Democrats received £251,000, Plaid Cymru £70,000, the Greens £37,750 and the SNP £10,000. As the Press Association reports, the single biggest donation was £3m from the Unite union to Labour. The Conservatives received 61 donations over £7,500, the largest being from hedge fund manager Jonathan Wood, who gave £250,000. Two former Tory-backing businessmen donated to the Brexit party: Christopher Harborne, who gave £2m, and Jeremy Hosking, who gave £250,000. When Boris Johnson raised the possibility of building a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, one engineer said the idea was “bonkers”. But, as the BBC’s Mark Devenport points out, it is (tentatively) in the DUP manifesto. The manifesto is here (pdf). And this is what it says about the bridge. If the feasibility study on a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland concludes positively, this should also be pursued with the national government and devolved institutions working together to take it forward. This is very good on how Boris Johnson fights elections. It is a clip from Matthew McGregor, who worked for Labour on the Ken Livingstone campaign in 2008, when Johnson beat Livingstone for the London mayoralty. This morning Jo Swinson was also asked about the YouGov MRP polling analysis suggesting the Lib Dems may gain just one seat at the election. She claimed it showed there was still “a huge amount to play for”. She explained: What this poll shows is that there are 134 seats where either the Liberal Democrats are in first or second place as things stand. That shows there’s a huge amount to play for. Jeremy Corbyn has not sought to make Boris Johnson’s character an election issue. He has been fiercely critical of Johnson’s policies, but he prides himself on being someone who does not resort to personal character assassination. He has summed up his attitude using the Michelle Obama’s line “When they go low, we go high” (although that’s a better slogan than it is a guide to how her husband won the 2012 election – but that’s another story.) But the Liberal Democrats are targeting Johnson personally. Chuka Umunna, the party’s foreign affairs spokesman, delivered a speech lambasting him on Monday, and this morning Jo Swinson, the party leader, followed that up with a speech entitled “the problem with Boris Johnson”. She said he only cared about himself. Boris Johnson only cares about Boris Johnson. He will do whatever it takes, sacrifice whatever or whoever is needed to get what he wants. This is a man who decided which side to support in the EU referendum by game-playing what would be most likely to get him the keys to Number 10. His life has been about becoming prime minister. Not out of some burning desire to make people’s lives better, but out of some sense of Etonian entitlement, because it’s what people like him get to do. Boris Johnson doesn’t care about you and your family. Just take the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. A British mother wrongfully imprisoned, a small child devastated, separated from her mum. When he was talking about that case, his words would be used against Nazanin at her trial. Swinson said Johnson was “not fit to be prime minister after lying to the Queen” over prorogation. She went on: Boris Johnson is not fit to be prime minister not just because he doesn’t care, not just because he lies, but also because he is complicit in stoking division and fear in our communities. Why else would Britain’s biggest racist, Tommy Robinson, be supporting him? Honestly - such an endorsement would shame any decent person but Boris Johnson has no shame when it comes to the language he uses about race. Whether this will make much difference is another matter. Negative campaigning can be effective, but Johnson, like Donald Trump, seems to be unusually impervious to this sort of criticism. Some people loath him because of his multiple character flaws. But other people don’t seem to mind ... Conservative candidates in the general election have been issued with a detailed dossier on how to attack Labour and Liberal Democrat rivals, which contains numerous rehashed and potentially misleading claims, the Guardian can reveal. My colleagues Hilary Osborne and Richard Partington have the story here. On Tuesday, when responding to the Times article by the chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, saying he had allowed the “poison” of antisemitism to take root in Labour, Jeremy Corbyn was careful not to criticise Mirvis personally, or to question his right to speak out. Instead Corbyn just stressed his opposition to antisemitism, and explained what he had done to tackle the problem. But on the World at One at few minutes ago Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary and Corbyn’s most influential ally in the union movement, went a bit further. He said that he disagreed with Mirvis; but he also implied that Mirvis was wrong to speak out in this way during an election. Commenting on the chief rabbi’s article, McCluskey said: I think that was wrong, and quite extraordinary that a religious leader should come out and say that ... The reality is this; everybody should be concerned and sorry about the type of hurt that has been caused [to] the Jewish community. And Labour has fought, Jeremy has fought, I’ve fought all my life against antisemitism. Labour has now very robust procedures to deal with anybody. We don’t want a single antisemite in the Labour party. So that is the message. When it was put to him that Mirvis would not have spoken out if he did not think there was a problem, McCluskey replied: I’m sure that’s what he believes, if he said it. I just absolutely fundamentally disagree with him. This is what Sajid Javid, the chancellor, said this morning about the IFS criticism of the Tories’ election plans. (See 9.50am, 10am and 10.45am.) In response to claims that the party was not being “honest” about its plans, he said: We have also clearly set out exactly how we are going to fund them. We have a very detailed costings document – the most detailed I would say that any party has published in any British election – so I’m very confident about that. The claim that the Conservative party’s manifesto costings document is “the most detailed” ever is dubious. The document (pdf) runs to nine pages, and does contain costings for the manifesto promises. But the Labour equivalent (pdf) runs to 40 pages and it includes an analysis taking into account behavioural responses (ie, how changes to tax rates will impact on the number of people paying those tax rates, and the likely consequences for the exchequer). The Tory document does not contain this level of detail. Unionists in Northern Ireland are united in opposition to Boris Johnson’s proposed Brexit deal, Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s deputy leader, said this morning. Speaking at the launch of his party’s election manifesto in Belfast, he said unionists would not accept plans that would effectively create a customs border in the Irish Sea. He said: There can be no borders in the Irish Sea. We will work to try to get a sensible Brexit deal. But it cannot erect new barriers. We need our people to come together, not create more division. The DUP’s manifesto is also explicit on this. It says: The east-west checks as proposed would lead to excessively bureaucratic burdens for trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and consequently higher prices and less choice for consumers as GB businesses opt for ‘not available in Northern Ireland’. The latest Scottish opinion poll has given Nicola Sturgeon a mid-campaign boost by puting the Scottish National party at 44%, its highest rating since the 2017 election. The Ipsos Mori poll for STV has more grim news for Labour, putting its support at 16%. The Ipsos poll also found the Conservatives have secured 26% of the vote, consistent with other recent polls, while the Liberal Democrats have failed to capitalise on Scotland’s strong pro-European sentiment, polling at just 11%. Only six months after the Brexit party won a Scottish seat in the European parliament with 14.8% of the vote, Ipsos found its support in Scotland now too low to be effectively measured: it puts it at under 1%. The Ipsos poll, one of the few done by random telephone surveys, has a chink of light for Labour and the Lib Dems. It said 23% of the 1,046 voters it polled last week have yet to make up their mind. While 84% of Tory and SNP voters have decided, only 73% of Labour supporters and 66% of Lib Dems were sure which way they would vote. Even so, it suggests recent polls forecasting another dire election for Scottish Labour are correct. Yesterday’s YouGov poll for the Times predicted Labour will only retain two of its seven seats, in Edinburgh South and Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. Others say Labour can only save Edinburgh South, a seat held by the Scottish party’s most vehement critic of Jeremy Corbyn, Ian Murray. Ipsos asked respondents to spontaneously list the most important topics for them at the election: 72% of Tories and 79% of Lib Dems put Brexit first; 67% of Labour voters prioritised the NHS, followed by Brexit, and 55% of SNP voters put Brexit first, with 46% mentioning independence and 45% the NHS. It said Sturgeon was the only party leader not to have a negative satisfaction rating, but voters were split 48% to 48% on whether she was doing a good or bad job. Boris Johnson had a net satisfaction rating of -52, with 23% of Tory voters disliking him, while Jeremy Corbyn was -47, with 41% of Labour voters dissatisfied with him. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, appears to be less unpopular in Scotland than other UK polls suggest. While 25% of voters had no opinion of her, her net satisfaction rating was the best of the UK leaders at -21%. Q: The IFS says some of the Waspi women who will benefit from your £58bn compensation are quite well off. And getting rid of tuition fees will help the rich rather than the poor. Are you happy about your manifesto choices, when you could be spending more reversing benefit cuts. Corbyn says the Waspi women were very badly treated. This is a specific cohort of people. Some of them have been driven into stress and deep debt by what happened. He says he has met them. They are living difficult lives. Some tried to go back to work, and were told to try apprenticeships. He says he thinks the treatment of them has been “disgraceful”. It is moral duty to pay them. Corbyn says the question challenges the principle of universality. He says he wants education to be a right for everyone. He will end universal credit, the two-child policy, the rape clause, and the wait to get benefits, he says. Q: Your tree-planting policy implies 190 trees being planted every minute. Is it realistic? Corbyn says he is not talking about one person doing the planting. It is a massive commitment, he admits. Q: Do you support the Southampton airport extension? Corbyn says any airport expansions under Labour will have to meet tests of sustainability, air pollution, noise pollution and traffic. He says rail connectivity has improved. He has looked at prices for going to Berlin. A train fare costs £200. But you can fly for £19. That’s not right, he says. He says his green manifesto, a Plan for Nature, is a serious plan. But government cannot implement it on its own. It needs communities to help, he says. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A has finished. Q: In Southampton the Labour council recently abandoned plans to charge the most polluting vehicles being driven in the city. Shouldn’t councils be adopting ambitious policies in this regard? Corbyn says he wants to give councils more power to integrate their transport systems, particularly bus services. Q: Won’t creating a new national park in Dorset lead to more visitors coming to an already popular, making traffic and pollution worse? Corbyn says Dorset is an incredibly beautiful area. He mentions Chesil beach in particular. He says making the area a national park would mean more money being available, and better controls. It would be there for all people. He says it was the postwar Labour government that introduced national parks. And Chris Smith introduced the right to roam. Everyone should be able to enjoy the countryside, he says. Q: How confident are you of gaining seats in the south? You have come through Dorset, which is as blue as it gets. Corbyn says his message is for the whole country. He is confident of winning. He wants to see two Labour MPs in Southampton. (At the moment one is Labour and one is Tory.) Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: What is your message to traditional Labour supporters who may be considering backing the Tories over Brexit? Q: We have been told you are shifting strategy, to focus more on leave voters. Does that mean your campaign is not worked so far? Corbyn says environmental problems can only be addressed on an international basis. He says his plans on Brexit are “absolutely clear”. He summarises them: negotiating a new Brexit deal within three months, and holding a referendum within six months. As PM, he would make sure the referendum was fairly held, he says. He says people have got to come together. He says he will take this message to every part of the country. And he says he has the same message everywhere. He does not say one thing in one place, and another thing in another. This point seems designed to address this CCHQ attack line. Q: Downing Street has a big garden. How many trees would you plant personally if you become PM? Corbyn says he has a nice hornbeam tree in a pot in his back garden. It was given to him by climate crisis protesters. He suggests the No 10 garden would be a really good place to plant it. Q: The IFS says your plans are not credible. If they don’t believe you, why should the public? Corbyn says the Labour manifesto is fully costed. He says he is happy to have it scrutinised. And here is his peroration. We are living in the jaws of a climate and environment emergency. We cannot afford more wasted years of Conservative inaction from a government bought and paid for by the big polluters and the billionaires. Labour is on your side and on the side of the environment. Our Plan for Nature is a radical and innovative response to the emergency we face and it’s just part of the green transformation of our economy and society that a Labour government will bring about. The future is ours to make provided we act now. Together, we can change course and leave a country and a planet that’s fit for the next generation. Corbyn says he wants to protect habitats. We’ll expand and restore our habitats and plant trees so that we can create natural solutions to bring down emissions and allow our wildlife to flourish, because currently wildlife is in crisis. Since 1970 the turtle dove population in Britain has declined by 97%. Animals that are part of our national culture are in frightening decline: the hedgehog, the natterjack toad and the red squirrel. Once these native species disappear they don’t come back. We’ll take specific steps to protect and restore their populations. And on animal welfare we’ll ban fur, end the use of cruel snares and halt the badger cull. And unlike the Conservatives you can trust that Labour will never allow the return of fox hunting. We mistakenly left out Plaid Cymru in the post about parties taking part in tonight’s climate crisis debate on Channel 4 tonight (see 9.28am). The post has now been changed. Corbyn also confirms the plan to plant 2bn trees over the next 20 years. Because a Labour government will set a target to plant 2 billion trees by 2040, starting with 300 million in our first term. We’ll plant trees in national parks, we’ll plant them in the national forest, which we’ll look to extend to Sherwood Forest. We’ll plant a million new trees on land owned by the health service, creating an NHS forest and we’ll work with communities to plant trees in towns and cities too. These will be mixed native species creating wildlife-rich woodlands. Corbyn is now confirming the plans for 10 new national parks. A Labour government will create ten brand new national parks, increasing the total size of our national parks by 50% meaning three-quarters of people will live within 30 minutes of a national park. We will consult widely on the exact locations of the parks but obvious candidates include: the Cotswolds, the Chilterns, the North and South Pennines, Coastal Suffolk, Coastal Dorset, and the Lincolnshire Wolds. A new authority will be tasked with ensuring the parks help tackle the climate crisis and restore nature but they will also be for leisure and for beauty. When Labour created the first national parks in the wake of world war two it was part of a radical plan to open up the best of our nation to everyone, from all walks of life. That’s the spirit that a Labour government will take forward as we create ten more parks ... giving people access to the green spaces so vital for our collective wellbeing and mental health. Our country is defined by its beautiful landscapes its rolling hills rugged coastlines and idyllic woodlands. Travelling around Britain by train as I do, I am so often in awe of the beauty that exists right here at home. A Labour government will protect that landscape which is so precious to us all. Corbyn says government must tackle this crisis now. As David Attenborough said earlier this year: “We now stand at a unique point in our planet’s history, where we must all share responsibility ... for the future of life on earth.” We have a choice. We can shut our eyes, cross our fingers and entrust our fate to a system that has already driven our planet to the brink of catastrophe. Or we can do everything possible to tackle the biggest threat we face. That means taking on the big polluters who profit from the current system. If we flinch, then we will be handing down a broken planet to our children. Bringing our carbon emissions down to net zero won’t happen by itself. It will only be possible with massive public investment in renewable energy and green technology. So a Labour government will bring about a green industrial revolution creating a million new, skilled, green jobs. One million jobs; from building wind turbines, to insulting homes, from reforesting the Great British countryside, to manufacturing new electric vehicles. Corbyn is now talking about the climate crisis. I’ve been deeply moved to see school children taking to the streets to protest about climate breakdown and I’m pleased we have some climate strikers here with us today. For someone of my generation it’s inspiring but also humbling to see children teaching the adults a lesson. But I’m proud that Labour has responded leading the British parliament to become the first in the world to declare a climate and environment emergency. We can see the effects of that emergency all around us as the recent flooding in Yorkshire and the East Midlands tragically brought home with the death of Annie Hall. A Labour government will invest in flood defences especially in areas like the North West, Yorkshire and the East Midlands that have been shamefully neglected by the Conservatives. The reality is this election is our last chance to tackle the climate and environment emergency. Corbyn says the Tories have been caught “trying to cover things up”. Yesterday Labour exposed “a secret plot” to sell out the NHS, he says. He repeats the point he made in his speech yesterday about how he thinks the dossier released yesterday has “shredded” his claim that the NHS will not be on the table in UK-US trade talks. He says “this election is now a fight for the survival of our NHS as a public service.” (This is a claim that Labour tends to end up making at almost every election. Although it normally has some validity, when put like this it tends to be hyperbolic. Conservative governments have often been elected, and the NHS has survived as a public service.) Jennie Formby, Labour’s general secretary, is introducing Jeremy Corbyn. She describes Southampton as her home town. She introduces Corbyn as “the most decent, honest and inclusive man I know”. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech in Southampton on the environment. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Around 212,000 more people moved to the UK long-term in the last year than left, according to the latest estimates. As the Press Association reports, the net migration figures for the year ending in June, which looked at people coming to the country with the intention to stay for 12 months or more, were published by the Office for National Statistics this morning. After peak levels of more than 200,000 in 2015 and early 2016, EU net migration has dropped and now stands at 48,000 in the same period. This is largely because of a fall in EU immigration, which remains at its lowest level since the year ending March 2013, PA Media reports. In an interview on the Today programme this morning, focusing mostly on the dossier published yesterday revealing what has been said about health policy in the UK-US talks about a possible trade deal, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said drug prices would not be on the table in talks on a UK-US trade deal. He said: In terms of drug pricing, we’ve said in our manifesto the price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. Asked why the leaked dossier does not say that the NHS and drugs prices would be exempt from the trade talks, Hancock replied: There was no need to say that because our position is absolutely crystal clear. This is what the Conservative manifesto (pdf) says about the proposed trade deal and the NHS. When we are negotiating trade deals, the NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. Here is my colleague Kate Proctor, who has produced a fun video about whether or not holding a general election in December is a terrible idea. And this is what Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said about Lib Dem manifesto plans in his opening presentation. The Lib Dems would almost quintuple spending on universal free childcare, the IFS says, “creating a whole new leg of the universal welfare state”. The IFS says the Lib Dem plan to put a penny on the main rates of income tax is “simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue”. The Lib Dems’ plans imply lower borrowing than under Labour or the Tories, the IFS says. Johnson says: They would appear to be the only one of these three parties which would put debt on a decisively downward path. And this is what Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said about Labour’s plan in his opening presentation. It is “highly likely” that, at least over the longer-term, Labour would need to raise taxes beyond the measures already announced, the IFS says. And it says Labour would “clearly increase taxes for many millions outside the top 5%”. Even though Labour would increase the size of the state, it would still leave the UK’s public spending as a proportion of national income lower than Germany’s, the IFS says. It is “far too simplistic” to assume that Labour’s plans would increase growth, the IFS says. That is because, even though Labour would boost investment and pursue a softer Brexit, the scale of its ambition creates uncertainty. Labour’s plan to abolish in-work poverty within a parliament is “not achievable”, the IFS says. It says the party’s plans for working-age welfare spending are “relatively modest”, undoing “only just over half the cuts implemented since 2015 and less than a quarter of those put in place since 2010”. But in the longer term Labour’s policies would probably “reduce labour market inequality and hence in-work poverty, possibly risking slower increases in average earnings”, the IFS says. The IFS says Labour’s plan to completely replace universal credit is “unwise”. It says it would be “expensive, disruptive and unnecessary”. Labour would double current spending on universal free childcare, the IFS says. The IFS is very critical of the decision to spend £58bn compensation the Waspi (Women against state pension inequality) women. Johnson says: While many were not aware their state pension age was rising, and some have clearly suffered hardship as a result, the decision was taken at least 15 years before the increase in pension age and most in the group are relatively well off. To believe the whole group should receive compensation is a recipe for complete stasis in policy. How can you ever defend any policy which ever makes anyone worse off if you think this change in pension age, implemented with 15 years notice, designed to equalise treatment between men and women, and in the face of dramatic increases in life expectancy, is in some sense unethical? The Labour plan to keep the state pension age at 66 is “an expensive promise”, the IFS says. Labour’s corporation tax plan would increase corporate tax revenues to “their highest ever in the UK and to among the highest in the developed world”, the IFS says. It says Labour’s plans to change the taxation of dividends and capital gains are “very welcome” and would raise revenue. The Labour plan for inclusive ownership funds, taking 10% of big firms’s share and allocating them for the workers and for government, would probably lead to companies reducing pay to compensate. And here is a fuller summary of what Paul Johnson, the Institute for Fiscal Studies director, was saying about the Tory manifesto plans in his opening presentation. At one point he said that the IFS would be saying a lot more about the Labour plans than the Tory plans. That was not the result of any bias, for or against, he explained. It was just a consequence of Labour having released much more detail about its plans, he said. The Tory plans are a lot more sketchy. IFS on Conservative plans It is “highly likely” the Tories would end up spending more than their manifesto implies, “and thus taxing and borrowing more”, the IFS says. Public spending under the current government is much closer to what Labour promised in its 2017 manifesto than what the Tories promised in their own manifesto, the IFS says. Johnson says: Current public service spending is due to be around £27 billion higher next year than implied by their 2017 manifesto. That’s closer to the 2017 Labour pledge than to the Conservatives’ own manifesto. But Tory spending plans would not reverse austerity, the IFS says. Johnson says: Conservative plans if delivered would leave public service spending outside of health still 14% lower in 2023-24 than it was in 2010-11. No more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in. There is a risk of an effective no deal Brexit at the end of 2020 under the Tories, the IFS says. It says this would harm the economy and increase the deficit and debt. The Tories have “failed to come up with any kind of plan or any kind of money for social care”, the IFS says. Tory plans on welfare are “all but non-existent”, the IFS says. It says the Tory plans for tax and spending will suit people who “think things are pretty much okay as they are”. And here is Paul Johnson’s conclusion from his opening presentation at the IFS briefing. The implication of the Conservative manifesto is that they believe most aspects of public policy are just fine as they are. Little in the way of changes to tax, spending, welfare or anything else. Yes, there are some spending increases for health and education already promised, but essentially nothing new in the manifesto. Labour, by contrast, want to change everything. Their vision is of a state with a far greater role than anything we have seen for more than 40 years. They would tax and spend more than ever before, putting in place a new universal welfare state with free childcare, free university, free personal care, free prescriptions and more besides; they would impose a swathe of new labour market regulations; their minimum wage would directly set the wages of a quarter of private sector workers; they would nationalise a series of companies whose performance is of vital importance to the UK economy; they would enforce transfer of effective ownership of 10% of large companies from current owners to a combination of employees and government. For good or bad five years of Labour government would involve enormous economic and social change. In the face of such vast ambition from Labour, one should not forget that the Liberal Democrat manifesto is itself a radical document that would involve a decisive move away from the policies of the past decade. Rarely can a starker choice have been placed before the UK electorate. Here is more from Paul Johnson’s opening presentation at the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ briefing. All other countries which tax and spend on the scale that Labour proposes have tax systems which levy more tax on the average worker than we do. Liberal Democrat proposals to put a penny on the main rates of income tax would be simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue. While the Conservatives continue to pretend that tax rises will never be needed to secure decent public services, Labour pretends that huge increases in spending can be financed by just big companies and the rich. In this respect neither Labour nor the Conservatives is being honest with the electorate. Here is my colleague Julia Kollewe’s story about the IFS analysis. In his opening remarks at the Institute for Fiscal Studies briefing Paul Johnson, the IFS, director, said neither the Tory nor the Labour manifesto plans were “properly credible”. He said (bold type in original IFS text): Neither [the Conservative manifesto nor the Labour manifesto] is a properly credible prospectus. Should they win this time it is highly likely that the Conservatives would end up spending more than their manifesto implies and thus taxing or borrowing more. The chances of holding spending down as they propose over a five-year parliament look remote. Why have they been so immensely modest in their proposals? Because to do otherwise would either mean resiling from their pledge to balance the current budget or would mean being up front about the need for tax rises to avoid breaking that pledge. Labour would not be able to deliver investment spending increases on the scale they promise. The public sector doesn’t have the capacity to ramp up that much, that fast. It is highly likely that Labour, at least over the longer-term, would need to implement other tax raising measures in order to raise the £80bn of tax revenue that they want and even just sticking to those proposals they would clearly increase taxes for many millions outside the top 5%. In reality, a change in the scale and scope of the state that they propose would require more broad-based tax increases at some point. Labour has deselected its election candidate for Falkirk for allegedly putting antisemitic posts on Facebook, leaving the party unable to contest a seat it once held for decades. Scottish Labour officials confirmed a report in the Falkirk Herald it had dropped Safia Ali as a candidate and suspended her party membership after past antisemitic posts on Facebook surfaced, in the latest controversy about candidate selections. Michael Sharpe, Scottish Labour’s general secretary, told the Falkirk Herald: I deeply regret the people of the Falkirk constituency will no longer have a Labour candidate to campaign and vote for on 12 December 12. There is no place for antisemitism, or any form of racism and bigotry, in our party. That is why Labour is taking robust action to root it out of our movement and wider society. Ali had stood as an independent candidate for the Carse, Kinnaird and Tryst ward in a local election to Falkirk council in 2017, getting the lowest number of first-preference votes. A party source said the comments were made on an older Facebook account she no longer used, and had not been picked up during candidate screening. He said the case was going through the fast-track disciplinary processes introduced by Jeremy Corbyn. “Safia Ali is no longer the Labour party’s candidate for Falkirk,” a party spokesman said. “We have taken immediate action on this matter.” Labour’s Falkirk constituency party was embroiled in a controversy over irregularities in member recruitment involving the Unite union when the union wanted Karie Murphy, an ally of Unite leader Len McCluskey and latterly a key aide to Corbyn, chosen as its candidate. The constituency party was put under special measures. In 2015, it was amongst the swathe of Labour seats to topple in the Scottish National party landslide and was held by the SNP’s John McNally in 2017 with a 4,923 vote majority. The seat has since been low on Labour’s target list in Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has just started its press conference to present its analysis of the main parties’ election manifestos. There is a live feed here. Boris Johnson is facing growing criticism for refusing to take part in tonight’s climate crisis leaders’ debate on Channel 4. Nicolas Stern, author of a landmark climate report, said it was crucial that all political leaders showed up for the debate to give voters the chance to see how future governments would respond to the unfolding emergency. Climate change and biodiversity are critical issues for both the UK and the world, and it is crucial that all our political party leaders take part in the groundbreaking debate. Stern, a crossbench member of the House of Lords and Chair of the Grantham Research Institute at the LSE, said voters had a right to hear “a more detailed discussion between the leaders about how their governments would rise to challenges of acting with the urgency and scale demanded by these issues”. For many voters, particularly young ones, climate change and nature are two of the most important issues at this election and they should be well-informed about each leader’s views about them when they vote. The hour-long debate will be held tonight on Channel 4 at 7pm. Jeremy Corbyn and the leaders of the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Green party have all agreed to take part. The decision of Johnson not to take part comes amid increasingly alarming news on the scale of the emergency. On Wednesday scientists warned that the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points posing “an existential threat to civilisation”. The Green party’s Caroline Lucas said: It’s outrageous that he can’t spare an hour to address the greatest challenges of our time. How are we supposed to trust the prime minister’s word that he’s taking climate and nature emergency seriously? Max Wakefield, director at Possible, which led the campaign for a climate debate, said: “It is not too late for the prime minister to do as the public wants and turn up to debate the climate and nature emergency.” Here is my colleague Heather Stewart’s story about the new Labour strategy. Here are the campaign events in the diary for today. 9.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes an analysis of the main parties’ manifestos. 10.30am: The DUP launches its election manifesto. 11am: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech on the environment. He will announce plans to plant 2bn trees by 2040. 11am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, campaigns in Hull. 11.30am: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, gives a speech on “the problem with Boris Johnson”. 12.30pm: Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, and Nia Griffith, his Labour shadow, take part in a defence hustings organised by the Royal United Services Institute. 7pm: Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Jo Swinson, Siân Berry and Adam Price take part in a Channel 4 News leaders’ debate on the environment. Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are planning to stay away. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Jedidajah Otte We have already mentioned Iain Watson’s report for the BBC on how Labour plans to revise its campaign to focus more on appealing to leave voters. His full report is here. And here is an extract. The message will be that Labour’s leave deal would offer voters a genuine choice - and that a new referendum will not be an attempt to remain in the EU by the back door. There will be an attempt to explain the deal Labour is seeking to negotiate – and that it would protect workers’ rights. In other words, the party leadership is not opposing Brexit by opposing Boris Johnson’s deal – it simply wants to find what it regards as a better one. That may be a tricky argument, compared with the simplicity of the Conservative message of getting Brexit “done”. But it is felt that reassurance for leave voters is necessary. And here is the Press Association version of the story. The Labour party has hit the reset button amid the latest polling saying the Tories are on course to win the general election. The party is understood to be changing tack in its campaign, particularly in leave-voting areas, where it is in danger of losing seats to the Conservatives. Labour insiders say a key mistake up until now was overestimating the electoral threat from the Liberal Democrats, and underestimating the likelihood of leave voters switching from Labour to the Conservatives, the BBC has reported. Labour’s strategy so far had been – in part – to emphasise that the election is about more than Brexit and to get voters to focus on issues which would unite Labour voters in leave and remain areas. The new plan is designed to appeal to those who voted for Brexit, and to try to convince them that Labour is not attempting to stop Brexit by offering another referendum. Shadow cabinet members who back a leave deal rather than remain will have a higher profile in the final two weeks of the campaign. Jeremy Corbyn and party chairman, Ian Lavery, who favours leaving the EU with a deal, will tour leave areas to try to explain the deal Labour wants to negotiate and emphasise that they will protect workers’ rights. Quite how much actual change we will witness in Labour campaigning remains to be seen. After all, it is not as if shadow cabinet ministers who are strongly remain have been given a high profile anyway. (Keir Starmer has been almost as invisible as Jacob Rees-Mogg in the last few weeks.) And what is being described is not a new policy, but just a subtle shift in emphasis. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, was asked about the BBC story when he was on the Today programme. He claimed he did not know anything about a shift in strategy, but he did not contest the accuracy of the story in any way. Both the Tories and Labour are likely to break their own spending rules, the Resolution Foundation said in a new report published today. RF is an independent thinktank focused on improving the living standards of those on low to middle incomes. The Tories have promised to balance the budget within three years, Labour said it would do so within five years. The analysis suggests that the Tories are failing to account for “costs associated with their new investment plans” and “increased interest payments” and “additional depreciation cost of £2.3bn per year by 2023-24”. The Tory manifesto does also not include any funding for the pledged £6bn increase of the national insurance threshold to £12,500. Labour’s manifesto on the other hand “failed to account for the additional £12bn annual cost from its commitment to compensate women born in the 1950s affected by the increase in the state pension age”, the report stated. Labour’s investment plans would mean its budget balancing headroom has already been more than used up, the report added. Labour has called the report inaccurate. The BBC’s Ian Watson just said on Today that Labour voters living in leave areas will “likely see a very different style of campaign” from the party over the next two weeks, as “the Lib Dem threat was overestimated, while the willingness of leave voters to switch from Labour to the Conseravtives was underestimated”. More Labour activists are set to be moved into leave areas, he said, and that shadow cabinet members backing a leave deal rather than remain will be given a higher profile. The message will be that a new referendum won’t be a “back door” initiative to remain in the EU, Watson added. Laura Duffell from the Royal College of Nursing told Sky’s Breakfast show this morning that she and her colleagues had doubts about the 50,000 extra NHS nurses that were promised in the Conservative manifesto. “I’d really like to know where the 50,000 nurses are coming from. [...] If there are 50,000 nurses out there, why do we not see them already? It’s not an overnight fix,” Duffell said. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks just spoke about the widely reported incident on the London underground from a few days ago, where a Jewish family was subjected to antisemitic verbal abuse from a man, before other passengers intervened. The man was later arrested. “The hero was a young Muslim woman wearing a hijab,” Sacks said. “She chose to identify with the Jewish family.” “She chose not to be a bystander but chose to confront racism head on,” he added. Labour’s Barry Gardiner is on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Quizzed on the YouGov MRP poll result and Labour’s reported change of tactic, with the aim to convince more Labour leave voters, Gardiner says he hasn’t heard of anything about a change in campaign tactics. He says the margins have “narrowed” in recent weeks, and that Labour is the only party trying to unite the country around a compromise: a final say on any Brexit deal. This from Sky’s Tamara Cohen: Hello, I’m taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons now. Many people wonder this morning how accurate the YouGov MRP poll predicting a comfortable Tory majority might be, as well as how accurate any polling can be. This from political journalist Conor Pope: This from Prospect editor Tom Clark, who is urging caution: And this from the journalist Paul Mason: There’s a bit of drama going down about whether or not Boris Johnson will do an interview with Andrew Neil. As Jim Waterson and Heather Stewart write: Labour has expressed concerns about the BBC’s political coverage after it was revealed that Boris Johnson has still not confirmed whether he will subject himself to a cross-examination by Andrew Neil. Jeremy Corbyn’s team agreed to take part in the series of one-on-one interviews with the journalist after the BBC told them the prime minister would definitely be doing a similar broadcast next week. However, a BBC source strongly denied they had told Labour that Johnson had confirmed. The BBC has yet to confirm the date of Johnson’s appearance, leading to Labour concerns that Johnson could be tempted to sidestep scrutiny from one of the broadcaster’s leading political interviewers. Nicola Sturgeon responded asking whether Johnson was ducking out because he was a chicken. Jeremy Corbyn supporter and Guardian columnist Owen Jones called it an “absolute disgrace”, saying the BBC had “lied to Labour and said they’d agreed an interview between Andrew Neil and Boris Johnson next week” – a claim the BBC denies, and Labour candidates are piling on. What’s happening today? Jo Swinson starts the day with a roundtable on homelessness in London and Jeremy Corbyn will be in Southampton to announce the party’s environment policies. A foreign policy debate, featuring the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, as well as the foreign affairs spokespersons for the Lib Dems and SNP. If you’re interested, that will be broadcast on Radio 4 tonight. Tonight, party leaders will participate in a debate on the climate crisis, broadcast on Channel 4. Boris Johnson has not confirmed whether he will be there and Nigel Farage has rejected the invite, but all other parties will be attending. A quiet day for the Tories, who have no major events or announcements scheduled. A new poll for the Times points to a thumping Conservative victory. While the Guardian is treating all polls with suspicion, read why here, the MRP poll from YouGov came closest to calling the unexpected result of the 2017 general election. The poll predicts the Conservatives will win 359 seats (42 gains), leaving Johnson with a majority of 68. Labour, meanwhile, would fall back to 211 seats – a result that would be in line with the disaster of 1983. Not everyone is happy with that message, including Boris Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings who has told Brexit supporters that the general election is “much tighter” than polls might suggest and urged them to persuade their friends to vote Tory. Matt Hancock is up early, talking about Conservative plans to tackle addiction. Good morning politics people. We’re two weeks out from the vote and Labour has taken the gloves off, accusing the Tories of being willing to sell off the NHS. Meanwhile, there’ll be a lot of talk about the climate crisis today, as scientists warn the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points, meaning “we are in a state of planetary emergency”. Jeremy Corbyn has returned to his deadliest line of attack in this election campaign, as he claims that leaked documents show Boris Johnson wants to sell off the NHS in a trade deal with the US. The official papers reveal US and UK officials have repeatedly discussed dismantling protections that keep NHS drug prices down as part of their negotiations about a post-Brexit trade deal. The Labour leader, and some experts, say that the official papers put lie to Johnson’s repeated claims that the NHS is not for sale and that healthcare is “not on the table” in trade talks between the two countries. Denis Campbell and Jamie Grierson have unpacked what the dossier says and what it means. Heather Stewart writes that “Corbyn had one central aim as he brandished the 451-page ‘secret” NHS document at a hastily-arranged press conference on Wednesday: to drag the general election debate safely back into Labour’s comfort zone after the antisemitism accusations. Today will be about the environment. Corbyn will be in Southampton where he will set out the party’s environment policies, arguing that the UK should plant 2bn trees by 2040. One plank of Labour’s energy policy is under fire today, as lawyers have warned that the party’s plans to take large parts of the energy industry back under public control puts it on a collision course with EU laws that guard Europe-owned companies against government takeovers. Later tonight, the leaders of most parties – Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage are the notable exceptions – will participate in a Channel 4 debate on climate issues."

          "bodyText": "The doves weren’t feeling it that night. Why should they have been? See it from their perspective. You and your mates have been trapped inside five pianos on stage at the Hollywood Bowl, waiting for your cue. And what was that cue? As soon as the flamboyant Englishman descends a staircase on to the stage, the piano lids will fly open, each bearing one of the letters of the name ELTON, hopefully in the right order. Your task will be to fly into the California night to a soundtrack of oohs and aahs before laughing boy bangs out Elderberry Wine. It didn’t happen. As Elton John made his entrance into US society in 1973, in a white outfit making him look like the victim of a tarring and feathering, the piano lids flew up, but the birds didn’t. “The doves had fallen asleep,” he recalled. Like so many matters raised in Elton John: Uncensored (BBC One), questions remain. Were any doves harmed during the making of this concert? Had they nodded off during the sound check? I would have. “It was the real start of my flamboyant outfits,” said Elton of the night that broke him stateside. Chubby, balding Reg Dwight from Pinner was, by his own charming admission, no Mick Jagger, David Bowie or Marc Bolan. Plus, stuck behind a piano, he couldn’t strut his stuff. He needed a right old zhooshing. Hence the Mozart wig he wore in Australia, the Donald Duck outfit in New York, although possibly not the spotted romper suit he chose for this sit-down with Graham Norton. I have never really cared for Elton’s music, although I did warm to him during this hour-long interview about his six-decade career. It wasn’t just because he was out and proud in the homophobic 1970s, but also because his self-satire cut through the treacle of Norton’s kneel-down-and-derriere-smooch interview technique. How rare to encounter a 72-year-old man laughing at himself rather than onanistically buffing his legacy. Why the toupee? “I don’t like being bald. I look like Shrek.” (Note to non-balds: baldness doesn’t necessarily make you green.) And he endearingly disagreed with critics of his disastrous 80s rug rethink. “They said it looked like a dead squirrel. More like a dead mole.” He even told of playing a Vegas gig in 2017 only two weeks after a prostate cancer operation. When he took his parting bows, he was in excruciating pain from fluid under his colon (and wearing a nappy). “If only they knew,” he said, “at that moment I was pissing myself.” So little of the original Elton remains. Hair, tonsils, prostate, appendix have all gone, but he has a pacemaker. “I’m like the bionic woman,” he giggled. Not quite: Lindsay Wagner had superpowers and her own hair. Norton drove to the interview along the Côte d’Azur in an open-top Rolls-Royce. Were licence-fee payers bankrolling its rental? Or was it Elton’s, like the private jet he loaned Meghan and Harry? It was the second time this month the BBC was interviewing British royalty. Norton is no Emily Maitlis, although they had two things in common. Both interviewed their subjects on home turf; she in Buckingham Palace, he in Elton and David’s place in Nice. Both outdressed their interviewees – she in fabulous shoes and cod-military coat, he in a jaunty print jacket and matching shirt. Coming after Prince Andrew’s inquisition, it was impossible not to compare the interviewers’ techniques. Maitlis was forensic, Norton oleaginous. “His showmanship and unique sense of style fast became legendary – and all before the age of 25,” oiled Norton. True, Elton has not been accused of having sex with a trafficked 17-year-old victim of a dead sex offender, but, still, one does hope for a nod towards journalistic critical distance from the BBC. Norton didn’t quite ask: “Remind us Elton, why are you so great?”, but the possibility was never remote. Worst, Norton thwarted Elton from describing his coming-out phone call to his mum, instead inviting him to compare his stage outfits to Liberace’s – about which I couldn’t care less. That said, I was delighted to learn how Elton Hercules John, as Reg became in 1967, chose his middle name. It was after rag-and-bone man Steptoe’s longsuffering horse rather than the lavishly muscled ancient Greek hero – though the latter, I suspect, has the bigger following in the gay community. Will he ever retire into domestic felicity with his husband and adopted sons? Not soon. If Paul McCartney can announce he is headlining Glastonbury aged 78, it’s unlikely his fellow septuagenarian is quite done. Elton is planning a musical of The Devil Wears Prada. His current so-called farewell world tour may never end. Lots of bits of Elton John have fallen off, but he is still standing."

          "bodyText": "It’s been a busy week for rocket launches. Europe, China, India and Russia have all sent payloads into space in the last seven days. Starting on 23 November, China launched two navigation satellites as part of their growing BeiDou navigation satellite constellation. After the launch from the Xichang spaceport, a video appeared on the country’s social media platform Weibo that claimed to show damage caused by one of the Long March 3B’s jettisoned rocket boosters falling on a village. Russia launched next, sending a top secret military satellite into orbit on 25 November from its launch site at Plesetsk. After a four-day delay, blamed on a power supply anomaly and bad weather, Europe’s fourth Ariane 5 flight of the year took to the skies from Kourou, French Guiana. Launching on 26 November, it carried Tiba-1, Egypt’s first military communications satellite, and GX5, the fifth satellite in Inmarsat’s Global Xpress network, which beams the internet to aircraft, shipping and remote locations. Rounding out the week-long launch spree, on 27 November, India launched its highest resolution Earth observation satellite, Cartosat-3, along with 13 small American “cubesats”. Cartosat-3 is a civilian satellite and is capable of taking images from orbit that can resolve details just 2cm across."

          "headline": "IFS manifesto verdict: neither Tories nor Labour have credible spending plan",
          "bodyText": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies has attacked the spending plans of the UK’s two main parties, saying neither election manifesto “is a properly credible prospectus”. In a wide-ranging review, the respected thinktank warned voters that Conservative party pledges to keep spending in check over the next parliament were likely to be torn up, leading to either higher taxes or higher borrowing. The IFS report was also scathing about Labour’s plans. It chided Labour for producing a manifesto that relied on taxes that were unlikely to raise the sums the party has said they will, and for spending plans that were unlikely to be fulfilled within a five-year term. “Labour would not be able to deliver investment spending increases on the scale they promise,” said IFS director Paul Johnson. “The public sector doesn’t have the capacity to ramp up that much, that fast.” However, the IFS also admitted that the size and scope of the measures in the manifesto meant the outcome was difficult to gauge. Johnson said the Tory tax and spending plans were unlikely to be delivered. “Should they win this time it is highly likely that the Conservatives would end up spending more than their manifesto implies and thus taxing or borrowing more. “The chances of holding spending down as they propose over a five-year parliament look remote.” Johnson, who has faced accusations from left of centre groups for pulling his punches when assessing Tory plans, said it was clear Boris Johnson had deliberately put forward “modest” plans. “Because to do otherwise would either mean resiling from their pledge to balance the current budget or would mean being up front about the need for tax rises to avoid breaking that pledge. Johnson said the Conservative party had form when it came to proposing strict spending limits only to break them while in government. He pointed out that the 2017 manifesto had pledged more austerity and spending cuts, but in reality public service spending had gone up, and was due to be around £27bn higher next year than implied by the Treasury. Looking back, he said, it was closer to the 2017 Labour pledge than the Tories’ own manifesto. Tory plans would leave public service spending excluding health still 14% lower in 2023-24 than it was in 2010-11. “No more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in,” Johnson said. Labour’s plans to rake in far more tax, mainly from the corporate sector and higher taxes on the wealthy, needed to fund an £83bn increase in spending, were unlikely to raise the sums estimated, he said. “In reality, a change in the scale and scope of the state that they propose would require more broad-based tax increases at some point. Much of Labour’s manifesto should presumably be seen as a long-term prospectus for change rather than a realistic deliverable plan for a five-year parliament.” The Conservatives have pencilled in few tax changes beyond a small cut in national insurance contributions and a freeze on the corporation tax rate at 19%, scrapping an earlier pledge to cut it to 17%, saving £6bn. “If you think things are pretty much OK as they are, then you will like the Conservatives’ proposals for tax and spend. If you want big increases in taxation and spending then Labour and the Liberal Democrats have plenty to offer,” Johnson said. But a vote for the Conservatives carried the risk, he said, that their promise to exit the Brexit transition period by the end of 2020 could mean something rather like a “no deal” outcome. “That would harm the economy and of course increase the debt and deficit.” Summing up, Johnson said while there were some spending increases for health and education already promised, there was “essentially nothing new in the Conservatives’ manifesto”. “Labour, by contrast, want to change everything. Their vision is of a state with a far greater role than anything we have seen for more than 40 years. They would tax and spend more than ever before, putting in place a new universal welfare state with free childcare, free university, free personal care, free prescriptions and more besides; they would impose a swathe of new labour market regulations.” A Labour plan to spend £58bn compensating Waspi women (Women Against State Pension Inequality) for losses during the equalisation of the state pension at 66 years of age over the last 25 years, was described as an “extraordinary” unfunded promise. Johnson added: “In the face of such vast ambition from Labour, one should not forget that the Liberal Democrat manifesto is itself a radical document that would involve a decisive move away from the policies of the past decade. “Rarely can a starker choice have been placed before the UK electorate.”"

          "headline": "'Truly astounding': inside the Farallon Islands' battle against a plague of mice",
          "bodyText": "The Farallon Islands of northern California are one of the world’s great biodiversity hotspots. These stark granite outcrops, which sit 30 miles (48km) off the coast of San Francisco, are home to 300,000 breeding seabirds, five species of seals and sea lions, and a type of cricket found nowhere else in the world. Scientists studying shark behavior or bird migration patterns flock here annually, but the islands have hosted other visitors for even longer: mice, tens of thousands of them. First introduced by sailors in the late 19th century, the Farallones’ mouse population has exploded in recent years, reaching numbers that have been described as “plague-like”. Researchers arriving for months-long stints on the islands find they must share their space with a colony of scurrying neighbors whose density can reach a whopping 1,200 mice per acre – reportedly the highest rodent density of any island in the world. “Sometimes you’ll see the ground moving as mice are burrowing their little tunnels underneath,” said Pete Warzybok, a senior marine ecologist who leads conservation research in the Farallones. “The numbers are truly astounding.” The question of how best to solve the growing rodent problem has created a decade-long conservation drama, with scientists, federal agencies, and activist groups each convinced they know the best way to build a better mousetrap. Federal authorities most recently proposed a controversial solution that would have involved dropping a rodent poison called brodifacoum on the island from helicopters. While the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) said at the time that brodifacoum was the best available solution, others argued the poison could have hurt marine life and perhaps even caused an epidemic of dead seagulls in nearby San Francisco. “It’s like dropping a bomb in the Grand Canyon,” said Richard Charter, a member of the Greater Farallones Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council, this summer. “Is this the appropriate place to conduct this experiment?” The plan was retracted this summer – at least temporarily – when members of the California Coastal Commission raised concerns about a lack of contingency plans in the event that the brodifacoum approach went awry. The episode illustrates just how difficult rodent infestations of this type are to solve and speaks to a wider crisis of our own making, as human visitors bring unwelcome guests to delicate island ecosystems around the world. On the Farallones, the mouse problem is more than a nuisance: it has become a threat to the islands’ unique ecosystem. The mice eat the seeds of the native plants, giving invasive species a better chance to thrive. And during the summer – peak mouse season – burrowing owls migrating past the islands are attracted by an enormous rodent buffet. When the mouse population crashes, which happens cyclically each year, the hungry owls turn instead on their neighbors, the islands’ population of rare ashy storm petrels. This increased threats, driven by the booming mouse population, puts an already delicate population in danger. Almost all of the world’s roughly 10,000 ashy storm petrels live off the California coast; of those, half live on the Farallones. Research by Warzybok and his colleagues published this month in the academic journal Ecosphere indicates that, even with 15 or fewer owls visiting the islands, the petrel population can be significantly affected. Each owl eats one or two petrels a night, he says, meaning that just a few owls can affect the total petrel population substantially in a single season. ‘We have to get every last one’ It may seem shocking, but dropping poison on an island to fix its rodent problems isn’t a new idea, and it has many supporters. To date, brodifacoum has eradicated rodent populations on at least 60 islands in Mexico, the South Pacific, the Galapagos, and Alaska. It was used successfully on South Georgia, a remote island near Antarctica that had been home to 33 bird species before rats eliminated 90% of them. Brodifacoum also killed the rats that previously choked Palmyra Atoll near Hawaii, where, since its application in 2011, native trees have rebounded more than 5,000%. “In the field, the use of rodenticide is state of the art right now,” said Doug Cordell, an FWS spokesman. That is in part because of how difficult it is to wipe out a rodent population. “We have to get every last one,” Warzybok said. If even one male and female were left alive, the population would bounce back quickly. FWS, which manages the Farallones, formally explored various options for removing the mice for more than a decade, considering about 50 approaches before settling on brodifacoum. “We took them all seriously, including the snakes and cats,” Cordell said. He argues that brodifacoum is the only candidate that is strong enough, widely available enough, and in possession of a consistent enough track record for the job. And although a plan to drop tons of poisoned grain from helicopters may sound extreme, the FWS maintains that it is safe, since brodifacoum is not water-soluble and the proposal included plans to trap burrowing owls and other at-risk animals on the island, to keep them out of harm’s way during the poison’s application. Even so, mentioning poison in the same breath as natural wonders often evokes public horror. In 2001, when the National Park Service undertook a brodifacoum-fueled effort to eradicate the black rats on Anacapa Island in southern California, furor reached such a peak that park rangers undertaking the effort had to wear bulletproof vests. In San Francisco, the opposition has been led in part by activist Maggie Sergio, who started her organization IslandWatch largely to focus on island rodenticide campaigns. “Brodifacoum is one of the most persistent and toxic poisons on the market today, and the impacts of this poison continue up the food chain for some time,” Sergio said by email. She, like many critics of the poison drop approach, points to the instances when the technique has gone wrong. FWS acknowledges in a recent Farallones report that the failure rate in similar mouse eradication attempts has hovered around 30%. On the Alaskan islet known formerly as Rat Island, excess grain bait dropped impulsively on its shores killed hundreds of birds, including 46 bald eagles. ‘Significant doubt’ Rat Island’s legacy is one reason that the Greater Farallones Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council, which advises the sanctuary’s superintendent, has expressed trepidation about brodifacoum in the past, according to Charter. In 2013, the council released a statement on the proposal expressing “significant doubt” about the project. Brodifacoum has been found in significant quantities in the organs of predators such as bobcats and mountain lions. And Lisa Owens-Viani, the director of a conservation organization that has sued California over its rodenticide regulations, points to a 2018 study that found significant levels of the poison in freshwater fish. “I just don’t think there’s enough known about how these poisons are spreading through the ecosystem,” she said. The fate of the seagulls that routinely fly between the Farallones and San Francisco was also of great concern to opponents of the FWS plan, who feared the birds could ingest brodifacoum at the islands before returning to the city, where they often flock to tourist attractions in search of a snack. The San Francisco environmental department considered the morbid possibility of vast quantities of dead seagulls ending up at the most popular spots. And in a letter seen by the Guardian, the FWS employee Michael Fry wrote: “95% of all the gulls at the SF Zoo, Fisherman’s Wharf, Alcatraz Is. are from the Farallones. Brodifacoum takes 4-7 days to kill a bird. All of the birds will be flying back and forth until they get sick and die. Probably half will die in San Francisco. Minimum number will be 3,000 dead gulls in SF.” Charter and other advocates are working to identify non-rodenticide alternative solutions, such as gene editing or contraception, that can slow a population’s growth without using hormones or poisons. But Cordell argues that while these new techniques are promising, they have never been used on mouse populations, and “they’re not at a state now where they’re used to eradicate rodents on island ecosystems”. In the end, brodifacoum presents the only “proven” method, he said. Cordell says the FWS will put its plans on hold for several months as the agency prepares to submit an amended proposal to the California Coastal Commission later this year. Meanwhile, October and November are peak burrowing owl season on the islands. Researchers like Warzybok will continue to step around mice as they go about their work, watching the sky for new arrivals."

          "headline": "Trump plan to label Mexico cartels as terror groups defies logic, experts say",
          "bodyText": "Mexican drug cartel thugs have hanged bodies from bridges, set fire to crowded buildings and tossed hand grenades into crowds. But Donald Trump’s decision to designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) has been questioned by experts, who argue that the move’s main impact would be cosmetic – although it might provide a pretext for possible US military incursions. Tom Long, an international relations lecturer at the University of Warwick, argued that although organised crime groups often use terror tactics to impose control, they cannot be conflated with militants who seek political power. “Their primary motivation is not to achieve political change – it’s to make money,” said Long. “In order to make money, they corrupt and intimidate political actors and political institutions – but it’s a byproduct of their main objective.” Mexico has been convulsed by violence for more than a dozen years, sending the homicide rate soaring to record levels. Strategies to establish the rule of law have eluded three presidents since the then president, Felipe Calderón, declared war on drug cartels in December 2006. Attempts at decapitating the cartels by capturing or killing leaders – the so-called “kingpin strategy” – have only unleashed more violence as underlings fight over the spoils. US attempts at offering assistance have also fallen short. But after the murder of nine women and children from an isolated Mormon community – all of whom were US citizens – calls for action have escalated, along with the specific demand that drug cartels be designated as terrorist organisations. After Trump said on Tuesday that he would “absolutely” go ahead with the designation, Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, tweeted: “Mexico will not accept any action that signifies a violation of its national sovereignty. We will act firmly … Mutual respect is the base of cooperation.” The massacre attracted enormous attention to the binational Mormon communities living in a remote corner of the country, and members of the group were outspoken in their calls for Trump to designate the cartels as terrorist organisations. “If someone is murdering your family, anybody would accept help from wherever they can get it,” Julian LeBarón, an anticrime activist and relative of some of the victims, told the Guardian. “Once it comes down to life and death, I think the moral thing is to choose life.”There is no doubt that Mexico is in crisis – and that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s “hugs not bullets” policy has failed to rein in the violence. Over three disastrous weeks in October and November, gunmen from various crime factions massacred 13 policemen, slaughtered the Mormons and besieged an entire city to free the son of the Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. But analysts who study Mexican security express skepticism that the terrorism designation would do much good. The move makes it illegal to provide material support to designated groups – such as Colombia rebel armies, said Brian Phillips, a terrorism expert at the University of Essex. “But that doesn’t make sense for criminal groups, because they’re already seen as illegitimate groups,” he said. “It’s already illegal to buy cocaine from the Sinaloa cartel.” The kingpin strategy has caused the repeated and violent restructuring of Mexico’s criminal underground. Groups fracture and reform at a dizzying rate, re-establishing territorial control through violence and alliances – a scenario in which any individual terrorism designation would be ineffective and hard to apply. “Organised crime in Mexico is already tremendously fragmented and disparate, so it’s not clear that tools aimed at hierarchical organizations are going to be effective,” Long said. Trump’s comments reprise a familiar practice of pummelling Mexico for political purposes: the president launched his 2016 election campaign by describing Mexicans as rapists and robbers and once threatened to send US troops over the border to stop “bad hombres”. But one unintended consequence of the designation could come at that same frontier, where it could bolster the cases of asylum seekers fleeing cartel violence. US judges routinely reject asylum claims from those fleeing crime, however violent, but they have traditionally been more sympathetic to people fleeing terrorism, said Adam Isacson, an analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America. “It reinforces the argument that the group threatening you has national reach – and that the government was less likely to be able to protect you,” Isacson said, adding Trump’s move might end up undermining his own efforts to undercut the US asylum system."

          "headline": "Lloyds plan to cut chief executive's pay by £220,000",
          "bodyText": "Lloyds Banking Group is proposing to slash its chief executive’s pay by £220,000 and spend £20m to raise retirement benefits for the rest of staff – only months after defending the boss’s bumper remuneration package. The bank is consulting shareholders over plans to cut António Horta-Osório’s pension package, which earlier this year was worth nearly half of his £1.3m base salary before being trimmed to 33%. That compared with 13% offered to the rest of staff. The proposals would mean the banks’s contribution to the chief executive’s pension being cut further, to 15% of salary from July 2020. Retirement benefits for the group’s 65,000 workforce would be raised to the same level, costing roughly £20m a year. The changes, if approved, mean Horta-Osório’s £419,000 pension package would be cut by more than half to about £190,000. It is understood that the bank is not planning to raise other parts of his pay package to offset the loss. It signals a U-turn by Lloyds, which has previously defended his pay package despite mounting criticism from politicians, shareholders and City lobby groups, who have been agitating for pension payments to be brought in line with the rest of staff. In June, executives were summoned to appear before the work and pensions committee by MPs, who accused the bank’s bosses of “boundless greed”. Horta-Osório defended his pay package by saying it was lower than offered to rivals at banks such as HSBC, while the bank’s remuneration committee chair claimed staff saw the boss as a “winner” and didn’t “resent the money” pocketed by the chief executive. Horta-Osório’s total pay package last year, including bonuses and other incentives, was worth more than £6m. Lloyds earlier this year cut his pension payments from 46% to 33% of salary. It also capped a portion of his pension, which is linked to his final salary, upon his request, although that move only cost Horta-Osório £3,000. The Investment Association has been urging companies to bring executive pension pay below 25% of salary but has ramped up the pressure by setting a two-year deadline for companies to comply with the UK corporate governance code and bring executive pensions in line with the rest of the workforce. The bank’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer are also given cash worth 25% of their salaries in pension payments. It is expected that their pay packets will also be cut if the proposals are approved. Commenting on the news, which was first reported by the Financial Times, a Lloyds spokesman said: “In line with the regular three-year review of the group’s remuneration policy, we are consulting shareholders on all elements of the policy, including pension allowances. “As stated before, the group will continue to support the guidelines set out by the Investment Association and, once approved by the board, the proposed new remuneration policy will be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2020 AGM.” The proposals follow similar moves by Standard Chartered, which bowed to investor pressure earlier this month with plans to halve the £474,000 pension payout for its chief executive, Bill Winters, from January. The changes proposed by Lloyds were welcomed by the trade unions representing staff. Rob MacGregor, a national officer for Unite, said: “Unite is clear that the changes announced today represent a progressive step in the right direction by Lloyds Banking Group and the union can only hope that it is the first of many such measures the employer will take when it comes to supporting employees and their pensions. “The issue of income in retirement is for many, particularly younger members of staff, a remote and distant one but it’s an issue that needs to be tackled head-on.” •This article was amended on 10 December 2019 to clarify that the Investment Association was urging executive pensions, not salaries, to be be brought in line with the rest of staff"

          "headline": "Scotland's bogs reveal a secret paradise for birds and beetles",
          "bodyText": "The bog at Forsinard stretches to the horizon, a vast mosaic of greens and browns. The tallest plants here grow only ankle high, but even so, walking requires careful attention. Hummocks covered in heather (Calluna vulgaris) or cotton grass (Eriophorum spp.) offer lumpy but secure footing. Soggy patches of sphagnum moss are less predictable. These bogs, in northern Scotland’s Flow Country, are deceptive in more ways than one. Beneath the moss and the heather and the sedge lies one of the planet’s largest surviving expanses of peat – a nutrient-poor, carbon-dense mass of partly decayed organic matter. But here lies the peatland’s hidden strength: a prodigious ability to lock away carbon, making it an important resource in the fight against climate change. The bogs are also home to a diverse assemblage of species, many uniquely adapted to its unusual conditions, and provide a critical breeding habitat for migratory birds. In Britain and beyond, people have drained large swaths of peatland and converted it to pasture or crop land for centuries. An estimated 80% of Britain’s peat bogs have been damaged or destroyed. Today, however, the country is on the leading edge of a global peatland restoration movement, and the programme at Forsinard is among the largest of these efforts. Peat is made up of partly decayed plant parts, pickled in acid released by living sphagnum moss. Plants in the vast bog at Forsinard are both rooted in peat and laying down new peat as time passes – a process that began about 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. A mass of healthy peat is about 90% water, which it filters and purifies, and houses a small group of specialised plants that have adapted to the extreme conditions of a nutrient-poor, waterlogged, acidic habitat. Scientists now know that peat ecosystems are the most powerful carbon sinks on Earth. They are capable of holding twice as much carbon per hectare as a pristine redwood forest, the planet’s second-most carbon-rich ecosystem, says Hans Joosten of the Greifswald Mire Centre in Germany. Scotland’s peat bogs, which comprise more than 20% of the country’s land area, hold about 75% of the carbon locked away in all British soils and vegetation – which is why their restoration has become such a priority. In the 1980s, the British government subsidised a blitz of bog drainage in order to plant exotic trees for marketable timber. (Since the first world war, when a lack of available timber hindered Britain’s war effort, the country has viewed creating forests as a national good.) The resulting plantations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), species native to North America, failed to thrive. The Flow Country had been treeless for thousands of years for good reason. Peat soil is often too acidic and nutrient-poor to support healthy trees, and the Flow Country endures howling winter winds of up to 90mph, which can stunt their growth or yank them out by the roots. During the forestry boom, the government offered grants to those interested in ploughing up natural bogs to plant trees, and provided tax relief to wealthy forestry investors. Overall, 67,000 hectares (165,560 acres) – 17% of the ancient peatland of Flow Country – was drained. Some of Britain’s richest citizens reaped impressive profits, but usable timber was rarely produced. In most cases, the plantations have grown only spindly trees that are unsuitable for lumber, so are used as biofuel or simply abandoned. While these ill-conceived forests haven’t produced much wood, they did trigger one of the fiercest environmental battles in British history. Richard Lindsay had just begun to survey the life of the Flow Country when the government’s timber incentive programme began. He and his colleagues at the UK’s now-disbanded Nature Conservancy Council hurried to record the beauty and biodiversity of wild Flow Country bogs moments before ploughs began ripping them apart to create tree plantations. “We were literally running along right in front of the ploughs,” he remembers. “We would go and survey an area one day, and go back the next day to see the ploughs [pass] right through the area that we’d just surveyed.” Living in pop-up tents, walking long distances across the formidable bog, Lindsay’s crew explored an intricate world where water equalled life. They found a community of different sphagnum and sedge species – some adapted to live on the raised hummocks and ridges, others thriving in the lower, soggier spots. They discovered that the rolling terrain hid mazes of pools, where diving beetles moved busily between the surface and the bottom, caddisfly larvae trundled along inside protective shells they’d built from bits of clay and pebbles, and newts and frogs fed on the insects. This aquatic abundance also supported droves of migratory birds. Ornithologists who rushed to study the Flow Country found a spectacular array of breeding species. In April, when the migratory waders arrive, the bogs come alive with graceful birds flying, calling, and soon after, incubating their eggs. Throughout the spring and summer, wading birds stalk the edges of bog pools, picking off prey to feed their chicks. In addition to offering rich hunting grounds, the bog provides ideal camouflage. The grey, white, and black plumage of common greenshanks (Tringa nebularia), large sandpipers named for the light-green hue of their legs, disappears against the sedge and heather. Golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) hatchlings look like little more than a heap of sphagnum moss when hunkered down atop the bog. The region is an essential habitat for breeding birds. The researchers found that the Flow Country hosted a startling 66% of Europe’s breeding greenshanks, 35% of the dunlin (Calidris alpina), and 17% of all European golden plovers. Divers – elegant, sharp-billed birds known as loons in the US – also raise families here: black-throated (Gavia arctica) and red-throated (Gavia stellata) divers nest among the small lakes of the blanket bog, often crossing the bog pools with young chicks on their backs. But as plantations grew up, the conifers formed dense, impassable thickets. Predators began to move in – hooded crows (Corvus cornix), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), pine martens (Martes martes), and others that birds of the bog had never encountered before. The danger zone stretched hundreds of metres around each plantation, eliminating potential nesting habitat for unknown numbers of dunlin, golden plover, and willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus). The new plantations brought other threats to the region’s native species. To prepare their land for timber, plantation owners ploughed up the bog, killing off the blanket of native plants that build peat and hold water on the landscape. Water drained away, eroding gullies and drying out the peat. Lindsay, now head of environmental and conservation research at the University of East London, sees bogs as superorganisms in which the plants work together to manage the flow of water and keep the system healthy. “If you cut an artery in your leg, it’s a small wound but can have profound effects on you,” he says. “In the same way, cutting a small part of a bog can have profound impacts because its entire hydrology is connected.” Armed with data from these scientific surveys, a group of advocates led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Nature Conservancy Council launched a full-fledged battle to protect the Flow Country bogs. Finally, in 1988, after about 190,000 hectares (470,000 acres) of UK bogs had been drained and planted with trees, the government ended its financial incentives. By then, the Flow Country had been severely impacted. The RSPB acquired part of it – the 21,000-hectare (51,900-acre) Forsinard Flows reserve – in 1995. Within four years, an additional 146,000 hectares (360,800 acres) of Flow Country bog had been designated as a special protection area under the EU birds directive. At that point, the anti-plantation movement was driven solely by conservation concerns – Lindsay and others were working to protect the peatlands’ native species. It would still be a few years before ecologists came to appreciate another trait of the bog: its ability to store tremendous amounts of carbon (although only if it’s healthy – and wet). When bogs are drained, air exposure speeds up peat decomposition, causing the bogs to haemorrhage carbon into the atmosphere. “Peatland switches from a carbon sink in natural conditions to a carbon source in drained conditions,” says Roxane Andersen, a peatlands scientist at the University of Highlands and Islands in Thurso, Scotland. “Carbon that has taken thousands of years to accumulate could be released in much less time.” Major farming regions in Europe and North America – including the midwestern corn belt and California’s Central Valley – lie on drained peatlands that have been spewing carbon for centuries. “You cannot see these emissions,” Joosten says. “A meadow with cows looks like a rich agricultural landscape. [But] this area emits the same amount of CO2per hectare as driving 135,000 km (83,885 miles) in a mid-size car.” He calculates that drained peatlands produce about 6% of all human-generated greenhouse-gas emissions. “That’s an enormous amount for a source that had not been recognised before,” he says. Today, Scotland is pouring cash into eliminating the very forests that people were paid so generously to plant just decades earlier. The country has spent millions so far, including more than £10m for restoration work at the Forsinard Flows reserve. The Scottish government’s climate change plan aims to restore 250,000 hectares (617,800 acres) of peatland by 2030. Because drained peatlands give off carbon 20 times faster than intact peatlands can sock it away, the priority during restoration efforts is to re-wet the ground. At remote forestry sites, the trees are often so small that it would cost more than the timber is worth to truck it away. In these cases, the felled trees are left to rot in the plough furrows. Bog restoration takes time but today, 16 years after the restoration began, Andersen has found that a location within the Forsinard reserve known as Talaheel – one of the first sites to be forested and one of the first targeted for restoration in 1998 – has switched from carbon source to carbon sink, capturing about 60% as much carbon per hectare as the pristine control site. “Even though some of the plants growing there are not typical of undisturbed bog,” Andersen says, “on balance, they’re taking up more carbon than they release.” Now, with what she’s learned from Talaheel and other restoration sites, she believes that peatlands damaged by plantations can be transformed from carbon source to sink in fewer than 10 years. As she nimbly picks her way across the recovering landscape, Andersen gazes at the mottled emerald and olive of the open bog. She sees hope for the ecosystem’s ability to adapt. “Peatlands have been around for such a long time, slowly but surely forming peat,” she says. “That suggests they’re intrinsically very resilient.” If they can be restored to health, Andersen and other scientists believe that the peatlands will endure, even in a time of unprecedented change. Holding its secrets close, the bog hides a paradise for birds and beetles – and, deeper down, a vast stockpile of carbon we can’t afford to set free.

          "bodyText": "Believe housing: newbuild programme Moving into a new two-bedroom bungalow in the village of St Helen Auckland in County Durham has allowed pensioners Thomas and Margaret Brown and their son Graham to spend time together as a family again. Four years ago, 54-year-old Graham was involved in a hit and run accident which left him unable to walk, forcing him to move into care. Home visits were out of the question as Thomas and Margaret lived in a four-bedroom house without adequate wheelchair access. But thanks to a newbuild from believe housing, the north-east’s biggest housing association, the couple can now welcome their son home for weekend visits. The wheelchair-adaptable bungalow, which is just around the corner from the couple’s former home, is one of four to be completed in the village last year by the housing association, which prides itself on building the right homes in the right places – transforming lives in the process. “We are very happy, and we can see Graham is happier too,” says 84-year-old former factory worker Thomas. “The accident left him unable to speak or get up and he spends his time in his room in the care home. Now when he comes to us, we can see him smiling to himself and having a little giggle. It makes a big difference.” Built on a vacant plot, the properties are part of an innovative £70m investment programme that will see more than 700 affordable homes being constructed across the north-east up to 2022. It marks a change in fortunes for affordable housing in the area, which for decades has been hit by the controversial right-to-buy policy and years of limited construction. The housing association, which has 18,000 homes, is now on course to complete more than 125 new affordable homes in the 2019-20 financial year, with right-to-buy sales running at just under that level. Unlike many other construction projects, the programme seeks out smaller brownfield sites in communities that have not seen affordable homes for decades. Rural communities have been deliberately targeted, including the remote village of Rookhope in the Pennines, where no new affordable housing has been built for more than 50 years. Building started in 2017 and the first 100 homes are spread across 10 different communities in the region, one of the most deprived in northern Europe. Many of the homes are bungalows with wet rooms specially designed for an ageing population. This has freed up family homes for other tenants. By 2020 it is hoped that 240 new homes will be built a year. Already communities including Bishop Auckland, Crook and Rookhope have benefited from new homes, with construction underway in Bowburn, Peterlee and Seaham too. Around 45 sites will receive new homes by the time the current programme is completed in 2022. By focusing on social impact rather than being driven by figures, the programme is already transforming the lives of local people most in need of affordable housing. One young mother in Seaham, for example, was able to move into her first home after being forced to live with her parents due to the lack of affordable housing. Kate Abson, director of housing for believe, says the housing association was prepared to change its plans if necessary. “Our programme is very much about need and tailored to build developments in existing communities. “There have even been schemes where we have proposed family housing and the community have said that is not what is needed, so we have built bungalows instead.” Bill Fullen, chief executive of believe housing, says housing organisations have been grappling with the aftermath of right-to-buy for nearly 40 years. “But now, for the first time, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel and begin to really tackle the housing crisis,” he says. “This turnaround to building more affordable homes than are being lost is a really important crossroad. It’s taken many years of hard work to get here, but it’s work that will mean that scores more families in communities across the area will have access to an affordable and secure home.” Housing runners-up Commonweal Housing and Praxis Community Projects: No recourse to public funds (NRPF) housing service for destitute migrants Migrant families and women at risk of destitution and homelessness have been helped thanks to a unique partnership between two small charities, Praxis Community Projects and Commonweal Housing. The charities’ no recourse to public funds (NRPF) project uses an innovative funding model to provide supportive housing for migrants unable to claim safety net benefits. Using £2.3m of social investment funding, Commonweal Housing bought seven London properties to lease at a discount to Praxis Community Projects, which provides housing management, specialist advice and support to migrants and refugees. The houses were then offered to local authorities as accommodation for destitute migrant families. The councils pay Praxis for the rooms and the charity reinvests the money into more free accommodation for single people with no recourse to public funds. Residents in the houses are supported by housing and immigration advisers, who help them settle in the community and support them with any immigration issues. The emphasis is on holistic support and work is carried out to ensure residents can access mainstream welfare. Matthew Wale, project development manager for Commonweal, says the project, developed over the past four years, demonstrates how partnerships between local authorities and third sector housing providers could provide support for destitute migrants. “Hopefully this will have a ripple effect,” he says, “and people will be able to see how the situation can be improved for thousands of destitute migrants with NRPF status currently seeking refuge in the UK.” Settle: support programme for vulnerable young people moving into their first home Vulnerable young people are being supported to move into their first home by a charity that is teaching them essential life skills to live independently. According to charity Centrepoint, 100,000 young people sought help from their council in 2017-18 because they were homeless. Of these, around 12,000 were a result of evictions. Care leavers are particularly at risk, with one in three becoming homeless within two years of leaving care. The Settle programme, run by housing charity Settle, aims to prevent this by giving young people the skills to manage their money, home and health. Working with social landlords across London, the charity supports young people most at risk of eviction as they begin their first tenancy. Officers work with young people in their homes for up to six months. Among those helped are care leavers, young parents and other vulnerable young adults, often aged just 18 and lacking essential life skills or family support. Rich Grahame, Settle chief executive, says resources are ploughed into temporarily housing care leavers and homeless young people in hostels. “Yet when their time comes to leave, their move is unsupported and abrupt.” Social landlords typically pay £8,000 in eviction costs, while each person who returns to homelessness costs the government £26,000 a year. Settle worked with social landlords in 2018 to support 62 young people in nine London boroughs. It now plans to expand the service and work with 500 young people over the next three years."

          "headline": "Ebola staff in Congo on lockdown after angry residents storm UN camp",
          "bodyText": "Ebola responders are on lockdown in the Democratic Republic of the Congo after angry residents stormed a UN peacekeepers camp in protest at fatal militia attacks on civilians, the World Health Organization has said. On Tuesday, the WHO evacuated 49 non-essential staff out of the 120 people working on the epidemic in the city of Beni in North Kivu, one of the recurring Ebola hotspots. The UN children’s fund, Unicef, also temporarily evacuated 27 staff, leaving 12 in Beni, Reuters reported. Some NGOs suspended their operations temporarily. Each day that insecurity prevents responders accessing people in affected areas is a “tragedy” that prolongs the second worst outbreak of the disease ever recorded, said the WHO’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a tweet. The Ebola outbreak, which has killed 2,198 people, is centred in the volatile north-east of the country. The number of confirmed cases has decreased over recent months and last week the WHO recorded an all-time low of just seven cases. But staff said that whenever there is conflict, the numbers go up again. On Wednesday, AFP reported that six people have been killed in protests so far this week. The bodies of four young protesters were found near the UN base in Beni after an attack on Monday in response to the killing of eight civilians. Six Congolese soldiers were wounded by gunfire, the Associated Press said. “Our demonstration is patriotic,” one of the demonstrators in Wednesday’s protest, law student Fiston Muhindo, told AFP. “Monusco is standing on the sidelines as the massacres unfold, when its chief mission is to protect civilians.” Dozens of protesters, many of them young, invaded one of two UN peacekeeper camps in Beni on Monday, tearing down a wall despite shots fired by the Congolese security forces in an effort to disperse the crowd. Some demonstrators demanded that the UN mission act or leave, and UN staff were evacuated to another base, near the airport. In Goma, police used teargas to break up a demonstration outside the university. After an emergency meeting with the UN, the Congolese president Félix Tshisekedi decided to allow joint operations between national and UN forces against the Allied Democratic Forces, a militia group operating near the Ugandan border that has plagued eastern DRC for decades. Since 5 November, 81 civilians have been killed in the region, according to Agence France-Presse. The Congolese army began an offensive against the ADF on 30 October, vowing to wipe out armed groups in the east of the country. Following Monday’s attacks, a UN spokesman said peacekeepers could not intervene, because the Congolese army had launched its offensive unilaterally. Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s deputy director for east Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, said the security and UN forces were “utterly failing” in their duty to protect the citizens of Beni and other hotspots in DRC. Magango said: “It is scandalous that civilians are dying day in, day out while the local police and nearby UN peacekeepers stay put in their camps. It is high time all entities charged with civilian protection in the DRC, including the UN mission, take steps to fulfil their mandate and bring an end to these killings.” Matthias Gillman, a spokesman for Monusco, one of the biggest peacekeeping operations in the world, said staff had been redeployed to another camp on the outskirts of Beni. Gillman said the mission had not been involved in operations against the ADF so far but that this would change. Asked to respond to accusations that the UN was failing civilians, Gillman said the “modus operandi” of the militia, to carry out random attacks at night in remote jungle villages, made its mandate to protect civilians difficult. The UN also had a duty to fight armed groups, he said, but had been prevented from doing so because the Congolese army had begun operations against the group unilaterally. “We understand the attacks going on by ADF are unacceptable and we are not indifferent,” Gillman said. “Our mandate is to protect civilians but to fully implement that is very complicated. “Our head of mission at Monusco met with the president to see how we can better coordinate our activity and do a better job of getting rid of ADF.” Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the WHO, was evacuated from Beni on Tuesday after her vehicle came under attack, with rocks and bricks shattering the window. Speaking from Goma airport, she said: “Amazingly, a lot of work is still going on in the hotspots. But the problem is a lot of people – around 300 – who are at high risk related to one particular infected individual, have not been contacted. Especially yesterday when there was gunfire and riots. It could build up again.” World Vision, which has 35 staff, 30 of whom are local, running community programmes against Ebola, said its staff were also on lockdown. Helen Barclay-Hollands, World Vision DRC eastern zone director, said operations in Beni had been completely halted and that efforts to control Ebola and measles, which has killed 5,000 people, were at serious risk of being undermined. Children would die from disease if work did not resume extremely quickly, she warned. “This outbreak of violence could not have come at a worse time,” Barclay-Hollands said. “Now this is all at risk.” Other NGOs said the Ebola outbreak should not be allowed to overshadow the “long-lasting humanitarian crisis” in DRC, driven by conflict, which is severely underfunded. A total of 12.8 million people in DRC need urgent support. Whitney Elmer, Mercy Corps’ country director in DRC, said: “For the past year, the Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC has overshadowed the complex and long-lasting humanitarian crisis in the country. We have seen donors pivot resources and lose focus of the wider humanitarian needs, but with 15 million people projected to be in need of emergency relief in DRC in 2020, this cannot continue.”"

          "headline": "Police raid office of Brazil NGO linked to brigade that helped battle Amazon fires",
          "bodyText": "The headquarters of an award-winning Brazilian NGO that works with remote communities in the Amazon has been raided by police, who also arrested four volunteer firefighters and accused them of starting wildfires to raise international funding. At dawn on Tuesday, heavily armed police raided the offices of the Health and Happiness Project, (known by its Portuguese initials PSA) in Alter do Chão in the Amazon state of Pará, seizing computers and documents. PSA has close links to the Alter do Chão volunteer fire brigade, which in September helped battle huge wildfires raging through protected areas in this popular tourist region. The four arrested firefighters were members of the volunteer brigade, and one of them works for PSA. The arrests came three months after Brazil’s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro sought to blame a surge in Amazon fires on NGOs, without providing any evidence. “It is a Kafkaesque situation. We were all taken by surprise without understanding why,” said the Health and Happiness Project’s coordinator Caetano Scannavino. “If [the firefighters] were really criminals they must be Hollywood actors because they tricked us.” The Alter do Chão fire brigade also denied the accusations. “We are sure that whatever the accusation, their innocence will be made clear,” it said in a statement. Local indigenous associations and campaigners said the raid and arrests were a politically motivated attack on dedicated firefighters and a respected NGO. “This is a very serious NGO whose work is recognised by the local population and internationally,” said Felipe Milanez, a professor of humanities at the Federal University of Bahia. The Iwipuragã indigenous association said: “We know the serious work and honesty of our firefighters.” José de Melo Jr, the detective leading the investigation, denied any political dimension and said he had evidence of arson. “We observed in some images that the firefighters were responsible for starting these fires,” he said. “They created a problem for them to solve and make money from.” Detective Melo Jr sent the Guardian a video he said firefighters had uploaded to YouTube. Apparently shot from a drone, it showed blazes burning in a stretch of forest before panning back to reveal a vehicle on a dirt road, but did not show anybody lighting any fires. ﻿The Alter do Chão brigade was formed last year and has close links to the Health and Happiness Project, founded in 1987 by Caetano Scannavino’s brother Eugênio, a doctor from São Paulo. “They have paralysed our operations,” said Eugênio Scannavino. “This is very dangerous. It is a retaliation against the NGOs.” The NGO’s activities include operating a hospital boat visiting remote riverside communities and helping indigenous communities develop sustainable tourism. It also runs an experimental agroforestry centre. On Monday the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported that real estate interests were putting pressure on protected areas in Alter do Chão. In September federal prosecutors said they suspected one of the Alter do Chão fires had been started in an area invaded by a land grabber on the run from police after being handed a six-year, 10-month prison sentence. But Detective Melo Jr said his operation has not examined any possible links between the fires and land speculation which locals say is rife on protected areas.﻿"

          "headline": "Coalition push to expand cashless welfare card faces Senate roadblock",
          "bodyText": "A government push to expand the cashless welfare card faces a Senate roadblock, with key crossbenchers saying they will not consider supporting the legislation until they have completed a “fact finding mission” over summer. The legislation, which is expected to pass the House of Representatives this week, expands the card to Cape York and the Northern Territory and extends existing sites in Ceduna in South Australia, the East Kimberley and Goldfields in Western Australia, and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay in Queensland. Labor has said it will oppose the card without amendments to make the scheme voluntary, meaning the government will be forced to rely on crossbench support for the expansion to come into effect. A delegation from the Northern Territory met with the Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie and the Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie this week, calling for them to block the rollout of the card to the territory. The legislation is due to be introduced into the Senate on Thursday, and the government had been hoping to pass the bill by the end of the parliamentary year. Sharkie, speaking on behalf of Centre Alliance’s two senators, said she and Lambie had agreed this week not to support the government legislation until they had done “more homework”. “At this point in time, we can’t support the bill and we would urge the government to allow us to get up to these remote communities over the summer break,” Sharkie told Guardian Australia. “We don’t take this decision lightly, we are really taking every care to make sure that we are making an informed decision.” Lambie has previously been supportive of the cashless welfare card, but a spokeswoman for the senator said she had “not finished talking to people”, and planned to travel to the NT and the Goldfields before considering the legislation next year. “She has told the government that she is on a fact finding mission and that is not yet complete,” a spokeswoman for Lambie said. A spokeswoman for the social services minister, Anne Ruston, said “it remains the government’s intention to pass the Bill before the end of the year”. The Labor senator for the NT, Malarndirri McCarthy, said the visiting NT delegation was “very concerned” about the prospect of the cashless debit card being imposed on 23,000 people in the territory, most of whom were Indigenous. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning McCarthy said the cohort of people had been on the Basics Card since income management was introduced to the territory through the Howard government intervention in 2007. “All of these people have pretty much been on that card at some stage over the past 12 years and there has been no proof, no evidence-based reporting to show that even that card works. “When the Senate inquiry sat in the Northern Territory and listened to residents, families, organisations in Darwin, in Alice Springs, who represented the regions, there was no evidence of support from those people who live in the NT.” The delegation – which included representatives from the Central Land Council, the NPY Women’s Council and the Arnhem Land Progress Association – also met with the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, and advisers for the social services minister. Josie Douglas from the Central Land Council said there had been no consultation with Indigenous groups in the NT on the cashless welfare card. “Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are sick to death of policies being imposed on us from the top down,” she said. “People across remote Northern Territory have no idea that this cashless debit card is coming their way.” Douglas said she had been “strongly encouraging” the crossbench to vote against the bill and had been given a positive reception, particularly from Lambie. “We are thankful that the senator has listened to us and understands and appreciates that there has been a lack of consultation,” Douglas said. Under the cashless debit card scheme that has been in place since 2016, up to 80% of a person’s welfare is quarantined to a bank card that cannot be spent on alcohol or gambling. The new legislation allows the minister to restrict 100% of payments in some circumstances. Without an extension being granted by parliament, the existing trial sites are due to expire in June next year. Debating the legislation in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Labor’s shadow minister for families and social services, Linda Burney, said the proposed expansion was a “stalking horse” for a national rollout, and confirmed Labor’s opposition. “It won’t create a single job, it is extraordinarily expensive and there are serious doubts as to whether it actually works,” Burney said. The Nationals MP for the seat of Hinkler, Keith Pitt, said that the card was “a tough but necessary policy” and had been welcomed in his electorate. “My community wants change [and] doing nothing is not an option,” Pitt said. “The cashless debit card is by no means a silver bullet, it does not hold all of the answers for all communities [and] it is a complex situation, but we are actually taking action, as doing nothing will never be an option.”"

          "bodyText": "Nineteen South Australian prison guards are attempting to have a coroner removed from investigating the death in custody of an Indigenous man after seven guards lost a bid to avoid giving evidence at the inquest. The inquest into the death of Wayne Fella Morrison has not heard any new evidence since last December, when seven guards who travelled in a transport van with the 29-year-old man argued they should be excused from giving any evidence that could implicate them in either criminal or internal disciplinary proceedings. Morrison, a Kokatha, Wirangu and Wiradjuri man, was blue and unresponsive when he was pulled from the transport van on 23 September 2016 and did not regain consciousness before dying in hospital three days later. He had been placed face-down in the van after being restrained by a dozen officers in an incident caught on CCTV at Adelaide’s high security Yatala Labour Prison. The prison guards have challenged the inquest in the supreme court, arguing that they should have a right to silence when being asked to give evidence that could lead them liable to civil or disciplinary penalty. They have also argued that the deputy state coroner, Jayne Basheer, should be removed from the inquest, saying there is a risk of apprehended bias because she had, at one point in her career, acted in a matter for which her fees were paid by the Correctional Officers Legal Fund. The hearing was listed for the supreme court in Adelaide on Tuesday and is scheduled to run for three days. Basheer and the coroner’s court are opposing her removal. Morrison’s family, which are not listed as a party to the case but have been granted the right to make a written submission, have argued that Basheer be able to stay on as coroner to ensure the inquest is concluded without further delay. Morrison’s sibling Latoya Rule said their family had waited three years and two months for answers about their brother’s death. If Basheer was removed as coroner, that wait would be even longer. “We stand by the coroner staying on for reasons of timeliness,” Rule said. “We just want transparency.” The inquest began in August last year and has already held several weeks of hearings, including evidence from health providers, experts and some of the prison guards. Those who were travelling in the van with Morrison have not given evidence. Rule said they and their family wanted the inquest to be concluded as soon as possible so recommendations could be made. “I am more concerned about what recommendations are going to be made and how that will help us in seeking further justice for Wayne,” they said. “At the end of the day someone has died, and I feel like what’s happening now is taking away from the death of Wayne.” Rule said their family would be supported in court by community members but that even with that support, having to continually attend court hearings for deaths in custody was taking its toll on both Morrison’s immediate family and the broader Aboriginal community. That community is currently grieving the fatal police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in the Northern Territory remote community of Yuendumu. “We don’t wake up every day wanting to all come down to the court to hear about the death of a loved one,” Rule said. “We want to move on with our lives, we want to grieve and to heal ... It’s not that I am against this [legal] process, we support due diligence, but I would rather know what happened to Wayne.”"

          "headline": "Aurora adventure: Norway’s northern lights, on a budget",
          "bodyText": "Beyond the cottage windows the world is white and still. Snow-covered mountains tumble to the sea. A single otter scuttles along the frozen river and disappears into the twilight. It’s 2pm but the light’s fading, colouring the scene an eerie blue. It’s the lure of the Arctic winter that has brought me to northern Norway in January – the strangeness of an icy world with long dark days and, of course, the possibility of seeing the northern lights. But rather than joining an organised (and pricey) aurora borealis trip with a tour operator, I’m here on a DIY long weekend with friends, renting a house in the tiny fishing village of Oldervik, an hour’s drive north-east of Tromsø. Our hire car comes with snow tyres and soon we’re following the wide coast road out of town. Norway is known for its astronomical prices so we’ve stashed food staples in our cases, raided duty free and stopped at a supermarket en route to top up. Non-drivers and those looking to save cash can take a bus to Oldervik: it runs three times a day from Tromsø (£7 each way). The village sits on Ullsfjorden, in a deep valley between two mountains, with our base – the cute four-bedroom, red-roofed River House – on the banks of the Oldervikelva river. On our first day we shovel away the snow from the doorway then layer up and crunch down to the harbour where fishermen are prepping to set out to sea. “Come back in 24 hours,” they say. “We’ll have fish for you then.” There’s little light pollution here, but the night is cloudy – not promising for aurora-spotting – so we retreat to the cosiness of home. The all-engulfing silence makes sleep easy, the gentle thud of snow occasionally falling from the roof the only sound. With no itinerary and no sun to wake us, days play out in a time-warp cocoon. We’re more than 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle, so the sun never appears above the horizon, but there’s a window of half-light from 10am till 2pm that we use to hike north between the water and the mountains, passing picture-book cabins and a tiny school. The weather here is influenced by the Gulf Stream, so temperatures don’t plummet to way below freezing like they do further inland, hovering around zero by day. Across the sea the Lyngen Alps soar jaggedly into the frigid sky. There are no shops or restaurants in Oldervik (nor within an hour’s drive), and although 300 people live in the village, there is no one about today; it’s just us making fresh tracks in the snow. Adrenaline-pumping activities, from dog sledding and reindeer adventures that take you deep into the wilderness, are easy to arrange from Tromsø – as are northern lights excursions, which chase any patches of clear sky throughout the night. And from Oldervik visitors can hike high into the mountains or ski cross-country along the frozen river and stay overnight in a network of huts. But the stark beauty of the landscape and the sense of life being lived in slow motion, make us just want to stop for a while. We cook, chat, read and stare, hypnotised, at the whiteness. When we do venture out, we use snowshoes to climb through the woods in deep snow, past a little cemetery lit up in the half-light. Another day we hike south along the fjord – the moon out above the peaks in a pink-orange sky – and pass a man digging a path through the snow to reach his “summer house”. A blizzard sets in that evening, the boats are back in the harbour, and down at the fish factory production is in full flow, a slick operation of cleaning, gutting and packing the sought-after skrei, Norway’s seasonal migrating cod. We choose one for dinner and watch as local fisherman Lars prepares it in moments. “I’m the fastest filleter in the north,” he says. At Oldervik, it’s possible to catch the aurora borealis any time from September to April, though mid-November to mid-January, when the sun never appears, is best. The visitors’ book has dozens of thrilled accounts of them appearing every night outside the front door or a little further along the valley (Sarah, the house owner, recommends staying at least four nights in case of bad weather). With overcast skies we’ve not been in luck so far but on our last night, at the first sign of clouds clearing, we bundle into the car and haven’t driven far when, with much excitement, we spot a strange glowing arc straddling the road like a milky rainbow. The stars are now out in force against the blackest of skies, flanked by white mountains, the sliver of moon aglow. And then it begins: shafts of greeny-white light dance as if from spotlights on the ground, a UFO-shaped light beams tendrils to earth. To the naked eye the lights are not the vibrant greens and blues cameras capture on long exposures (nor the total black on my iPhone snaps) but it’s a mesmerising, otherworldly show nonetheless. The temperature has plummeted to -10C but we lie on the ground and watch, never wanting it to end. We leave for Tromsø the next day happy – and in the muted daylight see what we’d missed on the way in. Incredible views of water, mountains and snow – and eagles soaring overhead. Tromsø is a small, pretty town, yet after our disconnect from the world, it seems busy. The modern cathedral is striking, the cafes chic and welcoming, the art gallery intriguing. But it’s the stillness of the vast, empty white wilderness beyond that gets under the skin – and the memory of that majestic lightshow will be forever etched in our minds. • River House sleeps six in four bedrooms from £600 a week or £450 for four nights.

          "headline": "UK development bank accused of failure to safeguard Congolese workers",
          "bodyText": "The UK development bank has been accused of failing to protect workers from exposure to dangerous pesticides and paying “extreme poverty” wages on palm oil plantations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Human Rights Watch said the CDC group, along with three other European development banks, had failed to properly oversee its investments in Feronia, one of Africa’s largest palm oil companies. This lack of oversight has enabled Feronia and its subsidiary, Plantations et Huileries du Congo (PHC), to commit rights abuses and damage the environment, said HRW. The alleged abuses include the exposure of workers to harmful pesticides and dumping untreated industrial waste into waterways that provide drinking water. The four banks – CDC, the Belgian development bank Bio, DEG from Germany and FMO of the Netherlands – have invested $100m (£77m) in the loss-making company since 2013. The banks all aim to promote economic opportunities in poorer countries. The CDC has received £2bn from the aid UK budget over the past three years to invest in projects. In DRC, it owns 38% of Feronia. The bank is currently investigating the alleged murder of a land activist by a Feronia security guard in July, amid claims by villagers they are harassed by plantation guards. “These banks can play an important role promoting development, but they are sabotaging their mission by failing to ensure the company they finance respects the rights of its workers and communities on the plantations,” said Luciana Téllez Chávez, author of the HRW report into the abuses, published on Monday. “The banks should insist that Feronia remedies the abuses and commits to a concrete plan to end them.” HRW researchers interviewed more than 200 people, including 100 workers at three plantations in the north of the country, as well as Feronia’s former CEO and PHC’s director general. Two-thirds of the workers exposed to pesticides, aged between 25 and 49, told researchers they had become impotent since starting work. They described skin irritation, pustules, blisters, eye problems and blurred vision, symptoms described in scientific literature as health consequences of pesticide exposure. Christian Lokulo*, 30, has worked on a plantation in Lokutuin Tshopo province for three years, spraying 300 palm trees with pesticides every day, six days a week, for $1.90. He told HRW: “They didn’t warn me of sexual weakness [impotence], if they’d say it, we’d protest. “They told us we need to protect ourselves, but they didn’t tell us what the risks are … We have discussed this a lot, a lot with the [company] doctors. The [company] doctor in Lokutu told us: ‘The work isn’t good but it’s better than unemployment.’” With long-term use, some of the pesticides used on the plantations cause cancer or other lasting effects, the report found. PHC has compulsory medical testing for workers, but none of the workers interviewed had received the test results. Dominique Azayo Elenga, a local leader, told HRW he filed a complaint with Feronia last year alleging the company’s untreated waste was contaminating its drinking water. “My population [in Boloku] uses water that has dirt from the factory,” Azayo Elenga said. “They’re using it. I discussed it with Feronia but nothing has been done about it yet.” The director general of PHC told the rights group he was not aware of complaints about contaminated water. The four banks have described their investment in the company in one of the world’s poorest countries as a success story, providing thousands of jobs and social infrastructure in very remote communities. But many plantation workers said their low wages left them struggling to feed their families. Managerial staff told researchers PHC frequently underpays wages and uses temporary contracts to withhold cash benefits, a violation of Congelese law. These allegations were denied by the company. Women reported the lowest salaries, earning as little as $7.30 a month gathering fruit, with no protective equipment. HRW said the development banks should ensure the businesses they invest in pay living wages to their workers. The organisation also said risk assessments should be carried out to evaluate the effect of projects on human rights and carry out mitigation, and that he complaint system should be strengthened. Téllez Chávez said the banks, which have invested billions of dollars in developing countries, should carry out reforms “not only to protect the thousands of workers in oil palm plantations in Congo, but to set a standard that could prevent similar abuses by other companies that they finance”. In a statement, a spokesman for CDC said the group was committed to resolving the issues highlighted by HRW. The statement said that, in the past six years, wages had doubled at Feronia and that $10m had been spent on medical and educational facilities, clean water and housing. The workforce is unionised and employees and their families get free healthcare, added the spokesman, with the average worker earning $3.30 a day, as agreed with unions – which he said was higher than a nurse or teacher would earn locally. “Even the lowest paid workers earn one and half times the national minimum wage in DRC,” said the statement. CDC said its palm oil mill effluent is “a mixture of waste oils and fats” and “does not threaten human health”, but recognised that “agrochemical application is an ongoing challenge at PHC”. “The challenge has been compounded by the difficulty in sourcing equipment that is compatible with the local climate and ensuring regular supplies of equipment from Kinshasa to the company’s sites,” said the group. PHC requires workers using pesticides to wear protective equipment at all times, and staff have been trained in its use, said CDC. All four development banks were contacted for comment, but Bio, DEG and FMO referred the Guardian to the CDC for a response. A spokesman for Feronia said they took the matters raised in the HRW report seriously and recognised that more needed to be done. “The issues are not the result of lack of intent, awareness, or monitoring on the company’s behalf. They are mostly the result of economic realities where funding has never been sufficient to tackle all of the company’s ESG commitments at once. They are though important to the company which is committed to tackling them,” he said. * Name has been changed."

          "headline": "Mungo national park: where alien landscapes reveal ancient culture",
          "bodyText": "It has been more than 50 years since the ancient dry lake bed of Mungo revealed human remains which corroborated a truth Indigenous Australians already knew. When a geologist found the remains of Mungo Lady in 1968 and then Mungo Man in 1974, the findings showed that people had been living on the continent for more than 40,000 years. If you want to walk in the footsteps of an ancient culture at the very spot where proof of their longevity was found, then Mungo national park is the place to do it. The lake bed is still giving up its mysteries. A walk across the white sand to spot an artefact is the highlight of our trip to the Willandra Lakes region world heritage area in south-west New South Wales. Once a month, you can take a Full Moon tour of Mungo national park to experience the thrill of watching a full moon rising over the Walls of China, a 17km stretch of sand and silt deposited over tens of thousands of years. These layers have been eroded by wind and rain to form a crescent-shaped lunette on the eastern shore of the lake. Once in the restricted area of the lunette, our tour guide points out a midden with scattered shells and animal bones recently uncovered by the shiftings sands. The find indicates the inhabitants had cooked abundant seafood from the once-thriving lake before it dried up some 20,000 years ago. When the lake was full it was a haven for wildlife and vegetation. Megafauna such as the diprotodon, a hippopotamus-sized relative of wombats and koalas, strolled the foreshore. As the lake dried up due to extreme climate change, much of the fauna and flora became extinct. To stand in that vast, eerie landscape at sunset is to gain a tiny window into the ancient history of the continent. The artefacts in this area are unique. They have been exposed not by archaeologists but by erosion, making it one of the best places on Earth to study ancient human life. The area’s three tribal groups, Mutthi Mutthi, Paakantji and Ngyiampaa, have given permission for guided tours of some restricted areas. Our guide advises us to look, not touch, and certainly not to remove anything. Not everyone heeds this warning. In the museum at the Mungo visitor centre, which houses a life-sized model of a diprotodon, there are letters from apologetic travellers who decided to send back the sand, leaves, shells or bones they’d collected. Aside the visitor’s centre sits the Mungo Woolshed, an extraordinary 200-year-old building which documents the region’s pastoral history. The highlight of the visitor’s centre is a collection of human footprints said to be 20,000 years old. They were uncovered in 2003 during a routine survey of archaeological sites and carefully transported to where they now stand, preserved as they were found. They are the oldest footprints ever found in Australia and afford scientists rich clues as to how people lived at the time. Flora and fauna you’ll meet: Red kangaroos, emus, wedge-tailed eagles, pink cockatoos and the stunning green-and-gold mallee ringneck parrot all inhabit the park. The arid landscape is speckled with saltbush, providing nourishment for the animals with its spear-shaped, succulent leaves. Don’t miss: The star of this region is the lunette, or Walls of China. Outback Geo Adventures offer a monthly full moon tour of the area, starting at sunset. In February and March of 2020, the moon will be at its closest distance to Earth – called a super moon. The eight-hour tour includes meals, and is priced at $160 per adult. If you can’t time your visit with a moon rise, the National Parks and Wildlife Service offers several guided tours of the Walls of China, including sunset tours, with prices starting from $50 per adult. Where to sleep: Mungo Lodge is a comfortable ecolodge and restaurant on the edge of the park, with its own landing strip for those who want to fly straight in. It offers a range of accomodation from deluxe cabins to a budget bunkhouse, caravan and camping sites. Prices start from $45 per person per night for budget accomodation, and from $295 per night for self-contained twin cabins. Inside the main building, which was constructed from local materials in 1992, you can relax in front of the fire or enjoy a meal in the large dining room and bar. The lodge also organises scenic flights and tours. The main camp in Mungo national park has 30 spots for caravans, trailers and tents, but you must come prepared with drinking water, cooking water and firewood because it is a remote site with scarce mobile coverage and no power. It costs $8.50 per adult on top of the park entry fees. Nearest hot meal: The Mungo Lodge bar and bistro is open seven days a week for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good pub meals can also be had en route to the national park, at the Crown Hotel, some 130km away in Wentworth. The charming old pub opened in 1861, and the historic photographs on the walls tell some of the story of the town. When to go: The best time to visit Mungo is during the cooler months as the temperature climbs well over 30C in the summer. The perfect time would be autumn or spring. Mungo Lodge closes over the Christmas period, from the 22 to 27 December. Logistics: Mungo national park is a 9.5 hour drive from Melbourne, a 13 hour drive from Sydney, or an 8.5 hour drive from Adelaide. The nearest airport, Mildura, is a 90-minute drive from the park on unsealed roads (although your sat nav or maps app will tell you it takes four hours). Mildura has direct flights from Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and Broken Hill, and there are car rental options at the airport. Bring a topographic map and a compass if you’re camping or exploring on foot or bicycle. If self-driving, a four-wheel drive is recommended. Take your best camera for unforgettable landscapes. A quick drive to Mungo lookout is a must as it offers the best views across the lake bed. • Guardian Australia was a guest of Destination NSW."

          "bodyText": "In the final minutes of Chelsea’s crisp win over Crystal Palace in their last home match Frank Lampard put a fatherly arm around 18-year-old Billy Gilmour before sending him scampering on to become the sixth academy graduate to feature in the Premier League derby. At the west London club which first imprinted an oligarch’s stamp on English football, Chelsea’s sparkling, homegrown version this season – a club legend appointed as manager promoting young players – is the unexpected result of fundamental contradictions running through the club. The most obvious is that Chelsea have effectively been forced to give these opportunities to teenagers who just months ago were pining for moves or loans to get some playing time. In February Fifa banned the club from making any new signings for two transfer windows after Chelsea were found to have serially breached the registration rules in the ferociously competitive trawl for under-18 players from overseas. The most striking is that Chelsea’s owner, Roman Abramovich, the Russian multi-billionaire who has spent £1.125bn in loans on the club since his transformational takeover in 2003, is never at Stamford Bridge these days to see his sparkling team. For 15 years he was welcomed into London and Premier League football, garlanded as his money bought Chelsea stars and trophies, and few questions were asked about him or the source of his billions. Then last year the British government delayed renewing Abramovich’s Tier 1 investor visa, as part of its suddenly keen concentration on Russian presence and money in the UK. He appeared to have been caught up in Britain’s retaliatory action aimed at the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, following the March 2018 outrage, the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Abramovich abandoned his UK application after that delay and two months later, in May last year, he took Israeli citizenship for which, being Jewish, he qualifies automatically. At the same time he abruptly cancelled the 60,000-seat new stadium which had been long in expensive development and for now Stamford Bridge is remaining in its somewhat tired state, significantly smaller than the gleaming, expanded homes of Chelsea’s top-six rivals. In the 18 months since Abramovich is thought not to have been to a Chelsea match in the UK. The club’s chairman. Bruce Buck, talking to the Guardian in one of the east stand hospitality boxes, said that despite the impression Abramovich deeply resents his public snub and the club seeming to be on hold, the owner is “absolutely not” considering selling Chelsea. Abramovich is still intensely involved in daily detail, Buck says, particularly the football itself, players’ contracts and the academy, and has said nothing about selling. “So far as I know, absolutely not; to the contrary,” Buck said. “I have never heard a word from Mr Abramovich: ‘Let’s get this ready for a sale,’ or something. Roman is – I’m not lying to you – as involved as I said he is and is I believe as in love with the club as he was on 1 July 2003 [when he bought Chelsea]. And that’s really all I know about selling the club.” The deepest contradiction about this apparent standoff is the idea, prompted by the government’s frostiness, that there was suddenly something mysterious about Abramovich’s wealth or his good relationship with Putin. There has never been any mystery about the source of Abramovich’s billions, the means by which he made it in the lawless Russia of the 1990s, or his good relations with Putin. It was then extraordinarily well documented in a British high court judgment which set it all out in 2012. The detail has been there all along. But with London opening its arms to Russian money, and Abramovich portrayed as an enigmatic benefactor in his box at Chelsea, few in Britain have been inclined to look at it. How to make billions When read in full, the 500-page court judgment by Mrs Justice Gloster is remarkable on three levels. First, that it so straightforwardly chronicles the political and physical protection, rigged auctions and good relations with Putin which enabled Abramovich to access an oligarch’s fortune in Russia and maintain it. Second, that Abramovich openly presented his krysha arrangements (“roof” in Russian, meaning political influence to secure business advancement) – with another Russian oligarch of the time, Boris Berezovsky – positively, as his actual case in court, because it was how “business was done”. Third, that the British high court documented it all with a kind of approval, including arrangements to “legalise” Abramovich’s huge payments for protection to Berezovsky and to his partner, a Georgian “tough guy” Badri Patarkatsishvili, which otherwise risked being considered money-laundering. Gloster found in favour of Abramovich in his defence to the $5bn lawsuit brought against him in London by Berezovsky, who had fallen perilously out of favour with Putin. Berezovksy claimed Abramovich had intimidated him into accepting only $1.3bn for his half share of the vast oil company Sibneft, which they had formed in 1995 through their association and Berezovsky’s closeness to Boris Yeltsin. Abramovich argued they never had a formal agreement to share ownership 50-50, that Berezovsky had supplied him with political influence, and Patarkatsishvili with physical protection, and so the $1.3bn had been Berezovsky’s final payoff. The Judge found against Berezovsky’s claim that Abramovich had intimidated him. The judgment sets out clearly the context for Abramovich’s rise and that of the other oligarchs: the tragedy of Russia after communism’s final collapse in 1992, when there was no orderly transition to western-style democracy and a corporate economy. Instead, Gloster observed, “Russia became Europe’s ‘Wild East,’” with “immense social upheaval, the partial collapse of old structures of authority, the enfeeblement and the impoverishment of the state and the disappearance of the rule of law.” Abramovich started working life as a mechanic, then completed courses in engineering and law, and he was 28, a “moderately successful businessman,” mostly in petrol trading, when in December 1994 he first met Berezovsky on a yacht cruise in the Caribbean. Berezovsky was a former scientist and celebrated mathematician who had become wealthy through car dealerships and banking as Russia’s old structures disintegrated. In the violent, administrative chaos he had worked his way into Yeltsin’s inner circle and attained political significance. Abramovich characterised his relationship with Berezovsky in his evidence to the court as “krysha” – “roof” in Russian. It meant political influence to secure his business advancement, and Abramovich said that his krysha relationship with Berezovsky also included necessary physical protection provided by Patarkatsishvili. Gloster found for Abramovich, that his relationship with Berezovsky “was founded principally on political krysha or protection,” not a 50-50 partnership. The judgment makes it clear that Sibneft, the oil giant which made Abramovich a billionaire, was created by Yeltsin because Berezovsky promised he would use some of the proceeds to support the president with TV propaganda in Russia’s 1996 election. By decree Yeltsin in August 1995 merged the oil producer and refinery, creating the huge Sibneft, immediately one of Russia’s largest companies, to be 51% owned by the state, 49% sold by auction. The way Abramovich obtained control is set out in the judgment; initially his route was through one of the notorious “loans-for-shares” schemes, for the right to manage the government’s 51% of Sibneft. In the loans-for-shares auction Abramovich and Berezovsky made a joint bid of $100.3m, a very large amount of money to raise in Russia at a time when western banks and investors were avoiding involvement in the country. The judgment says of this price, however, that Abramovich, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili “effectively … had persuaded other potential bidders, by various means, either not to bid at all, or to put in bids of lesser amount.” Abramovich next bought that 51% in another auction process in May 1997, after Yeltsin’s government defaulted on repaying the $100.3m loan. Abramovich and Berezovsky’s company NFK, which had been managing the stake, held the auction and sold it to a newly formed Abramovich company, FNK, for $110m plus a number of additional commitments which added to the overall cost. Abramovich bought the overwhelming majority of the remaining 49% in Sibneft via three auctions in 1995 and 1996, in which, the judgement says, he “exploited that opportunity” by using Sibneft’s own money to secure financing, although he also used a small sum from his own company, Runicom. No suggestion was made that this was unlawful as a matter of Russian law or otherwise commercially inappropriate. Sibneft was a vast oil company, integrated from producing crude to refining it, although Abramovich and his management did have to significantly improve its operations and “transformed Sibneft from a loss-making Soviet-style bundle of assets into a competitive, profitable, modern corporation.” Within just three years Sibneft was making a $315m profit; in 2000 the profit was $675m. Berezovsky wanted money immediately to fund the ORT TV station and support Yeltsin politically, and Abramovich was able to pay him huge sums: approximately $760m between 1995 and 2000. Oligarchs and the president The judgment gives a flavour of Putin’s ruthlessness as he rose through heading Russia’s security service to senior political positions, then in May 2000 became president. At a meeting he held with oligarchs in July 2000, shortly after he was inaugurated, Putin was reported to have told them he would not review or try to undo the privatisations and auctions which enriched them and outraged many in Russia’s population if they did not oppose him in politics. Berezovsky fatefully did criticise and oppose Putin; in August 2000 ORT broadcast criticism of Putin’s handling of the Kursk submarine disaster, in which 118 men were killed. Two months later Putin said in an interview in Le Figaro, referring to the oligarchs: “The state is holding a big club in its hands, which it will use only once. To deliver a crushing blow on the head.” Just four days after that criminal charges were announced against Berezovsky in relation to alleged fraud at the Aeroflot airline. He fled to France and was ultimately given asylum in Britain. Abramovich has never criticised Putin and from early on was involved in activities which pleased him, such as becoming the governor of the remote and impoverished Chukotka region in 2000, which he modernised, spending large sums of money on public projects. Abramovich even bought Berezovsky’s stake in ORT in 2000 to neutralise the criticism of Putin. He explained “I would suffer personally and most importantly Sibneft as a company would not be stable” if Berezovsky did not stop using the TV station to criticise Putin’s government. Gloster noted of Abramovich’s relationship with Putin that he was not in the “inner circle”, nor was he in a position to manipulate or otherwise influence Putin, but that: “It was clear from the evidence that … Mr Abramovich enjoyed very good relations with President Putin and others in power at the Kremlin … It was also clear that Mr Abramovich had privileged access to President Putin.” Abramovich agreed to pay Berezovsky the $1.3bn in January 2001; Berezovsky had fled Russia by then and, following a meeting with Patarkatsishvili at a luxury hotel at Courchevel, in the French Alps, Abramovich met with Berezovsky at Megève heliport. Abramovich, denying Berezovsky’s claim of a 50-50 agreement for the ownership of Sibneft, explained the payment as “buying myself my freedom” from the krysha relationship. It was, he said, “an opportunity to close this particular chapter in my life.” In 2003 Abramovich paid Patarkatsishvili $585m, which he said was for krysha protection in aluminium ventures. The court judgment includes a long analysis of how these payments were presented to satisfy western banks’ anti-money laundering regulations. In 2005, just eight years after he bought Sibneft, Abramovich sold his stake to Gazprom, a company majority owned by Putin’s government, for £7.4bn, exponentially more than he paid for it. The Premier League Buck’s law firm acted for Abramovich in the acquisition of Chelsea in 2003 and in the successful case against Berezovsky; he declined to comment on the case, the way Abramovich made his money, or his current visa issues, due to client confidentiality. About the Chelsea purchase Buck repeated the frequently told story that Abramovich had “recently acquired” a love for football after he went to a match, the 2003 Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford, when Manchester United beat Real Madrid 4-3 but lost 6-5 on aggregate. After he decided to buy a club they hired Citibank as advisers; they held a review and suggested Abramovich should consider United, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur, or Chelsea. “I can’t quite remember the reason for [him choosing] Chelsea,” Buck said, “but I assume that is where they saw the best opportunity balanced against the best price. Like when you’re looking to buy anything.” The Premier League at the time had no “fit and proper person” test for owners or directors of England’s historic clubs. But if they had, Abramovich’s record, with no convictions for any criminal offence, would not have prevented him taking over, injecting his multi-millions and changing the English game. Richard Scudamore, then the chief executive of the Premier League, valued the investment coming into clubs. If any questions were asked about Abramovich the league would – justifiably – point to the general welcome being afforded him in London, the property he was buying and ask on what basis football should make a different judgment. Buck says Abramovich told him and the other executives that he had three priorities when he bought Chelsea. The first was: “‘Have success very promptly.’ And that meant a lot of money in the early days invested in players.” It is a stretch now to remember how alien it was to England’s traditional football culture when Chelsea began to splurge on mostly overseas stars, funded by an owner with no previous connection to the club, to capture the game’s highest prizes. In his second season, after hiring José Mourinho and signing for him Didier Drogba, Arjen Robben, Petr Cech – and Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira and Tiago Mendes, three Portuguese players represented by Jorge Mendes – plus several more stars and the wages to attract them, Chelsea were on their way to acquiring titles and recorded a financial loss of £141m. That was by far a record in football history until Manchester City lost £197m in 2010-11 . The second priority, Buck says, was to invest in the academy to foster success long-term. For years barely a single Chelsea youth player made it regularly into the first team until now, with the talents given their chance by Lampard, sparked by the transfer ban. The third was “to do something for the community in the broader sense”, which Buck says informed the work of the Chelsea Foundation, in which the club spends 3% of its revenues, around £12m-£15m, on social projects, including initiatives to counter racism and antisemitism. These are continuing despite Abramovich’s absence from the club and his representatives say that in Israel he is also involved in social projects and technology start-up companies. Abramovich’s Israeli passport does entitle him to come to Britain and, although not to work directly for money, he can go to Chelsea and have meetings and watch matches if he wants to. Asked whether he put the stadium on hold in indignation at his treatment by the government, Buck says: “He put it on hold a few months after the incident in Salisbury; we can all draw our own conclusions as to whether that’s related.” He declined to say how Abramovich feels about being made unwelcome, after the UK accepted him and his money for so long. But the impression of Abramovich feeling unjustly targeted and rarely visiting, and the stadium project postponed, creates a perception that Chelsea is on hold and the young players are being given opportunities in that stasis. Buck says no and is emphatic that Abramovich is still committed to Chelsea: “I understand what you’re saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: let’s see what happens in the next transfer window. The point I am making – it’s a glib one – if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it’s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.” This article was amended on 27 November 2019 to correct and clarify some factual matters. This article was amended following a legal complaint made on behalf of Roman Abramovich."

Comments 183 entries, with no mistakes, apart from the duff anagram in my clue to BREASTPIN, for which I apologize profusely, but which introduced me for the first time to ‘gay deceivers’ meaning an old-fashioned padded bra (a curious term). Though less challenging than last month’s Spoonerisms, you still clearly found it a tougher-than-average plain puzzle. The clue that gave most trouble was the one for ADES. I was really quite surprised that so many of you were unfamiliar with Thomas Adés, the British composer (and pianist and conductor) born in 1971. My use of ‘shades’ also puzzled several; I was referring to the souls of the departed (Latin manes) forever wandering around Hades. Favourite clue, of 18 mentioned, was, by a very long way, ‘The core earth’s middle pens? Possibly’ for CENTROSPHERE. INTERPLAY proved a friendly word to clue (‘almost too good’ was one comment). The three most popular approaches were: the ‘party line’ anagram, references to the football club Inter(nazionale) Milan, and ‘Pinter play’ with disposal of the initial ‘P’. The first of these produced many clues which differed in only minor details and were consequently not distinctive enough to be highly placed. Note, however, the unusually long HC list above, a pointer to the high overall standard of clues submitted. Sad to report, we have recently lost two outstanding competitors from earlier years, Joyce Cansfield and Frank Palmer. Joyce was also a crossword setter for many years, producing over 1,000 puzzles for The Times and, as Machiavelli, contributing regular crosswords for The Listener. In addition, she was the national Scrabble® champion in 1980 and the first champion of Countdown. She appeared in Ximenes and Azed slips 216 times. Frank was a distinguished and much-published academic in the field of linguistic science, retiring as Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at Reading University. In Ximenes and Azed competitions he gained 29 prizes, 152 VHCs and 211 Hcs, a fine record spanning 62 years. Finally, a special announcement. A lunch to mark Azed No. 2,500 is planned to take place in Wolfson College, Oxford on Saturday 2 May 2020.

          "headline": "From Alaska to Australia, anxious observers fear mass shearwater deaths",
          "bodyText": "The carcasses began to arrive in July. Residents around the Bristol Bay area of Alaska found thousands of dead short-tailed shearwaters washing up on remote beaches, and sent samples to Anchorage. “We collected about 100 birds for testing and they didn’t test positive for any diseases or toxins,” says Dr Kathy Kuletz of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. “They were severely emaciated. The birds had starved.” Two months later, observers in Australia began to register similar concerns. Every year the shearwaters – also known as mutton birds – make a remarkable 15,000km migration from the northern hemisphere to breeding sites in the Bass Strait and the south-east of the continent. But this year they have arrived late, and in lower numbers than usual, leading at least one watcher in Victoria to warn that Australia’s most common seabird could suddenly become one of its rarest if numbers plummet drastically this year. “I’m very, very concerned,” says Peter Barrand, the president of Birdlife Warrnambool. Patchy and late return The arrival of shearwaters at places such as Griffiths Island and Phillip Island in Victoria is well known not only for its scale, but also its precision timing. But this year, something was wrong. “They arrived about 10 days to two weeks later than usual, and that’s significant,” says Duncan Sutherland, the deputy director of research at Phillip Island nature parks. In a good year, about 1.4m shearwaters return to burrows on Phillip Island, but Sutherland estimates that numbers are down by half. The birds that did arrive were in good condition, Sutherland says, but the patchy and late return has him worried. Many of the shearwaters are now heading towards Antarctica to feed again, before returning to the island to lay just one egg. In April, they fly back to the northern hemisphere. Back in Alaska, Kuletz believes she may have an explanation for the late arrival of the shearwaters. “We had some birds staying quite late,” she says. “We had groups that were just too weak to head south. We saw late flocks sitting on the water very late in the season.” The waters around Bristol Bay are part of one of the world’s biggest salmon fisheries, and Kuletz says gillnet fishers were reporting unusual behaviour from the birds hanging around their boats. “This is a really remote and widely dispersed area. Most people wouldn’t normally encounter them but [the shearwaters] were coming in, they were weak and approachable.” Kuletz says about 6,000 shearwaters were reported washed up, but this would have been a “tiny fraction” of those that would have died in remote areas far away from human eyes. The most likely cause of the deaths, she says, lies in the unusually warm ocean temperatures. The hypothesis is that the warmer waters have dispersed the shearwaters’ main diet of krill, while other fish unsuited to the warmer temperatures have moved away to find cooler waters. “We’ve had these unusually warm waters and very little ice in winter and spring,” she says. “The winters have been warming over the last few years. What we are seeing is very much out of the ordinary, certainly since they have been recording temperatures.” ‘Begging for food’ Sean Dooley of BirdLife Australia says the organisation has received reports of dead shearwaters on beaches along the New South Wales coast, as far north as Port Macquarie, to Manly, Bondi, Coogee and Cronulla in Sydney, and as far south as Tathra. Dooley says it is very hard to know how many shearwaters may have perished, and whether the numbers this year are abnormal. The mass wreck of 2013 is still the worst known, he says, with more than 50,000 birds found dead. “We are still talking about a bird in its millions,” he says. “Even on good years they arrive with their fat reserves depleted.” As in 2013, Dooley has heard reports of shearwaters “begging for food” from fishers at Lord Howe Island. “That same thing was happening in 2013,” he says. It is not unusual to find dead shearwaters on beaches, even in their hundreds, at this time of year. A 15,000km flight will always claim some. But some close observers are worried that something worse is amiss. For decades Barrand, of Birdlife Warrnambool, has set his calendar to the arrival of the birds to Griffiths Island, near Port Fairy in Victoria. A day or two either side of 22 September, the skies fill with them. This year, they were late. He says “something like 50%” of the island’s 30,000 to 40,000 have failed to turn up. “If they return to Alaska to feed with the same catastrophic conditions they’ve had this year, it’s going to decimate the population,” he says. “If they don’t do well this year, then are we going to go from probably the most common seabird, to something that’s rare, in the space of a couple of generations. I’m very, very concerned.” On Phillip Island, Sutherland is a little more cautious. “Something strange is happening, but we just don’t yet have evidence to say if it’s at a population level that’s catastrophic, or something else that we are unaware of,” he says. “They’re our most abundant seabird, but they are clearly vulnerable to changes in the environment given they undertake these massive migrations and they are susceptible at both ends of the planet. “With more time hopefully we can unravel this. I’m certainly concerned about what’s going on.” A spokesperson for the NSW government’s environment, energy and science group says monitoring of shearwaters after breeding will not produce results until next year. “Short-tailed shearwaters appear to be having a poor year, as they did in 2013. The difference being that the westerly winds are not bringing the numbers [of dead birds] onto the beaches this year. “These seabirds are very resilient to poor food foraging in their non-breeding areas. If conditions are poor, only the strongest breeders will return to breed, and are the more likely birds to raise healthy successful chicks.”"

          "headline": "Andrew Sparrow's election briefing: Question Time leaders special – the verdict",
          "bodyText": "Leaders special – snap verdict BBC Question Time is one of the most difficult gigs for any politician, and on Friday night Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson all had half an hour in front of what is normally the most abrasive audience in current affairs TV. Sturgeon probably had the best night. Corbyn had a much rougher ride inside the studio than he did outside (where there was a huge crowd of students cheering him), but he grabbed the headlines with an announcement that he would stay neutral in a second Brexit referendum. Johnson struggled to win over the audience, and he faced particular criticism for racist and homophobic comments in his journalism, but this was a rehash of arguments that have been rehearsed before and it is hard to imagine anyone recalibrating their view of him on the basis of what they heard. The real loser was Swinson, who struggled very, very badly. Jeremy Corbyn – summary Often the best way to seize the initiative on this kind of programme is to make news, and that’s what Jeremy Corbyn did. He gave us a story, confirming for the first time that he would be neutral in a second Brexit referendum. The Tories will criticise him for this but at least now Corbyn will not have to put up with headlines like the ones he faced on Saturday, when he was criticised for refusing to say nine times what he would do in such a referendum. On Friday, his answer seemed to close down some of the criticism he was getting from the audience over Brexit. Otherwise he faced quite a lot of hostility, which he handled reasonably well. The most aggressive questioning came from the man who asked about Corbyn’s failure to intervene at a press conference to protect the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth from a heckler. Corbyn’s resort to a stock answer was not impressive, but the anger of the questioner sounded contrived (even by the standards of this programme) and of the two men in the exchange, Corbyn sounded the more reasonable. Nicola Sturgeon – summary Nicola Sturgeon was the longest serving party leader on the programme, and before she became Scotland’s first minister in 2014 she had had a long apprentice as deputy first minister, and it showed. She came over as confident and assured. She said the SNP would not put the Tories into office, but she confirmed that she would expect Jeremy Corbyn to agree to a second independence referendum in return for SNP support. Sturgeon also said the SNP would not expect to vote on English-only matters. Under EVEL (English votes for English laws – new parliamentary rules introduced by David Cameron), the SNP would not vote on these matters anyway. Jo Swinson – summary She had a dismal half hour - undoubtedly her worst of the campaign. Boris Johnson – summary For Boris Johnson that was an awkward and uncomfortable half-hour that highlighted his arrogance and the extent to which he is perceived as untrustworthy, but none of it was terminal, and the main consolation is that it could have been worse. The opening question, about Johnson’s relationship with the truth, could have turned very ugly, but it was from a WASPI (Women Against State Pension Inequality) campaigner and Johnson quickly digressed into talking about pensions. Towards the end, as he faced a series of harsh questions about NHS underfunding, he was very much on the back foot, but none of those questions were steel-tipped. The one that most fitted this category was about Johnson’s use of racist language in his journalism, to which Johnson blithely responded by citing free speech. Overall, it was a defensive performance. Johnson did not say anything particularly unexpected, he did not have anything new or pertinent to say about his opponents and he did not even say much about Brexit. The subject he kept returning to was his time as London mayor – with the result that it sounded like a rerun of his campaign for the Tory leadership in the summer. It did not feel as if he had made any progress here, but he can take some comfort from knowing that by this time next week this encounter will mostly have been forgotten. Meanwhile John McDonnell has rejected suggestions that Labour’s economic policy would increase prices and lower wages, arguing that structural changes would challenge “extreme inequality” and unstable investment. Jeremy Corbyn has agreed Scottish Labour can campaign against Brexit even if a future Labour government brokers a fresh deal with the EU, Labour’s Scottish leader has said. Corbyn has pledged to renounce British sovereignty of the remote Chagos Islands and respect a UN vote calling for the archipelago to be handed back to Mauritius. Nigel Farage has urged voters to elect at least some Brexit party candidates to “hold Boris Johnson to his word” during the launch of a slimline election policy platform based on political changes, lower immigration levels and spending funded by a “Brexit dividend”.

          "bodyText": "Australia has suffered a devastating early bushfire season with fires across several states burning through hundreds of thousands of hectares and destroying hundreds of properties with the loss of six lives. New South Wales has been the most severely hit, with more than 1.65m hectares razed, an area significantly larger than suburban Sydney. All six deaths occurred in there and more than 600 homes were destroyed. At one point firefighters were battling a fire front about 6,000km long, equivalent to a return trip between Sydney and Perth. In Queensland, 20 homes have been lost and about 180,000ha burned. In Victoria, where the bushfire season usually starts later, 100km/h winds fanned more than 60 blazes during an unprecedented heatwave on Thursday. The most extreme warning, a code red, was issued for the north-western and central regions. The state’s emergency services minister, Lisa Neville, compared it to “the worst conditions you’d see in February or March”. Seven districts in South Australia were rated as being at catastrophic risk of fire on Wednesday as temperatures soared into the 40s. A blaze on the Yorke peninsula burned through about 5,000ha, damaging at least 11 properties and injuring 33 people. Western Australia has also experienced early bushfires in several regions, with fears of much worse to come over summer, and there were minor bushfires this week in Tasmania. Is this unprecedented? Australia has always had devastating bushfires, a point emphasised by some columnists and newspaper editorials, but scientists say the fire conditions this year are without parallel on several fronts. Let’s start with the situation in NSW. Over the past 50 years, there have been just two calendar years in which more of the state has burned than this year: 1974 and 1984. With this year, those two were much larger than any other year, as this graph shows, based on data from the University of Wollongong’s centre for environmental risk management of bushfires: This year, which still has six weeks to run, sits fractionally behind 1984. Both are a long way behind 1974, when more than 3.5m hectares burned. But scientists says fire conditions today are fundamentally different, and fundamentally worse in many ways, when compared with some of the fires experienced in the past. The centre’s director, Ross Bradstock, says the 1974 fires burned through largely remote country mostly in the state’s far west, devouring green, non-woody herbaceous plants. The conditions were created by above average rainfall which produced ample fuel in outback grasslands. By contrast, the fires in the east of the state this year have been fuelled by a lack of rain. The extent of the fires is in significant part driven by the amount of dry fuel available, some of it in highly unlikely places, and the amount of dry fuel is linked to the record-breaking drought. Rainfall between January and August 2019 was the lowest on record in some areas, including the northern tablelands of NSW and Queensland’s southern downs. Parts of both states experienced record low soil moisture. As temperatures and wind speeds increased but humidity remained low, conditions were primed for small fires to become major conflagrations. Bradstock says it has put NSW in uncharted territory: “For the forests and woodlands in the eastern half of the state, this is unprecedented. “Natural features in the landscape which often impede fires, like these wetter forest communities, are just burning. There is likely to be long-term ecological and other environmental consequences.” The director of the fire centre at the University of Tasmania, David Bowman, says the unprecedented nature of the fires this spring can be seen through their intensity and geographical spread across the country, noting at time of writing there were fires in five states. The extent of the bushfire risk is illustrated through Bureau of Meteorology data of the cumulative forest fire danger index across winter. The map shows the overwhelming majority of the country, with a few exceptions in Victoria, central Queensland and western Tasmania, experienced between “above average” and “highest on record” fire conditions in winter when compared with the average since 1950. Bowman says the extraordinary nature of the fire season is clear on several measures: the extent of area burned, and the underlying dryness and poor air quality affecting people across the country. Smoke in NSW and Queensland has prompted a rise in people seeking emergency treatment for respiratory problems. But as illustrative evidence he emphasises the areas affected in which fire has never or rarely burned in the past, including rainforests, wet eucalypt forests, dried-out swamps and organic matter in the soil where the water table has dropped. He says one of the most striking images of the extreme fire conditions in recent weeks were those of a devastated banana plantation at Taylors Arm, west of Macksville, in northern NSW. He lists it alongside the loss of other landscapes – including Gondwana-era vegetation in the Tasmanian world heritage wilderness area that in some cases had not burned for more than 1,000 years – as evidence of change. “There’s just layer upon layer upon layer of differences,” Bowman says. “If you narrow your frame you can say ‘nothing to see’. But if you broaden your aperture, it’s clear. “I wrote a book on Australian rainforests. I’ve seen every Australian rainforest biome, and the fact that multiple versions of these ecosystems right around the country are burning all within the same couple of years … This is a really confronting warning light.” What do other professionals dealing with fire say? They largely back the scientists. As has been widely reported, 23 former fire and emergency services chiefs from across the country have jointly warned climate crisis is making bushfires deadlier and the season longer, and called on the government to act. Neil Bibby, former chief executive of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority and one of the 23, says: “It has been the last couple of years where we have been realising things have started to change and this is the new future … It will only get worse.” The chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council, Stuart Ellis, says this bushfire season already has an “enduring nature”. “[It’s] just relentless,” he says. Andrew Gissing, an emergency management expert at the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC and a consultant with Risk Frontiers, says an analysis of building losses from bushfire seasons back to 1925 suggests this season is already the third worst in NSW. In Queensland, about a third of all financial losses from burned buildings since 1925 have occurred this year. Is this climate change in action? No fire can be blamed on climate change alone, but Bowman says the rise in higher temperatures, extreme dryness, worsening fire seasons, extreme bursts of fire weather and behaviour and the spread of fire across the country all align with scenarios painted by climate change projections. Greenhouse gas emissions have a clear impact on rising temperatures and, through that, an indirect link on increased dryness in eastern Australia. A recent study found the extreme temperatures that drove historic 2018 bushfires in northern Queensland were four times more likely to have happened because of human-caused climate change In short, climate change can and does makes bushfires worse. Bradstock says a range of published research has found escalating atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are increasing the risk of the type of fires affecting NSW’s eastern forests, but reducing the likelihood of a similar fire to that experienced in 1974. The elevated scores on the forest fire danger index in winter this year meant not only that the risk of bushfires was significantly heightened as the warmer seasons began, but opportunities for hazard reduction burning had been limited in some parts of the country – although NSW authorities still managed to meet its annual target of 135,000ha of prescribed burning. Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, from the University of New South Wales’ climate change research centre, says studies by the CSIRO and others have found the fire season has got longer, particularly in eastern Australia, where it is starting earlier. This is expected to continue until 2050 at least. “We know that catastrophic conditions are now more likely to occur, and into spring as well,” she says. On this year, Bradstock says: “I guess the most concerning thing to emphasise is it’s not over. We’re not even into summer yet.”"

          "headline": "Children bear the brunt as the world's biggest measles epidemic sweeps Congo",
          "bodyText": "More than 5,000 people, mostly children, have been killed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in what is currently the world’s biggest measles epidemic. Measles, which is preventable through vaccination, has spread to all 26 provinces of the country, which is also battling a 15-month-long Ebola epidemic. About a quarter of a million people in DRC are thought to have been infected by measles this year alone, more than three times the number infected in 2018. Three-quarters of cases, and around nine in 10 deaths, involve children younger than five years old. “The situation is very critical and very alarming,” said Xavier Crespin, Unicef’s chief of health in DRC. “All the international community are focusing on Ebola but we are seeing the number of measles cases in DRC are far more,” he added. Since August 2018, authorities have struggled to contain the spread of Ebola, which has claimed 2,196 lives in the eastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The country’s weak health infrastructure, combined with political instability and widespread suspicion of health workers, have severely hampered efforts to tackle the disease. Officials have described the outbreak as the most complex public health emergency in history. On Friday, the World Health Organization warned of escalating violence, which has is preventing health staff from reaching communities. The WHO has documented more than 300 attacks on health care facilities in the country this year, including six deaths of workers and patients. Health workers say the same problems, combined with a shortage of vaccines caused by funding delays, are also undermining attempts to stop measles. “We don’t have a lot vaccines to cover all of the country. We are doing the immunisation campaign step by step: we begin with hotspot areas and then move to other group of provinces because we cannot do all of them at the same time,” said Crespin. In some cases, families who live far from clinics make expensive and lengthy journeys to health facilities, only to find there are no jabs available. “When they come sometimes there is a stock out of vaccines, they go back [home] and they cannot come back,” said Crespin. A lack of trust in health teams, which has also severely disrupted the Ebola response, is leading some to refuse vaccines. “In some remote areas it can take two, three or four days just for the team to do 100km, it takes a lot of time to reach the population, and when you come there people are not sensitised and some refuse the vaccine,” Crespin added. Children require two jabs to be protected against measles, which means health teams face the additional challenge of reaching families, and convincing parents, a second time. The disease is highly contagious and is normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The measles virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body. Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease, which can include blindness, severe diarrhoea, ear infections and encephalitis, an infection that causes brain swelling. Patients can also experience severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. The country’s weak health system has left communities highly vulnerable to such outbreaks. Unicef surveys in DRC suggest that 65% of children under five are not completely vaccinated. Among these children, one-fifth are not vaccinated at all. So far this year 5,110 people have been killed by measles in the DRC. “The health coverage is very weak, we think about 50% of the population have no access to basic health services,” said Crespin. “There is a big need to invest in strengthening the health system in this country to address the gap we are facing now.”"

          "headline": "More to the floor: the decade the dancefloor was decolonised",
          "bodyText": "In the first half of the 2010s, the western world dominated the conversation in electronic music. White, male producers and DJs, often based in London, New York or Los Angeles, mostly controlled the barriers to entry, and took music from foreign cultures without consequence. Diplo, cherry-picking from baile funk, dancehall and reggaeton and tailoring each rhythm to suit an English-speaking market, is the most high-profile example of this appropriation, but he is just one of many white producers in the post-internet decade who dabbled in different cultures with boyish insouciance they regarded drop-crotch trousers, curtained hair, or any other passing trend. In the second half of the decade, however, multilateral club scenes from Latin America, Africa and east Asia have come to define the global underground, each pressing their native sounds towards the razor’s edge with confidence and technical prowess. This exists, in part, thanks to collectives such as NON and Naafi, who loosened the western stranglehold on dance music. Alongside America’s Chino Amobi and South Africa’s Angel-Ho, UK musician Nkisi conceptualised NON in 2014 as a pan-African, “borderless state” that was intent on “decolonising the dancefloor”. Their incendiary manifesto and militant sound, which included sundry genres from mutant dancehall to the sparse architecture of South Africa’s gqom style, moulded their cadre into something akin to the Black Panthers of clubland – all of which was bound up in red, Soviet-reminiscent agitprop. For NON’s label collaborators, black liberation meant denouncing their citizenship from the countries, institutions and social spaces that had subjugated and erased black and brown bodies. No matter their origins, they found solidarity by sublimating what they called the “reverberations of racialised violence” into music-making and DJing, with a nonhierarchical structure. The Mexican collective Naafi (short for No Ambition and Fuck-all Interest) can be seen as NON’s Latin American counterpart. Founded in 2010 by Tomas Davos (who DJs as Fausto Bahía), Lauro Robles (AKA Lao), Paul Marmota and Alberto Bustamante (AKA Mexican Jihad), it emerged into western consciousness mid-decade. They, too, condemned the insidious effects of colonialism in the industry. “In Latin America, anything coming from the media or music was something that was created in the Anglo world,” Lao said in 2016. Nahuel Colazo, co-founder of HiedraH, an Argentinian collective affiliated with Naafi, says: “Among my friends, it was common for Latin music to be looked down on. If you listened to a lot of Latin music, you were weird. Tthere was something wrong with you.” What he refers to is the type of music that threw Naafi into the global club spotlight. Initially, the crew spun South African house, Angolan kuduro, drum’n’bass and techno before suffusing their sets and productions with the thrum of more local rhythms. Listen to one of their mixes and you might as easily hear Guadalajaran trap by Jarabe Kidd, or a bootleg mashup of Yaviah’s reggaeton track En La Mía folded into Nicki Minaj’s Truffle Butter instrumental. Their focus on showcasing regional genres, as heard in the Prehispánico, Guarachero, and costeño genres in their 2014 tribal compilation, was a rebuke. Tribal music was associated with the poor tastís of the working class, and, according to Lao, not something that the government sees as important or appropriate for the culture in Mexico. Among mainstream, white-washed Mexican DJs and producers, it was wiped from club contexts. Naafi, however, wanted to do justice by tribal music and save it from erasure – they managed to secure national arts funding for the compilation, an astonishing step forward. The success of NON and Naafi countered the notion that you had to pander to an anglicised palate in order to be internationally successful. But NON and Naafi’s ascent is partially due to the diasporic dance culture planted in 2009 by New York party GHE20G0TH1K. GHE20G0TH1K established itself as the matriarchal antithesis to white, male electronic dance music. Helmed by Venus X – AKA Jazmin Venus Soto, a Dominican woman from the New York neighbourhood Washington Heights – GHE20G0TH1K railed against formulaic mixing techniques and predictable DJ sets, instead favouring disruptive transitions between far-flung genres that had no business being juxtaposed against one another. Inside the murky Brooklyn warehouses that the mutant party occupied, punters mobbed to heaters dished up by such DJs as Total Freedom, Arca, Kingdom and Jubilee and ranging from warped alien rap and New Orleans bounce, all the way up the bpm spectrum to unrelenting hardcore. This dancefloor was also highly politicised in the sense that its broad music selection properly represented the black, brown, queer and second-generation immigrant attendees who peacocked in its Saturday-night spaces. Even so, the DJs at these nights resided in cultural epicentres such as New York, Los Angeles and London, with more opportunities, platforms, financial capital and technology, and also had the privilege of being from places that the rest of the world glorified. So, when NON introduced the concept of decolonising the dancefloor, and Naafi spoke about the self-flagellation of Mexico’s DJ community towards its own indigenous sounds, the discourse moved from the diversity of the music itself to the DJs playing it. The critique shifted from representing the likes of tribal, Afrobeats, and baile funk to a diasporic audience towards finally allowing DJs who came directly from the original cultures to be on stage. In a recent survey by Pew Research Center, 60% of Americans believed the United States would decline in global importance by 2050. Current music trends already reveal these drastic vicissitudes of western power. Today’s pop stars no longer necessarily speak English, but often Spanish or Korean. The vocabulary critics use to describe non-English-speaking genres has become more richly textured and granular than ever, firmly eschewing the ghettoising catch-all term “world music”. Club music is no different: the most vibrant and forward-thinking of left-field electronic music exists in Latin America, Africa and east Asia. These scenes, which are tethered together through the internet and social media, grew out of championing continental minorities, as in the case of HiedraH Club de Baile in Buenos Aires. This LGBTQ+ music collective, whose mission links together disparate regional rhythms such as cumbia turra, cumbia villera, perreo, corporal, sasha and guaracha, considers parties a form of political protest and sonic liberation. Co-founder Tayhana (also an affiliate of Naafi) has an almost intimidating mastery of CD decks, and is among the global south’s best and brightest. British-born live streaming site Boiler Room took note of all this earlier this year on the collective’s tour across Latin America. Their first stopover was in Argentina to hold a HiedraH label night alongside affiliates Lechuga Zafiro, Brea and Aggromance. Despite censorship of western platforms such as SoundCloud, Facebook and Instagram, collectives including SVBKVLT, Genome 6.66mbp and Asian Dope Boys in Shanghai have succeeded in circulating their fringe futuristic Chinese sound around the world. English DJ Hodge approached SVBKVLT – made up of Hyph11E, 33EMYBW, Scintii, Nahash, Osheyack, Gabber Modus Operandi and Swimful – for a three-hour takeover on Rinse FM in April. Its crew members have played European festivals such as CTM and Unsound, as well as the opening night of the Warehouse Project in Manchester. Yet, back home, this community of cyberpunk provocateurs still struggle to protect themselves against government-imposed conformity and surveillance, and have struggled to secure licences and regular homes for their events. Arts collective, festival and record imprint Nyege Nyege in Kampala, Uganda, rose to global recognition through celebrating and showcasing the best of their native underground. At the very beginning, organisers used their life savings for the inaugural event, hunted down emerging performers in remote villages and went to painstaking lengths to transport industry standard Funktion-One speakers from Kenya. Their tireless efforts led to high praise: UK website Fact declared it the world’s best festival. In October, Nyege Nyege’s Slikback played at Europe’s most prestigious club, Berghain in Berlin, and his cohorts have also made major waves this year: Hibotep debuted at Sonar festival in Barcelona; Tanzania’s Jay Mitta had his first performance outside Africa for Boiler Room London; and MC Yallah performed at the German pavilion in the Venice Biennale. Perhaps partly helped by the global panopticon of the internet, new generation DJs and producers like these combine everything from the weighty syncopations of footwork to the sparse, percussive rolls of gqom and euphoria of hard trance, until the key compounds are almost unrecognisable – and then add their own distinctive local flavour. The result is a simultaneously global and local sound, and cross-continental collaborations are making it even more cosmopolitan. Slikback and Hyph11E, for instance, joined forces in September as an east Africa-meets-east Asia caucus to produce the EP Slip B. Their tracks are five agitated, polyrhythmic workouts stricken with high tempos in classic Slikback style, while HYPH11E provides a noisy palette of chaotic scribbles and mechanical whirrs; both share a penchant for dystopian jungle-adjacent rhythms. There are sceptics who regard enthusiastic media coverage – like this! – about these distant subcultures as exoticisation. Tavi Lee, the founder of Genome 6.66Mbp, told Bandcamp Daily: “People tend to overhype and fetishise China, perhaps seeing it as a rising, futuristic force that will save the west from its apparent stagnation.” Nyege Nyege co-founder Arlen Dilsizian echoed similar sentiments in 2018. “We see this overwhelming wave of praise, like: ‘Wow this is amazing!’ Well, wait a minute. Five years ago, they said [South African genre] kwaito was amazing, or Shangaan electro.” Both comment on the west’s leering gaze and attention deficit, but there is something to be said about the way, year after year, these global scenes continue to push forward fresh permutations in club culture. Given the nature of today’s polylingual pop, and world politics on the whole – Brexit, and the Trump administration’s dismantling of western multilaterialism – are the US, UK and Europe finally relinquishing their superiority complex? At the dawn of 2020, it’s likely that the xenophobia in western bureaucracies will directly clash with foreign artists from these underground milieus. Crossing borders has never been so difficult. Last month, for instance, Tayhana was detained at Glasgow airport ahead of her show at the Art School; in May, Tanzanian artists DJ Duke and MCZO from Nyege Nyege were denied month-long visas into the US, in spite of support from Red Bull music festival and New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Red tape to import acts means club enthusiasts might increasingly travel to the source. As demonstrated by Berlin’s scene, which brought €1.5bn into the city last year, electronic music tourism is a highly lucrative industry. Festivals like Nyege Nyege and clubs like Cakeshop in Seoul, South Korea significantly boost a city’s cultural capital, leading to sustainable local economic development. Over time, it is likely fans must export themselves to these faraway locales to experience the uncharted frontiers of experimental music – and how this will ultimately affect the community’s carbon footprint is another question. One thing is clear: the guard is changing. Along the international club continuum, producers and DJs are reassembling dancefloor sonics in more iconoclastic combinations than ever before. Promising young performers now have the infrastructure to draw audiences, and audiences, in turn, know that the experts and innovators of any particular genre are best found at the source. As the rest of the world is finally given a global voice, westerners should bow their heads and listen."

          "headline": "Labour would return Chagos Islands, says Jeremy Corbyn",
          "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to renounce British sovereignty of the remote Chagos Islands and respect a UN vote calling for the archipelago to be handed back to Mauritius. In comments that appear to commit Labour to return the Indian Ocean islands, the party’s leader said on Friday he intended to “right one of the wrongs of history”. Asked by reporters on the campaign trail in Stoke-on-Trent whether he would accept the international court ruling on sovereignty, Corbyn said: “Yes, absolutely. I’ve been involved in the Chagos campaign for a very long time. “What happened to the Chagos islanders was utterly disgraceful. [They were] forcibly removed from their own islands, unfortunately, by this country. “The right of return to those islands is absolutely important as a symbol of the way in which we wish to behave in international law. So yes, we will carry that out.” Britain’s “outright defiance” of a UN deadline to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius by Friday, in a final act of African “decolonisation”, has been condemned by Mauritius and the globally scattered communities of exiled islanders. The UK’s refusal to end its occupation of the Indian Ocean archipelago is expected to be marked by protests outside the UK high commission in the Mauritian capital, Port Louis, organised by those who were forcibly deported more than 40 years ago and their descendants. The Labour party’s election manifesto, published on Thursday, pledges to allow Chagossians to resettle in their homeland. Earlier this year, the UN general assembly voted by an overwhelming majority of 116 to six countries in favour of a motion condemning Britain’s occupation of the remote islands and demanding that what the Foreign Office terms the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) be reunified with Mauritius. An advisory opinion by the international court of justice (ICJ), in The Hague, found the islands had been illegally severed from Mauritius in the 1960s. The president of the ICJ, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, urged the UK and other member states to “complete the decolonisation of Mauritius”. The UK regards neither the ICJ judgment nor the UN motion as binding. The UN vote in May, which underlined Britain’s diplomatic isolation in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, set a six-month deadline for UK withdrawal, which expires on Friday. The Chagos archipelago is the last African territory to be held by the UK. Diego Garcia, the largest island in the archipelago, is now a strategically important US military base used by American bombers on long-range missions and, in the past, for rendition flights carrying terrorism suspects. Speaking at the UN last month, Jagdish Dharamchand Koonjul, the permanent representative of Mauritius, said: “The response of the United Kingdom to [the UN deadline of 22 November] has been one of outright defiance.” Koonjul described the UK’s position as disrespectful of the ICJ and the UN. “The time has come for the United Kingdom to comply with the international rule of law which it has so long championed,” he said. The UK’s representative, Dame Karen Pierce, said Britain remained clear that it held sovereignty over BIOT and was providing a £40m support package to improve the livelihoods of Chagossians. About 1,500 islanders were forcibly deported between 1968 and 1973 so Diego Garcia could be leased to the US for an airbase. They have never been allowed to return apart from a few short “heritage” visits. In a speech to Mauritus’s national assembly, the country’s prime minister, Pravind Kumar Jugnauth, said on Thursday: “The United Kingdom cannot profess to be a champion of the rule of law and human rights whilst maintaining an illegal colonial administration in part of the territory of Mauritius and preventing the return to the Chagos archipelago of the former inhabitants it forcibly removed five decades ago, thereby being in clear violation of international law.” Prof Philippe Sands QC, who represented Mauritius at The Hague, said: “The failure to give effect to the [ICJ] ruling and general assembly decision is lawless and deeply regrettable, a reflection of a continuing colonial mindset. It undermines the UK’s supposed commitment to the rule of law.” Most of the islanders and their descendants live in Mauritius, the Seychelles or the UK, where there have been attempts to deport third-generation Chagossians on the grounds that even if their grandparents would have been entitled to UK residency they are not. Olivier Bancoult, the leader of the Chagos Refugees Group UK, said protests were planned outside the British high commission in Port Louis on Friday. He said: “[We] call on all world leaders – and particularly the UK government – to take this opportunity to engage directly with the Chagossian community … and to recognise Chagossians’ right to determine their own future, and the future of their islands. “It’s time the government engaged directly with the Chagossian community across the world, deliver support for Chagossian return and offer proper support for those still living in exile.” Third-generation Chagossians who come to the UK via the Seychelles or Mauritius can face deportation. The Home Office initially told Jeanette Valentin, who lives in Milton Keynes, that both of her daughters, Taniella and Nesta, would be removed when they reached the age of 20. Lawyers intervened and successfully obtained citizenship rights for both teenagers. “They can now go to university in Britain,” a relieved Valentin said at the time. Alexander Finch, a solicitor at the law firm Fragomen, who took up her case pro bono, added: “Had Jeanette been able to pass on British citizenship to her children this application, and its costs, would never have been necessary. “We hope the Home Office will review its policy towards third-generation Chagossians recognising their unique historical connection to Britain.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The UK has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), which has been under continuous British sovereignty since 1814. Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the BIOT and the UK does not recognise its claim.”"

          "headline": "Secret bunkers and mountain hideouts: hunting Italy's mafia bosses",
          "bodyText": "On the slopes of the Aspromonte mountains, Pasquale Marando, a man known as the Pablo Escobar of the Calabrian mafia, the feared ’Ndrangheta, built a secret bunker whose entrance was the mouth of a pizza oven. Less than 10 miles away, Ernesto Fazzalari, who allegedly enjoyed trap shooting with the heads of his decapitated victims, lived in a 10 square-metre hideout in the formidable southern Italian range. When authorities came for him in 2004, Fazzalari, then the second most-wanted mafia boss after Matteo Messina Denaro of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, had already escaped through a secret tunnel under the kitchen sink. Before his eventual arrest in 2016, Fazzalari spent 20 years as a fugitive in the Calabrian mountains, where the wanted men of the ’Ndrangheta have for decades planned and built elaborate mirror cities underneath their villages. It is a literal underworld of bunkers located behind sliding staircases, hidden trapdoors and manholes linked by endless tunnels that merge and separate, leading to escape routes among the sewer system or amid the brambles of a dry river bed. To smoke them out of their holes the Italian authorities formed a special military unit composed of elite and highly trained soldiers known as the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron, or the Cacciatori, literally: the hunters. The Cacciatori have in the last 25 years arrested almost 300 fugitives, whose mugshots are now displayed like trophies on a large bulletin board in a room in their headquarters. They have also uncovered over 400 bunkers, described by investigators as “works of superior engineering”. The unit was originally founded in 1991 with the intent of fighting a crime at that time widespread across Calabria: kidnapping. “But over time that phenomenon almost disappeared,” Major Carmelo Aveni, commander of the Cacciatori, explained. “Another criminal emergency took hold: old ’Ndrangheta bosses, who had always been present in the area, began to get stronger and bolder.” At one time derided by the Sicilian and Campanian mafias, today the ’Ndrangheta is by far the most powerful criminal group in Italy and one of the richest in the world. A study by the Demoskopita Research Institute in 2013 estimated that it was more financially powerful than Deutsche Bank and McDonald’s combined, with an annual turnover of €53bn (£44bn). According to investigators, the secret of its success lies in its deep embeddedness in Calabria. Bosses rarely abandon their remote villages, despite global operations worth millions. To protect themselves they build escape tunnels under their houses, sophisticated bunkers in mountains that are reachable only on foot and hideouts in the woods for when they are on the run. “If we were going to arrest them, we needed well-trained men able to climb steep mountains, abseil down ravines, jump off a moving helicopter; not to mention the ability to withstand cold and hunger for days while monitoring the movements of a suspected fugitive,” says Aveni. “And they needed to do all of this in the dark, given that we often carry out our work at night.” During their night expeditions, the Cacciatori are equipped with machine guns, night vision goggles and bulletproof vests. “At first sight, the bosses’ homes seem completely normal,” says Aveni. “Nothing would lead you to believe that there are tunnels or an underground bunker. Then you begin to inspect every nook and cranny of the house: walls, floors, stairs, even a pizza oven can hide a tunnel. We have even found walls wired to an electrical device. Just push a button to move the wall. “The underground tunnels are very narrow. A person can barely fit through and must slither like a snake to move. Some are 300 metres long and often lead to sewers connected to other houses.” Fazzalari’s bunker in the Aspromonte national park had a television, air conditioning, computers, weapons and sacred images of saints and the Madonna. The Cacciatori have sometimes found copies of Italy’s penal code, which bosses study before going to trial. The list of fugitives of the ’Ndrangheta is constantly updated, sometimes monthly. Arrested bosses are often superseded by their sons, cousins and even their wives. The latest entry is Francesco Pelle, ’Ndrangheta boss from San Vito. Five months ago, when Pelle learned that he had been sentenced to life in prison for murders, he went on the run. Aveni prefers not to discuss the case while his men search for him. Not all the fugitive mobsters use bunkers and tunnels, some turn to nature itself as a shield. Girolamo Facchineri, 53, who was arrested in March 2018, chose to hide in a mountain shelter, among the thick woods of Cittanova. Reachable only after crossing several rivers with an all-terrain vehicle and then hiking through trails and steep slopes for 40 minutes, the shelter was completely camouflaged, covered in vegetation. Facchineri had lived there for two years in solitude, in a forest inhabited by wolves and wild boar. Is it worth it to build a criminal empire worth millions and then live like a rat? According to investigators, it is this mindset that gives the ’Ndrangheta its strength. “Sacrificing one’s life for the sake of the criminal family has a dual effect,” says the chief prosecutor of Catanzaro, Nicola Gratteri. “On one hand, the boss sends a message to his enemies, who could capitalise on his absence from the territory in order to take control of it, as if to say: ‘I’m still here, and I’m still in charge.’ “On the other hand, it sends a message to investigators: ‘I’m still here and you won’t find me.’” After a long, night-time operation to reach Facchineri, the Cacciatori raided the shelter at dawn, when the boss was making his morning coffee. “When we broke down the door, he was sitting on a chair sipping his espresso,” a member of the Cacciatori who took part in the mission told the Guardian. “He complimented us and told us we were very competent in having located him.”"

But, fake faces aside, these two giants play their respective corrupt union men with an understated menace, while Joe Pesci delivers a standout turn as a mafioso for the ages. From Wednesday 27 November, Netflix Ladhood Liam Williams turns his hand to the subject of modern masculinity in this adaptation of his Radio 4 series. In a love letter to his home town of Garforth, Williams explores his awkward teenage years in Inbetweeners-style, interrupting the action with his commentary. From Sunday 24 November, BBC Three Andy Murray: Resurfacing After a hip injury led Andy Murray to plummet from the world’s No 1 tennis player in 2017 to down in triple figures, this documentary film recounts his rehabilitation in painstaking detail, plus his continually thwarted comeback. Murray is typically stoical, all the more admirable considering his repeated defeats. A true sportsman. From Friday 29 November, Amazon Prime Video The Score: Bank Robber Diaries Joe Loya robbed so many banks in the space of 14 months that he lost count; now he delves back into his troubled past to talk through his methods and motivations in this engrossing podcast. A tale of rage and ultimately redemption from the now remorseful Loya. Podcast Broken With Black Friday on the horizon, this new series from the makers of Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown sets out to expose the counterfeit corruption and negligence behind some of the world’s most popular products. The film-makers tackle everything from fake makeup to vaping and cheaply made plastics in insightful detail. It’s a big-ticket Watchdog for the streaming age. From Wednesday 27 November, Netflix Lambs of God A group of nuns have spent several generations enclosed on a remote island, the contented last of their order, until a modernising new priest comes along and much sinning ensues. Equal parts horror and thriller, this Australian original could make viewers examine their own values. Available now, BritBox The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show The arrival of Christmas means not only over-indulgence and presents but also a musical TV special. Country star Musgraves takes the reins, with James Corden, Leon Bridges and Lana Del Rey on hand to help her sing through the classic Christmas tunes. From Friday 29 November, Amazon Prime Video Nostalgia The enigmatic Andrei Tarkovsky ventured into the Tuscan hills for this meditative, visually haunting drama. It concerns a Russian writer (Oleg Yankovsky) whose research leads him into a curious friendship with a visionary Italian academic, living in a rain-sodden, ruined spa. It’s a watery, immersive examination of what it is to be human. Sunday 24 November, 1.25am, Film4 Atlantics Mati Diop made history earlier this year as the first black female director to compete in the main competition at Cannes with this part love story, part horror, part whodunnit. Beautifully shot on location in Senegal, it concerns the turbulent romance between Ada and Souleiman, set against the backdrop of a risky potential migration overseas. From Friday 29 November, Netflix Servant M Night Shyamalan brings the festive cheer with this tale of a couple struggling to cope with the death of an infant child, instead replacing it with that classic of all horror tropes: a demonic baby doll (plus a strangely possessive nanny). The score is suitably portentous and the colour palette is gloomy; a slow burn guaranteed to provide the scares. From Friday 29 November, Apple TV+"

          "bodyText": "In 2007, the renowned intellectual of the left Stuart Hall was asked if it was hard for him that the more equal world he had argued for his entire life seemed increasingly remote. “I feel the world as stranger to me than I ever felt before,” he replied. “Should we have a political party that believes we should tune ourselves up to the global economy? Of course we should – but not two, or two and a half! It’s when everyone is operating in so many of the same parameters that the only debate you can have is a sort of Swiftian debate ... shall we eat the children now or later on?” When Jeremy Corbyn stood for leader of the Labour party, his stated aim was to broaden that debate. His victory was the product not of a movement but a moment. He emerged at a time when social democratic parties across the west were being crushed because they had provided inadequate responses to a generation of wage stagnation, deregulation and neoliberalism, more than a decade of war, five years of crisis and austerity and an ever-intensifying climate emergency. The issue was whether the centre left was capable of providing a vision of society in which the poor did not pay for the crisis of the rich, the weak would not be scapegoated for the follies of the powerful and the planet did not pay for everything. Corbyn won not because he had all – or even any – of the answers, but because he was at least prepared to put the questions. He stood for more than office. Elected the year before Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, his unlikely ascent did not spark the crisis in Labour’s relevance; it was a response to it. The Labour manifesto, released on Thursday, exemplifies why a course correction was both urgent and necessary. It does not justify everything the party has or hasn’t done over the past four years. What it does do is elevate the electoral conversation beyond Corbyn the individual, to the set of priorities, values and interests that his election as leader represented. For most of my political life, Labour has attempted to cattle-prod me to the polls with the threat that if it lost, things would be much worse. It is a relief to have a party woo me with the notion that if it wins things could get much better. The party’s commitment to taxing the oil companies to green the economy, taxing the tech giants to pay for broadband, nationalising the railways, building council houses and offering free training for adults are changes I would like to see and would be prepared to pay my share for. Moreover, they are underpinned by values that have people rather than profit at their centre. A manifesto of this nature expands the sense not only of what is desirable but what might be possible. It forces other parties and commentators to explain why they don’t want those things or aren’t prepared to prioritise them. They will vacillate between claiming that Labour cannot pay for its promises, and complaining that they don’t like how it will pay for its promises, and insisting that the promises are undesirable, untenable or unworkable. Predictably, the very party that squandered more than £2bn on preparations for a no-deal Brexit and £1bn for the support of the Democratic Unionist party will inevitably cry profligacy. Those who claim it will wreck the economy must consider who, ultimately, this economy is for. When the fifth-richest country in the world cannot feed its children, house its working poor or treat its sick, its economy is already wrecked. Those who lamented the choice in candidates on the debate stage on Tuesday now have the opportunity to contemplate the choice in agendas – to reflect not simply on who will win, but on what might change. The manifesto will primarily be understood in the context of the next three weeks. That is understandable. The point is not to lay out these plans and start a conversation, but to get people to vote for them and start a transformation. The manifesto’s proposals will be polled, its inconsistencies pored over, its arithmetic scrutinised. In 2017, the manifesto marked a shift on the doorstep. When people complained about Corbyn, canvassers could pivot to the policies. Often, it turned out, voters liked what he would do more than they disliked him. For the first time since his election many party members emerged from their defensive crouch and advocated not necessarily for him, but for the agenda that made him possible. But while the electoral impact of these manifestos are important they are essentially political documents. If there’s a serious criticism of Labour to be made here, it’s that too little of substance has emerged between the last manifesto and this one to remind us what the party is for and why we should care what it does. In the words of Lynton Crosby, the Australian consultant who shapes Conservative electoral strategy: “You can’t fatten the pig on market day.” The case against poverty and inequality, militarism and bigotry, must be made constantly and consistently, not presented as a one-off party trick. There is a significant, if dormant, constituency for that discussion. On the day the 2017 manifesto came out, I sat in on a focus group of undecided voters from Harrow, north London. That day Sarah (she withheld her second name) had driven to London from Edinburgh, where she had been visiting her mum, listening to the radio as she travelled. Taxing people more for earning more than £80,000 seemed reasonable to her. “Things have swung too far the wrong way,” she said, setting the tone for the group. It was time to “make things fairer”. Debbie was broadly in agreement: “We need to show people we care about them.” While the press deplored this descent into socialist orthodoxy and Marxist dogma – and almost certainly will again – the reception around the table was far more tempered and sympathetic. Debbie and Sarah weren’t just commenting on the coming election – they were talking about the accumulated decay of the previous decade and how it might be reversed. As a country, they thought we could do better. One of the casualties of the media’s chronic lack of curiosity about Corbyn’s appeal both within and outside the Labour party was the portrayal of his support base as swivel-eyed and hard-headed, when it has always been far more relatable and less ideological. This is not 2017. We don’t know what effect this manifesto will have. We shouldn’t assume it will be the same. The Tories have a different leader; Brexit is a different beast; public perception of Corbyn has shifted; traditional allegiances are softening. Anything could happen. But the one thing that has happened is the presentation of an alternative. Living at a time when many find it easier to imagine the end of the world as we know it than the end of capitalism as we know it, that is no small thing. • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "After her separation, Sunshine Coast naturopath Stacey Foat’s search for a suitable living arrangement had not been very fruitful. She had been living in a friend’s granny flat with her two-year-old daughter, Halo, for about eight months. Then a close friend mentioned another single mother she knew was moving to the area and looking for a place to stay. Maybe this was just what she needed. “I knew I didn’t want to live alone,” Foat says, “but how was it going to work with my daughter, our personalities? Were we going to clash?” Nikki Horsford was moving from Mackay with her daughter Portia, eight at the time. The two mothers chatted on the phone and they “instantly clicked”, the pair agree. They found a big house with a pool, something neither of them would have been able to afford on their own. They signed the lease, and Horsford and her daughter Portia travelled to the Sunshine Coast and moved straight in. “The emotional support is there, the teamwork in the house,” Foat says. “We complement each other really well.” The pair have now been living together for a year, and just renewed the lease on their shared home. Foat reflects that they have been lucky to have very similar approaches to boundaries, and good communication skills to work through anything that came up. In a study on loneliness conducted by Relationships Australia, single mothers and fathers reported the highest rates of social isolation. Divorce and parenting are very emotional experiences, especially when faced alone. Financial and child-rearing pressures also mean that, for single parents, there is very little room at the end of the day for self-care and meaningful connection with other adults. Shared living arrangements can help tackle this problem. The latest Australian census shows that multiple-family households have more than doubled in 15 years. It is unclear how many of those are single-parent families co-housing, but, thanks to social networks, and platforms specifically designed to help single parents find housemates, it is now much easier to engineer this arrangement. Jenny Davidson, the chief executive of the Council of Single Mothers and their Children (CSMC) in Victoria, believes that co-housing has many benefits for single parents. “It normalises your family type,” she says. “You live with another single mother, your kids are going to grow up thinking single mothers families are very normal. So that’s one element of social isolation: feeling different. Secondly, it gives you company and it gives you more freedom to go out and to do more things.” Foat says: “Nikki was further ahead on the journey than me. She’d been separated for six years so she was able to say, ‘That’s normal, it’s gonna feel like that for a while’.” Horsford says: “You doubt yourself as a parent sometimes, and it’s nice to have that back-up from another mum to say: ‘Look, this is so normal. Sit down and have a coffee with me and let’s talk about it.’ Being a single mum, you don’t have that validation, that support from a significant other, so it’s nice to have that from someone who is in the same boat.” CSMC has started a closed Facebook group to help facilitate the kind of interactions Horsford and Foat now enjoy. Five years into its existence, the group includes more than 950 members. “It’s obviously filling a need,” Davidson says. “The cost of living is prohibitive. And the private rental market is competitive. Sharing makes it a lot more likely that you’ll get a house, or that you get a house where you want to live.” Wilhelmina Ford is the founder of ShareAbode, an online platform that helps single parents pair up in the search for suitable living arrangements. Her own experience jumping through rental market hoops made her think this was a solution many single parents would benefit from. But how does it work for children? “I always say to people not to go for parents with children of the same age,” Ford says. “Go for different developmental milestones, so they’re learning from each other.” For Foat and Horsford, the five-year age gap between their two daughters meant that the girls took easily to the new arrangement. “Halo adores following Portia around,” Foat says. “She’s learned to swim within a month because they were together in the pool and she was mirroring what Portia was doing.” Horsford agrees that the new living arrangement has given the girls the opportunity to experience what it is like living and growing up with a sibling. Sydney single father Nick Albion was lucky that his children could skip the introductions. Weeks after his separation, the father of four ran into Rebecca, the mother of one of his son’s friends, at a dance school drop-off. Herself newly separated, Rebecca was familiar with the challenges and she offered to host Albion until he was ready to get back on his feet. “My sons spent quite a bit of time at their place anyway, they got along really well,” Albion says. “She offered free accommodation for as long as I needed but I said, ‘That’s a kind offer, but, to be practical, let’s say any longer than two weeks I pay rent.” Albion ended up co-living for a whole year and credits this arrangement with giving him and his children much needed support through this transition. “Living with another adult who has been through a similar experience was like having round-the-clock counselling.” There were challenges, as there were always going to be, with six children in the house (Albion’s four children came to stay most weekends), but the two single parents made it work and supported each other through a time of adjustment. This year Rebecca moved to a more remote location, which makes the commute tricky for Albion, so he decided it was time to move out – but he admits it is not without “mixed feelings”. He worries he will be lonely, and that he and the children will miss the support and balance provided by having another parent in the house. Albion says he would like to find another single parent family to cohabit with, and hopes not having all the children at home at the same time might make it a bit easier. While cohabitation between unrelated single parents seems relatively novel, living with family, parents or siblings can feel like a more normalised social arrangement. Narelle King, a Melbourne-based mother of two, moved in with her sister nine months after she separated from her husband. “We were spending so much on rent, power, and we were with each other all the time,” she says. “So we decided to get a house together again. That was four years ago, almost five. And we’re still together.” King’s sister does not have children but the two had lived together before, and they grew up sharing sisterly disputes. But that has changed in their adult house. “When you want something to work, you work extra hard at it,” King says. No living arrangement is perfect but single parents have limited options and particular needs. The benefits of sharing can be transformative for everyone involved, from meaningful connection to emotional support, to picking up a forgotten dinner ingredient and sharing bills. Ford suggests doing weekly family dinners to build that social connection between the two families. “If you want to depend on each other, you have to build it, you have to put effort in.”"

          "bodyText": "The blanket of smoke covering kilometres of Queensland and New South Wales as a result of prolonged bushfires has seen a spike in emergency department presentations for respiratory problems, but illnesses such as heart attack and stroke are also likely to be triggered from the ongoing air pollution. According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths globally are linked to ambient air pollution. One of the pollutants most strongly associated with air pollution is particulate matter, extremely small solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in air. During bushfires, particle pollution can reach high concentrations. While Australia’s national standard is less than 8 micrograms/m³ of ultrafine particles, suburbs 25km or more away from the fires have reached 50 micrograms/m³ in recent days. By comparison Jakarta, which frequently ranks among those cities with the most dangerous levels of air pollution, maintains particulate matter levels upwards of 140 micrograms/m³. But Australia’s elevated concentrations from fires are enough to affect people with existing respiratory, heart and neurological conditions. According to the NSW department of health, short-term exposure to particulate matter appears to exacerbate pre-existing diseases while long-term exposure most likely causes disease and increases disease progression. Particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres are the most problematic, so small they can get deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream. Dr Arnagretta Hunter, a cardiologist with Doctors for the Environment Australia, said the smoke smothering parts of Australia was most dangerous for those with preexisting conditions such as asthma or heart disease. “The way I think about it, it’s a bit like cigarettes,” she said. “Smoking a cigarette if you have been smoking a long time can trigger a heart attack, but it doesn’t always. It can be the fumes from motor vehicles that trigger an attack, and we know living near arterial roads is associated with heart disease. “The challenge with this fire season is the number of people exposed to bushfire smoke in some regions is greater than we’ve seen before. It is putting us through new experiences in terms of the health consequences.” The vice president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Chris Zappala, said healthy people probably did not need to worry too much. But he urged those with any chronic health conditions such as asthma to take extra precautions, and not to hesitate to call an ambulance or go to an emergency department if they were worried. “They should try as much as possible to limit exposure by staying inside and increasing preventer medications which need to be taken every day usually and then also relievers for immediate symptom control,” Zappala, who is a respiratory physician, said. “They will need to carry those medications with them, and anyone with a chronic lung condition however mild must act preemptively.” For other people, the haze is unlikely to have long-term ill effects. “It will be mildly irritating,” he said. “It will cause coughing but not long-term injury. Our airway is designed to filter and deal with a whole range of dust particles and spores and it does that very effectively on a day-to-day basis, and those filtering and cleaning mechanisms will take care of it even if the smoke goes for several days.” While people should try to avoid being outside, he said they should not necessarily avoid exercise outside, or activities such as cycling or walking to work because the benefits of those outweighed the irritant from the smoke. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine [Acem], the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Climate and Health Alliance and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine President have all declared climate change a medical emergency in recent weeks. Acem president Dr John Bonning said bushfires and heatwaves lead to surges in presentations to hospital emergency departments and that patients with histories of conditions like asthma, emphysema and allergies, as well as pre-existing cardiac conditions were most at risk. “Heatwaves can also lead to increased presentations for conditions such as heatstroke, cardiac events and mental health issues,” he said. “This disproportionately affects some of our most vulnerable patients, including the elderly and children. It is also an equity issue, as people without insulated homes, or who are unable to afford air conditioning, are at increased risk.” Associate professor Linda Selvey from the University of Queensland’s school of public health said the government must develop a national climate change and health strategy. “I know that health departments are aware of and talking about the issue, but in terms of overall climate change adaptation and strategy, we are way behind where we need to be,” she said. Climate and Health Alliance executive director Fiona Armstrong said the bushfires being seen in Australia were “not normal”. With Victoria reaching 39C on Thursday and experiencing extreme winds and a code red warning, potential for bushfires, and a risk of a thunderstorm asthma event, she said people should stay indoors and follow medical advice to avoid putting themselves at risk. “The conditions we are experiencing are those that scientists have warned about for decades,” Armstrong said. “Without decisive action to phase out the burning coal and other fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming, these conditions will continue to worsen.”"

          "headline": "Detectorists hid find that rewrites Anglo-Saxon history",
          "bodyText": "On a sunny day in June 2015 amateur metal detectorists George Powell and Layton Davies were hunting for treasure in fields at a remote spot in Herefordshire. The pair had done their research carefully and were focusing on a promising area just north of Leominster, close to high land and a wood with intriguing regal names – Kings Hall Hill and Kings Hall Covert. But in their wildest dreams they could not have imagined what they were about to find when the alarm on one of their detectors sounded and they began to dig. Powell and Davies unearthed a hoard hidden more than 1,000 years ago, almost certainly by a Viking warrior who was part of an army that retreated into the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia after being defeated by Alfred the Great in 878. There was gold jewellery including a chunky ring, an arm bracelet in the shape of a serpent and a small crystal ball held by thin strips of gold that would have been worn as a pendant. Beneath the gold were silver ingots and an estimated 300 silver coins. The law is clear: such finds should be reported to the local coroner within 14 days and failure to do so risks an unlimited fine and up to three months in prison. Any reward may be split between the finder, land owner and land occupier. Powell and Davies, experienced detectorists from south Wales, chose a different route. Two days later they went to a Cardiff antiques centre called the Pumping Station and showed some examples of their find to coin dealer Paul Wells. He immediately knew they were very special. The crystal ball pendant turned out to be the oldest item, probably dating from the 5th or 6th century, while the ring and arm bracelet are thought to be 9th- century. They were described as priceless in court. Nothing like the arm bracelet has ever been seen by modern man before. But if anything, the coins turned out to be even more significant. Among them were extremely rare “two emperor” coins depicting two Anglo-Saxon rulers: King Alfred of Wessex and Ceolwulf II of Mercia. They are important because they give a fresh glimpse of how Mercia and Wessex were ruled in the 9th century at about the time England was morphing into a single united kingdom. Still, the pair did not contact the authorities. Instead Powell got in touch with another treasure hunter, Simon Wicks from East Sussex, and two weeks after the find he presented himself at upmarket coin auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb in Mayfair, central London. Wicks put a selection of the coins found in Herefordshire, including a pair of the two emperors, in front of one its leading experts. The expert gasped when he saw the coins and suggested the two emperors could be worth £100,000 each. Meanwhile, whispers that Powell and Davies had struck gold had begun to circulate and on 6 July – 33 days after their discovery – the Herefordshire finds liaison officer, Peter Reavill, contacted Powell and Davies and gently asked if they had anything to tell him about. Powell initially replied with a firm denial but they eventually handed over the gold jewellery and an ingot. However, they insisted they had only found a couple of damaged coins that they did not need to declare. But the net was closing in. Police visited Wells’ house and he showed them five coins from the hoard that had been stitched into his magnifying glass case. When he was arrested he said: “I knew it would come to this.” Thirty coins from the hoard including five of the two emperors have been recovered and, together with the gold jewellery and silver ingot, are safe in the hands of the British Museum. Gareth Williams, a specialist in the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings at the museum, said the coins were changing historians’ understanding of the period. Alfred has long been seen as a significant figure in English history, while Ceolwulf II has been regarded as a much less important personage, a puppet of the Vikings. The presence of both kings on the two emperor coins suggests some sort of pact between the pair. But the rarity of the coins also suggests that Alfred quickly dropped his ally, who was just about written out of history. The presence of the coins near Leominster suggests that part of the Viking army was in the area after being defeated in Wiltshire in 878 before moving east via Watlington in Oxfordshire. In a striking coincidence another metal detector found a Viking hoard in Watlington in October 2015 – four months after the Herefordshire hoard was unearthed. That hoard was declared and is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Williams said: “The two hoards together are fundamentally changing our view of history. These coins are encouraging us to go back to the written sources and re-examine them.” The hoard may eventually be exhibited at the British Museum and in a museum in Herefordshire. Meanwhile the four men could face jail terms much longer than the three months for failing to declare a find. The value of the hoard and the attempt to hang on to it permanently means that Powell and Davies at least could be facing years in prison. But because only 30 of the Herefordshire coins out of an estimated 300 have been recovered, the picture is incomplete. Judge Nicolas Cartwright made it clear he believed they knew where the missing coins – worth millions – were. The police hunt for these precious pieces of English history goes on."

          "bodyText": "By any measure Australia’s First Peoples with disabilities are among some of the most disadvantaged people in Australia today. This is because they often face discrimination based on their Aboriginality and/or disability. Meeting the needs of First Peoples with disabilities is one of the most urgent and critical social justice issues in Australia today. Yet despite the many unmet needs, the situation for the vast majority of First Peoples with disability remains largely unknown to the wider community. In the experience of the First Peoples Disability Network, we say that the majority of First Peoples with disabilities live in poverty. They also lack access to disability appropriate housing. Many young Aboriginal people with disability cannot attend school or can only participate in a very limited way because their local school can’t accommodate their disability. And we have the extraordinary ongoing situation of the indefinite detention of First Peoples with disabilities in Australian prisons, particularly in the Northern Territory. The human rights situation and the violations experienced by many First Peoples with disabilities are often deeply disturbing. The disability royal commission is likely to expose, often for the very first time, the serious abuse and neglect of First Peoples with disability. Regrettably with the advent of the National Disability Insurance Scheme we have seen a predictable path which has seen many First Peoples with disabilities either miss out or getting seriously under-resourced plans. This continues to occur because there is effectively no meaningful advocacy support for First Peoples with disabilities to access the NDIS. We at the FPDN predicted this would happen because sadly we are all too familiar with how the system rarely prioritises or understands the sometimes unique needs of First Peoples with disabilities. We have documented this for a decade, and other First Peoples with disability prior have done so too, articulating a clear way forward to address the needs of First Peoples with disability. At FPDN we have long observed that the disability system is upside down in many ways. The voices of people with disability including First Peoples with disability are often superseded by the voices of the service system or the bureaucracy. We are concerned that the NDIS is becoming increasingly medicalised, requiring individuals with disability to prove their disability and to get more and more medical assessments. This approach is proving a very significant barrier for many First Peoples with disabilities, especially for those living in regional and remote Australia because of costs associated with such assessments. It can be very difficult to access specialists for assessments outside of the country’s cities. This medicalised approach is in conflict with the sentiment and the human rights approach to disability that is supposed to be the driving force behind the scheme itself. We need a truly social model of disability approach that addresses functional impairment as opposed to a heavily labelled approach that seeks to approach a person’s disability based upon deficit that will in our view only further disenfranchise First People with disability and all Australians with disability. At FPDN we say we are the thought leaders on inclusion. We know this because in traditional language there was and is no word for disability. This is a wonderful thing in our communities – we have always been “come as you are”. Evidence gathered from Lake Mungo has recently discovered a single footprint of what is believed to have been a male who was using a stick to assist with his running. This is compelling evidence that shows we have always known that disability is part of the human experience. However, we are continuing to butt up against a system that requires people with disability to accept labels that we say are fundamentally about deficit. We know that most Australians with disability share our world view that we must reject the medical model of disability, continue to advocate for the social model of disability but move to the model we propose that of a culture of inclusion. Because we predicted as far back as 2013, when the NDIS was first established, that First Peoples with disability would be regrettably likely left behind we developed a 10-point plan for the successful implementation of the NDIS in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Some six years later we state again our plan to meet the needs of our people with disability. • Damian Griffis is a descendant of the Worimi people of the Manning Valley in NSW.

          "headline": "Johnson’s ‘Get Brexit done’ drumbeat cannot drown out reality for ever",
          "bodyText": "One test of a campaign slogan is how efficiently it helps voters explain their preference to others and to themselves. Why Donald Trump? To make America great again. Why leave the EU? To take back control. Simple. Boris Johnson has found that kind of groove with his pledge to “Get Brexit done”, which is why he beat the phrase like a drum in televised leader debates this week. It packs a lot into four syllables: release from the EU for those who really care, and relief from having to think about it to those who don’t. It has the pleasing crispness of a page being turned, while making Labour’s policy feel like a threat to reread a grim chapter all over again. As politics, “Get Brexit done” is snappy; as policy, it is empty. It is the vacuous sequel to “Take back control”, starring the same falsehood about Britain’s global stature. Johnson’s claim now, as in the referendum campaign, is that leaving Europe is an act of empowerment. It contains the illusion that we, the liberated nation, tell them, the spurned continentals, how things will be. Three years of negotiation tell a different story. The UK tried to retain privileges of EU membership without abiding by the rules, failed, and watched its deal deteriorate as a result. If the Tories win a majority, that pattern repeats all next year. The old movie will be remade with the same gallop towards a cliff edge, cheered on by hardliners lying about “clean breaks”. Johnson’s plan is to complete a comprehensive free-trade agreement before transitional arrangements expire next December. More time is available, but he insists it will not be necessary. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, extension would have to be sought by July. The government would need to make record-breaking progress in final-status talks in the first months of 2020 for Johnson’s boast to be vindicated. That looks unlikely. Trade talks between advanced economies can fill the best part of a decade. Ministers have three lines of defence for their improbable timetable. First, the UK and EU start from what Johnson describes as “perfect alignment and harmony”, so there isn’t much to adjust. Second, Phil Hogan, the EU trade commissioner, has said a year is sufficient. Third, people said Johnson couldn’t ditch the backstop from Theresa May’s deal, but he did; he is the naysayers’ nemesis. Those arguments are bogus. Citing the status quo as evidence that change will be easy is an old Brexiteer con. As Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform, says: “Where we start isn’t what matters, it’s all about where we want to end up.” Johnson’s plan explicitly mandates divergence from EU norms. Its purpose is to carve out competitive advantage through deregulation. Brussels sees that as a threat to undercut continental businesses and dump substandard goods on EU consumers. The price of market access is set at a high level of compliance with European rules, which Tories despise. The narrowness of the Channel and the Eurosceptic fixation on de-alignment combine to make future trade talks harder than EU dealings with more remote countries. When EU officials nod along with the tight timetable, they are being polite and trying not to spook British voters. The commission wants the deal ratified as much as Johnson does. An imbalance of power favours Brussels as much in the next phase as it did in withdrawal talks. A new hand is dealt but the rules don’t change: the lone state gets weaker cards than the bloc of 27. The commission brings cold-blooded negotiators, hardened over decades of top-level technical negotiation. The UK brings a demoralised civil service with little experience of trade talks, instructed by delusional Tories who think free trade is something to do with Britannia and ruling waves. As for Johnson’s powers of persuasion, they are fictional. He achieved removal of the backstop by abandoning a promise not to permit a trade border between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain, burning the DUP and reverting to a Brexit model he had once vigorously rejected. That climbdown hints at one method for meeting the December 2020 deadline. If Johnson is prepared to sign pretty much anything to show he has met his promise of progress, he can cobble a deal together – a “bare bones” agreement, according to Sabine Weyand, head of the EU’s trade directorate. That would still need subsequent negotiation and phased implementation, but there is probably a way to stretch transition at the 11th hour, calling it something else to allow Johnson the pretence of not having begged for an extension. First overboard in the great betrayal will be fishermen. Brexit offered them false hope that foreign trawlers would be banished from UK waters. But hated quotas will be back. Other maritime EU states will demand them as a condition of progress in talks over other issues. Johnson will fold, and then systematically let down other voters who trusted him. If returned to Downing Street, he will spend next year climbing the steep learning curve towards realisation that Britain thrives on frictionless access to the single market – something his deal prevents. He will discover the finer points of “rules of origin” that make it uneconomic for manufacturers to keep links in their supply chains outside the EU. He will notice businesses using transition to activate relocation plans they had drafted for emergency evacuation in case of a no-deal Brexit. His diplomacy will be sabotaged by Tory hardliners paranoid about gravitation back into Brussels’ orbit. Impatience for a trade deal with Washington will spur Eurosceptic zealots into battle against any pragmatist who tries to repair relations with Europe. Johnson will lie like crazy to appease both sides, and be despised for the duplicity. That doesn’t mean Brexit will still dominate headlines. If the Tories prevail on polling day they will have a mandate to change the subject, and a vanquished opposition will not foist Brussels business back into the news. Jeremy Corbyn is already trying to foist it out of the election campaign. Neither of the main candidates to be prime minister sees benefit for themselves in a realistic debate about Britain’s European future. Why should they? Realism is a gloomy song, a meandering number with dissonant harmonies and no prospect of satisfying resolution. It is not a hummable tune. It lacks the upbeat tempo of “Get Brexit done”, which has the makings of a one-hit wonder to top the electoral charts by Christmas. But then the months go by, it is December 2020, Johnson’s jaunty tune is an awkward memory. And Brexit is still not done. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Robert Ponsonby obituary",
          "bodyText": "Robert Ponsonby, who has died aged 92, was a highly influential figure in music administration, directing the Edinburgh festival from 1955 to 1960 and the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts (now the BBC Proms) from 1974 to 1986, during which period he also served as the controller of Radio 3. Between those posts he acted as the general administrator of the Scottish National Orchestra (1964-72), while in later years he devoted his energies to a considerable number of musical institutions, notably the Musicians Benevolent Fund, the Young Concert Artists Trust, the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation and the Purcell school. Highlights of his Edinburgh tenure included Maria Callas and the La Scala company in Bellini’s La Sonnambula; Birgit Nilsson (with Set Svanholm, Kerstin Meyer and Elisabeth Söderström) in Wagner’s Die Walküre; Britten conducting Britten and accompanying Peter Pears; Isaac Stern with Myra Hess; the young Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Irmgard Seefried in lieder by Hugo Wolf; and Victoria de los Angeles in Falla’s La Vida Breve and in recitals with Gerald Moore. He also secured some fine theatrical performances, such as Christopher Plummer’s Henry V with the company of Stratford, Ontario. On the lighter side, he brought to the festival the singer-comedian Anna Russell, Flanders and Swann and Beyond the Fringe. He later described the Edinburgh years as his “apprenticeship”, his learning curve encompassing handling great artists, dealing with foreign agencies and “uncomprehending bureaucrats”, not to mention the press. There were also the civic authorities to contend with and it was their “indifference, sometimes approaching hostility”, coupled with severe economic constraints, that precipitated his ultimate resignation. Those pragmatic skills were to be tested further in his years at the BBC, an organisation he described as “my bread and butter (and sometimes jam) for 13 years”. One incident on his watch left a bitter taste, however: a strike by BBC musicians that resulted in the cancellation of 20 concerts in the 1980 season. The corporation had proposed, on artistic as well as financial grounds, to disband five of its 11 full-time in-house ensembles, including the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. There was strong resistance from the music community, with a petition to parliament gathering half a million signatures. The BBCSSO was reprieved, though only five of the original ensembles remain today. Unhappy with the corporation’s handling of the affair, Ponsonby contemplated resigning, but was persuaded otherwise by Colin Davis. There was also the ever-controversial issue of programming the Proms. As successor to William Glock, whose devotion to the avant garde was not to all tastes, Ponsonby endeavoured to steer a course between Glock’s rigorous modernism and English late Romantic composers, for which there was enthusiastic lobbying. His policy was to draw on the vastly expanding classical repertoire, not least with regard to contemporary British composers. These included Harrison Birtwistle, Simon Bainbridge, David Blake, Peter Maxwell Davies, Jonathan Harvey, Robin Holloway, Oliver Knussen, Nicholas Maw, Giles Swayne, Hugh Wood and many others. Inevitably there were still carpers, although no one could accuse Ponsonby of box-ticking: his programming, frequently inspired, was underpinned by wide experience and total integrity. Born in Oxford, he was the older son of Noel Ponsonby, organist of Christ Church, and his wife, Mary (nee White-Thomson). He studied at Eton and then served in the Scots Guards (1945-47). From 1948 until 1950 he was organ scholar at Trinity College, Oxford, and took a degree in English literature. While at Oxford he was president of the university opera club and was involved in its 1950 production of Berlioz’s Les Troyens, also taking the role of Masetto in its Don Giovanni under the baton of the youthful Davis. At the start of 1951 he joined the staff of Glyndebourne opera, learning the craft from Moran Caplat and Ian Hunter, former assistants of Rudolf Bing. He remained Hunter’s assistant until 1955, describing him as “the most successful impresario of his generation”, before taking Hunter’s place as director of the Edinburgh festival. His diplomatic skills were tested there on many occasions. He liked to tell the story of the conductor Otto Klemperer insisting on exchanging his hotel suite for a room in the spartan hostel where the orchestra were lodged in order to gain closer proximity to an attractive female player to whom he had taken a fancy. Ponsonby’s discreet solution, to which the maestro reluctantly agreed, was for Klemperer to sleep at his hotel but to be allowed to spend daylight hours at the hostel. On leaving Edinburgh, Ponsonby spent two less than rewarding years with the Independent Television Authority (1962-64), moving gratefully from there to the Scottish National Orchestra at the invitation of the musical director, Alexander Gibson. Ponsonby said he learned most of what he knew about the psychology of orchestral musicians and their relationship with conductors from the SNO, and recalled his eight years in Glasgow as the most satisfying of his career. On leaving the BBC, he became artistic director of the Canterbury festival (1987-88) and played an active role behind the scenes of British musical life as an adviser, programme consultant or trustee of numerous organisations. In his book Musical Heroes (2009) he wrote informatively and entertainingly about individuals in the musical world (mostly conductors, composers and performers) he admired. An extended interview with Pierre Boulez, derived from one of the six programmes Ponsonby made for the BBC’s World Service, is particularly valuable for his penetrating observations and technical insights of the French conductor. Ponsonby’s exceptional height of 6ft 6in, and a certain reserve, made him seem more remote than he was. The obituaries of leading musicians he wrote for this and other newspapers were well-informed and highly readable, while a keen sense of humour is evident in both Musical Heroes and a later collection that complements it, In and Out of Tune (2016). He was married twice: to Una Kenny in 1957 and to Lesley Black in 1977. Both marriages ended in divorce. • Robert Noel Ponsonby, arts administrator, born 19 December 1926; died 3 November 2019"

          "bodyText": "On Saturday, the people of Bougainville – a small archipelago of islands flung 700km off the coast of Papua New Guinea in the Solomon Sea – will begin voting in a referendum that will determine if their beloved homeland will become the world’s newest nation. It is a vote that has been nearly 20 years in the making. In 2001, as part of a peace agreement to end a devastating decade-long civil war, the government of Papua New Guinea promised the population of Bougainville, then about 200,000 people, that they would one day be able to cast a vote to decide their future. The results will be announced in December. It is expected to be overwhelmingly in favour of independence, with some observers anticipating a “yes” vote of more than 90%. But the road to this point has been long and tortured and the path ahead could be just as problematic, even if the result is as emphatic as predicted. Gold, copper and war At the heart of the story of Bougainvillean independence is a mine, which lies at the centre of the main island. Panguna mine, a huge open-cut gold and copper mine, provided 45% of Papua New Guinea’s export income in the years after it opened in 1972. As Papua New Guinea became independent of Australia in 1975, Bougainvilleans began to ask whether or not Bougainville would fare better on its own, rather than having its resources cut out and used to prop up a bigger nation. “[Panguna] led to many Bougainvilleans asking what was in it for them. Their resources were being exploited for the benefit of Papua New Guinea,” says Anthony Regan, who is a legal adviser to the Bougainvillean government, in a position funded by the Australian government. In 1988, tensions over the mine escalated, causing Papua New Guinean police and defence force officers to be deployed on the island. Fighting between the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) and PNG government forces developed into a full-blown civil war, which saw an estimated 20,000 people, out of a population at the time of 200,000, killed. “The fighting stopped in 1997, because leaders on all sides were recognising it was going nowhere,” says Regan. “Even the moderates in the Bougainville government could see they might be left with a Pyrrhic victory where Bougainville won, but Bougainville was left so divided that it would be no victory at all.” Over two years Bougainvillean leaders thrashed out a deal with the Papua New Guinean government, coming up with a Bougainville Peace Agreement. The thorny issue of independence was dealt with by both sides agreeing that an independence referendum must be held 10 to 15 years after the first Autonomous Bougainville Government was elected (by June 2020), but that the vote should be non-binding. The final say as to whether Bougainville will become an independent country rests with the PNG government. ‘A tremendous effort’ The effort required to conduct a vote like this in Bougainville, an autonomous region where 90% of people live in rural hamlets and villages, where roughy half of the population are illiterate, which has no radio or television network that covers the entire population, where just a few hundred copies of Papua New Guinean newspapers are brought from the mainland each day, and where the scars of a brutal war are still felt, is “tremendous”, says Mauricio Claudio, the chief referendum officer of the Bougainville Referendum Commission (BRC), which has been set up to administer the vote. “The primary challenge was the lack of time the BRC was given to implement this referendum,” says Claudio, an American, who was only appointed to the role and arrived in Bougainville at the beginning of the year. Funding for the BRC came in late, as did the appointment of a chair of the BRC, the former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. But Claudio also names issues with: “Communications, infrastructure, inclement weather, unreliable power and just the propensity for natural phenomena and catastrophe. It’s a tough environment.” Despite this, in less than a year, the BRC has conducted the most comprehensive electoral enrolment process in Papua New Guinea’s history, with an electoral roll that has 20% more names on it compared to the roll used in the 2015 ABG elections. At the close of the enrolment period 205,731 voters were registered to vote, with close to a 50-50 gender split. As part of the peace agreement, the ABG has conducted significant reconciliation work between groups who stood opposed during the conflict, as well as a large-scale gun collection program. Though the preparation has been frantic, the BRC believes it is ready for the vote. “Our assessment is the referendum will be a peaceful one and a credible one,” says Claudio. ‘We want to be free’ Over the course of the next two weeks, starting in the larger townships of Buka and Arawa, and then moving to more remote areas, voters will be able to attend one of 829 polling stations – 800 of which are in Bougainville, 25 in PNG provinces and four in remote mining locations – to cast their vote. Bougainvilleans living abroad have also been able to vote, with two polling stations in Australia and two in the Solomon Islands. They will be asked whether they wish to vote for greater autonomy from PNG or for independence from it, but there is little question about which way the vote will go. “People are not divided,” says Helen Hakena, a peace and women’s rights campaigner in Bougainville. “The majority of Bougainvilleans want to vote for independence, because we are saying we want to be free. There has been a long struggle for our people, starting in the 1960s, and we would like to put an end to our struggle for self-determination.” But with the Panguna mine closed since the conflict began and without other operational mines or developed industries, the question of how an independent Bougainville would support itself hangs over the vote. According to a report by Satish Chand, a professor of finance for the University of NSW, the ABG collected just K2.4m (US$705,000) from company taxes, customs duties and other taxes, compared to the K41.3m (US$12.1m) it received from the PNG government, meaning the ABG had “by 2016 reached just six percent of the distance to fiscal self-reliance”. Hakena reluctantly counts herself in the group who will not vote for independence because of fears an independent Bougainville would not be able to provide services to its people. “It does hurt my pride as a Bougainvillean woman,” she says. “I don’t think Bougainville is ready, even though I would like us to become free and to become an independent nation. “I will be voting for greater autonomy because I would like Bougainville to be financially secure so that we can have all the services that we are enjoying now, which is not 100%, but we are still fortunate that we have the schools, we’ve got the health people, the airport, communication, transport, everything. We don’t own anything at this time, everything we have is owned by Papua New Guinea. “Bougainville enjoyed financial security during the good times before the crisis, we were really very well off, unlike now, the crisis spoiled everything, so we are back to basics now.” The danger of disappointment The other question is what will happen after the vote, given the fact that it is non-binding. Volker Boege, a research fellow at the University of Queensland, has travelled to Bougainville regularly for years as part of a group conducting dialogues throughout Bougainville about the peace agreement and the referendum. He said in the early days of these dialogues, it was clear that people assumed: “We vote for independence, we have a party and the next day we are independent. They are now realising that this is not the case, it’s a non-binding referendum, the leadership of PNG and Bougainville will have to negotiate, the final say is with the PNG parliament.” The process could take years, Boege says, with some Bougainville observers estimating it could be a decade before an independent Bougainville is established. There are fears that the Papua New Guinean government, which does not wish to lose part of its nation, or set a precedent for other independence-minded provinces, might drag out the process. “Expectations are high, yes, there is the potential or the danger of the feeling of frustration or disappointment coming to the fore after the referendum,” Boege says. “Of course the big question mark is about the PNG side. How will the PNG side actually respond and behave and what kind of commitment will there be?” He says Bougainvilleans are “very happy” with the replacement in May of the longstanding PNG prime minister Peter O’Neill by James Marape, who is regarded as more open to an independent Bougainville. While international organisations say they are not anticipating violence in the region as a result of the referendum, Hakena’s experiences in the civil war – in which she lost many family members and gave birth to her child prematurely alongside women who died in labour due to lack of health care – make her fearful about what will come. Her organisation, the Leitana Nehan Women’s Development Agency, which started out of the conflict, providing counselling to those affected by its violence, has been telling the women in their network to prepare in case of violence, or in case Papua New Guinea blockades Bougainville, as it did during the conflict. “We’re saying, you have to grow your own food like you did in the crisis, we grew our own vegetables,” she says. “We are preparing our people, growing our own food, fishing, getting their own medicine, putting food in the house. That’s what we’re telling our women – be prepared because we don’t know if there will be problems.”"

          "headline": "Lake District under pressure to ban 4x4s from farm tracks",
          "bodyText": "Pressure is mounting on the Lake District national park to reconsider its decision to allow off-road cars and motorbikes on farm tracks that campaigners say is devastating the tranquillity of the area. England’s largest national park has received a highly critical letter from advisers to Unesco, which granted it world heritage status in 2017 after a 20-year campaign. The problem is particularly acute in Tilberthwaite valley and the valleys surrounding the villages of Little Langdale and Elterwater, and local people have been lobbying for a ban with the backing of the National Trust and a petition signed by more than 350,000 people. Despite this, in October the Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA) decided to continue allowing recreational off-road vehicles on dozens of farm tracks on this land – much of it once owned by Beatrix Potter and described by Alfred Wainwright as “the loveliest in Lakeland”. The authority has received a letter from the International Council on Monuments and Sites (Icomos), the body that advises Unesco on protecting world heritage sites. It says the impact of these vehicles “is not limited to the material aspects of the roads and their erosion but also on the character and tranquillity of the landscape”. “Icomos states that the traffic regulation orders (TROs), which have been available to national parks to remove the right to use motorised vehicles on certain ‘green’ roads since 2006, appear to be an appropriate tool to deal with the impact,” it adds. The letter then cites a report published by Icomos on the issue this year. In the report, Icomos found that an increase in the number of vehicles had damaged the “aesthetic and historic qualities” of the landscape. It criticised the national park authority for disregarding complaints and underplaying the damage being inflicted on the area. It alleged that undue weight had been given to the commercial benefits of allowing tourist trips in 4x4s to remote beauty spots. It also recommended that the park authority should “consider the banning of the use of 4x4 vehicles on green roads within the world heritage property”. Mechtild Rössler, the director of the Unesco World Heritage Centre, said the authority would not lose its world heritage status but Unesco was monitoring events closely. She added: “While the Unesco World Heritage Centre follows the situation at the Lake District world heritage site closely with the authorities concerned and our advisory bodies, the world heritage status is not at risk.” The letter was sent to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in September. However, the LDNPA did not receive the document until 8 October, the same day its rights of way committee took the decision to continue allowing recreational vehicles on its lanes. After the decision, the National Trust issued a strongly worded statement saying it could not support the park authority and urged it to review its decision. “We think that this activity is at odds with what people want from their national parks in the 21st century – to tackle climate change and champion sustainable transport … We fully understand that managing a national park is challenging but where conflict can’t be resolved by management, protecting the environment is more important.” The main complaints centre on two tracks near High Tilberthwaite farm, bequeathed to the National Trust by Potter. Campaigners estimate there has been an increase in the number of 4x4s in the area from 90 a month in 2008 to 400 a month in 2017. Two hill farmers, Glen and Dorothy Wilkinson, left Tilberthwaite farm in April last year because of the damage caused to an unsealed track that runs through the land, saying it had made it “impossible to carry on with our jobs”. During a meeting at its headquarters in Kendal, the LDNPA voted five to one to back an officers’ report that called instead for a new management plan. A spokesperson for the authority confirmed the Icomos letter had arrived after the public rights of way committee made its decision. However, the LDNPA stated the letter did not “raise anything new” and the heritage body’s report had been reviewed fully by the committee as part of its deliberations."

          "headline": "Paul McCartney confirmed as Glastonbury 2020 headliner",
          "bodyText": "Paul McCartney is the first artist to be confirmed as a Pyramid stage headliner at the Glastonbury festival in 2020. Organiser Emily Eavis described the booking as “an absolute dream come true. There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary”. McCartney, who will perform on the festival’s Saturday night, had teased the performance earlier in the day on Twitter, with juxtaposed images of composer Philip Glass, actor Emma Stone and rock’n’roller Chuck Berry: Glass-Stone-Berry, or Glastonbury. He said in another tweet that he was “excited to be part of your anniversary celebrations. See ya next summer!” He will turn 78 the week before his performance, making him the oldest Pyramid stage headliner ever – beating Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, who was 73 when the band played in 2013. Other Pyramid performers further down the bill have been older, though, like 85-year-old BB King in 2011, and Burt Bacharach, who was 87 when he played in 2015. He joins a group of artists to have headlined more than once: Arctic Monkeys, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Peter Gabriel, Van Morrison, Muse, Oasis, Pulp, Radiohead, REM and the Who. The Cure and Coldplay hold the record with four headline slots, but despite the latter band releasing a new album this week, Chris Martin told an Australian radio show earlier this month: “We won’t be playing at Glastonbury 50 – although I’ll probably be there because I love going.” McCartney had been one of the most strongly rumoured names to headline the landmark edition of the festival. In April, Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis said he hoped McCartney would play again, “hopefully for the 50th”. In September, McCartney said in a Radio 2 interview: “People are saying that it will be good if I did it, so I’m starting to think about whether I can or whether it would be a good thing … It’s starting to become some remote kind of possibility.” He is only the second artist to be confirmed for the festival, following the announcement of another septuagenarian, 75-year-old Diana Ross, as the Sunday teatime “legend” performance on the Pyramid. McCartney has headlined once before, in 2004, when he played a mammoth 33-song set spanning the Beatles, Wings and his solo material, including two encores. It featured a segment paying tribute to his Beatles bandmates, with Here Today – his 1982 song that poignantly addressed John Lennon in the wake of his death – segueing into George Harrison’s All Things Must Pass, and Yellow Submarine, originally sung by Ringo Starr. There was also an outing for In Spite of All the Danger, a song he recorded in 1958 with Harrison and Lennon in pre-Beatles band the Quarrymen. The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis said of that performance: “Paul McCartney looked surprisingly nervous. His between-song patter wobbled a tightrope between charming and excruciating. There was much talk of ley lines and ‘vibes’. He displayed a worrying tendency to adopt a cod-Jamaican accent. It scarcely mattered: his back catalogue is unimpeachable, his voice fantastic.” As the first headliner to be announced, McCartney is a rather more safe and crowd-pleasing choice than the one for this year’s festival, Stormzy: only the third rapper to headline the festival, and the first black British solo artist. His set was universally well-received, silencing some earlier grumbles that with only one album to his name, he didn’t have the catalogue to headline. No such problems for McCartney, who has long been touring perhaps the most beloved songbook in pop history. He last played the UK in December 2018, following the release of his 17th solo album, Egypt Station, where he worked with contemporary pop songwriters and producers like Ryan Tedder (Beyoncé, Taylor Swift) and Greg Kurstin (Adele, Lily Allen). In summer 2019, he toured stadiums across North America, performing with Ringo Starr at the final date at Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles. In September, he also published his second children’s book, Hey Grandude!, a picture book illustrated by Kathryn Durst about a grandfather taking his grandchildren on magical adventures. With McCartney confirmed for Glastonbury, some will be hoping for more of a curveball Pyramid booking for Friday or Sunday nights. Among the rumoured artists are heritage acts who have never appeared before, like Fleetwood Mac and Madonna, as well as younger, edgier performers like Kendrick Lamar, the 1975 and Foals. Fans of Taylor Swift have spotted a conspicuous gap in her summer touring schedule over Glastonbury weekend, while the Chemical Brothers, who headlined the Other stage this year and the Pyramid in 2000, sparked rumours in October after band member Ed Simons posted an image of the Pyramid stage under construction with the caption “Soundcheck”. In October, Liam Gallagher expressed a desire to play, but said: “I’m not arsed about headlining … A little small gig in a little sweaty tent will do me, man.” Many hoped Elton John would include Glastonbury in the itinerary of his final ever world tour, but it now looks unlikely. He recently announced five new US dates, including ones on the Friday and Saturday nights of the Glastonbury festival."

          "headline": "Spanish police find vast cannabis plantations hidden deep in forests",
          "bodyText": "Spanish police have arrested six people and seized 16,000 marijuana plants after an investigation into a spate of robberies led officers to two huge and sophisticated drug plantations hidden in remote pine forests. The operation began seven months ago when the national police force learned that an Albanian gang had been stealing cigarette vending machines from bars and petrol stations in the north-eastern region of Aragón. Officers discovered that the same gang was also growing marijuana on a massive scale and had set up camps to keep a constant eye on the crops. The plantations, deep in the pine forests near Agüero and Murillo de Gállego in Aragón, could be reached only after a 30-minute drive in a 4x4 vehicle and a further 30 minutes on foot along difficult paths. “The gang had cut down large areas of pine trees to maximise the amount of space for growing marijuana,” police said in a statement. “They had also adapted gullies to store water, which was then fed to the plantations using pumps, hoses and electrical generators.” Officers found the sites were guarded day and night. “To do so, the gang had established camps that had everything needed for lengthy stays, including a large supply of non-perishable goods and even a stone oven,” added the statement. “Their permanent vigils, together with a perfect knowledge of the forests in which they lived, made the investigation on the ground enormously difficult.” The plantations were raided in September. The force said the difficult terrain had meant that 70 officers had been needed to carry the plants to the nearest point reachable by 4x4s. “The operation has seen the complete dismantling of the six-person gang and the seizure of 16,000 plants weighing a total of 3.5 tonnes,” said the statement. “It is the biggest seizure to date of marijuana in Aragón.”"

          "headline": "Grounded: how Ed Sheeran brought pop back down to earth",
          "bodyText": "Of all the controversies generated by rock and pop music over the last decade, the weirdest may be those by artists who aren’t weird or controversial at all. Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi, Adele, George Ezra, Jess Glynne have all sold a phenomenal number of records and earned an equal amount of opprobrium. The collective terms for them are usually pejorative: the new boring, the ordinary boys, a beige pop wasteland. They’re held up as evidence that pop music is having a potentially fatal existential crisis: when did pop cease to suggest a life more glamorous or exciting than your own? When did it cease to be aspirational, strange and intriguing? Never mind David Bowie pointing down the lens at Top of the Pops – how did we go from Lady Gaga wearing the contents of a butcher’s counter to the 2010 MTV awards to nondescript artists who are only distinguished from their audience because they’re the ones on stage? When did pop become so boring? It’s easy to overestimate the dominance of normality in modern pop, particularly if you’re a music hack writing a piece that suggests it has been in irreversible decline since your teens. If you want pop music that looks spectacular, glamorous and aspirational, or suggests an intriguing world outside the experience of its audience, or that terrifies parents, there’s plenty of it. Drugged-out face-tattooed rappers; DayGlo K-pop bands; Lana Del Rey’s LA femme-fatale shtick; Billie Eilish’s gothic sci-fi imagery; the Afro-futuristic fantasias of Janelle Monáe and FKA twigs. Equally, you would struggle to describe it as anything other than a phenomenon. Between them, Sheeran and Adele have sold almost 300m records in the last decade; Glynne has had seven No 1 singles in the last five years; Capaldi is the biggest British artist of 2019, author of both the year’s bestselling single and its bestselling album. This sound’s appeal shows no signs of waning. You might have thought the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours reached critical mass a few years ago, when the charts were packed with Sheeran-alikes and Mike Posner had a hit with I Took a Pill in Ibiza – a folky ballad that seemed like an Onion parody of self-obsessed millennial angst, Posner whining about, of all things, being given free drugs in a nightclub. But the success of Capaldi’s Divinely Inspired to a Hellish Extent (and George Ezra’s triple-platinum Staying at Tamara’s, the biggest-selling album of 2018) shows you couldn’t have been more wrong. The question of whether it’s a new phenomenon is interesting. Just as people have a tendency to overplay the recent dominance of “ordinary” pop, so they have a tendency to overstate how spectacular pop was in the past. Watch any old episode of Top of the Pops, even from the two eras proclaimed as the show’s golden ages of eye-popping sensation – the glam-dominated early 70s and the post-punk new romantic explosion of the early 80s – and in between the glitter and platform boots, or the rouged-up, sexually ambiguous synth-prodders, you’ll see umpteen artists who look utterly normal and playing incredibly prosaic music. The difference may be that those artists were generally a reaction against the pop mainstream: MOR acts catering to an older audience unlikely to be taken with T Rex or Suzi Quatro; “serious” rock bands distinguishing themselves from the supposedly shallow image-consciousness of whoever was on the cover of Smash Hits that week. Now, they are the pop mainstream, or at least an important and influential part of it. The roots of the current wave of ordinary pop date to the early 2000s, when most of the artists – and a vast tranche of their audience – were children. A succession of talent shows appeared and quickly dominated the TV schedules: Popstars and Pop Idol launched in 2001, the BBC’s forgotten rival Fame Academy in 2002, The X Factor in 2004. Their stars largely had very brief careers – Hear’Say, Leon Jackson, Michelle McManus – but one idea the shows propagated proved far more enduring. Their format was dependent on the notion that pop stars weren’t remote, otherworldly figures, but rather everyday people. You didn’t need such things as alluring charisma, originality, a striking image, feral sexual magnetism, or a willingness to shock to be a pop star. Indeed, those were drawbacks that would get you classified as “weird” – a term the judges used as if it was abusive – and booted out early on. All you needed was a decent voice, a backstory that connected with the public – to make you relatable – and the right break. While that represents a hopelessly reductive view of what a pop star is, it’s nevertheless extremely pervasive. At the same time, Coldplay – a band then devoid of any identifiable image, whose live show culminated with the dizzying spectacle of Chris Martin turning off an illuminated globe that sat on the lid of his piano – commercially leapfrogged their post-Britpop peers and the image-heavy wave of new indie bands, and became arguably the biggest rock band in the world. Critics occasionally pit them against the TV talent show winners, “authentic” rock artists v the puppets of manufactured pop: in 2002, Coldplay’s In My Place battled Colourblind by Pop Idol runner-up Darius Danesh for No 1, a state of affairs excitedly reported on by Radio 1. In truth, they had more in common than the adversarial narrative suggested. The success of the TV talent-show winners was predicated on their fans knowing they were normal. Whether by default or design, Coldplay wore their “authenticity” on their sleeve. You could tell by looking at them they weren’t a record company confection, honed by stylists and media trainers, nor were they a style-over-substance NME hype band. The message was essentially the same: here was ordinariness, not as a sniffy reaction to pop’s excesses but as a saleable commodity in itself. This was underlined a few years later when Adele commercially outstripped Amy Winehouse. Initially, this seemed unlikely. Adele’s output was too obviously created in Winehouse’s shadow: big-voiced, London-accented retro-soul styling; Mark Ronson production credit; even a Scouse indie cover in the repertoire, the Coral’s Dreaming of You standing in for the Zutons’ Valerie. As it turned out, predictability was among Adele’s greatest assets. She flourished in the void created when it became apparent that Winehouse was incapable of meeting public demand for more of the same by following up the 16m-selling Back to Black. Adele was a talented artist offering something similar to Winehouse, but one less likely to blow out gigs, or to punch someone in the front row, or to be photographed staggering wild-eyed around London. She cut a more relatable figure: a bright, gobby, unstyled north London girl, her brand of heartbreak dealt in moist-eyed stoicism and passive aggression rather than howling disconsolately on the bathroom floor and revealing you could only climax if you thought of your ex. Journalist Peter Robinson suggested that the eureka moment of what he called “the new boring” came when Adele performed Someone Like You at the 2011 Brit awards, an event otherwise packed with explosive spectacle. “Wow,” host James Corden nodded approvingly at its conclusion, “you can have all the dancers, pyrotechnics, laser shows you want, but if you sound like that all you need is a piano.” As if to prove Corden’s point, Adele’s 21 became the biggest-selling album of the 21st century. Six months later, Sheeran broke through, touting an even more austere version of Coldplay’s dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal. He released his major-label debut to widespread critical opprobrium, yet became not just one of the most successful artists of the decade but one of the most influential, writing for everyone from Justin Bieber to One Direction to Eminem, and spawning endless imitators. The most prosaic reason for Adele and Sheeran’s success is that their songs connected with people: even Sheeran’s most implacable critic would have a hard time arguing that Thinking Out Loud doesn’t sound like the kind of song that’s going to soundtrack first dances for the rest of eternity. But the time was also right for artists like them. An audience who’d grown up on TV talent shows and Coldplay, with their intrinsic messages about normality and authenticity, had reached maturity. Social media had brought a new set of ideas about pop artists’ proximity to their fans. It was no longer held to be a good thing to be remote or aloof or mysterious; what people apparently wanted was availability and dialogue. Moreover, it didn’t do to be too outrageous or excessive because someone would record you and post the footage online, where it would live for ever. Social media also supplied a new set of stars: influencers, YouTubers, vloggers. Their appeal is invariably baffling to anyone over the age of 25, but the general takeaway is that kids want to watch people who look a bit like nice older siblings doing everyday things, being a little wacky and sharing makeup tips. Their appeal is not dissimilar, then, to that of Sheeran, who – 150m record sales, an estimated £170m fortune and an MBE later – still gives off the air of a mate’s brother just back from a gap year with tales of how sick Goa is. Or, indeed, of Jess Glynne, who’s more glamorous – no record label has yet allowed a female pop artist to take the stage in quite such a dressed-down state as Sheeran or Lewis Capaldi – but still gives off a resolutely ordinary air. At 23, Capaldi is too young to remember a world before social media, and seems like a hybrid of pop artist and social media star: nearly as famous for his extremely funny videos as he is for his music. Whenever the why-oh-why-ing starts about these artists’ success, it’s usually accompanied by a side-order of hand-wringing about the decline of youth rebellion, citing figures about the rise in youth teetotalism, drawing attention to the disappearance of visually-arresting subcultural youth tribes. A cartoon emerges of parents who grew up in the hedonistic 80s and 90s raising a generation of prissily self-obsessed conformists, interested only in seeing their own lives reflected back at them. Another way of looking at it would be to note that the last decade has been one of uncertainty and disorder: financial chaos, austerity, political upheaval, division. The future looks less certain still. Perhaps what people want from pop culture isn’t the thrill of the unknown but reassurance and stability. It’s telling that 25, Adele’s multimillion-selling followup to 21, offered more of the same – raking over the relationship that had inspired its predecessor, her collaborators having rejected an album full of songs about her life as a new mother. If Ed Sheeran, Lewis Capaldi et al seem like aspirational figures – they’re just like me – they also offer affirmation. Sheeran’s last album, No 6 Collaborations Project, is filled with songs depicting the now rich and famous singer globetrotting, attending swish parties and hanging around with “the beautiful people” while informing his listeners that he feels out of place and would rather be back at home with his partner. Its overall message appears to be: I was happier when I was more like you; be thankful for what you’ve got and careful what you wish for. If its audience wants reassurance about the future, at least the future of this particular subgenre of pop seems secure. There are more artists waiting in the wings: among the major labels’ priorities for 2020 lurks JC Stewart, a dressed-down acoustic guitar-toting Irish singer-songwriter who co-wrote Capaldi’s song Hollywood. If the music industry seems loth to let female pop stars be as visually unremarkable as their male counterparts, then outside of it – in the bedroom pop that’s huge with teens and tweens, its hits propagated not by radio play, but by viral videos and TikTok crazes – lurk female artists who aren’t bound by their rules: just watch Beach Bunny’s Prom Queen, a massive social media hit in 2019 thanks to TikTok. At least one area of pop appears to be intent on going back to normal, over and over again."

          "headline": "Killer drones: how many are there and who do they target?",
          "bodyText": "What is a drone? Drones – remotely piloted craft – first appeared in the 1990s when they were used for military surveillance by the US. Familiar advances in miniaturisation and cost mean they are now used for all kinds of purposes – for recreation, filming, monitoring conservation or to deliver vital medicines in remote areas. Military technology has also advanced, albeit more slowly, and the principal drones used now are evolutions of the technology first deployed to spot hidden Serbian positions during the 1999 Kosovo war. Weapons on drones were first deployed almost immediately after 9/11, their usage since has been bound up with the so-called “war on terror”. How many military drones are out there? The vast majority of the many thousands of military drones are used for surveillance, and defence experts predict that will continue. Analysts at information group Jane’s estimate that more than 80,000 surveillance drones and almost 2,000 attack drones will be purchased around the world in the next 10 years. Weaponised drones are not cheap: experts say the starting price for the technology is about $15m (£12m) per unit, with more for add-ons, on top of the training and the crews needed to pilot them. It is a world in which the UK is a relatively small but still influential power. The RAF operates nine missile-bearing Reaper drones, one of which is in repair; it plans to buy 16 next-generation Protector drones by 2023 at an initial cost of £415m. In 2019 alone, Jane’s experts expect the world’s 10 biggest drone powers to spend some $8bn on units. “The wide variety in types of UAV [unmanned aerial vehicles] makes them suitable for both surveillance and combat missions, with low-cost models able to conduct surveillance operations, opening up the capability for militaries with a smaller budget,” says Greg Murray, a senior analyst at Jane’s. Which countries are the main users of drones? The first phase of drone warfare was dominated by three countries: the US, the UK and Israel. The US and UK rely on Predator and latterly Reaper drones made by General Atomics, a Californian company owned by billionaire brothers Neal and Linden Blue. Israel develops its own technology. Drones rapidly proliferated in a second wave over the past five years, with Pakistan and Turkey developing their own programmes. Since 2016, Turkey has used drones heavily, against the separatist Kurdish PKK in its own country, in northern Iraq and more recently against Kurdish groups in Syria. China, meanwhile, has begun supplying a range of countries with its Wing Loong and CH series drones, including to the UAE – where they have been used in a string of deadly strikes in Libya – as well as Egypt Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, although not every country has been able to deploy what it has bought. Iran was blamed for an attack on Saudi oil installations in September believed to have involved drones as well as missiles. Proliferation is expected to continue, not least because Russia and India are running behind. When did drones turn into weapons? Weaponisation came almost immediately after 9/11. Predator drones had already observed Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader, from the skies. But the first strike, in October 2001, missed its intended target, Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Some of his bodyguards were killed in a vehicle outside the leader’s compound instead. But this failure did not deter the US. Predator and Reaper drones have since been deployed by the US in Afghanistan and the northern, tribal areas of Pakistan in various iterations of the “war on terror”, as well as in Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. British statistics give some idea of the frequency of contemporary drone strikes (the US does not release equivalent data). In four years of war against Isis in Iraq and Syria from 2014-2018, Reaper drones were deployed on more than 2,400 missions – almost two a day. Drones account for 42% all UK aerial missions against Isis, and 23% of weapon strikes, according to statistics collected by UK website Drone Wars via freedom of information requests. Who pilots them? RAF Reaper drones are piloted from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire and by UK personnel from Creech air force base in Nevada, where crews operate in three-hour shifts, although the drones themselves are based in the Middle East, almost certainly at an air base in Kuwait. Pilots on rotation control devices that are able to loiter in a conflict zone for about 16 to 20 hours – and able in theory to hit a target the size of a household pane of glass. Justin Bronk, from military thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, says “drones are five to six times more efficient than conventional air missions”. But Professor Peter Lee, a drones expert at Portsmouth University, says “drones are a lot more analogue than people think. Reapers still need human piloting to take off and land”. Is drone use legal? Ethical? Drone usage consistently tests legal norms. They have been deployed by Washington in countries with which the US is not technically at war, using the broad justification that such strikes are part of a “war on terror”. That relies on a controversial law passed a week after 9/11. Critics say the Authorisation for Use of Military Force permits “perpetual war” but despite Democrat opposition, a Republican majority in the US senate help prevent its repeal. For the US, such drone strikes have become commonplace. The practice began under George W Bush, was expanded under Barack Obama and appears to have increased further still under Donald Trump, although in March he made analysis harder by signing an executive order banning reporting of drone casualty details. In Obama’s first two years in office, 2009 and 2010, 186 drone strikes were launched in Pakistan, Syria and Yemen, according figures supplied to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. In Trump’s first year and 11 months in office 238 drone strikes were launched. How accurate are the strikes? The reality is that civilians have been hit in strike after strike as targets are misidentified. Precise figures, however, are hard to establish as much of the information is classified. In a rare piece of disclosure, the US said 473 air strikes (from both drones and planes, the figures are not separated out) had been made against targets outside Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria between January 2009 and December 2015. It acknowledged there had been as many as 116 civilian deaths as a result of those strikes, 4% of the reported casualties. But Jennifer Gibson at human rights group Reprieve says the organisation has tracked a high rate of errors. Research conducted by Reprieve in 2014 “found that in attempts to kill 41 individuals, the US killed as many as 1,147 other people and that on average the high value targets died three times”. Some disclosures stretch credibility to the limit. The UK says only one civilian was killed or injured from British drone and air raids in Syria and Iraq, between September 2014 and January 2019. In the those same raids, Britain said 4,315 fighters were killed. Press reports tell a different story. Over the past 12 months, a US drone strike was believed to have killed 30 farm workers in Afghanistan; up to 11 civilians were killed in a US drone strike in the south of Libya. What were the most egregious uses of drones? The US operates a policy of signature or pattern targeting, in which strikes are launched at places where targets are believed to gather, although this can easily lead to mistakes. Leaked documents revealed that a secret US programme, Skynet, had used “metadata” to identify suspicious individuals in Pakistan: top of its list was in fact a journalist – al-Jazeera’s Pakistani bureau chief, Ahmad Zaidan. It has also used “double tap” targeting, where a site is hit twice or even three times to target first responders considered connected with those already attacked. That idea appears to be spreading: the UAE is accused of operating a double tap strike in Libya this August, which killed 45 people including guests from a nearby wedding who had come over to help. Politicians, militaries and intelligence agencies in drone-using countries have drawn up “kill lists” on which named individuals are intended to be, in effect, assassinated by drone or in other air strikes, a policy only occasionally publicly acknowledged. Reyaad Khan, a British Isis fighter from Cardiff, was killed in Syria aged 21, in an RAF drone strike. The UK was not at war in Syria at the time, but then-prime minister David Cameron asserted he had the power to make the decision to target him. “I am not going to contract out our counterterrorism policy to someone else,” he said. How will drones change war? Drones have already changed warfare, providing a more efficient – from the military’s point of view – alternative to conventional aerial missions. But analysts worry that they make it easier for countries to embark on wars and undeclared “shadow wars”, and put non-combatants at greater risk. “Simply put, they transfer risk from combatants to civilians,” says Chris Cole, director of Drone Wars. The long term question is whether humans will be removed from the loop – the science fiction nightmare where AI-powered drones will select and lock on to targets with no human oversight. There is no shortage of speculation about the topic and concern about the idea, but as yet little evidence of the use of drones, particularly lethal drones, being governed solely by computer. Nevertheless, the medium-term risk remains, and there is a campaign – Stop Killer Robots – hoping to halt their development with a global treaty, that is opposed by the US, Russia and China. Experts now hope to introduce rules for autonomous warfare, but as with drone technology itself, there is no serious attempt to halt development – or proliferation. • Browse the full range of in-depth Guardian briefings."

          "bodyText": "At 6.30am five-year-old Osman Balama and his mother reach the state hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, the second-largest city in Burkina Faso. He hasn’t been feeling well for a few days and his mother is worried that he has contracted malaria. The waiting room is already full of mothers and grandmothers with young children on their laps, all with the same tired look as Osman. “The rainy season has started,” says Sami Palm, head of the clinic. “That means more mosquitos. I’m certain that almost everyone here has malaria.” Two red lines on the detection strip confirm malaria. “He doesn’t need to stay in the hospital, because he isn’t vomiting and isn’t extremely sick,” Palm says. Osman is sent home with medication – the Burkinese government covers treatments for children aged five and under. Each year around 400,000 people worldwide die from malaria, half of them in seven countries in Africa, including Burkina Faso. Despite progress in reducing deaths since 2000, cases have been gradually increasing. “We’re having more and more problems with resistance – from the parasite, which knows how to counteract the medicines, and from the mosquitoes, which are getting less sensitive to the insect poisons applied to the mosquito nets,” says Palm. “On top of this, there are many remote areas we can’t reach.” A radical trial using “gene drive” technology is currently taking place in Burkina Faso, that will see the release of genetically modified mosquitoes in an attempt to wipe out the carriers of the disease. “We’re developing mosquitoes here that can only have sons. Those sons will also only be able to produce sons, causing the population of females, the only gender that bites, to dwindle until the mosquito is extinct,” says Moussa Namountougou, head of the insect farm of the Institut de Recherche et Sciences de la Santé (IRSS), just a few kilometres from the hospital. “To do this we have added a bit of genetic information from a slime mould to the mosquito DNA. That extra bit contains the instructions to break down any sperm cells that could produce a daughter mosquito.” Namountougou and his team have at their disposal a gene drive, which they want to use to stop the genetic instruction diluting as modified mosquitoes mate with those that don’t have the new genetic information. This uses a sort of genetic copier so breed offspring with the new trait – with the intention of wiping out female malaria-carrying mosquitoes. “This way the trait spreads rapidly through the entire population, over just a few years,” says Namountougou. “Such a gene drive has never been released into the wild.” The village of Bana, near Bobo-Dioulasso, is where GM mosquitoes using this technology will eventually be released. The government gave the go-ahead in June. Bana is like many others: mud huts around a central square, no sewage system or electricity, the ground strewn with drying shea nuts, whose harvest has just begun. “We have two major problems here: water pollution and malaria,” says village elder Tchessira Sanou. “I used to go into the forest to gather sticks and leaves from specific trees and shrubs to treat the symptoms. Now we receive mosquito nets from the government and we have medicine, but the disease persists.” Even if no one dies, the disease has a huge impact. “If you or your child get sick, then you can’t work in the fields for several days. That can cost you your entire harvest, leaving you with too little to eat.” For seven years, Target Malaria, the organisation behind the project – has been sending teams of theatre performers to Bana to explain what scientists are doing in their village. “It’s very important to us that everyone in the village understands what’s going on here,” says Lea Pare, of Target Malaria. “Not everyone in the village can read or write, so this helps everyone understand. We need that, or they won’t support the project.” More than 100 local people have toured the insect farm in Bobo-Dioulasso, where scientists explained mosquitoes’ life cycle, and answered questions. Genetic modification is controversial, and gene drive technology takes it a step further. Introducing “ordinary” GM produce to agriculture has led to widespread resistance. Several countries have also outlawed the technology. And there are substantial objections in Burkina Faso. “It makes us puppets of the west,” says Ali Tapsoba, director of Terre à Vie, a community organisation in the capital Ouagadougou. “We believe genetic modification is never a solution. There is always a risk that the mosquitoes will mutate and we will lose track of them. People in our country must learn to live more hygienically, then the malaria mosquito will disappear in a safer way.” There are doubts too in the academic world. Recently, entomologist Willem Takken from Wagening asked in the Volkskrant newspaper whether another type of mosquito wouldn’t simply take the place of the exterminated insect. Namantougou already knows the work he’s doing is not nearly enough. “In Burkina Faso there are four mosquitoes that can carry malaria, and we need to tackle each.” The genetic instruction taken from slime moulds only works in this one type of malaria mosquito, and not in others. “Those will continue to have daughters,” he says. Bart Knols, mosquito expert at the Radbouduniversiteit in Nijmegen, says bed nets are far more cost effective. “The development of gene-drive mosquitoes is expensive, while a mosquito net costs next to nothing. I think that it’s more effective to invest more money in distributing those.” Last year, a group of around 160 social and environmental organisations called for a for a moratorium on the experimental use of the gene drive at a UN meeting. It failed by a narrow margin, and many African countries voted against it. “Opponents of the gene drive should be required to come live here in Burkina Faso for a while and see what malaria brings,” Pare says. “Then they can see for themselves how much we need a solution here.” As evening falls in Bana, men with mosquito nets arrive and begin swishing them through the air. “These are test mosquitoes, without the gene drive,” says Namountougou. “They have a modification that makes them sterile: no eggs are formed after mating.” These mosquitoes serve a primarily scientific purpose. “We want to know, for example, how far the mosquitoes travel. We also train people to catch and analyse the mosquitoes.” One of the catchers shines a flashlight on his net, and at least 10 mosquitoes fly about. The men carefully place their filled nets in a freezer. The following day the mosquitoes will be removed one by one and transported to the lab, where Namountougou will inspect whether they are modified or not. He has great optimism for future possibilities: “The malaria mosquito isn’t the only mosquito causing misery. With a gene drive we can also make dengue, Zika, and chikungunya disappear.” • A longer version of this story appeared in De Volkskrant"

          "bodyText": "On a blustery hillside above Achray farm in Brig o’Turk, a goat nibbles at the incongruous paraphernalia of microwave discs and masts that will finally deliver superfast broadband to the village. After three years leading a campaign to install this link site, which was switched on last week, Crispin Hoult was understandably evangelical. “Broadband is the first step to rebuilding the community. And on a personal level, I can finally watch Netflix.” The significance of this leap into the 21st century – a result of Stirling council’s rural connectivity drive and some local fundraising - cannot be overestimated. That sort of impact was clearly a factor in Labour’s ambitious manifesto pledge to offer universal free broadband by 2030. Over the years Brig o’Turk has lost successively its petrol station, post office, cafe and school, and young families in particular have moved away to larger settlements, tempted by more affordable housing and decent internet access for children’s studies. It is a 14-mile round trip to buy a pint of milk, and the only cash service is in the kitchen of a resident who hosts post office facilities a couple mornings a week. “There’s a danger of this becoming a place for middle-class retirees,” said Hoult. The advent of broadband has ushered in fresh optimism. There is a plan to buy the school building and repurpose it as a tea room and shop. Another idea is to buy an electric vehicle for the village to share in the same way as a city car club. Hoult said rural public transport was “appalling”. But for Tim Tindle, the chair of the Trossachs Community Trust, which put together the tea room plan, the optimism does not extend to the election or even Labour’s broadband offer, which he believes would still leave remote areas at the back of the queue. “Politicians are talking about the things that matter to politicians,” said Tindle. “Social enterprises, local jobs, affordable housing – that’s what matters to us.” When viewed on a map, Brig o’Turk is the belly button of the sprawling Stirling constituency, which has 93,750 residents, receives 4.5 million tourists a year and covers an area the size of Luxembourg. It spans from the Campsie Fells in the south to the farming communities around Killin to the north, taking in historic Bannockburn, the university city of Stirling, as well as affluent commuter towns such as Dunblane, struggling former mining villages to the east and the Loch Lomond and Trossachs national park, the location of some of Scotland’s most glorious scenery. Stirling is a key marginal, pitting the Conservative incumbent, Stephen Kerr, who has revealed himself to be a solid Brexiter since his election in 2017, against Alyn Smith, a leading SNP MEP and standard bearer for an independent Scotland’s re-entry into the EU. Previously a safe Labour seat since 1997, Stirling swung to the nationalists in the 2015 SNP landslide and then to Kerr in 2017 with a majority of just 148. Come December, the vote here will inevitably be regarded as a test of how voters are prioritising support for Brexit and the union or independence and the EU. Travelling around the constituency, certain themes emerge. There’s palpable frustration among constituents at the idea that their votes will be interpreted through a constitution-or-Brexit prism, when many are as immediately concerned with the climate crisis and how crumbling rural infrastructure can work against sustainable living. There is a lively seam of pro-independence activism, almost universal disdain for recent antics at Westminster, but also hearty approval for “getting Brexit done”. It is perhaps a legacy of the 2014 independence referendum that even those who declare themselves disgusted by politics are remarkably well-informed about it. Standing behind the bar at the Byre Inn, just down the road from Hoult’s smallholding, Sharon Vint laughed as she said: “I like to know what I’m complaining about!” Vint, who manages the pub with her partner, Jason, said she did not believe the election would happen on 12 December. “There’s been so much with Brexit – it’s happening now, then it’s delayed – I’m 100% convinced that something’s going to go wrong with this election.” Vint backed independence (although “I just don’t believe that now’s the time when there’s so much else to focus on”) and Brexit (“you can’t avoid the fact that we spoke and the government did their own thing”). The local council area voted by 60% to remain in the UK in 2014 and 67% to remain in the EU in 2016. Vint has voted for the Liberal Democrats, Labour and SNP at various points and now has as little time for Nicola Sturgeon as for Boris Johnson. “Nobody is really addressing the things that concern us. We’re a family of six, living together and working, and we’re not doing well,” she said. Many residents highlighted the huge disparities in wealth across Stirlingshire. The Start Up Stirling food bank said the more remote areas of the constituency have seen the steepest growth in crisis food deliveries over the past year. In the pretty conservation village of Ashfield, north of Dunblane, the relevance of the Westminster election campaign was interrogated over homemade soup and scones as Transition Stirling, an environmental charity, held a repair cafe in the village hall. “People are more and more willing to speak about the environment,” said Chris Steedman as he wrestled with a recalcitrant desk lamp, “but this election is all about Brexit. It’s about rhetoric, not issues.” At Babes in the Wood, a children’s clothing shop in Stirling with the dual purpose of reducing waste and poverty, director Linda Barrack said referrals had increased “massively” since the rollout of universal credit across the area. “We see people who are living with the effects of political decisions in Westminster every day,” she said. “Some people come with environmental concerns, because they don’t want to waste plastic toys, and others are not able to provide what they want to for their children, even though both parents are working.” Emily St Denny was on the lookout for second-hand bath toys for her eight-month-old daughter. One of a significant minority of EU students and staff around the university, French-born St Denny said she had lived in Stirling for 15 years. Although she cannot vote in this election, she is a former co-chair of the local Scottish Greens and considers electoral behaviour in depth through her job as lecturer in politics. St Denny said constituents were only beginning to recognise how marginal the seat had become. “The constitutional question has a distorting effect, so that people who might be more aligned with the Conservatives, for example, might decide to vote SNP,” she said. “Research shows that the first independence referendum and all those subsequent votes did improve people’s political literacy, but there are also concerns about how divided the country is. There’s also the effect of Brexit after a decade of austerity. A new normal is emerging of food banks, stretched services and communities under pressure.” The SNP hopes that sort of sentiment will benefit it come election day. Emily Bryce, 68, a pro-independence activist who has been canvassing for the party, said the most visible faces of the Conservative party only worked in her favour on the campaign trail. “I’ve met a lot of elderly ladies who are frankly horrified at the behaviour of the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson,” she said. “These women are watching on in disbelief and are losing faith in politicians.” Bryce, a retired administrator, had spent an afternoon helping out at the inaugural meeting of Stirling &amp; Clacks Pensioners 4 Indy. “People assume that my generation is anti-independence, and it’s certainly the case that during the 2014 campaign there were a lot of scare tactics used, especially when it came to pensions. But we believe that independence is normal. It’s a reasonable expectation to want self-determination.”"

          "bodyText": "There’s a feeling of complete independence that comes with carrying everything you need. At the end of a solid walk it’s incredibly satisfying – even if your evening meal consists of two-minute noodles and a cup of tea. On the other hand, there’s also something to be said for arriving in camp to find that your extremely roomy tent has already been pitched, and a table is ready with local oysters, a cheese platter and a glass of verdelho. I decided you don’t need to be too fundamentalist about these things after walking the 31km Light to Light track in Ben Boyd national park, on the far south coast of New South Wales, with Light 2 Light Coastal Walks. The walk is exceptionally beautiful but logistically complex. With no public transport nearby, you need at least two cars to complete the three-day hike independently. Perhaps because of this, several guided walking tours operate along the Light to Light track, including Light to Light Camps, which offers a challenging two-day version of the hike, and Life’s an Adventure, which does “pack-free” walks that bus you back to hotel accommodation after a day of trekking. Light 2 Light’s three-day walk is only moderately challenging for a reasonably fit person, allowing scope to enjoy a constantly changing kaleidoscope of wild sea cliffs, old-growth forest and coastal heath, and to think about what European settlement meant for the land and the people. Benjamin Boyd was pretty typical of the early colonists whose names remain attached to so many Australian landmarks. In less than 10 years in the 1840s he acquired vast pastoral holdings, pioneered grandiose schemes that ended in fraud and bankruptcy, pursued his commercial interests by moving into politics, devastated wildlife by helping to establish whaling on an industrial scale, and was investigated for bringing forced labour to the colony from Pacific islands. Traditional owners have discussed moves to rename the national park, but for now the northern end of the walk is still marked by Boyd Tower, conceived as a lighthouse but used only to spot whales for the fleets that operated out of Twofold Bay for decades after Boyd’s departure in disgrace. From here the walk winds gently south, alternating between forest and the shoreline, marked by the extraordinary ancient red rocks that characterise the entire walk. They form dazzling contrasts with the aquamarine sea and the green of the woodland. The walk ends at the Green Cape lighthouse, where the whales round the northern point of Disaster Bay, and where so many ships failed to. Our guide, Cam, and his partner, Tess, are between them a deep well of knowledge on the abundant wildlife, flora and the remnants of colonial buildings and shipwrecks. Discussions are also under way with the local Thaua people to incorporate more comprehensive information for visitors on Indigenous history and culture. For those who simply love to walk, the greatest appeal of this hike is the ever-changing variety of environments the track passes through, such as a lovely enclosed woodland at the start of day three, which suddenly gives way to coastal heath, leading down to dramatic cliff views. This may not remain exactly the same for much longer, as plans are afoot to realign some sections of the track (largely to bring it closer to the sea) and to install huts for walkers as part of a $7.9m development to improve facilities and attract more visitors. Take it alone, and the walk offers a magnificently remote experience, with a side of two minute noodles. Go on a guided tour, and you can walk unencumbered, finishing the day with outstanding food, all cooked using local produce. Flora and fauna you’ll meet: It’s hard not to bump into wildlife along the track. Whale-watching is one of the huge attractions of the park. Boat trips leave from Eden for close encounters, but even from the cliffs we regularly caught sight of humpbacks and southern rights heading south for the summer. Eastern grey kangaroos crossed our path and hung around the campground, while swamp and redneck wallabies patrolled the beach in the early morning, and at least one echidna wandered on to the track. White-bellied sea eagles soared over the cliffs, lyrebirds showed off in the forest and pied oystercatchers watched over their chicks at Saltwater beach, where the breeding ground for hooded plovers is also protected. The vulnerable eastern ground parrot is more likely to be heard than seen. Native wildflowers are abundant in the coastal heath sections of the track. The logistics: Unless you’re travelling with multiple vehicles, the best way to complete the walk independently is to arrange a pick-up by a local tour group. Light to Light Camps offer transport from one end of the walk back to your car, for $200, and Light 2 Light also offers transfer services. Bittangabee and Saltwater camping grounds are the only two midpoints on the track accessible by car. If you carry your own tent and food, the whole 31km length can be walked in two or three days, camping at Saltwater Creek and Bittangabee – which have carparks, barbecues and toilets – or two other designated free camping sites with no facilities. With Light 2 Light you can choose a self-guided walk (you walk alone, they set up the campsite and cook) or a fully guided walk over three days, camping at Saltwater Creek or staying at Green Cape lighthouse. Where to sleep: Of the two campsites along the track, the smaller Saltwater Creek, roughly at the midpoint, has the more attractive setting, between two creeks and behind a glorious surf beach (though swimming is hazardous). Bookings are required for this or Bittangabee (nearer the south end) through National Parks and Wildlife if you are not on a guided tour, with costs starting at $24 a night. Green Cape Lighthouse, offering three beautifully restored cottages and one smaller cabin, is the only non-camping option on the track; prices start at $120 a night. When to go: Spring and autumn are ideal both for weather and whale-watching, especially September-November, when the whales are heading south. Overnight temperatures can get down well into single figures even at these times, so pack for warmth if you are camping. • Guardian Australia was a guest of Destination NSW. Three-day guided hikes with Light 2 Light tours start at $895 a person, including transfers from and to Merimbula airport. Ben Boyd national park is roughly six hours’ drive from Melbourne, and seven hours’ drive from Sydney.

          "bodyText": "Aboriginal people were forced to collect wood for their own pyres in at least four cases of mass killing in Western Australia, a practice that was still happening as late as 1926, new research reveals. The Killing Times – a collaboration between Guardian Australia and the University of Newcastle’s colonial frontier massacre research team – has found that some of the most violent episodes in our colonial past took place well into the 1920s, in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Government forces, including soldiers, police, magistrates and native police, were involved in more than half of all massacres recorded between the 1820s and the 1930s. The Killing Times map has been updated today with 57 new sites. With this broader national picture we can reveal: About 97% of people killed in these massacres were Aboriginal men, women and children Massacres became more violent, systematic and calculated over time The average number of Indigenous deaths increased over time, before declining in the 1900s, but massacres continued up to 1928 Colonist deaths in massacres stop almost entirely from the early 1900s onwards Reprisal for killing civilians was the most common justification, with 111 attacks sparked by the death of a colonist “Opportunity” attacks were the second most common, and the majority were planned with government involvement or sanction At least 65 massacres of Indigenous people were in retaliation for the killing or theft of livestock, or theft of property “Just about all of the massacres in the first 30 years [of colonisation] are carried out by government forces,” said Prof Lyndall Ryan, who heads the University of Newcastle research team. “There’s always police involved in the story, right across Australia. “As the frontier starts to expand, it’s less likely to be British soldiers, but soldiers who’ve left the regiment and been appointed as magistrates, or mounted police. “They don’t lose their military bearing, let’s put it that way.” Events were recorded in graphic detail in newspapers, journals, court documents and even a 1926 royal commission but, with the exception of Myall Creek in New South Wales in 1838, no perpetrators were ever convicted. At Mount Bryan in South Australia in 1844, William Carter killed an Aboriginal family, including a pregnant woman and her unborn child. Carter reported it in horrific detail to magistrates. He was never charged with a crime; the magistrates said “the whites appear to have acted with great moderation.” At York, WA, in 1837, a pastoralist kept ears as souvenirs after a killing for which nobody was tried or convicted. The Swan River Guardian newspaper described the actions – endorsed by the military, led by Lieutenant Bunbury – as medieval. Barbarities of the Middle Age have been committed even by boys and servants, who shot the unarmed woman, the unoffensive child, and the men who kindly showed them the road in the bush; the ears of the corpses have been cut off, and hung up in the kitchen of a gentleman, as a signal of triumph. The Swan River Guardian, 16 November 1837 More than 20 massacres took place in the 20th century – half of them in the years after the first world war. The accounts of these later killings – as told by perpetrators as well as survivors – are utterly horrifying. The late Hector Chunda Jandany’s father and grandfather were killed by colonists in the Kimberley. The Gija artist and senior lawman often spoke and painted about what happened. Of the Jail House creek killings in 1900, Chunda said: “some kartiya [white people] bin round em up the blackfellas, put em chains around their necks. They used to drive em like a mob of cattle. They took em to the right place, Jail Creek. Then they were carting woodback to the place where they were camping, then tie them up, like a dog. “All the kartiya get em their guns, line em up every girl and boy and shoot em down. Whang, all the children on the rocks. [Smash their skulls on the rocks.] Chuck em kerosene, put em on the firewood and chuck all em them dead bodies in the firewood place, put em kerosene and chuck em matches. “Kartiya bin finish em up, killed the lot.” Aboriginal people were killed and their bodies burned at Panton River in the east Kimberley in the 1880s, and again at Kariyarri in the Pilbara in the 1890s. At Linnekar Gorge in 1896 a descendant of survivors, David Turner, said “kartiya come there to shoot blackfellas for no reason. Gather all the blackfellas and tie em up with chains. Told blackfellas to get all the wood, stack em on the wood heapStarted shooting the blackfellas with the chains (still on). They had a bottle of kerosene and just pour em on and burn it up.” The practice continued well into the 20th century. • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In 1924, according to oral history passed down by survivors, a group of Gija and Worla men were convicted of killing a bullock at Bedford Downs station. They were sent back to the station with “tickets” around their necks as a label of their guilt. Some removed the tickets before they reached the station, others left them on. When they arrived, those who still had their tickets on were sent to a remote area to chop wood. After spending the morning chopping wood, they were given food poisoned with strychnine, causing them to die painfully. Their bodies were then burned. Two men who refused to eat escaped. They, along with two women who had also witnessed the killings, passed on this story. These recounts are told with brutal simplicity. Ryan believes it is a sign that “the hatred of Aboriginal people after world war one seems to have intensified”. “Racism has become more profound. It’s more acceptable, more articulate. “Everything is more ruthless, as if the compassion has gone,” Ryan says. “This is hard, ruthless country, no holds barred.” She adds: “These are professional killers, by the time we get into the 20th century. The Boer war and world war one seem to have a big impact on the way massacres are carried out. And that’s to do with better gun technology, like long-range rifles.” At the same time, Ryan says, Aboriginal labour was needed to build the frontier, so “there’s a lot of contradiction going on”. “They always know it’s wrong,” Ryan says. “On the one hand, the authorities in Broome or Darwin are saying “massacre is illegal” but they all seem to be doing it, and nobody’s brought to justice. “You do find some of the press in Western Australia expressing concern . But most of the stations in the Kimberley are actually owned by politicians in the West Australian parliament. “Most of the massacres in the Northern Territory, even after 1911, are carried out on pastoral leasesowned by politicians in South Australia, the pillars of South Australian society. “It’s happening on their cattle stations, prominent South Australians.” The historical records show that it takes some perpetrators decades to talk about what took place. Ryan believes the need to bear witness is a great burden on them, that seems to weigh heavier with time. “The whole thing about massacres is the code of silence that is imposed in the immediate aftermath,” Ryan explains. “Many people are too frightened to speak. Aboriginal people won’t speak. They might get killed themselves. “Some of the perpetrators might feel badly but they’re not going to say anything immediately afterwards. They might talk 20 or 30 years later, when all fear of being killed or being arrested has gone. “Often it’s the young men who are in their late teens or early 20s, who’re not the leaders of the massacre but part of the hunting group. Sometimes when they’re married, and children of their own appear, they suddenly realise they’ve killed a little Aboriginal child and I think it really weighs on them. “The need to tell becomes terribly important.” The Killing Times is just the beginning of research into the frontier. There are still many sites awaiting verification, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. “We’ll never have the whole list but what we’ve got is really confronting enough,” Ryan says. “The cover-up has been so profound and this is just a very important part of it. The cover-up of massacres is an important part of white Australia.” The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacre Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle’s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.

          "bodyText": "Does your small business offer remote working options? If not, then you had better consider it. Otherwise, you could find yourself not only losing good employees, but losing out on prospective employees too. That’s the conclusion from a report released this week by Zapier, a firm that provides connectivity tools for software and technologies. The study, which surveyed almost 900 US “knowledge workers” – those who primarily work in a professional setting and use a computer as part of their job – found 95% of those workers want to work remotely, and 74% would be willing to quit a job in order to do so. Unfortunately, there are still too many companies that don’t offer remote working options, and they’re suffering because of it. According to the Zapier study, 31% of those surveyed said they don’t work remotely because their company doesn’t allow it and 26% quit their jobs because of this, a trend that only adds to an employer’s challenges to find and keep good people in these times of tight employment. Remember – these are “knowledge” workers – people that aren’t on the factory floor or do work that requires them to be onsite or at a customer location all the time. Unfortunately, those employees can’t be accommodated with remote working options due to the nature of their jobs. But there are options for them too. I’ve seen some of my clients get creative with employee hours by offering extended shifts that have more continuous days off as well as offering greater flexibility over scheduling for those higher-performing workers who have been with the company for a certain period of time. But for the rest of your workforce, it’s important to have a remote working policy. A good policy should require you, the employer, to provide technologies – cloud based applications, communications and collaboration tools and devices – that will enable remote employees to do their work productively from home. In return, the employees must commit to being available during work hours as if they were in the office and to minimize any signs that they’re working from home, such as dogs barking, kids crying and the team from The View arguing in the background. Most importantly: a work from home policy doesn’t have to be permanent. Many of my clients have “trial periods” – maybe 90 days – which gives both the employee and employer the chance to determine if the arrangement is satisfactory because let’s face it: some people can handle working from home and others get distracted too easily. Giving both parties the opportunity to back out if things aren’t going well is important. Maybe it’s my age, but I don’t agree with the two-thirds of respondents in the Zapier survey who believe that by 2030 the office will just “disappear”. I know this because I run a company where all of my people work remotely. We don’t have an office and even though I’m benefitting from lower overheads I can confidently say my company is probably the most dysfunctional company in the world. Sure, we talk on the phone and see each other at client meetings. But offices provide an environment for collaboration, teamwork and plain old human contact that is an invaluable part of a successful company. I know that not having that environment means I’m missing out on identifying potential opportunities or solutions to problems that naturally come about during office conversations – even if most of these conversations are about The Bachelor. So yes, you need to have a remote worker policy. The data proves it. But balance it with in-office requirements too. Your company will always need that as well. • This article’s headline was amended on 18 November 2019 to more accurately reflect the text."

Running between them is Chesil Beach, the setting made famous by Ian McEwan’s novel-turned film. The National Trust has restored this peaceful stone cottage overlooking the sea. There’s a spacious master bedroom on the first floor and another double in the attic. The sitting room has a charming inglenook fireplace. The comfortable cottage works in all weathers: if there’s a storm brewing, it provides the perfect place to watch the sea changing colour, or curl up on a window seat with a book. If it’s fine, there’s a pretty garden and a lovely stroll down to the beach. Once dreaded by sailing ships as a notorious site for wrecks, Chesil (from the old English for gravel) stretches 18 miles from Portland to West Bay. For much of that distance, it creates a barrier between the sea and the precious Fleet Lagoon, home to rare flora and fauna. Off-season, the beach is deserted and you can gather driftwood, gulls’ feathers, shells and rashers of sunbaked seaweed as you crunch for a mile or so from the cottage to the Clubhouse at West Bexington for lunch. • From £391 for two nights, sleeps 4, nationaltrust.org.uk The Victoria Inn, Wells-next-the-Sea, Norfolk Walkers in search of wind, sky and expanses of sandy beach have a rare treat in store at Holkham Bay and there is nowhere better to stay than the Victoria Inn, right on the doorstep.

          "bodyText": "Stephen Rickerby and Lisa Shekede need a head for heights. As wall painting conservation experts, they often clamber up scaffolding to view rare surviving images in churches across Britain. But this year they have faced risks that are extreme even by their standards: scaling death-defying heights and sheer cliff faces to reach extraordinary paintings within churches in remote areas of northern Ethiopia. Their major study of ancient churches is for a UK-based charity, the Ethiopian Heritage Fund. Many have never been properly surveyed, and in some cases rope-scaling is the only way to access churches built into cliffs and caves. More than 150 rock-cut or constructed examples have been identified so far. Some are carved into the rock, cavelike with “stunning” interiors, Rickerby said. “The exterior of these sites rarely gives you the impression of what they’re like inside. They’re carved architecture with pillars, columns, capitals, arches, vaults. It’s sophisticated internal architecture in some of these places.” About 45 have paintings, largely dating from the 12th to 18th centuries, depicting local saints and sometimes a virgin and child, but most are largely unknown beyond the local communities, despite their significance. The British experts have also found evidence that their survival is under threat. “A number of churches and their paintings have been recently destroyed or obliterated,” Rickerby told the Observer. With growing populations, local communities build a new church closer to their village and abandon the ancient site, which gets neglected or even ransacked for building materials, leaving paintings exposed. “It’s pretty alarming because no one outside the local communities has any idea of what’s going on,” he said. Rickerby, who is a consultant to the Getty Conservation Institute and works closely with the Courtauld Institute and English Heritage, described these paintings as “an expression of artistic spirituality from one of the countries where Christianity arrived earliest in history”. “Ethiopia converted to Christianity in the 4th century. So if we’re concerned about our Christian heritage, the fact that the cradle of Christian art is disappearing should concern us all,” Rickerby said. Although some local people are fiercely protective of their churches, these historic sites are “off the radar” and “local safeguards are really weak”, he added. Some of the churches are so remote that they involve hours of hiking after hours of driving, said Rickerby: “Typically, roads are washed out, you get diverted, you’re going across country, there are no signposts. You’re relying on local people to tell you where some of these churches are. So it’s quite adventurous.” He added that, while some of the churches would have been difficult to access in their earliest days, others have become more so: “These churches are now additionally stranded by rock collapses. Entrances to some of these churches are lost. That’s why the only route to them is by rope-climbing. With an altitude between 2,500 and 3,000 metres, some of the churches are right on ledges, 400 metres up.” Local guides, mountaineering barefoot, shared their worn-out ropes – twine and leather bound together, Shekede said: “It was the scariest thing I’ve ever done. It’s a steep drop. Your knees go. It’s not like we’re not used to heights. We’ve worked in little cantilevered boxes in the dome of St Paul’s cathedral. We know what it’s like to work at height. But it’s when you’re on the side of a mountain, and you know there’s no health and safety. If you do fall and break something, how the hell are you going to get back down to anywhere? You suddenly realise that things could go horribly wrong.” But the landscape is stunning, said Rickerby: “Big plains and mountains rising out of them. Sheer mountains. It’s like a Garden of Eden. “You get that sense of why the churches are out there and why they chose those spots. They’re communicating with heaven, rising above the plain.”"

          "headline": "Steve McQueen: Year 3 review – skewed ties, missing teeth and hope",
          "bodyText": "Their shining morning faces cover the walls of the Duveen galleries from floor to ceiling: beaming, laughing, awkward, exuberant. Who could not love them, all these eager young children from primary schools across London? Seventy-six thousand year 3 pupils, aged seven or eight, arranged on the diminutive wooden benches of our childhood in thousands of class photographs. This is a collective portrait of both our past and our future. Face to face with all this rising hope, which of us could not be moved? Year 3, Steve McQueen’s new project with Artangel, is unassailable in its emotional immediacy and grandeur. At first it thrives on the impact of its sheer scale. Walk into Tate Britain and you can hardly take in the spectacle of so many school photographs stretching into the distance, and all of them so regular in their lineup and format: the benches at identical range from the camera, the children symmetrically arranged around their teachers, the colours of the school clothes – red, grey, purple, royal blue – regularly repeating. They are all of them, so to speak, uniform shots; at least until the eye homes in. Skewed ties, missing teeth, the wild child, the double act fooling about in the back row: perhaps one looks for the familiar at first. But then there is that tall boy in a turban leaning so slightly out of line, as if he wanted to break free; the baffled girl with the amber eyes stretching out her hands; the nervous anxiety of the child squeezed into the front row at the last moment, not quite sitting on the bench. Some classes break into laughter at the shutter’s click, delighted by the photographer’s rival smile, or perhaps by the whole surprise of the occasion (few primary schools organise these all-together-now group portraits any more). In at least one shot, a child is jubilantly singing while the teacher tries to maintain the conventional silence. And, sad to say, an entire class of grey-clad children looks fearful and tense. Looming top left is the grim overlord of discipline. There are schools with 32 pupils to a class, and schools with five children in a Georgian salon. There are home schools and sports academies, free schools and pupil referral units, although not a single image is captioned. This is surely crucial, a principled egalitarianism. No seven-year-old is to be pigeonholed according to the kind of school their parents chose for them. You will see the same exuberance in the salon, with its parquet floor, as the run-down gymnasium where the uniforms are reflected in the lino’s dull gleam. And it is the children themselves who defy social prejudice. Clearly nobody can take in the stupefying numbers. Perhaps skip the odd photograph, you think, anxiously trying to do them all justice. But then some child stands out with a quizzical frown or a fetching smile and you have to give their classmates your full attention too. This is the lovely paradox: a mass observation project (two-thirds of London’s primaries took part) that allows each and every pupil to single themselves out. It is no overstatement to say that you could spend hours with these children, in all their curiosity and innocence, straining to see the little images skied high on the wall – like children overlooked, yet again, for this year’s school nativity. But McQueen has a plan for these invisible faces. A special giant magnifying glass on wheels will be provided to view photographs on the top rows. And every one of the pupils involved will visit Tate Britain. Children who may have never left their borough, let alone set foot in a gallery, can come and behold themselves on the walls of a national museum. Perhaps they might look at the art around them too and become the next generation of artists. Outside the gallery, a selection of these school photographs appear on 600 billboards throughout the city. You can see the twins in Miss Smith’s class in pleats of laughter on an underground poster, or the contemporary pupils from Steve McQueen’s own primary school on a gigantic street billboard. Here they are, out in the open – free from art world associations, and from McQueen’s own reputation as a prize-winning artist and film director: standing for potential and liberty, representing nothing but their own unique selves. An art event of an entirely different kind is taking place at the National Gallery. It would be hard to think of a greater disparity. The subjects of Year 3 are living beings, our fascination with them almost a test of human solidarity. Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece in Trafalgar Square is exactly the opposite. Created by machines, it might have been made for them too, so frigid, empty and remote is it – taking you far closer to the state of contemporary CGI displays than the workings of Leonardo’s mind. The first room feels like the gift shop into which visitors are decanted at the end. It consists of nothing but a sequence of tacky display stands in the form of open-ended aluminium boxes through which photos of Alpine rocks may be glimpsed, along with wrong-scale reproductions of drawings related to The Virgin of the Rocks, which is the subject of this “immersive” extravaganza. The audio of dripping rivulets leaks into the next room: a facsimile conservator’s studio, lit with Anglepoise lamps, where the technical observations of scholars who cleaned the painting, to the effect that there is another composition below the surface (meaningless, without narrative context), have to be cheered up with instrumental music. The lowest point is the interaction room, where visitors can twiddle knobs to change the chiaroscuro lighting on a rock… at which point, the Science Museum surely beckons. In the final room, the painting is displayed in a virtual mock-up of the altarpiece in Milan where it was first seen in 1508. Projections shift across its surface, to the point where my neighbour though it was a CGI too. Can that really have been the intention? Perhaps no damage is truly done, since more people stood before that eerie masterpiece of Italian art than any digital pixelation in the Leonardo experience. I cannot imagine what possessed the National Gallery to “recontextualise” our Leonardo in this way. The price of admission is steep: £20 at weekends, for a painting that belongs to the nation and can be viewed free, again, from 20 January onwards. If you want scholarly exegesis, spend the money on the catalogue instead. Star ratings (out of five) Steve McQueen: Year 3 ★★★★ Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece ★★ • Steve McQueen: Year 3 is at Tate Britain, London, until 3 May 2020 • Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece is at the National Gallery, London, until 12 January 2020"

          "bodyText": "One local newspaper described the sales listing, with calculated understatement, as a “mid-century fixer-upper”: an underground bunker built to withstand a nuclear attack, and to house the fire power to retaliate. The decommissioned nuclear silo in southern Arizona was once home to the Titan II, the largest intercontinental ballistic missile deployed by the US Air Force. The silo’s owner, Rick Ellis, told the Arizona Daily Star newspaper that he was selling the property because he’s “bored”. Ellis said he originally bought the silo to turn into a commercial data storage center because it is shielded from electromagnetic pulses that can scramble electronics, but his plans were waylaid by the economic recession. So far, he said he has rejected serious offers from a buyer who wanted to turn it into a greenhouse for medical marijuana and another who planned to use it as a porn studio. The threshold to tour the property is much higher than for a typical open house. Interested buyers must prove they have the money to cover the $395,000 cost and sign a liability waiver before descending a 40ft staircase into the bunker to tour the property. “Private yet not too remote,” says the listing for the property, which includes more than 12 acres of desert. There are 18 decommissioned nuclear silos which surround Tucson and were operational from June 1963 into the 1980s. They were on alert to launch, or respond, to nuclear attacks with the Titan II missiles, which carried warheads with nine megatons of explosive power – the equivalent to a yield 600 times that of “Little Boy”, the bomb dropped over Hiroshima. When the bunkers were decommissioned, the government demolished them, filled them with rubble and sealed the entrances with concrete. Ellis took on a major excavation after purchasing the property, which still includes some original equipment such as floor-to-ceiling springs which isolated each level of the basement from seismic shocks and signs revealing the bunker’s designated smoking area. Premier Media Group created a 3D tour of the bunker which showcases pools of stagnant water and the 6,000lb blast door which can be closed with one hand. For those who can’t provide the paperwork necessary to tour the property, realtors Grant Hampton and Kori Ward recommend a visit to the nearby Titan Missile Museum in Sahuarita, Arizona, which is inside a decommissioned silo."

          "headline": "Reef Life by Callum Roberts review – miraculous and threatened",
          "bodyText": "In August of this year, Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, called for the widespread ingestion of psychedelic substances to help bring about a transformation in attitudes to the climate crisis and the living world. The proposal may sound far-fetched, but it has some science behind it. Studies show that, in the right setting, psychedelics can not only be effective against addiction and depression but can also help people feel more connected to nature. Yet the living world of tropical coral reefs surpasses in wonder and beauty anything engendered in the human mind by psychedelics. As the evolutionary biologist Leslie Orgel once said, evolution is cleverer than you are. A reef will convince you that it also has a bigger, stranger and subtler imagination. There are few better guides to the glories of reefs than Callum Roberts. Reef Life is a vibrant memoir of the joys, as well as the grind, of a research career beginning in the 1980s that has spanned a golden age of coral reef science. It is also a fine introduction to the ecology of reefs and the existential threats they now face. Roberts is well equipped for the task. He is chief scientific adviser to Blue Planet II, and has given us two of the best books in the last 15 years about the ecology of the sea and its fate in human hands: An Unnatural History of the Sea and Ocean of Life. Roberts revels in the details of life on a coral reef. A mantis shrimp, for instance, has “a carapace of mottled green edged with a thin red line like the piping on an iced cake”. Its eyes, “frosted glass balls on blue stalks, marked with a horizontal line like the slot of a helmet visor”, give it “an almost supernatural power” to see linear and circularly polarised light. This book also addresses the major questions regarding human responsibility and possibilities for change. We live at what is probably the zenith of coral reef evolution in hundreds of millions of years in terms of their diversity and productivity, but human action might bring this all to an end within a few generations: “It is an extraordinary position that I still grapple with daily to understand.” Coral reefs are, arguably, life’s greatest miracle. Hugely productive ecosystems in nutrient-poor waters, they harbour a quarter of all marine diversity in less than 0.1% of the oceans’ extent. On a healthy reef, top predators such as sharks are abundant, while life lower down the food chain appears to be scarce – a seeming inversion of the “pyramid” we’re familiar with on land, where a vast savannah supports a herd of wildebeest, but only a few lions or leopards. (The solution to the apparent paradox is that life at the lower trophic levels on reefs provides abundant resources for predators but turns over very fast.) Despite their intense vibrancy, reefs are also vulnerable, both to direct human impacts such as overfishing, pollution and insensitive development, and to indirect impacts of the large-scale combustion of fossil fuels, which result in global heating and changes to ocean chemistry. In the past four decades, three pulses of heat have devastated many reefs around the world, including, in 2016 and 2017, the Great Barrier Reef. The risk to their future is unlike anything they have experienced in millions of years. There is already a rich literature, and to a lesser extent a filmography, on the threats they face and what, if anything, can best protect them. Among the highlights are John “Charlie” Veron’s sober and devastating A Reef in Time, the gripping documentary film Chasing Coral, and Coral Whisperers, Irus Braverman’s fluent account of 100 or so interviews with leading scientists and conservation managers. Journalists continue to document how the destruction of reefs impacts on the mental health of researchers, who report “ecological grief”. Roberts is a humorous, determined expert, who has spent more than three decades trying to come to terms with such issues. As his book begins, he is a fresh-faced student assisting in some of the first detailed studies of coral reefs on the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea. Working in harsh conditions, blundering into embarrassing situations and sometimes exposing himself to danger, he is carried forward by “thunderclaps of wonder”. A few years later, and now a respected marine biologist, he is assessing the aftermath of the huge releases of oil into the Persian Gulf by Saddam Hussein’s forces as they fled from Kuwait in the first Gulf war. Remarkably, some of the reefs here – among the most northern in the world – survive, having escaped the tide of pollution. Further adventures, from the Caribbean to the Maldives and far beyond, follow. In 2013, Roberts is in Australia supporting scientists and environmentalists who are trying to slow and even reverse the impact on the Great Barrier Reef of the development of new port facilities for the export of coal. By this time, scientists are warning that even a relatively small increase in the global average temperature, let alone the 2º Celsius or more that now looks probable, is likely to have a devastating impact on most of the world’s reefs. Roberts finds himself deployed as part of what turns out to be an effective campaign to change minds regarding the proposed coastal development; by 2015 the opposition Labor Party come to power with a promise to protect the reef. It is poignant to read this in 2019, long after Australian voters have returned a government that does not appear to believe that the climate crisis should be a cause for concern. “I don’t know a single coral expert who is not haunted by doubt,” Roberts writes. “It is already possible to glimpse the most dystopian of futures.” But, he stresses, there are “hopeful strands”. It has been found, for example that some corals can survive in hotter and more acidic waters than was previously thought. Further acclimation and adaptation may be possible in some instances. Genetic engineering to make more heat-resistant corals may be feasible, though controversial. But above all, according to Roberts, there is a role for well-managed marine parks. “Most coral reef damage of the last couple of decades has been from manageable stresses like pollution, overfishing and development rather than climate change.” Where these pressures are reduced, corals and the endless forms of life they support have a fighting chance. In a moving penultimate chapter, he describes a visit to Palmyra Atoll in the Pacific, the world’s most isolated reef, and currently among its most intact. Palmyra is part of a huge US conservation zone called the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. Roberts, with his irrepressible warmth and passion, concludes: “Now is the time for action, not mourning. There is everything to play for.” • Reef Life: An Underwater Memoir by Callum Roberts is published by Profile (£16.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

          "headline": "General election: Boris Johnson dismisses Labour's broadband plan as 'crazed communist scheme' – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "That’s all from us for this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. For a comprehensive summary of the day’s politics news, see my colleague Andrew Sparrow’s wonderful election briefing: And, for those who want to read yet more, Peter Walker, Rajeev Syal and Heather Stewart have our main UK politics story this evening: A coalition of women’s groups has written to political leaders asking what they will do to end violence against women and girls if they win the general election. The UK-wide coalition of more than 90 women’s organisations is calling for legislation to protect all women from domestic abuse. They want decisive action on the crisis in rape justice, proper funding for support services, and a duty on employers to prevent sexual harassment. Sarah Green, the director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said voters need to hear from party leaders and every candidate during the election that action in this area remains a priority. Issues relating to the abuse and violence experienced by women and girls are no longer ‘behind closed doors’. Times have changed and many women and men demand that the government make a high priority of ending and preventing this abuse in the first place. In their letter to the leaders, the coalition said: Violence against women and girls is not inevitable, but it is enduring because it relates to women’s persistent inequality. This election is taking place at a time of crisis in the criminal justice response to rape – even though more women than ever are coming forward to report to the police, just 1.5% of cases are being prosecuted. Domestic abuse homicides are at their highest level for five years, reports of sexual harassment are reaching epidemic levels in our workplaces and education institutions and many women MPs are leaving political careers citing online abuse and threats of violence against them as factors. These issues are deeply related and require urgent action by an incoming government. Jeremy Corbyn has launched what is probably the most eye-catching, radical surprising policy of the election campaign so far, promising free, full-fibre broadband for everyone in the country. Labour would deliver it by 2030 by nationalising part of BT, with remote and rural areas of Britain currently getting the worst broadband receiving the new service first. The ongoing cost would be paid for by a new tax on tech giants, with the free broadband saving families on average £30 a month, Labour says. In a speech in Lancaster Corbyn said that only 10% of Britain has access to full-fibre broadband, while in South Korea coverage is 98%. He said this showed how Labour would be using the power of the state to deliver an essential public service. He said: Labour believes that the British people deserve the very best. As a country we should be proud of our history of building treasured public institutions and services. In the 19th century it was the public waterworks. In the 20th century it was our fantastic National Health Service, freeing people from the fear of illness. British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century, delivering fast and free broadband to every home. Only the government has the planning ability, economies of scale and ambition to take this on. This is a mission for everyone to get behind. My colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson have a good analysis here of how feasible the plan is. Labour’s plans has caused alarm in the City, where it was claimed that the party has massively underestimated the cost of its free full-fibre broadband offer and that the prospect of further nationalisation could halt further investment in the sector. The plan to nationalise Openreach, the broadband division of BT, caused particular shock because until last night Labour had claimed that it had no nationalisation plans beyond its existing commitments to bring rail, energy, water and the Royal Mail back in to public ownership. The BT chief executive Philip Jansen said Labour’s plans would not cost £20bn, as the party claimed, but closer to £100bn. Julian David, chief executive of tech trade association techUK, said Labour’s plans would be a “disaster” for the sector. He said: Re-nationalisation would immediately halt the investment being driven not just by BT but the growing number of new and innovative companies that compete with BT. Boris Johnson dismissed the plan as a “crazed communist scheme”. And the Conservatives sought to play up fears that the Corbyn plan shows that Labour’s nationalisation agenda will turn out to be more extensive than the party admits. But the Tories were also keen to stress their own plans to roll out improved broadband services, and there is likely to be some nervousness in CCHQ about how voters will react to the Labour giveaway. As a retail offer, it is big enough to get noticed - even by a public that seems bored and disengaged from the election. Corbyn’s analysis of the problem faced by the public is sound (Ed Miliband had a very pithy summary here), and ‘people like free stuff’ is not a bad guide to electoral behaviour. But this is a plan that marks an extension of the nationalisation agenda (other services being nationalised by Labour were once in the public sector; broadband wasn’t, because it did not exist in that era), and although voters might easily agree with Corbyn that the broadband service they are getting now is unsatisfactory, whether they think it would be any better under a monopoly state provider is another matter. The Tories claim a similar project in Australia has been a disaster. At this stage it is just too early to know how the electoral politics of this announcement will unfold. Johnson has faced questions about how “relatable” he is during a BBC Breakfast interview. In his encounter with the BBC’s Naga Munchetty, and a subsequent hour-long phone-in on Radio 5 Live, there were also references to the fact that no one even knows for sure how many children he has. Johnson did not seem to enjoy the references to his private life, but he insisted - as he always does - that he would not talk about his family, and got through both programmes without significant embarrassment. Johnson has escalated his attacks on Cobyn and Labour, claiming that that Corbyn’s plans are “absolutely terrifying”. In a short speech unveiling his battlebus, he sought to justify this charge with a series of allegations about the opposition - many of which were partially or wholly untrue. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, has said his party would use regulation to make Britain “the gold standard of climate capitalism for the world”. He also said that the Lib Dems were committed to a £100bn programme over five years to tackle climate change. Police are launching their biggest ever operation to keep election candidates safe from attacks and abuse amid rising concern from politicians about the dangers they face. That’s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. A former North Sea diver has been selected as the Brexit party’s candidate in Tynemouth, despite the fact he lives in Australia and has only ever passed through the northern English seaside town. Ed Punchard, who survived the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster in 1988, claimed he had an affinity with Tynemouth, which is on the north bank of the Tyne, because it has a North Sea coast. The 62-year-old, who grew up in North Wales, said he was willing to leave Australia – where he has lived for the past 30 years – if he is elected. He said he has family links to the fishing industry in south-west England and felt at home in Tynemouth. He said: I have come here to win, not to muck about. I wouldn’t have come if I had not thought I could do it. Tynemouth has been held by Labour’s Alan Campbell since 1997. He is standing again. The other candidates are John Appleby for the Liberal Democrats, Lewis Bartoli for the Conservatives and Julia Erskine for the Greens. Another question from BTL (below the line). What happens if someone casts a postal vote and then dies before polling day? The answer to this one is easy; the vote still counts. But it begs a much harder, and more interesting, question; can the votes of the dead decide an election? In the new edition of Sex, Lies and Politics, a book edited by Philip Cowley and Robert Ford of 50 essays summarising the findings of research into elections and voting behaviour in a very readable manner, Kingsley Purdam addresses exactly this question. He says that 8.4m people requested postal votes in 2017 and that around 3,000 postal votes could have been completed by people who went on to die before polling day. That is around five votes per constituency. Purdam says that in North East Fife Stephen Gethins won by just two votes and “such a small margin could easily have been determined by voters who had already died before the count began.” Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, has delivered a speech on Lib Dem economic policy this afternoon. Here are the main points. Davey said the Lib Dems were calling for a £100bn spending programme over five years to tackle climate change. He said: Our climate investment plan includes a new £10bn renewable power fund. It alone would leverage in over £100bn of extra private climate investment. Not a new subsidy, but state climate finance, to fast-track clean power deployment and give a healthy profit to the taxpayer. Payback as we clean up. This fund will confirm Britain as the world leader in offshore wind, and make Britain the global number one in tidal power too. From Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon to a whole suite of tidal power stations round our coast. Creating another new climate industry. And we will invest £15bn more to make every building in the country greener, with an emergency ten-year programme to save energy, end fuel poverty and cut heating bills. Cutting the average household’s energy bill by a whopping £550 a year. He said the Lib Dems would regulate the City to address the climate emergency. he said: We will regulate the City for climate. From pension funds to banks, from the debt markets to the stock exchange. Mandatory disclosure on fossil fuel investments, to expose investors to their climate risks. New laws to require a financial institution or large corporate to publish their multi-year strategy to move to net zero. New accounting standards and laws, to write down climate damaging assets to a zero value by 2045. Under Liberal Democrats, the UK can become the gold standard of climate capitalism for the world. He said that by remaining in the EU, the Lib Dems would generate a £50bn “remain bonus” for the economy. The Lib Dems are committed to revoking article 50 if they form a majority government (which is probably impossible, given their size and the extent of their support). Interestingly, although Davey spoke about the Lib Dem commitment to keep the UK in the EU, he did not mention revoking article 50. There have been claims that voters are reacting badly to this promise, and that instead the Lib Dems are more keen on stressing their commitment to backing remain in a second referendum. He said the Lib Dems would adopt “well-being budgeting”. He said: What does well-being budgeting mean? Well, go check out the early experiments in New Zealand – where investment in mental health services has gone up. And then think what a well-being approach to human capital would mean for investment in education and training. I can confirm today, that investment in infants, children, young people and adults – their education, their training, their wellbeing – this would be the top day-to-day spending priority for the Liberal Democrats. He said the Lib Dems would aim for a structural surplus in current spending. He said: How you ensure that your day-to-day spending on things like salaries and benefits, is covered by your revenue, primarily tax receipts. The Resolution Foundation have proposed a new fiscal rule for day-to-day spending - that a government should target a structural surplus in current spending equal to 1% of national income over a parliament. And their rule retains sensible flexibility, allowing spending up to minus 1% of national income - if there’s a downturn and forecasts turn out wide of the mark. Liberal Democrats will adopt that fiscal rule – and our spending plans meet it, with current account surpluses in every year of our five year costings. Here is a question from below the line prompted by the post at 2.34pm, saying Boris Johnson will be defending the smallest majority for a prime minister since 1924. Can Boris Johnson remain as prime minister if he loses his seat? In 1906 the Conservative leader Arthur Balfour lost his seat only weeks after being replaced as PM by the liberal, Henry Campbell-Bannerman. But Balfour soon returned to the Commons in a byelection and served as leader of the opposition. If the Tories lose the election, and Johnson loses his seat, he may decide to follow the Balfour example. Or he may decide to walk away and do something else. The much more interesting question is, what would happen if Johnson loses his seat, but the Conservatives win. In Britain the prime minister has always been a member of parliament and since 1902, when the Marquess of Salisbury stood down, the PM has always been a member of the House of Commons, not the House of Lords. But there is nothing in the constitution or in law saying that the prime minister has to be an MP. And there are precedents for people serving in government and not being members of the Commons or the Lords. Harold Wilson made Patrick Gordon Walker foreign secretary even though he lost his seat in the 1964 election. But when Gordon Walker lost a byelection three months later, he had to stand down. Unless there is something in the Conservative party rules saying the party leader has to be an MP (which the party may be able to bypass anyway), it would theoretically be possible for Johnson to remain as PM, even if he had lost his seat, pending a byelection at which he might return. This would be unprecedented, but precedent has become a poor guide to our politics recently. A lot would depend on whether his party accepted this (ie, whether he was still seen as an election winner), and perhaps on whether Buckingham Palace were willing go along with this arrangement. Doubtless the idea of being prime minister but without having to turn up to PMQs every week might appeal to Johnson. Most politically-conscious Britons would consider it unthinkable to have a prime minister not sitting in parliament, but in many other parts of the world the head of the executive is not a member of the legislature and it is not entirely impossible to imagine that one day in the UK this could change. UPDATE: I’ve corrected the post to reflect the fact that, by the time he lost his seat in the 1906 general election, Arthur Balfour had already been been replaced as prime minister by Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who replaced him when the Conservative government fell in December 1905, precipitating the election. And if you don’t trust polling, you can always try using focus groups to get an understanding of public opinion. Lord Ashcroft, the Conservative peer and polling specialist, is conducting regular focus groups during the election campaign. He has just a report about the findings from his latest ones, conducted in three leave-voting, Labour-held seats (Stoke-on-Trent North, Bolton North East and West Bromwich East). According to Ashcroft’s write-up, the groups divided into those who saw the election in terms of Brexit and those who did not. Amongst the latter group, opposition to the Tories was still quite high, Ashcroft says. The thoughts of those – including leave voters, and even some 2017 Conservatives – for whom Brexit is not the main priority illustrate that taking these seats from Labour is by no means a done deal for the Tories. With echoes of the last election, austerity still loomed large in these voters’ minds. But Ashcroft also found people sceptical about Labour’s proposals. And this week’s policy news? “Promises on the health service, which I don’t believe;” “Labour said something about bringing back bursaries for nurses. I don’t think they’ll do it, but it was nice that they thought of it;” “There was something about a Russian file that they won’t release until after the election. It makes him sound a bit Trumpish;” “Corbyn is trying to get McDonald’s workers up to £15 an hour! If they do that, the price of food goes up, people don’t go into McDonald’s anymore and people lose their jobs;” “It’s more than half the people on the front line in the public sector;” “Just the money, Corbyn promising so many billion. They’ll put another note in at the end of the term, and say ‘sorry, there’s no money left’,” “Labour want to raise the Corporation Tax, don’t they. Businesses will just move. There will already be a cost with Brexit, so if you then raise Corporation Tax, what incentive is there for any company to stay in this country?” “The four-day week. I can get behind that;” “It’s all well and good if you’re not self-employed. Who’s going to pay me for a four-day week?” “I’m a business owner. If my staff come to me and say ‘Jeremy Corbyn says I only have to work four days,’ well, you’re no use to me.” Panelbase has released a new poll. Polls, of course, do not always turn out to be accurate predictors of election results, but they are a better guide than using hunches or guesswork. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has described the behaviour of Rupert Lowe, who stood down as a candidate for his party in the Labour/Tory marginal Dudley North yesterday, allowing no time for it to choose a replacement, as “disgusting”. Farage also offered an apology to voters in the constituency, who now will not have the option of voting for his party. Lowe, a Brexit party MEP, announced his decision moments before the 4pm deadline for nominations. In their overnight press notice about their plans to revive neglected communities, the Conservatives said they would “reverse many of the Beeching rail cuts of the 1960s, reconnecting towns that have suffered since their railways were removed”. The party said it would fund this through a £500m “Beeching reversal fund”. As the Press Association reports, Sim Harris, managing editor of industry newspaper Railnews, has said this fund “is not going to buy you very much”. Harris said opening many of the lines closed by the Beeching cuts would cost billions. He explained: [£500m] is not going to buy you very much railway. A rebuilt railway costs millions for each kilometre. It depends what’s happened to the railway since it closed. If it’s still there, and it’s a matter of upgrading and reopening a freight line, that is the cheaper option, but you’ve still got to spend money on the stations. It would cost far more than that to really reverse Beeching. From ITV’s Robert Peston Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister) has said that agreeing a UK-EU free trade deal before the end of next year would be “difficult but not impossible”. The government insists that the deal will have to be concluded within this period, because Boris Johnson says he will not extend the transition period. Speaking at the British Irish Council meeting, he said: In terms of negotiating a trade agreement before December 2020, it would be difficult but not impossible. Even though the deal might be agreed, we could run into issues with ratification. My aim is we will continue to have tariff-free trade with Great Britain, not just Northern Ireland. One consequence of nominations closing yesterday is that we now know Boris Johnson will defend his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency and that rumours that he might decamp to a safer seat turned out to be unfounded. As the Press Association reports, Johnson will go into the election trying to defend the smallest constituency majority for a prime minister in nearly 100 years. In 2017 he held his seat with a majority of just 5,034. No prime minister since 1924 has fought a general election while simultaneously defending such a slim personal majority. Nominations for the election have now closed. If you want to know who the candidates are standing in your area, there is a great page on our website here that will tell you. During an election campaign all leaders need a stump speech - a standard five-minute speech they can repeat over and over again, setting out why they should be elected. Boris Johnson has just delivered the latest version of his at the unveiling of the Conservative party’s election battlebus. The Conservatives announced almost no new policy in the campaign so far (that may change when the manifesto eventually comes out) and there was little that was positive in the Johnson speech. Instead, it was mostly an attack on Labour, and Jeremy Corbyn in particular. Much of what Johnson was saying was not new. But the speech did include some criticism that was stronger than anything we’ve heard from Johnson in recent days (and probably less honest). On the Labour plan for free broadband, Johnson went beyond describing it as “crackpot” (the line he used on the BBC this morning - see 9.39am) and instead described it as a “crazed communist scheme” (see 12.45pm). Johnson’s language is reminiscent of the Tories describing Ed Miliband’s plan for a cap on energy bills as “Marxist” - before adopting it two years later as party policy. Johnson also claimed that, overall, Labour’s plans were “terrifying”. He said: And what is Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party offering? ... I think it’s absolutely terrifying. I have to say, I think their programme is truly scary, disastrous for this country. Johnson made various claims about Corbyn that have already regularly been aired by the Tories in the campaign: that Labour would hold two referendums next year (highly questionable - Corbyn says he would not allow a Scottish independence referendum in 2020, although Johnson said “that is the price that Nicola Sturgeon will demand for putting Jeremy Corbyn in power); that Labour would spend an extra £1.2tr over five years, costing taxpayers an extra £2,400 per year (implausible, because it is based on assumptions about Labour spending that are partly flawed or unfounded); and that Corbyn sided with Russia at the time of the novichok poisoning attack (arguable - Corbyn was initially sceptical of the UK government’s assessment that Russia was to blame, but Labour would contest that he “sided with” Russia.) However, Johnson also added two other allegations that have barely featured in this campaign; that Corbyn wants to get rid of the army, and that he does not approve of home ownership. Johnson said: Come with us, a government that backs our armed services, thinks they are a force for good around the world. Go with Corbyn and his lot, who actually think that the armed services should be disbanded - that’s what he said. Come with us, a party that believes in helping people, wherever we possibly can, to have the satisfaction that comes from home ownership, which is absolutely right. Or go with Jeremy Corbyn, who actually thinks home ownership is a bad idea and is opposed to it. The claim that Corbyn wants to get rid of the armed forces is based on a line he said in a speech in 2012: “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every politician around the world instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces did what Costa Rica have done and abolished their army, and took pride in the fact they don’t have an army.” You can argue that this shows that Corbyn wants the army to be disbanded - but only if you are not willing to accept that there is a difference between musing about an ideal world, and advocating actual policy. As for the line about Corbyn and home ownership, I have no idea where that comes from (unless Johnson was talking about second home ownership, where Labour policy is unsympathetic). I have asked the Conservative party if they can supply evidence for this, and will let you know if I get a reply. The Rev Richard Cameron, who heckled Jeremy Corbyn on a visit to Glasgow on Wednesday and accused him of being a “terrorist sympathiser” has been suspended from his work as a minister while the Church of Scotland carries out an inquiry. During the incident, the Scotstoun parish church minister told Corbyn: “I thought you’d be wearing your Islamic Jihad scarf.” It later emerged that he had posted a series of Islamophobic and homophobic tweets, and that the Humanist Society Scotland had complained about Cameron’s behaviour on social media nine months ago. A Church of Scotland spokesperson said: In accordance with our procedures Rev Richard Cameron has been administratively suspended. This is to allow us to carry out an inquiry in relation to the incident which took place earlier this week and the subsequent complaints about his social media use. The Boris Johnson event was another of those where the close-up photographs make the room look packed, but where the wide-screen shots show that he was speaking to a relatively small audience. This is from the Manchester Evening News’ Jennifer Williams. Here is some video from the Boris Johnson bus launch. Johnson has now finished. It was only a very short stump speech, but it did mark an escalation in campaign rhetoric. Some of what he was saying about Labour was even more extreme, and questionable, than what he has said in the past. I will post the quotes shortly. Johnson says he was not allowed to talk about Labour’s plans in his BBC appearances his morning. (The presenters tried to get him to focus on Conservative plans, not just on attacking Labour.) But he says now he can talk about Labour. Labour’s plans are terrifying, he says. He repeats his claims (which Labour denies) that Labour would hold two referendums next year. He claims that Labour is opposed to home ownership. Boris Johnson is now speaking at the launch of the Conservative battlebus. He says Brexit will be like angioplasty. It will clear the arteries, and allow the government to focus on other projects. Those will include rolling out broadband. But the Conservative plan will not be like the “crazed communist scheme” outlined by Labour today. Here is an excellent Guardian explainer from my colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson looking at how feasible the Labour free broadband plan is. McDonnell says Labour is introducing this policy partly because broadband connectivity is an issue that people kept raising at public meetings. And they made the point that children could not do their homework without broadband access. And so this is a measure that will tackle inequality, he says. And that’s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: Will you be able to get access to land to lay these cables? Corbyn says there will be some disruption as new cables are laid. But this is necessary, he says. Q: Do you rule out a non-aggression pact with the Liberal Democrats in the election? Jo Swinson knows that having a Labour government is the only way to stop Brexit. Corbyn says he is fighting the election on a pledge to end austerity, ending the problems introduced by the coalition government that included the Lib Dems. He says Labour would introduce an early budget. If other parties make ending austerity a point of negotiation, he would refuse. He says he is not going into coalition with any of the pro-austerity parties. In fact, he is not planning to go into coalition with anyone. He is planning a majority. Q: When would poorer communities see the benefits from this? Corbyn says remote rural areas, that do not get any broadband at the moment, will get this early on. People who want to expand small businesses in rural areas cannot do so without proper broadband. Q: Do you plan to stop people watching porn on the government’s broadband service? Rebecca Long-Bailey says there will be a charter of internet rights. (She does not address the point about pornography.) Q: Other companies that provide broadband also provide things like landlines. How would you separate out those? And would broadband workers from all other companies get to keep their jobs? Long-Bailey says Labour does not want to stop other companies providing enhanced services. Workers who transfer will do so under TUPE. That means their rights will be protected. Q: Can you do this under EU laws? If not, is it a tacit admission that you want to leave? McDonnell says Labour has had legal advice saying this is compatible with EU law. Jeremy Corbyn and his colleagues are now taking questions. Q: Isn’t the real problem with BT the fact that it has little competition. How would replacing it with a state monopoly make a difference? Corbyn says he is proposing a public service, like any other public service. He says his plan will improve the livelihoods of many people. Every person in the room uses a computer every day, he says. They need this kind of access. On public ownership, he says BT used to be in the public sector. Q: Can you really afford this? BT say your plans will cost twice as much as you claim. And won’t ultimately taxpayers have to pay more? McDonnell says the £20bn figure that Labour is using is a figure from the government’s own review. Since privatisation, £54bn has been paid out in share dividends. That is twice as much as full-fibre rollout would have cost. He says pension funds want the prospect of a steady income from something that is secure. This plan will offer that. Q: Can you deliver this without a majority Labour government? Corbyn says that issue does not arise because there is going to be a majority Labour government. McDonnell urges people to see Ken Loach’s new film, Sorry We Missed You. It is shocking, he says. But it shows what is happening in the gig economy. He says the plan being announced today is huge. But it is one that will transform lives. McDonnell says for years people have said that taking on the multinationals is too difficult. But they accept that now is the time for it to happen. McDonnell says this is an example of a “shovel-ready project” that Labour would initiate immediately. McDonnell says this is not a return to the 1970s. This is public ownership for the future, he says. And the government will publish a charter of digital rights. McDonnell claims the Tories do not understand the problems facing the country, particularly the threat posed by the climate emergency. He says, when he is chancellor, he will not tolerate people dying from being homeless. He says it is important now for all infrastructure to be green. And, turning to broadband, he says that in South Korea state investment has led to 98% of the population being covered by full-fibre broadband. He says the UK has nothing like that scale of ambition. Now that is changing. Mark it in your diary, he says. It is a historic moment. British Broadband will be a new public service for the 21st century. It will have an infrastructure and a service arm, he says. And he says Labour will begin with the areas with the worst broadband. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is speaking now. He says, whatever the Conservatives throw at them, Labour will continue to be relentlessly positive in the campaign. Labour is costing every spending announcement, he says. But he says the Tory campaign is based on scaremongering. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is speaking now. She says there is clear evidence that rolling out full-fibre broadband will boost the economy. She says one CBI survey said a 10% increase in its reach could increase GDP by 1%. More people would be able to work at home under this plan, she says. And that would be good for the environment. It would also reduce the number of people shut out of the workforce. Corbyn says Labour has a track record of delivering tranformative change. Only Labour can deliver this project, he says. This will be at the heart of Labour’s plans to tranform our society, he says. Corbyn says the initial upgrade will be funded by Labour’s green transformation fund. And, when it comes to running costs, Labour will close down the tax loopholes exploited by the giant multinationals. They think they can get away with not paying their share. Well, I’ve got news for them; not any more. Corbyn says Boris Johnson promised during the Tory leadership contest to make full-fibre broadband available for everyone. But people would have to pay for it. And now we have seen the government’s plans. They involve copper cables that are already out of date, he says. Corbyn says there will be guaranteed jobs for people currently working in the broadband industry. Corbyn says the full-fibre broadband that Labour will deliver is the gold standard. It is the fastest and most secure. It will deliver “lightning fast” download times, he says. The plans will save the average household £30 a month on bills. Only eight to 10% of the UK has access to full-fibre broadband. In South Korea, it is 98%, he says. He says this is essential infrastructure. The best way for this to be provided is for the public to take control of it. Labour will create a new enterprise, British Broadband, overseeing a publicly owned network, delivering full-fibre broadband within 10 years. This will show Labour using public investment to transform the economy. This plan will also have national security implications, he says. The current companies have had little incentive to roll out full-fibre broadband to remote and rural areas. Labour would prioritise those areas. And then it would roll it out in towns. Finally it would complete the roll-out in urban centres. Jeremy Corbyn says at the start of the campaign he promised to put forward the most exciting plan ever seen. The party has not even published its manifesto, he says. When it comes next week, “it is going to knock your socks off”. He says he does not want to lead a government that allows people to think nothing ever changes. Today he is going to give a sneak preview. A Labour government will make broadband free for everybody. And not just any broadband, but the very fastest, full-fibre broadband, to every home in the country. He says, instead of billing customers, he will tax the internet giants such as Facebook and Google “fairly” to cover the running costs. Cat Smith, Labour’s candidate for Lancaster and Fleetwood, is opening the Corbyn event. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech on Labour’s plans for free broadband in Lancaster. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson interview and phone-in with the BBC this morning. Johnson described Labour’s plan for free broadband as “crackpot”. Asked about his own plans for broadband, he said: What we are going to deliver is gigabyte broadband for all and what we won’t be doing is some crackpot scheme that would involve many, many tens of billions of taxpayers’ money nationalising a British business. He claimed that his decision not to publish the report into Russian interference in elections was nothing to do with his having something to hide. When asked if this was why it had not been published, he said that was “absolutely not” the case. He claimed he was just following normal procedures. I see absolutely no reason to change the normal procedures for publishing ISC [intelligence and security committee] reports just because there’s an election. Dominic Grieve, the chair of the committee, has strongly rejected the No 10 claim that the delay in the report’s publication is routine. Johnson claimed there was no evidence of Russia interfering in UK elections. He said: There’s no evidence of that and you’ve got to be very careful before you ... you simply can’t cast aspersions on everybody who comes from a certain country, just because of their nationality. He claimed not to know whether it was true that nine Russian oligarchs have given “serious money” to the Conservative party. Asked to confirm this, he said: “I honestly don’t know.” All donations were legitimate, he said: Frankly, all donations to the Conservative party are properly vetted and properly publicised, and I think all donations to the Conservative party and all other parties are properly vetted and properly publicised. I leave it to your teams of researchers to bring that fact before us - it’s all there in the public domain. He said the government had “got to do better” on the NHS. He declined an opportunity to clarify exactly how many children he has. The BBC’s Rachel Burden told him this was an issue many people raised. She said: Lots of people have been in touch this morning saying, ‘ask the prime minister how many children he has’. That is a question that frequently comes up, just so you’re aware.I think people find it odd that someone who is a public figure can’t answer that question. Johnson said he did not comment on his children. But he told Burden she was wrong to assume that none of his children had gone to state schools. Your assertion that none of my children have been to state school is wrong. That’s all I’ll say. Ed Vaizey, the former Conservative minister for broadband, told the Today programme he thought Labour’s plan for free broadband was “crazy”. He explained: It will end up costing taxpayers a huge amount of money and I suspect it will delay the rollout of superfast broadband hugely. I think they will achieve completely the opposite effect … There’s a difference between government investing strategically where there is market failure – and I’ll acknowledge that in some areas there is market failure – and a wholesale nationalisation of the telecoms network. Australia have tried the sort of nationalisation approach with their broadband network. It’s been a 10-year project, it’s gone three times over-budget from $15bn dollars to $45-51bn dollars, and it’s meant that Australia has dropped down the broadband rankings. Here is my colleague Rajeev Syel’s most recent story about Labour’s plan to provide free broadband, including what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been saying about it in interviews this morning. Jeremy Corbyn is giving a speech on this at 11am, and at the event he will also be taking questions, alongside McDonnell and Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary. We’ll be covering it live. The Sun’s Tom Newton Dunn has also been factchecking the PM. The Labour party has also been conducting its own factchecking scrutiny of what Boris Johnson said in the phone-in. The BBC’s Reality Check team have posted two tweets about Boris Johnson’s Radio 5 live phone-in. Welsh Labour has accused the leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, of using offensive, populist and attention-grabbing language by comparing the oppression of people of colour over the centuries to being Welsh. When he addressed the Plaid conference last month, Price called for the Westminster government to pay its “debts” to Wales. He said: We don’t want anyone’s charity – but reparation for a century of neglect that has left a country, rich in its resources, a bitter legacy of poverty, sickness, blighted lives and broken dreams. And in an interview published on Thursday by the Welsh thinktank iwa, Price said: We had an extractive economy with a political power centre outside of our nation. For most people that is analogous if not identical to the experience of colonialism. The context, of course, is going to be different in every case. The term internal colonialism was invented to describe the experience of African Americans in the United States. In fact, there is a quote from the 19th century where they were referencing our experience – the Welsh inside the British Isles – in order to explain their own experience of internal colonialism. I don’t think you can understand the predicament we’ve been left in without those two salient facts and the interrelationship between the two. Price said there was a “gasp” from the press when he made his remarks at conference and added: “Sometimes, let’s be honest, you have to say very bold things in order to get a response.” On Friday, Welsh Labour’s health minister, Vaughan Gething, called for Price to apologise. He said: Plaid seek to present themselves as a party of tolerance and inclusion. Adam Price’s choice yet again to use the provocative and racially loaded language of reparations is far from tolerant and inclusive. It is deliberately offensive attention-seeking. This isn’t hidden, he brazenly admits it in the interview. He deliberately conflates the oppression of people of colour over the centuries with being Welsh, despite Wales’s own role in that oppression being widespread and well documented. This is shameful. His faux-intellectual posturing is nothing more than Trumpian populism. We cannot allow this poison to take hold in our politics. Q: Your education was not typical. Johnson says he went to the same state primary school as Ed Miliband. Q: But you went to Eton. Can you ever see a time when state schools have the same resources as private ones? Johnson says he wants to level up school spending. Burden asks about Johnson’s own children. They did not go to state schools, did they? Does he have any children who are still of school age? Johnson replies: I’m not going to comment on my children, if that’s all right. Burden says this issue does come up. She says many viewers say they want Johnson to be asked how many children he has. (See here.) Burden does not put the question to him directly, and he does not address it, saying he does not want to talk about his children, but he does say: Your assertion that none of my children have been to state schools is wrong. And that’s it. I will post a summary soon. Johnson says affordable childcare is “the holy grail”. Q: There is a crisis in funding this. And it is women who are disproportionately affected. Johnson says he understands how important this issue is. He will be looking at what the government can do to help. Q: Why aren’t you publishing the report on Russia before the election? Johnson says he sees no reason to change the normal procedures just because there is an election. Q: But it has been cleared for publication by the intelligence agencies. Johnson repeats the point about there being no need to change the standard publication procedures. (Dominic Grieve, the intelligence and security committee chair, has said it is not true to say that it is normal for No 10 to hold up a report like this for weeks. It has happened before, when a reports needs security clearance. But this report was cleared by the intelligence services some time ago.) Q: How many Russian oligarchs donate to the Conservative party? Johnson says those figures are publicly available. Rachel Burden asks about yesterday’s A&amp;E waiting times. She says: Do you feel any sense of shame that the NHS has been brought to its knees by a Conservative government? At this point the caller intervenes, siding with Johnson. She says her personal experience of the NHS has been a good one. Johnson says he knows that the NHS needs more money. And so it would be crazy to waste next year having two referendums. (He keeps coming back to this attack line against Labour, that Labour denies. The party is only planning a single referendum, on Brexit, in 2020.) Johnsons says that when he was mayor of London, the city became one of the safest in the world. The murder rate went down to below 100 a year. Rachel Burden says that was only for a year. Johnson claims it was for several years. Burden says that’s wrong. Here is an extract from a report my colleague Peter Walker wrote in June looking at Johnson’s record as London mayor. Johnson said that as mayor from 2008 to 2016 he “cut the murder rate by 50%”, that knife crime went down, and he credited a rise in police stop-and-search operations with helping reduce crime. The reality is more mixed. The murder rate fell significantly, if not by 50% – from 155 in 2008 to a low of 94 in 2014. It did then start to rise again under Johnson, reaching 109 by 2016. The statistics for total knife offences varied over the eight years, but were only marginally lower at the end – 9,937 in total for 2008-09, against 9,738 for 2015-16. Q: What are the Tories planning for mental health? Johnson says he wants to invest properly in mental health. He wants wraparound care. Q: Would you introduce free broadband? Johnson says what he would not do is introduce “some crackpot scheme that would involve many, many billions of taxpayers’ money nationalising a British business”. Q: Parliament should get us out of the EU. And taking no deal off the table is a mistake. Parliament is not fit for purpose. Oliver Cromwell was right 500 years ago. Good luck to you. Johnson says he agrees. He thinks parliament has been “senselessly” blocking Brexit. And he agrees that the EU has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Listen to what President Macron is saying about creating a banking union and an European army. Macron is a brilliant guy, but this is not what the British want. Johnson says Labour would hold an independence referendum next year. And if Scotland joined the EU, it would have to adopt the euro. Rachel Burden, the presenter, interrupts Johnson. She says she does not want to let him spread “disinformation”. Johnson says Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, has said she does want an independence referendum in 2020. Q: Are you committed to the union? Johnson says he is fully committed to the union. And Northern Ireland will remain part of UK customs territory. He says he takes it “awry” to be lectured on his commitment to the union from Jeremy Corbyn, who for years as actively sided with the IRA. The caller takes umbrage at this. She says in no way is she a Corbyn supporter. She knows full well about his background, she says. Rachel Burden says the BBC has asked customs experts if checks will be imposed on goods going from Northern Ireland to Britain. And the experts say that is not clear yet, because a joint committee will oversee the process. Johnson says, as prime minister, he is saying that there will not be checks. And in the last resort Stormont will have the power to end this arrangements. The caller says Stormont has not been sitting for 1,333 days. Johnson restates his claim that customs checks will not apply to goods being sent from Northern Ireland to Britain under his Brexit plan. This claim is contested, not least because Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, has said “exit summary declarations” will have to apply to these goods. Q: Has anyone from the Conservatives promised anyone from the Brexit party a peerage? No, says Johnson. He ridicules the idea. He says it is on the Telegraph front page. Normally the Telegraph is reliable, he says. (He has been a highly paid columnist for years.) Q: So there have been no conversations with the Brexit party? Johnson says he cannot say that. He says people from rival parties do talk. But no peerages have been offered. Q: What about the Heathrow third runway? Johnson says he thinks the promoters of that project have yet to satisfy the authorities that the project will meet the right standards on access and air quality. These issues are being constested in the courts, he says. Q: My Tory candidate has failed Portishead. But I support your Brexit plan. What should I do? Johnson says he hopes the caller can support the Conservatives. He says there is a slightly “fantastical” proposal on broadband from Labour today. His party has a realistic plan, he says. Johnson says Labour’s plan for free broadband is “fantastical”. Q: Our Tory candidate has promised for years to get a Portishead rail link into Bristol. But it has not been delivered. Can you promise this? Johnson says he cannot promise that route will be reopened. But today the Tories are unveiling plans to reverse the Beeching rail cuts. Was the Portishead line cut as part of those cuts? The caller says yes, it was. Q: Are you fully behind HS2? Johnson says this is a project with the costs mounting. It made sense to review it. Q: Are you fully behind it? Johnson says people deserve to know what his instincts are on this. But when it comes to scrapping something of national importance, “I really do hestitate.” Johnson suggests he is minded not to scrap HS2. BBC Radio 5 live’s Rachel Burden starts. She says she wants to offer listeners as much clarity as possible. Q: [From someone who runs a fish and chip shop] How will you help businesses like mine? Johnson says he loves fish and chips. After Brexit the UK will take back control of its fishing waters. The government will support small businesses. It is putting £2bn into training. And it wants to revitalise town centres too, he says. Q: Many shops feel it makes sense to stay below the threshold for paying VAT. This creates unfairness. It would be fairer if the threshold were reduced. We purchase potatoes, and we get fish from Iceland and Norway. Can you make it more of a level playing field? On VAT, Johnson says he gets the point. He will consider this. He understands the point about firms not having an incentive to stay below the point at which are are liable for VAT costs. Boris Johnson is now about to start taking questions from listeners on Radio 5 live. The phone-in is due to last an hour, and it is being shown on the BBC news channel too. While Boris Johnson was on BBC Breakfast, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, was on the Today programme talking about the Labour manifesto promise to provide free “full-fibre” broadband for every home and business in the UK by part-nationalising BT. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff has full coverage on the business live blog. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, picking up from Jedidajah Otte. Here is some more reaction to Boris Johnson’s BBC Breakfast interview. Full marks to the editor who decided to let Naga Munchetty do the interview. In an interview at Tory conference Johnson said that he did not know who Munchetty was, even though at that point the row generated by the BBC’s decision to reprimand her for commenting on Donald Trump’s racism had been headline news for days. If you detected an edgy undercurrent to the interview, that was why. It got particularly tense when Munchetty started asking Johnson how people can relate to him as a family man. At this point the PM seemed distinctly uneasy, but Munchetty spared him the question he probably dreads the most: how many children do you have? (As far as I know, the only journalists who have asked him this are Jason Groves and Jack Doyle from the Daily Mail, in an interview in July. They did not get an answer. Johnson has four children by his second wife and at least one other, but the question has not gone away because there are rumours he might have another.) Here is some more comment on the interview from journalists. And this is from Piers Morgan, the presenter of ITV’s Good Morning Britain, who is accusing Johnson of another broken promise. The Johnson interview is over now. Here a first reaction from Sky’s Rob Powell: Johnson says he wants every child in this country to have the most amazing opportunities, and that in order to achieve that, Brexit needs to get done. Munchetty says she wants to get a “feel” for who he is. She asks him about his family life, which seems to be an uncomfortable question for the PM. He responds by saying again that he wants every child to unleash their full potential. Why is he relatable though?, he is asked. Munchetty plays a clip of him using a mop in a very awkward way. Has he ever used a mop before, she asks. She says he is very different from most people in this country, that he is privileged. Johnson is now asked whether he has done enough for the flood victims. He says you can never do enough for someone who has suffered in a flooding. Of course there’s always more you can do, he says, but he will make sure that the insurers don’t “weasel out of their obligations” to the flood victims. His government has put far more into flood defence than previous Labour governments, he says, £2.6bn. They move on to migration. Is net migration going to rise and fall under a Conservative government? Johnson says “it’s a great thing” that there are “more EU nationals in the UK than ever before”. Once we come out of the EU, in January, we will take control of our borders, the PM says. When pressed for particular target numbers, Johnson says he doesn’t want to play the numbers game. He says the problem is uncontrolled immigration, and that this is what Labour wants to pursue. He brings up an Australian-style point-based immigration system again. Is a brain surgeon or a porter getting more points? His analysts haven’t decided yet, the PM says. Munchetty is now quizzing the PM on the NHS. Johnson tells a story of how he had to go to Hillingdon hospital last year because of a piece of glass in his foot. He says staff asked for more funding, and that the way to fund the NHS is to have a strong, robust economy. He says a Conservative government will rebuild Hillingdon hospital. What about record A&amp;E waiting times? Munchetty say £20.5bn is the figure for increased NHS funding the Tories have pledged. Johnson retorts that the correct number is £34bn, but seems startled. The PM is quizzed on GP numbers. 272 is the actual increase of GPs achieved last year, Munchetty says, not 5,000 as Jeremy Hunt promised as health secretary. Johnson says Labour wrecked the economy when they were in power. Boris Johnson is now on the BBC Breakfast sofa. Presenter Naga Munchetty says she wants to get clarity from party leaders in these interviews. She kicks off by challenging the PM’s “Let’s get Brexit done” campaign slogan. Brexit won’t be “done” anytime soon, she says, there will be a transition period, and a second phase of negotiation on the future relationship. Boris Johnson responds saying it was parliament that caused the delay, and repeats his standard catalogue of Brexit-related soundbites, taking back control etc. He says if he gets a majority he will try to “get Brexit done by January”, adding he thinks Brexit can “turbo-charge” a one-nation agenda. One problem for Corbyn and McDonnell today will be that BT says that a full-fibre rollout will cost £40bn – double the Labour estimate. This from Neil McRae, the chief network architect at BT: Chris Leslie, who defected from the Labour party to join what is now the Independent Group for Change, tweeted this yesterday evening, for those who missed it. Let’s look at some reactions to Labour’s pledge to roll out free broadband to every household and business over the next 11 years. This from Labour’s David Lammy: And this from the Lib Dems’ Sam Gyimah: Labour peer Andrew Adonis: This from Sky’s Rowland Manthorpe: Hello, I’m taking over from my colleague Kate Lyons. The headlines suggest it won’t be a boring day in politics. Labour’s ambitious free-broadband-for-all pledge via a part-nationalisation of BT by 2030 is already prompting juicy reactions on Twitter. Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell will present further details of this £20bn taxpayer-funded project at a campaign event in Lancashire, and people will be falling over themselves to grill them thoroughly. The event is due to start at 11am, followed by a Q&amp;A. But first McDonnell will be on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and on Sky News at 8.30am. Boris Johnson, who has pledged £5bn to roll out full-fibre broadband to every home by 2025, will be on BBC Breakfast at 8am and BBC Radio 5 Live at 9am. Let’s go! The papers A reminder of what Boris Johnson was up to yesterday as he visited the West Monkton CEVC Primary School in Taunton, Somerset. In the latest instalment of the Guardian’s People and Power series, Aamna Mohdin has written about the way a residents’ Facebook group could swing the seat of Canterbury. Local newspaper editors once controlled the information that circled around a town or small city during an election. But in Canterbury in 2019, that power has fallen into the lap of the 32-year-old administrator of a Facebook group. Edd Withers set up the Canterbury Residents Group on Facebook five years ago in an attempt to bridge the divide between the city’s large student population and its older residents. In a sign of the changing media environment that could shape this election, what started as a community project to bring generations together has turned into a lively and often chaotic rolling political conversation about all manner of issues affecting the city. Of the nearly 100 Canterbury residents who contacted the Guardian about the tight race in their constituency, Withers’ Facebook group was mentioned more than a dozen times. While one resident described it as “a good starting point to find the ‘real’ residents and the issues they are passionate about”, another said they left the group “because of the extreme views and bullying behaviour”. Quite an interesting new campaign video from the Labour team. The drama around deals between parties continues to roil. Nigel Farage has attacked the Conservative party after it was claimed that senior Brexit party figures – including Ann Widdecombe – had been offered post-election roles or peerages as part of an attempt to get him to stand down more candidates at the general election. Farage said it showed “the system is corrupt and broken”. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the day’s political news. I’m Kate Lyons and will be with you on the liveblog for the first hour or so of the day, before I hand over to my excellent colleagues. As usual, you can get in touch with your questions, thoughts, witticisms etc on Twitter or email (kate.lyons@theguardian.com). It’s a big day for promises as both Labour and the Conservatives roll out big-spending, crowd-pleasing election pledges. The Conservatives are offering a package to revitalise neglected towns while Labour is promising free full-fibre broadband for homes and businesses. Boris Johnson says a Tory government would spend hundreds of millions of pounds reviving dying high streets and struggling communities. It includes discounts on business rates, rate relief for pubs, money to reopen train stations and a £150m fund to help groups trying to take over and run pubs and post offices threatened with closure. Labour has criticised the proposal, saying the Conservatives are the ones responsible for destroying high streets and towns through “a decade of vicious cuts to the services that people on our communities rely on”. Meanwhile, Labour is promising free full-fibre broadband for every home and business by partly nationalising BT. Jeremy Corbyn will outline the plan during a speech in Lancaster, saying: “What was once a luxury is now an essential utility.” The plan, estimated to cost about £20bn, will be funded partly by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The Conservatives have criticised the policy, saying it was a “fantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband [that] would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions”. As for what will happen today: Jeremy Corbyn will be announcing his broadband plan in a speech on digital infrastructure in Lancaster this morning. Boris Johnson will launch his campaign bus in Oldham at lunchtime. The Lib Dems go to Leeds where Ed Davey will be giving a speech in the afternoon on economics. And there is a big question mark hanging over the Brexit party’s campaign events. There is meant to be a launch in Dudley for their candidate but it’s unclear if that will go ahead – given the candidate has pulled out of the seat. Join us for the ride!"

          "headline": "Andrew Sparrow's election briefing: Labour's broadband pledge dominates",
          "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn promises free, full-fibre broadband for everyone in the country Labour would deliver it by 2030 by nationalising part of BT, with remote and rural areas of Britain currently getting the worst broadband receiving the new service first. The ongoing cost would be paid for by a new tax on tech giants, with the free broadband saving families on average £30 a month, Labour says. In a speech in Lancaster Corbyn said that only 10% of Britain has access to full-fibre broadband, while in South Korea coverage is 98%. He said this showed how Labour would be using the power of the state to deliver an essential public service. He said: Labour believes that the British people deserve the very best. As a country we should be proud of our history of building treasured public institutions and services. In the 19th century it was the public waterworks. In the 20th century it was our fantastic National Health Service, freeing people from the fear of illness. British Broadband will be our treasured public institution for the 21st century, delivering fast and free broadband to every home. Only the government has the planning ability, economies of scale and ambition to take this on. This is a mission for everyone to get behind. My colleagues Mark Sweney and Patrick Collinson have a good analysis here of how feasible the plan is. Labour’s plans has caused alarm in the City, where it was claimed that the party has massively underestimated the cost of its free full-fibre broadband offer and that the prospect of further nationalisation could halt further investment in the sector. The plan to nationalise Openreach, the broadband division of BT, caused particular shock because until last night Labour had claimed that it had no nationalisation plans beyond its existing commitments to bring rail, energy, water and the Royal Mail back in to public ownership. The BT chief executive Philip Jansen said Labour’s plans would not cost £20bn, as the party claimed, but closer to £100bn. Julian David, chief executive of tech trade association techUK, said Labour’s plans would be a “disaster” for the sector. He said: Re-nationalisation would immediately halt the investment being driven not just by BT but the growing number of new and innovative companies that compete with BT. Boris Johnson dismissed the plan as a “crazed communist scheme”. And the Conservatives sought to play up fears that the Corbyn plan shows that Labour’s nationalisation agenda will turn out to be more extensive than the party admits. But the Tories were also keen to stress their own plans to roll out improved broadband services, and there is likely to be some nervousness in CCHQ about how voters will react to the Labour giveaway. As a retail offer, it is big enough to get noticed – even by a public that seems bored and disengaged from the election. Corbyn’s analysis of the problem faced by the public is sound (Ed Miliband had a very pithy summary here), and ‘people like free stuff’ is not a bad guide to electoral behaviour. But this is a plan that marks an extension of the nationalisation agenda (other services being nationalised by Labour were once in the public sector; broadband wasn’t, because it did not exist in that era), and although voters might easily agree with Corbyn that the broadband service they are getting now is unsatisfactory, whether they think it would be any better under a monopoly state provider is another matter. The Tories claim a similar project in Australia has been a disaster. At this stage it is just too early to know how the electoral politics of this announcement will unfold. Meanwhile Johnson has faced questions about how “relatable” he is during a BBC Breakfast interview. In his encounter with the BBC’s Naga Munchetty, and a subsequent hour-long phone-in on Radio 5 Live, there were also references to the fact that no one even knows for sure how many children he has. Johnson did not seem to enjoy the references to his private life, but he insisted – as he always – that he would not talk about his family, and got through both programmes without significant embarrassment. Johnson has escalated his attacks on Corbyn and Labour, claiming that that Corbyn’s plans are “absolutely terrifying”. In a short speech unveiling his battlebus, he sought to justify this charge with a serious of allegations about the opposition – many of which were partially or wholly untrue. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, has said his party would use regulation to make Britain “the gold standard of climate capitalism for the world”. He also said that the Lib Dems were committed to a £100bn programme over five years to tackle climate change. Police are launching their biggest ever operation to keep election candidates safe from attacks and abuse amid rising concern from politicians about the dangers they face.

          "headline": "Coca-Cola country in southern Mexico – photo essay",
          "bodyText": "To enter the highlands of Chiapas, in southern Mexico, is to enter a world of vibrant indigenous culture, breathtaking natural beauty, entrenched racism and grinding poverty. It is also to enter the territory of Coca-Cola. More Coke is consumed per capita in Mexico than in any other country, and some studies suggest the indigenous communities of the highlands, or Los Altos, may be the soft drink’s most loyal customers on the planet. San Juan Cancuc, a small community in Chiapas known for its consumption of Coca-Cola A Coca-Cola van in the narrow streets of San Cristóbal The signs are everywhere. Red trucks emblazoned with the curly white logo are familiar sights in towns and far-flung villages and on the winding, mist-shrouded mountain roads that connect them. Coca-Cola fridges occupy the most visible spots in most corner shops, while billboard adverts are so widespread they often end up as building materials for the very poor. A celebration in the village of Zinacantán, with dancing, singing, alcohol and soft drinks No gathering to celebrate a birth, a marriage or a patron saint is considered complete without Coke for the guests. Strikingly, Coca-Cola has become an integral part of indigenous religious observance and healing ceremonies, which are often intertwined with the Catholic pantheon but operate autonomously from the church. A bottle of Coke, believed to feed the good spirits and help the sick, is today as central a feature of many public and private rituals as incense, candles and sacrificial chickens. A woman in front of an altar at her home in El Pinar. Coca-Cola has become so intertwined with the local culture that is part of spiritual ceremonies such as this one in Tenejapa. Pascuala is a pulsadora, a type of healer. Several years ago she started using Coke in her ceremonies “Coca-Cola is sweet, so the spirits will appreciate it, and it also has certain healing properties” said Pascuala, a traditional healer from El Pinar. But the intertwining of Coca-Cola with local tradition in Los Altos has contributed to the rise of a health emergency that activists accuse authorities of not taking seriously enough. Type-2 diabetes is now firmly established as the biggest killer in the region, according to a study of death certificates between 2008 and 2012 in three municipalities. Jaime Page, a medical anthropologist who carried out the study, says the government has sought to keep diabetes mortality out of official statistics to avoid looking bad. Other health problems related to excessive sugar consumption, such as tooth decay, are also rampant. “The consumption of soft drinks here is really terrible, and even with diabetics themselves it can seem impossible for them to stop,” Paige said. “I think it might be a lost battle.” Sanando Heridas is a free and itinerant healthcare system for indigenous people. Rosa is pregnant and has comes to check on the baby and her glucose level The story of how Coca-Cola became so deeply embedded in this verdant land of age-old traditions and minimal disposable income goes back to the 1960s when local indigenous leaders, with state backing, began accumulating power in religious, social and economic spheres. This included taking control of the concessions for the distribution of Coca-Cola and, initially, Pepsi too. Paige says this happened at the same time as evangelical churches were making inroads in the area and pressuring indigenous communities to stop drinking alcohol. This combination led indigenous religious leaders to start substituting Coca-Cola for the local firewater, called pox, which they had long used to feed the spirits in their rituals. In the Merced church in San Cristóbal, indigenous people have their own altar where they pray to the Virgin Mary as well as the spirits of nature. Healers at the church use soft drinks instead of the traditional pox, a very alcoholic drink prohibited by the Catholic church The seal of celestial approval not only helped create a belief that Coca-Cola had the power to heal but also fuelled its march to becoming a symbol of social status and good hospitality. On more prosaic terrain, Coke also began to replace a traditional drink made of fermented corn dough, called pozol, which was once the main way peasants topped up their energy during long days in the fields. Today they are much more likely to reach for a sugar-packed soft drink. Fensa, the Coca-Cola plant of San Cristóbal, Chiapas. Coca-Cola’s colonisation of Los Altos was also accelerated by the construction of a bottling plant just outside San Cristóbal de las Casas, the area’s main city, in the 1990s. The plant today supplies much of the south of Mexico, and it has always paid particular attention to the local market. Lunchtime during a celebration in Zinacantán. Marketing strategies have included huge billboards with smiling indigenous models, religious references and slogans written in indigenous languages, as well as the proliferation of points of sale no matter how small the volumes shifted. Marcos Arana, a medical doctor and activist based in San Cristóbal, likens the strategy to drug gangs penetrating deep into communities via large networks of small dealers driven primarily by the need to feed their own habits. Tania, aged three, a Coke drinker, has had four milk teeth removed. Arana says the addiction starts ever earlier. A recent study in an indigenous community found that 15% of children aged one or two regularly drank soft drinks, as did 3% of babies under six months. Soft drinks in a shop in San Juan Chamula. Coca-Cola’s penetration of the market in Los Altos has also been aided by a strategy of charging less in remote rural areas where a Coke in a returnable glass bottle is often scarcely more expensive than bottled water. As in most of Mexico, clean drinking water is not generally available even to those who can count on running water in their homes, which means many turn to soft drinks for basic hydration. The irony of this is clear in an area known for its constant downpours and abundant springs, such as the one that attracted the Coca-Cola bottling company. Local activists say the company has so overexploited the spring that the city of San Cristóbal is now facing water shortages. A small river whose water level has decreased significantly. People collect rainwater in a cistern and store it in plastic bags. A well that extracts fresh water from a volcano basin. The bottling plant has permits to extract more than 300,000 gallons of water a day as part of a decades-old deal with the government that critics say is overly favourable to the plant’s owners. The activists allege this has been possible in part because Coca-Cola has friends in high political places. Between 2000 and 2006 the country’s president was Vicente Fox, a former head of Coca-Cola Mexico. It all adds up to a perfect storm of sugar-related health issues in Los Altos. María del Socorro Sánchez, who is in charge of nutrition at the main hospital in San Juan Chamula, says only about one in 10 of the indigenous patients with diabetes accept there is any need to cut out sugar-packed drinks. “They just don’t believe that it is bad for them,” she said."

          "bodyText": "From a Siberian slackliner who tiptoes across a line slung 100 metres above Lake Baikal to a champion free-diver with seemingly superhuman breath-holding powers, the 2019 Kendal Mountain Festival – taking place this weekend (14-17 November) in the Lake District market town – features extraordinary tales of bravery and endurance. But, among the more extreme stories, there are also tales of the healing power of nature and inspiring stories of women adventurers, older athletes and disabled outdoors lovers. Here are five highlights from the 103 films being shown over the weekend. Next year the film festival will go on tour, with Kendal film nights running in 22 locations from February to June. Bob &amp; Marion Marion Luker (78) and husband Bob (81) have been running marathons for decades. In this inspirational film they talk about why they run – and why they have no intention of stopping. It’s interspersed with footage of them running across Dartmoor’s epic landscape. The Running Pastor Sverri Steinholm is a Lutheran pastor on the Faroe Islands who uses trail running to deal with the challenges of his job. The camera tracks him as he takes on routes through the islands’ wild, rugged terrain. Wild Swim “It’s the closest I can get to my brain being still.” In Wild Swim, Amy Walker talks honestly about how swimming helps her deal with depression and accept her body shape. In the film, shot at Janet’s Foss waterfall in North Yorkshire, she refers to the great joy she finds in cold-water swimming. Climbing Blind This film follows the story of blind climber Jesse Dufton as he prepares to scale a remote Scottish sea stack, the Old Man of Hoy. He leads the climb, with his partner, Molly, following. Eastbound with Jenny Graham Premiering at the festival, this film profiles the endurance cyclist who broke the round-the-world record by more than two weeks in 2018, riding more than 18,000 miles fully self-supported in just under 124 days. Her story is all the more impressive given that she was in her mid-30s before she started endurance cycling. • kendalmountainfestival.com Looking for a holiday with a difference?

          "bodyText": "Today our world is a little freer, a little fairer, and a little more hopeful. Today, one less innocent man is incarcerated in Australia’s detention camp on Manus Island, guilty only of seeking refuge from persecution. Behrouz Boochani was no ordinary detainee. The Iranian Kurdish journalist and author became the voice of Manus detainees, and with it the persistent conscience of us all as we learned of the atrocities committed by the Australian government on its remote Pacific island detention camps. How poignant that he was finally freed to visit Christchurch, a city that knows only too well the violence and suffering borne of prejudice. A city that wrapped its arms so warmly around its refugee community after a terror attack just seven months ago, to heal their wounds and stand for inclusion. Behrouz has said that Christchurch has taught the world about kindness this year. He is also quick to note that the prejudice that leads to violence against refugees is the same that underpins policies allowing cruel treatment of them by governments such as Australia’s. For him, the plight of refugees and displaced persons across the globe right now is connected to the fear-mongering politics of Donald Trump and Scott Morrison. For a Kurdish journalist targeted by the Islamic Republic of Iran, living in the uncertainty of being returned to face torture or imprisonment was no real option. That’s the thing about refugees, our flight is a harrowing necessity. That reality is at the core of the right to seek asylum, recognised by the UN refugee convention and most nation states after the shameful abandonment of Jews fleeing Nazi persecution during the Holocaust. So, policies like Australia’s offshore detention system, or Trump’s caged children, are an attempt to deter those who are already escaping the unthinkable from seeking safety. That was the context for Behrouz’s plight, that remains the source of unfairness. The camps have since been declared unlawful by the United Nations, their conditions being described as amounting to torture by the UN itself and the likes of Amnesty International. But mainstream condemnation would likely not come about without the constant stream of firsthand reporting provided by Behrouz. That he got to walk free on Thursday night in New Zealand was a dream six years in the making. What Behrouz and the 900 or so men with whom he shared his island prison suffered was hardly bearable. He said on Friday that, for the first time, he saw himself as a survivor of Manus Island, because until now he was never sure whether he would make it out. It was never just the violence, never just the lack of hygiene, or the brutal conditions of the centre itself. It was, Behrouz said, the mental torture caused by being deprived of hope. Today, Aotearoa New Zealand gets to stand as a counterpoint to the politics of hate and division on the rise elsewhere in the world.

          "bodyText": "We’re now going to close our live blog, but here are the main political developments of the day: In what might well be the most eye-catching pledge of the election campaign yet, Labour promised free full-fibre broadband for every home and business by part-nationalising BT. The party said the policy, estimated to cost around £20bn, would be partly paid for by high taxes on internet companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. The Conservatives criticised the policy, saying it was a “fantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband [that] would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions”. A string of public figures have declared they will not vote for Labour due to its association with antisemitism. Authors John Le Carré and William Boyd were among two dozen signatories of a letter published in the Guardian which cites fears of effectively surrendering the fight against antisemitism. The Brexit party claimed that senior figures within their ranks including former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe and its candidate in Peterborough Mike Greene were offered post-election roles by the Tories in exchange for stepping aside. The allegations were vociferously denied by the Tories. A spokesman said: “Neither the Conservative party, nor its officials have offered Brexit party candidates jobs or peerages. We don’t do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people.” Jeremy Corbyn said people should be allowed to reunite with their families and stressed the necessity of inward immigration to the UK due to skills shortages. The Labour leader ruled out imposing what he described as “arbitrary” net migration targets after successive failures to achieve them. His comments came after the Home Secretary Priti Patel appeared to retreat from a Tory pledge issued overnight to “reduce immigration overall”. By this afternoon she seemed to water down that commitment (see 3.52pm). Meanwhile prime minister Boris Johnson said he welcomed “people of talent” migrating to the UK but that he was “also in favour of control”. Fake nurse! The Labour party in Wales withdrew a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actor. The Liberal Democrats dismissed suggestions (see 8.53pm) that the party has put itself before the national interest in fielding a replacement candidate in Canterbury (see 7.21pm) and in contesting the South West Hertfordshire seat where pro-Remain former minister David Gauke is running as an independent. Earlier, my colleague Andrew Sparrow summed up the day’s events up until the late afternoon (see 6.06pm). Thanks for joining us, and for all your comments. The announcement, one of the most significant of the campaign so far, is now leading the major news channels. However, Jim Pickard from the Financial Times has rightly highlighted the apparent inconsistency between John McDonnell’s claim in July that the nationalisation of the water companies was “the limit of [Labour’s] ambition when it comes to nationalisation” and the pledge this evening. He had promised in an interview with the Sunday Times that “There are no tricks up my sleeve”, that Labour had no plans to nationalise companies such as BT and would limit takeovers to power networks, Royal Mail, rail and water companies. Nicky Morgan, the outgoing culture secretary, has dismissed Labour’s pledge to provide free Wi-Fi as “reckless” and claimed it was part of an effort to distract from the party’s divisions over Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn’s fantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions. Corbyn is so clearly trying to distract from his party’s divisions on Brexit and immigration that he will promise anything, regardless of the cost to taxpayers and whether it can actually be delivered. What reckless idea will be next? Of course, the policy would indeed technically cost taxpayers billions, but according to Labour it would be delivered without raising taxes for individuals. And here’s some more reaction to the eye-catching policy pledge. A new tax on Big Tech companies including Facebook, Google and Amazon would help fund Labour’s plans to provide homes and businesses with free internet connections, while the part of BT responsible for broadband would also be taken under public ownership. A new British Broadband public service would boost 5G connectivity and deliver fast full-fibre internet across the country, where parts have poor internet connections, the party said. If in government, it would aim to deliver the service at no cost to members of the public by 2030 after integrating the broadband-relevant parts of BT into the new public entity. Jeremy Corbyn will make the announcement in Lancaster on Friday where is expected to describe the new free public service as central to his plans to transform the country and economy. The rollout would begin with communities which have the worst broadband access, including rural and remote communities and some inner city-areas, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then lastly by areas currently well served by super-fast or ultrafast broadband. Labour said it will be paid for through the party’s “Green Transformation fund” and the greater taxation of corporations, adding that it will save the average person £30.30 a month. There would be a one-off capital cost to rollout the full-fibre network of £15.3 billion, in addition to the government’s existing and not yet spent £5 billion commitment. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is expected to say that the plans represented “public ownership for the future” and would challenge “rip-off ‘out-of-contract pricing”. He told the Mirror: We’re dramatically falling behind. The future of our economy has got to be based on the fourth industrial revolution and new technology and artificial intelligence. In some areas it’s quite clear it’s holding back the local economy. We’re falling behind our international competitors when it comes to the roll out of broadband. It’s the basic form of communication and where the jobs will come from in future. In the smaller towns and coastal communities, the same message comes up: we’re being held up by our transport connections and our broadband connections. This will also transform rural economies. Cat Hobbs, director of campaign group We Own It, also told the paper: It’s absolutely clear that privatisation is bad deal for the public purse, and for our public services. We’re wasting billions on shareholder dividends and the higher cost of investment in the private sector. By bringing our services into public ownership, we could use that money to deliver better services for all of us. David Lammy has accused the prime minister of not knowing the words to “The wheels on the bus” after he appeared to initially falter when singing part of the popular nursery rhyme. Boris Johnson mentioned his visit to a school in Taunton during his round up of his day’s exploits only to say that he discussed education funding. Here’s a bit more from the Labour rally in Edinburgh. Holding off from committing to specific new policies, Jeremy Corbyn did not address demands for Scottish independence either. Fundamentally our message is one of social justice, social justice that brings a sense of decency to people’s lives. That is foremost what we would do. Somebody asked me the other day you would like to do when you go into office on December 13. Lots of things, hundreds of things, I could ask all of you what your priority would be and we would probably come up with lots of things different things. I just thought for a second or two, and I thought the thing I would really like to do is use the power of government, the power of office to end rough sleeping homelessness once and for all. He also repeated his pledge that a Labour government would establish a department of employment rights to “guarantee from day one of your employment you have got full rights at work, including the right to join a trade union”. Meanwhile, the SNP’s logo and a slogan saying “Escape Brexit” was projected onto the facade of McEwan Hall in Edinburgh. Brexit party officials are now claiming that senior figures within their ranks including former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe and its candidate in Peterborough Mike Greene were offered post-election roles. In a video directly uploaded to YouTube, party leader Nigel Farage said: They then tried something that borders on corruption. Repeatedly, it’s been suggested to me that I might like a seat in the House of Lords so I can go quietly. Every time this gets said my answer is the same: I’m not for sale. I’m not interested. Knowing they couldn’t buy me off, there was a concerted attempt from people who work deep inside No 10 Downing Street – and I’m not blaming Boris for this, I don’t believe he would be part of this but it shows you the calibre of people he’s got around him, the culture that exists in Westminster. He bypassed me and went to other senior figures in the Brexit party suggesting that eight of them could go in the House of Lords and all they had to do was come to Nigel and convince him to stand down in a whole load more marginal seats. As you can imagine, I said I do not want, and will never have anything to do with, this kind of behaviour. At a rally tonight, Farage has also demanded the House of Lords is abolished to prevent people being “brought off”. And some light relief from the Guardian’s sketch writer John Crace. My colleague Severin Carrell is reporting from a Labour rally in Edinburgh where Jeremy Corbyn has announced the party’s manifesto will be “bigger, better and - I’m not sure I’m pleased to say it - longer than the last one” Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard earlier criticised the Scottish National party for what he claimed was a contradictory position in supporting unity in Europe but division in the UK. However, Nicola Sturgeon predicted earlier today that Corbyn would soon back her call for a Scottish independence vote in 2020 after he appeared to soften a commitment made to journalists on Wednesday that such a referendum would not take place during Labour’s first hypothetical five years in power. Brexit party chairman Richard Tice has hit out at the Conservative party and re-stoked the row (see 4.34pm) over whether the Tories offered “jobs and titles” to his party’s candidates standing in Labour-held seats. Since our decision to stand down more than half our candidates for the good of this country, we have been dismayed by the behaviour of senior Conservative Party figures. Our people have been offered jobs and titles to stand down as candidates on the last day of nominations, as part of a concerted campaign to undermine our party. We made a unilateral gesture which should prevent a second referendum and keep Boris Johnson in office. We are proud and grateful that our candidates have resisted these distasteful overtures and stood firm. A Tory spokesman said Brexit party candidates had not been offered peerages. Neither the Conservative Party, nor its officials have offered Brexit Party candidates jobs or peerages. We don’t do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people. The only way to get Brexit done and unleash Britain’s potential is to vote for your local Conservative candidate, otherwise the country runs the risk of another deadlocked Parliament, or even worse a Labour/SNP coalition led by Jeremy Corbyn who would subject Britain to two referendums in 2020. Earlier, Brexit party candidate Rupert Lowe – the former Southampton FC chairman – announced that he was not going to contest the election in Dudley North for fear of enabling a Labour victory (see 4.46pm). Chuka Umunna, the Liberal Democrat economics spokesperson, has been fielding accusations that his party has put itself before the national interest in fielding a replacement candidate in Canterbury (see 7.21pm) and in contesting the South West Hertfordshire seat where pro-Remain former minister David Gauke is running as an independent. He criticised the party’s former candidate in the constituency, journalist Tim Walker, for acting unreasonably and said there must be “reciprocity” among parties if candidates are to step aside. Let’s take a look at the facts. We want to stop Brexit, we are the UK’s biggest and strongest remain party. We have agreed unprecedented arrangements … I can’t think of any other instance where one of the main parties in the UK has stood aside in an election for other parties in a number of seats. These arrangements can only work where you have a party that is committed to remaining in the European Union. The Labour party has been steadfast in saying it is not a Remain party. But also, if you do these arrangements, there needs to be reciprocity. The problem with what [Tim Walker] did there was that he took a unilateral decision and you operate as part of a team. You are a candidate for a political party. He didn’t consult anybody about that decision. That would be like you [the interviewer] announcing that you’re going to defect to CNN live on air before actually talking to your employers. That’s obviously not a reasonable way to conduct yourself. A string of public figures have declared they will not vote for Labour due to its association with antisemitism. Authors John Le Carré and William Boyd are among two dozen signatories of a letter published in the Guardian which cites fears of effectively surrendering the fight against antisemitism. The Labour party in Wales has withdrawn a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actor. My colleagues Lisa O’Carroll and Pamela Duncan have the story In the film, which was broadcast on Tuesday on the BBC, ITV and S4C, the nurse tells viewers how a trade deal with US president Donald Trump is a threat to the NHS. The actor, dressed in a blue NHS style uniform, told viewers: “We will increase the funding available to our health service. Labour is the party that created the NHS, and we will defend it against Tory attempts to sell it off for parts to Donald Trump.” Labour said it was not aware that the nurse was fake until someone pointed out she was an actor, in contravention of the guidelines for such broadcasts. Plaid Cymru branded the advert “fake” and attacked the Labour party’s record on the NHS in Wales. The Green party in Canterbury has announced it will not stand a candidate in the marginal seat where pro-Remain Labour MP Rosie Duffield is defending a wafer-thin majority against the Tories. It comes after the Liberal Democrat candidate unilaterally stood down yesterday, citing fears of dividing the remain vote despite not trusting Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit. Green Party spokesperson Henry Stanton said: The Green Party - unlike other political parties - places local democracy and local parties at the heart of its operations. In this instance, members voted not to stand a general election candidate... The local party will instead be focussing efforts on campaigning to save the Wincheap wet woodland and water meadows, improve public transport and clean up Canterbury and Whitstable’s dirty air. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was forced to deny losing control over her party on Wednesday after Tim Walker suddenly announced he was standing aside in an article for the Guardian. The party – which came a distant but respectable third in 2017 – swiftly installed an outside candidate, Claire Malcolmson, a councillor in Surrey, to replace him. Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has confirmed her party will run 17 candidates across the 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland, with none of the major parties contesting all seats due to a unionist electoral pact and pro-Remain agreements. Foster also criticised Sinn Fein over the party’s historic decision to not to take up seats in Westminster, which is due to their principled refusal to “validate British sovereignty over the island of Ireland”. This will be a close election. It’s about who has a plan to deliver for Northern Ireland. The DUP has a strong team of candidates who have a plan to get Northern Ireland moving again. We will stand on our record as the only party to have delivered 1.5 billion more to support hospitals, schools, broadband and roads. Real investment in real lives. Sinn Fein want a mandate to do nothing. They won’t take their seats in Westminster and won’t let the other parties form an executive in Stormont. It’s time to get Northern Ireland moving again. This is from PA Media: The Democratic Unionist Party is running in 17 constituencies, standing aside in Fermanagh South Tyrone in support of Ulster Unionist candidate Tom Elliott. Sinn Fein is running in 15 constituencies, and will not field candidates in South Belfast, East Belfast or North Down and will instead support pro-Remain candidates in those seats. Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party will run candidates in 16 constituencies. Alliance is the only political party that is running candidates in all 18 constituencies. At the last election, the DUP won 10 seats and Sinn Fein won seven, along with independent Sylvia Eileen. A total of 102 candidates will contest 18 constituencies across Northern Ireland at this year’s General Election. Nominations closed on Thursday ahead of next month’s polling day. Steve Aiken from the UUP had previously suggested the party would run in all of the region’s 18 constituencies. He later rowed back from that position following pressure in North Belfast and from unionist rivals over standing a candidate against Democratic Unionist deputy leader Nigel Dodds, who is expected to face a tight race against Sinn Fein’s John Finucane. The other constituency which the UUP will not run in is West Belfast, a seat which has traditionally been dominated by Sinn Fein with only a small unionist vote. Aiken also came under pressure for his party to stand aside in South Belfast where the DUP’s Emma Little Pengelly is expected to come under pressure from SDLP candidate Claire Hanna. The Green Party has stepped aside in South Belfast for Hanna due to her Remain credentials. Meanwhile, the SDLP announced it has completed the nomination of the 15 candidates it will run. The party had previously said it was stepping aside in three constituencies in support of other remain candidates. Those are North Belfast, East Belfast and North Down. The Green Party is stepping aside in East, West and North Belfast in support of pro-remain candidates. Of the smaller parties, People Before Profit is running two candidates, the NI Conservative Party is contesting four seats and Aontu will stand candidates in seven constituencies. My colleague Jamie Grierson has debunked the Tories’ claim that net migration would reach 840,000 under a Labour government. The Tories had said its analysis of Labour’s conference proposals suggested net migration could increase to 840,000 a year under Corbyn, but the opposition party dismissed the “fake news from the Conservative party’s make-believe research department”. The Guardian has been fact-checking claims made during the run-up to the general election. Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality party, has responded to the news that O’Mara will not contest the Sheffield Hallam seat. She said his decision was “a victory for women across the country” and endorsed the Liberal Democrats in the constituency. The Women’s Equality Party is the only political party that has won in four fifths of its target seats before a single vote has been cast. WE announced we would be standing against Jared O’Mara to hold him to account at the ballot box, after he publicly admitted sexually harassing a 20-year-old staff member and has yet to face any consequences. He was one of five MPs we targeted and is now the fourth of those men to step down. This speaks to the enormous courage of survivors and campaigners who have spoken out against MPs facing allegations of abuse in this election. Our campaign has made it impossible for parties to continue to ignore abuse and for individual politicians facing unresolved allegations to continue as MPs. O’Mara’s decision is a victory not just for the constituents of Sheffield Hallam but for women across the country. However, this situation should never have been allowed to continue for so long. That’s why the Women’s Equality Party is pleased to be endorsing the Liberal Democrats in Sheffield Hallam in exchange for them taking on our key policies in their manifesto. The changes we are calling for in the Recall Act will give the public more power to sack their MPs, ensuring that constituents never end up in this situation again. Former Labour MP Jared O’Mara will not stand in the general election, as expected, Sheffield Council has confirmed. He famously won the seat from former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg in 2017, and shall not defend the more than 2,000 majority he achieved in Labour’s first ever victory in the constituency since it was established in 1885. Former aid worker Laura Gordon will look to prevent local councillor Olivia Blake from upholding Labour’s majority, while the Conservatives’ Ian Walker will fight the Sheffield Hallam seat for the third time after coming a respectable third at the last election. O’Mara was accused by a junior staffer of sexual harassment after his suspension from the Labour party when a series of sexist and homophobic tweets emerged, written before he was elected. He had said he would be taking time out to deal with his mental health – he has autism and cerebral palsy – after a former aide accused him of being “the most disgustingly morally bankrupt person I have ever had the displeasure of working with”. Please let everyone be assured that I will be tendering my resignation via the official parliamentary process as soon as term restarts. I am not in any fit state to continue and nor would that be appropriate if I was. I reiterate my apology to my constituents, the people of Sheffield and the people of the UK as whole. The European commission has said it is launching “infringement proceedings” against the UK after the government refused to nominate a new British EU commissioner. This news only broke within the last few minutes, and the practical impact will probably turn out to be minimal or non-existent, but in symbolic or headline terms, this is probably a gift to Boris Johnson. For Tory leaders (and some Labour ones too) it has for years been taken as axiomatic that voters like to see their PM in a wrangle with Brussels (a flawed mindset that ultimately contributed to the Brexit vote) and now at last Johnson will be able to perform this role. Being in breach of EU treaties will go down better with his Brexiter base than sending the letter requesting an article 50 extension, something he did last month after promising he never would. In a statement the commission said: As the guardian of the treaties, the European commission has today sent a letter of formal notice to the United Kingdom for breaching its EU treaty obligations by not suggesting a candidate for the post of EU commissioner. The UK authorities have until Friday 22 November at the latest to provide their views. This short time period is justified by the fact that the next commission must enter into office as soon as possible. Following the UK’s reply on 13 November to the two letters sent by president-elect Ursula von der Leyen recalling the UK’s obligations under the EU treaty - and the European council decision of 29 October 2019 extending the article 50 period (1) -, the commission has now analysed this reply and considers that the UK is in breach of its EU treaty obligations. The Conservatives have sought to brush aside new figures showing that A&amp;E waiting times are at their worst level for 15 years. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, claimed this was a byproduct of increased demand, and that the NHS is in some ways “performing better than it ever has”, but for Labour this was essentially a free hit. Labour was placed on the defensive as the Tories launched an attack on its immigration policy. CCHQ issued a press notice claiming that Labour is committed to an open border policy, or “free movement” for the whole world, and that as a result 840,000 people could come to the UK every year. CCHQ also said that, if Labour just maintained EU free movement, average net migration might be 260,000 every year for the next 10 years, or 2.6m in total over the next decade. Interestingly the press notice includes an implicit admission of the Tories’ failure to meet their own immigration target (getting annual net migration below 100,000), because it says 260,000 per year would be a “slight increase” on current immigration levels. The claim that Labour would operate an open border policy is untrue and ludicrous, but Labour has not yet finalised its immigration policy and there is a tension between those in the party who backed a conference “free movement” motion (the Momentum wing, crudely) and those who back immigration controls (the Unite wing, crudely). Jeremy Corbyn has said that he wants an immigration system that is “fair”. Boris Johnson said that he favoured “controlled immigration” and that in some circumstances this would mean net migration levels falling. He said: We want to have a controlled system ... And yes, that may mean in some sectors immigration comes down. Johnson has been accused of refusing to meet members of the public and running scared of protests during a visit to Somerset. The Tories have denied a claim from Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, that one of Johnson’s most senior aides has been offering jobs to his candidates to get them to stand down in Tory target seats. Farage made his allegation as nominations closed, meaning it is now too late for parties to replace candidates who are standing down. After the 4pm deadline one Brexit party candidate in a ultra-marginal seat announced he would not contest the election because he wanted to help the Tories take it off Labour. Jeremy Corbyn has ruled out agreeing to a second Scottish independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government. That’s all from me for tonight. My colleague Mattha Busby is writing the blog now. People should be allowed to reunite with their families, Jeremy Corbyn has said in an interview where he also stressed the necessity of inward immigration to the UK due to skills shortages. The Labour leader told the BBC that policymakers had to be realistic about the issues the country faces, and ruled out imposing what he described as “arbitrary” net migration targets after successive failures to achieve the stated goal. We have to be realistic that in this country we have 40,000 nurse vacancies, we have a great shortage of doctors, we have shortages of many skills, and they cannot be met very quickly because we’re not training enough people, so there’s going to be immigration in the future. Pressed on whether he would rather see the number of migrants in the UK go up or go down, he said: As a point of principle I want people to be able to be reunited and I want British people to be able work across Europe as they are at the present time. Putting arbitrary figures on it as successive governments have done simply doesn’t work. Our immigration strategy is based on fairness, justice and the economic needs of our society, and they are considerable. I have made my case very clear about the value of migration to our society, about the stability of people living in our society, about the horrors of the hostile environment created deliberately by Theresa May, and others, and the uncertainty that so many EU nationals have been put through. I think that uncertainty should finish, they should have guaranteed rights to remain in Britain. The BBC reports that Corbyn said Labour’s eventual migration policy would depend on the outcome of Brexit. The party has, of course, promised a second referendum which could see the UK remain within the EU. I recognise why people voted Remain and why people voted Leave in different parts of the country and for different reasons - in my own communities where I represent and also all across the country. [But] I think that is actually a sensible approach that a very large number of people [have] come to think, well, at least somebody has been grown-up about this. Corbyn’s comments come after the Home Secretary Priti Patel appeared to retreat from a Tory pledge issued overnight to “reduce immigration overall”. By this afternoon she seemed to water down that commitment (see 3.52pm). The prime minister Boris Johnson also spoke to the BBC earlier where he welcomed “people of talent” migrating to the UK but said he was “also in favour of control”. The Labour party in Wales have withdrawn a party election broadcast after it emerged that a nurse featured in the video who criticised the Conservative party was an actress. In the film, which was broadcast on Tuesday on the BBC, ITV and S4C, the nurse tells viewers how a trade deal with US president Donald Trump is a threat to the NHS. Labour said the production company had used an actress without telling them and as soon as it was brought to its attention it withdrew the advert. It will not be working with the company in future, a spokesman said. The deadline for election candidates to be nominated was 4pm today. That means that, if a candidate now withdraws, it is too late for their party to replace them. And, right on cue, Rupert Lowe has announced that, despite being selected as the Brexit party candidate for Dudley North, he is not going to contest the election. Dudley North is a Labour/Tory marginal where Labour won by just 22 votes in 2017. The MP was Ian Austin, who left Labour to sit as an independent and who is now urging voters to back Boris Johnson. In a statement, Lowe says he cannot afford to take the risk of his candidature helping Labour win. In an interview with Sky News Jeremy Corbyn confirmed that the “extend free movement” motion passed at conference would not necessarily be included in full in the party’s manifesto. The party’s manifesto policy on immigration (and everything else) would be decided at a Clause V meeting of the party this weekend, he said. He went on: The conferences passes motions, and that is absolutely fine. The meeting that’s held this weekend will decide what actually goes in the manifesto, which is not necessarily every last dot and comma of every resolution passed at conference. Tory sources are dismissing the Nigel Farage claim (see 4.20pm) as rubbish and “typical Farage attention-seeking”. They may say something more specific later. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, claims Sir Edward Lister, Boris Johnson’s chief strategic adviser in No 10, has been calling Brexit party candidates offering them jobs if they stand down in target seats. I’ve asked the Tories for a comment, and will post their reply when I get it. UPDATE: Tory sources are dismissing the Nigel Farage claim as rubbish and “typical Farage attention-seeking”. They may say something more specific later. On the BBC’s World at One Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that increasing demand was to a large extent responsible for A&amp;E waiting times in England being at their worst level for 15 years. Over the last five years the number of people going to A&amp;E had risen by a quarter, he said. “Parts of the system are responding extremely well,” he insisted. He went on: In terms of getting operations done, there’s been a 7% rise, so when people talk about the performance of the NHS, in many ways the NHS is performing better than it ever has. Jonathan Ashworth, his Labour shadow, said Hancock’s response was “staggering”. According to the BBC’s Norman Smith, Priti Patel, the home secretary, did eventually confirm that the Tories went to reduce immigration in her broadcast interview. (See 3.52pm.) Boris Johnson labelled climate change protesters “crusties” after security concerns forced him to change his election campaign visit to a bakery, the Press Association reports. Extinction Rebellion activists were positioned outside Burns The Bread in Glastonbury, Somerset, prompting a decision to divert the prime minister to one of the company’s shops in Wells. At the shop in Wells Johnson commented on the change in plan, saying: “There were lots of crusties there - more crusty than your loaves.” In a press notice overnight Priti Patel, the home secretary, said the Conservatives would “reduce immigration overall”. But in an interview this afternoon she has appeared to back away from that pledge, according to the BBC’s Callum May and Norman Smith. Scottish Labour strategists have armed Jeremy Corbyn with data on the numbers of people giving disability payments for mental illness and child poverty for each of the Westminster constituencies he has visited in Scotland. In an effort to switch the agenda from the harder territory of Brexit or Scottish independence on to core topics such as poverty, party officials have mined official data to produce fact sheets for Corbyn and Labour candidates to use in campaigning. Corbyn’s two-day trip to Scotland, taking in key seats in Glasgow, Hamilton, Uddingston, Dundee and West Lothian, has been short on new policies but heavy in incident. He has been heckled by opponents, and tripped himself up on party policy on a Scottish independence referendum. But addressing the small crowds and audiences which gather at campaign stops, Corbyn reels off data on local poverty levels. Speaking at Newtongrange Scottish mining museum in Midlothian on Thursday, where Labour’s Danielle Rowley won a shock victory in 2017, he lambasted the Conservatives and Lib Dems for their “political choice of imposing austerity on the whole of the UK … Nine years later we see the result of it.” He said: In a constituency like this, which has almost 5,000 people in receipt of personal independence payments, almost 40% of those get it for what’s called ‘psychiatric disorders’ – in reality it’s mental health stress. When you have so many people suffering from mental health stress: then you ask yourself, why is that? Is it just one of those things, or is it because of insecurity in their lives? Insecurity in housing, insecurity in the private rented sector, poverty at home. Why are so many children living in poverty in this area? Why are 25% of the population in this constituency in fuel poverty? Are any of these things necessary? Why are 8,000 children living in poverty? Is any of this necessary? No. These are from Sky’s Lewis Goodall, who has been out on the campaign trail. The Lib Dems published a plan for equalities and human rights at a new event this morning attended by Sal Brinton, the party president and two Lib Dem candidates who have joined from Labour, Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna. This is from the Jewish Chronicle’s Lee Harpin who was there. Boris Johnson has an update on the flooding. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has been tweeting about Labour’s stance on free movement. She confirms - as the party was saying earlier, see 9.45am - that Labour is not treating the “extend free movement” motion passed at conference in September as referring to maintaining free movement for everyone from EU countries after Brexit. It referred to “free movement rights”, she says. But the Conservatives continue to clam that Labour actually go much further. Following up on the press release issued overnight (see 9.45am), Priti Patel, the home secretary, has released an open letter to Abbott saying party figures have consistently called for looser immigration rules. Patel quotes John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, saying in 2013: “If we’re a civilised society, we should have open borders ... It should be a basic human right.” But, of course, McDonnell wasn’t shadow chancellor in 2013. At that point he was just a backbencher. My colleague Paul Johnson has detected something of a pattern in Boris Johnson’s walkabouts around the country. The Brexit party leader Nigel Farage says he does not expect to vote in the general election. According to the Press Association, there will be no Brexit party candidate in the Tory-held Kent seat where he votes (presumably Sevenoaks, where he had his family home), and he does not want to vote Conservative. He told reporters: “I doubt I’ll vote. I very much doubt I’ll vote.” Asked whether he had ever not voted before, he replied: I did spoil a paper in 1992. I couldn’t vote for John Major, I couldn’t do it. My last Conservative vote was 1987. The BBC’s Alex Forsyth has more on Boris Johnson’s Glastonbury no-show. (See 1.56pm.) There were lively scenes in Glastonbury as Boris Johnson dodged a crowd of protesters at a bakery in a business park on the outskirts of the Somerset town. Word got out that Johnson was on his way and a crowd of about 100 – including Extinction Rebellion protesters, musicians and even a bard – turned up to greet him at the Burns the Bakery unit. It got tense when the police moved the crowd away from the front of the bakery on to a grass verge close to a busy road. Tory supporters including James Heappey, the party’s candidate in Wells, waited at the bakery for Johnson for more than an hour, but he did not show. There was no explanation, leading to frustration and anger from those who had hoped to express their concerns about issues ranging from the climate emergency to the state of the NHS and pensions to the PM. Retired NHS manager Martin Campbell said: “He’s running scared. He doesn’t want to talk to ordinary people about the issues that affect us all.” At one point a rumour went round that Johnson was in Glastonbury high street, leading to a dash from Burns the Bakery into the town but there was no sign there. A video clip later appeared on Johnson’s Facebook page of him serving a customer at a Burns the Bread shop, though not at either of the company’s two branches in Glastonbury. In an interview this morning in Scotland Jeremy Corbyn said he rejected the claim from Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, that Britain will become a “second-rate player” if it leaves the EU. Asked if he agreed, he replied: No I don’t think we are ever going to be a second-rate player. This is a big country, an important country and trading partner and I look forward to leading a government that will be working with others around the world. [Tusk] makes many statements at many times and he is the president of the EU and, yes, he can make those statements and I look forward to discussing them with him. HuffPost’s Paul Waugh has got hold of a briefing note from Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour group, advising activists how to respond to awkward questions on the doorstep. We have received a briefing from the monarch of UK psephologists, Prof Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University, about what might happen in the election, and the short version is this: while there are many imponderables in play, it seems a toss-up between a Boris Johnson majority and a hung parliament. Curtice said it was “pretty much a binary contest” between the two. And what of a Labour majority? The answer will not be welcomed by Jeremy Corbyn: The chances of a Labour majority are as close to zero as it is possible to be. He said the issues for Labour included Corbyn’s personal unpopularity with voters (although he also noted that Johnson was “the most unpopular new prime minister in polling history”), and the fact that they had lost both remain and leave votes through a middle-ground approach to Brexit. Curtice said: Where they have demonstrated Blairite moderation is the one issue on which you shouldn’t demonstrate Blairite moderation, as it won’t get you anywhere. The current Tory lead of about 10 percentage points would most likely be enough for Boris Johnson, Curtice said. With a 10-point lead, however you look at it, if that was to transpire in the ballot box it would be highly likely the Conservatives would win a majority of a size that would be sufficient to get the withdrawal treaty through. But given the likelihood the Tories will lose a “fair chunk” of seats in Scotland and to the Lib Dems, Johnson needed to keep the lead above about six or seven percentage points: If it get below that, the odds are beginning to swing in favour of a hung parliament. So be aware: just because the Tories are ahead in the polls, it doesn’t mean to say that Boris is going to get a majority. The key battle in northern Tory target seats, he said, would be for the Conservatives to hang on to gains made by Theresa May in 2017, and for the Lib Dems to take seats from Labour. Curtice said: “Boris Johnson would love the Liberal Democrats to go up.” The one exception to the binary end point, he noted, would be the very particular result where the Tories won 320 or so seats, just below a working majority, and the DUP held the balance. With the Northern Irish party wanting neither to support Corbyn or back Johnson’s Brexit deal, this could bring a new deadlock. According to the Press Association, which had a pool reporter accompanying Boris Johnson when he visited West Monkton primary school, near Taunton, Johnson held Rosie the rabbit and sang songs with pupils. The PM then suggested singing The Wheels on the Bus, remarking: “The wheels are staying very much on the bus.” According to PA, Johnson asked a separate group of pupils for their favourite book before asking: “Have you got the Incredible Hulk? That’s the one I like.” In a newspaper article in the autumn Johnson famously compared himself, or the UK as a whole, to the Incredible Hulk. Then he ended up talking about breasts. As PA reports, while looking at a Hulk book, one pupil shouted “boobies” to which the PM replied: “Those aren’t boobies, they are muscles.” While Johnson was inside the school, chants of “Boris out” could be heard outside, where Labour, Liberal Democrat and climate change activists were gathered. Jeremy Corbyn is now saying that he would not agree to a Scottish independence referendum in the first two years of a Labour government - which would rule out one being held in 2020 or 2021. This is a change from what Corbyn was saying at one point yesterday, when he was ruling it out for the entire five years of a Labour government, although the party subsequently said it would be open to one after the Holyrood elections in spring 2021 (which, given the amount of time preparing for a referendum might take, would be close to saying 2023 at the earliest). In response, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has posted this on Twitter. My colleague Steven Morris says it is starting to look as if Boris Johnson might be giving Glastonbury a miss after all. Boris Johnson is due in Glastonbury shortly. According to my colleague Steven Morris, who is there, not everyone wants to give him a warm welcome. Here is some footage of Jeremy Corbyn being confronted by a heckler at a meeting in Dundee. (See 10.53am.) According to the Press Association, the heckler later identified himself as Bob Costello, a former SNP activist. It is often assumed that being heckled reflects badly on a politician, but it is hard to watch this and think that Costello emerges with much credit. “Is this democracy?” he shouted at one point, during his prolonged interruption of proceeding. Corbyn replied: The democracy is that we have a public meeting where we conduct it in a reasonable manner, and those who wish to say something at the end are of course free to do so. Democracy is not when you interrupt somebody when they are speaking. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, had to delete a tweet this morning saying he would be “live from South Yorkshire” when he was in Hull. Hull is in East Yorkshire, as he subsequently acknowledged. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has pledged to revoke article 50 on day one of her premiership if she is elected to Number 10. Speaking to the PA news agency on a visit to the Guru Nanak Sikh temple in Glasgow, she said: The Liberal Democrats have been very clear - we want to remain in the European Union. We are an internationalist party and so a Liberal Democrat majority government would revoke article 50 on day one. She also stressed her opposition to a second referendum on Scottish independence. I want Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom for very much the same reasons I want the United Kingdom to stay in the European Union. We work better when we are closely together with our nearest neighbours, where we share values and we share economic interests. So I want Scotland to stay in the UK, I do not want another independence referendum, Liberal Democrats will not support indyref2. Here is the full quote from Nigel Farage alleging that Tories have been using underhand methods to try to persuade Brexit party candidates to stand down. He did not give any specific examples, and he did not say where this was happening, or who was responsible, but it was clear that he was claiming that this pressure was coming from Conservatives. Farage said: What is going on right now is nothing short of disgraceful. There is a full-scale attempt, going on out there as I speak, to stop men and women, freely, putting themselves up before the UK electorate. You would have thought this was Venezuela. And that is what is happening. Our people, men and women – much like these on the platform here – who put themselves forward are now coming under relentless phone calls, email and abuse, and being told they must stand down. That is happening in 21st Britain. I think that is a complete and utter disgrace. The battle for Scotland’s anti-Tory vote between Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon became bitter and personal on Wednesday evening after the Labour leader accused Sturgeon of “being willing to usher in another heartless Conservative government”. The two clashed on Twitter after Corbyn’s two-day campaigning visit to Scotland got off to a rocky start, when he had tied himself in knots over Labour’s referendum policy. He first ruled out backing one for a full five-year term, before retracting that after being corrected by his aides to say Labour would not support one for the first few years. He simultaneously rejected Sturgeon’s calls for a “progressive alliance” to defeat the Tories, insisting it was “their choice” whether to back Labour or allow the Tories to regain power. Sturgeon retorted that Scottish National party MPs would only support a minority Labour government if it allowed Holyrood to stage a fresh independence referendum at a time of its choosing. Sturgeon wants one next year. Corbyn retaliated by tweeting back footage from 1979, when SNP support for a vote of no confidence helped topple James Callaghan’s Labour government, allowing Margaret Thatcher to win her first general election and heralding 18 years of Tory government. The SNP leader hit back by accusing Corbyn of “desperate stuff”, pointing out she was in primary school in 1979. The SNP had tabled a no-confidence motion after Callaghan’s government decided not to introduce devolution to Scotland as the 1979 devolution referendum required 40% of all Scotland’s voters to say yes. After a low turnout, that threshold was not met. With backing too from the Liberal party, Thatcher tabled an early day motion stating the house had no confidence in Callaghan’s government which went to a vote. Along with unionist MPs from Northern Ireland, the SNP’s 11 MPs voted against Labour, which lost the motion by one vote. Those events are engrained in Labour folklore as proof of the SNP’s dishonesty about opposing the Tories. With the polls showing Labour support as low as 12% in Scotland, they face another wipeout on 12 December and are desperately trying to mobilise disillusioned and apathetic Labour voters. Scottish Labour’s Facebook page features film of Ian Lavery, the party chairman and a former National Union of Mineworkers president, insisting a minority Labour government would challenge the SNP to vote down its budget, including £70bn extra spending for Scotland, rather than agree a deal. He concluded: “Let the SNP decide whether they want to accept that or not. Let them decide whether they want to stick their fingers up at the Scottish people.” Farage says in September he offered to work with the Tories on a “leave alliance”. That could win an 80 or 100-seat majority. But the Tories were not interested, he says. He claims this shows the Tories are putting party before country. Here is one of the Farage quotes. Farage says if his candidates get to Westminster they will not be “good little boys and girls”. They will fight for Brexit. He cannot understand why people think it makes sense for the UK to be shackled to 15% of the world’s economy, he says. Farage says the Tories have not been grateful for his decision not to stand candidates in Tory-held seats. Instead, all that the party has had from the Tories has been “wall to wall abuse”, he says. And he claims something “disgraceful” is happening that the audience do not know about. Brexit party candidates are coming under relentless pressure to stand down. They are getting phone calls, emails and abuse, he says. Farage claims, again, that Boris Johnson signalled a “marked change of direction” in a video he posted on Twitter on Sunday about Brexit. (Actually, he didn’t.) Farage says he would be happy with a Canada-style trade deal, or a no-deal Brexit. Under either option, the UK would not be bound by EU laws. Farage says the Tories are today talking about reducing immigration. “Are you having a laugh?” In the last three elections they have promised this, but failed, he says. Farage says democracy only works if you have losers’ consent. The losers must accept the result of the election, he says. He says the Brexit party will fight Labour in every seat in this country. Farage says the audience probably used to think they lived in a 21st century democracy. But all the promises made by politicians have not been delivered, he says. He claims Labour think people did not know what they voted for. Labour wants people to do it all again. Labour is treating voters with contempt, he says. In May the highest Brexit party vote came in areas with the most Labour MPs, he says. He says Labour is now more about Hoxton than Hull. In Labour areas there is no enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn, he says. He claims many Labour voters will stay at home. That gives the Brexit party a phenomenal opportunity, he claims. Nigel Farage is speaking at the Brexit party event. He is in Hull, and he says this is Brexit country. He says the Brexit party reset the political agenda when it was set up earlier this year. Its success in the European elections led to the removal of Theresa May as prime minister, he claims. He welcomes Michelle Dewberry to the party. At the Brexit party event Michelle Dewberry is speaking now. A former winner of the TV reality show The Apprentice, Dewberry is the Brexit party’s candidate in Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle. Maybe this is the “big announcement” the party promised earlier. (See 10.15am.) Dewberry stood as an independent, pro-Brexit candidate in the same constituency in 2017. She says in this campaign it seems as though wanting to speak up for the north has become trendy. But for years the north has been neglected by Westminster, she says. She says Brexit will allow the UK to decide how the country should be run. There should be deeper devolution, she says. She says she is tired of having the north treated “as an afterthought”. This has to stop, she says. She says politics is broken. There has been a lot of talk of tactical voting. That shows the system does not work. Parliament should truly reflect the desires of the people. First-past-the-post does not achieve that. She says the Brexit party wants constitutional reform. She also rejects the claim that by standing in Hull West and Hessle (a seat Labour held in 2017 with a majority of 8,025) she is splitting the pro-Brexit vote. Every person can use their vote way they wish, she says. The Brexit party event flagged up earlier (see 10.15am) has just started. Nigel Farage, the party leader, is due to speak soon, but at the moment David Bull, a doctor and Brexit party MEP, is speaking. One in six patients waited longer than four hours in A&amp;E in England during October – the worst-ever performance since a target was introduced in 2004, according to official data released this morning. In response Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said these figures showed why the NHS needed Labour’s £40bn rescue plan. He said: The Conservatives have ushered in the worst NHS crisis on record. Under Boris Johnson the NHS is in crisis and we’re heading for a winter of abject misery for patients. Our A&amp;Es are overwhelmed, more so than ever. In every community there’s an ever growing queue of people waiting for treatment. In his response Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said almost nothing about why the figures were so bad, but instead just attacked Labour. He said: With rising demand, and with dedicated staff already working exceptionally hard, the last thing our NHS can afford is Labour’s plans for a four-day week and uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, which would cripple our health service – leaving it understaffed and underfunded. It is not true to say that Labour is planning uncontrolled and unlimited immigration. (See 9.45am.) Labour is finding it harder to explain how the NHS would absorb the possible costs of its plans for a 32-hour working week (the Times has splashed on the issue today), but, as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, explained at a news conference yesterday, this is a 10-year aspiration, not something to be introduced immediately, and the idea is that productivity increases will make it affordable. Here is an explanation of the Labour 32-hour working week plan. It may feel to some of us as if the election campaign has been going on for ages, but on the Today programme this morning Deborah Mattinson, the pollster and public opinion specialist, issued a healthy corrective. Most members of the public are not yet taking any notice, she said. She told the programme: One of the things to bear in mind is that nothing much is landing from this campaign at the moment anyway. There was a poll this week saying 42% of people had picked up nothing. I asked people in a focus group yesterday: ‘What have you heard since the campaign began?’ And literally they all looked at me blankly. Mattinson said it was only in the last fortnight of the campaign that non-committed voters would start to take an interest in what was going on. Jeremy Corbyn was heckled by a supporter of another Scottish independence referendum as gave a speech this morning at the Queen’s Hotel in Dundee, PA Media reports. The report goes on: On the second day of his Scottish tour, Corbyn was interrupted by a shouting member of the audience who asked him what he planned to do about the “will of the Scottish people”. The man shouted: “Is this democracy?” Corbyn tried to quieten him, saying: “It’s perfectly democratic when we listen to each other, so I’ll listen to you in a moment.” “Take your hands off me,” the heckler shouted as people grabbed him. He was then ejected to the cheers and claps of the audience. Boris Johnson began campaigning in a rainy south-west by visiting a school, the Press Association reports. Pupils at West Monkton primary school, near Taunton, welcomed the prime minister who was accompanied by Rebecca Pow, the Conservative candidate seeking re-election for Taunton Deane. In the overnight Conservative party press notice about immigration Priti Patel, the home secretary, restates her commitment to introducing an “Australian-style points system so what we can control our borders”. What do you think David Cameron, the former Tory prime minister, thinks of that? Apart from a low-key day of canvassing in Reading West, he does not seem to have played a role in the election so far, and it would be surprising if he were to start giving interviews criticising his successor. But on this issue we know what he thinks, because he covers it in his revealing and extremely readable memoir, For the Record. Writing about the Brexit campaign, he says: By the time we got to June, referendum month, Boris [Johnson] and [Michael] Gove were pledging to introduce an ‘Australian-style points-based immigration system’ before the next general election if Britain voted leave. Quite apart from the fact that we already had the equivalent of a points system (clear categories for immigrants, with some channels such as unskilled labour from outside the EU set at zero), our system was tougher than Australia’s, and our level of immigration much lower. From the Brexit party I don’t know what that will be about, but we’ll tune in ... In his Today interview Brandon Lewis, the security minister, said wealthy Russian businessmen had an “absolute right” to donate to the Conservative party if they were British citizens. Admitting that he had received donations from prominent Russians himself, he said: I have had donations from Lubov [Chernukhin] and also Alexander Temerko, as has the Conservative party. They are British citizens, they are prominent British businesspeople as well - Alexander himself has invested in the renewable energy industry in the East of England. So British citizens have the absolute right, as any other British citizen does, to invest in and be part of the British political scene, and I think it’s wrong to accuse them of anything else. It is interesting that CCHQ put up Brandon Lewis, a Home Office minister, to give interviews this morning defending what is the Conservative party’s overnight attack line against Labour - the claim that average net immigration would rise to 840,000 a year under Jeremy Corbyn – and not his boss, Priti Patel. Patel, the home secretary, is very popular with with rightwing Tories and Brexit party supporters, but she is not one of the cabinet minister most skilled at dealing with forensic questioning. Here is the extract from the Conservative news release explaining how the party justifies its claim. (Bold type in the original document.) New analysis released today, using official figures and based on HM government’s own methodology reveals: Maintaining free movement with existing EEA members would result in average net immigration to the UK of 260,000 per year over the next 10 years. This is equivalent to a city the size of Brighton moving to the UK every year. Labour’s policy of maintaining EU free movement would lead to 2.6 million more people moving to the UK over the next 10 years. This scenario is a minimal interpretation of Labour’s policy and represents a slight increase based on current immigration levels. Extending free movement to the rest of the world would result in average net immigration to the UK of 840,000 per year over the next 10 years. This is equivalent to the combined populations of Manchester and Newcastle moving to the UK every single year. This means that levels of net migration would more than treble if Labour introduced their proposals for completely open borders. This analysis is deliberately cautious and is likely to provide a significant underestimate of net inflows from non-EEA countries under Labour’s plans. This claim is that it is based on a motion passed at Labour party’s conference. But there are two problems with citing it as evidence that Labour would allow annual net immigration to rise to 840,000 a year. First, the wording of the motion was very generalised (the full text is here), and it was not clear what it would mean in practice. And, second, Labour is only committed to implementing policies in its manifesto, not motions passed at conference. Today Labour is arguing that, when the conference motion demanded a manifesto pledge to “maintain and extend free movement rights”, this was not a reference to allowing non-EU nationals to come and live in the UK freely. “There was no mention [in the motion] of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries,” a party source said. Instead this was a reference to extending the rights that already apply to British citizens and others with the right to live in the UK, for example by making it easier for spouses to join them, the source argued. This may be a fair way to interpret the motion passed by Labour conference, but this is not a point that the party made particularly forcefully at the time. Today Labour has dismissed the Tory claims as “fake news”. In a statement Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: This is more fake news from the Conservative party’s make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories we won’t scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them. What is true, though, is that Labour has yet to say what its immigration policy would be. Jeremy Corbyn and others have said things that imply that they would like to keep free movement for EU nationals after Brexit, but during the campaign Corbyn has tended to sidestep questions about what Labour’s exact policy will be, saying details will be given in the manifesto. But Labour does want to negotiate a soft version of Brexit with the EU, keeping the UK aligned to the single market, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has admitted that negotiating this would involve a negotiation about whether or not the UK would maintain EU free movement rules. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Brandon Lewis, the Home Office minister, is now being interviewed on Today. He was talking about flooding on ITV’s Good Morning Britain earlier. (See 8.23am.) He accepts that the Tories have let people down in the past by failing to hit their target of getting net migration below 100,000. But he claims that was partly due to the Tories being in coalition with the Lib Dems from 2010 to 2015. Q: Which immigrants would you allow? And don’t just say the brightest and the best. Lewis says the migration advisory committee would advise the government on this issue. The government has to look at this methodically, he says. It would take the MAC’s advice. Q: You claim there would be surge of migration under Labour. But this claim is based on a motion passed by the Labour conference that won’t be in the manifesto. Lewis says the Tory claim is also based on what Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell has said. He says the Tory claim that Labour could end up allowing more than 800,000 migrants into the UK per year is an understatement. The shadow employment secretary, Laura Pidcock, has dismissed immigration targets as “arbitrary”. Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Pidcock said: We know actually that migrant labour does not undercut wages, it is exploitative bosses that seek to undermine national agreements – that’s our emphasis. Questioned on whether she would be happy for immigration to rise under a Labour government, Pidcock added: “I think these targets are arbitrary.” When pushed on comments in the Guardian by the leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, more free movement, Pidcock said: It isn’t right that we place the blame on numbers of immigrants for wages. Actually those employers that seek to undermine those national agreements are to blame for the exploitation. And he [McCluskey] talked about stricter regulations and that is what we are proposing. Pidcock added: “I think it’s a false flag, this issue of immigration.” She then accused the media of “mischaracterising” McCluskey. Pidcock said: What you are actually doing is mischaracterising Len McCluskey as some kind of false division in the Labour party. He is the leader of the trade union that I am a member of, he talked very clearly about there not being an environment where national terms and conditions can be undermined by exploitative bosses. Pushed again on whether she is in favour of extended free movement rights, as was voted for at the Labour party’s conference, Pidcock added: I am in favour of making sure there are conditions where no worker, whether they be British or a foreign worker are exploited in this country, because that is the real issue. The issue is not about migrant labour, the issue is about what kind of legislative environment we have for workers, and we will create one where all workers are protected. Pidcock also hit back at the CBI’s claims that Labour’s pledge to sanction businesses who cannot prove that they are working to remove their gender pay gap is “adding bureaucracy”. She said: We don’t want employers, and some do, to see this as a tick box-exercise where they look and say: ‘OK we do have a gender pay gap, and we’ve written down that we do, but we’re not going to do anything about that.’ There has to be proof of how they’re working to close that gap, and if there’s absolutely no proof as to how they’re working towards the elimination of that gap then there will be some form of sanction. The security minister, Brandon Lewis, has defended the prime minister’s refusal to apologise over the government response to the floods in Yorkshire and the east Midlands. Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Lewis, a former floods minister, was played clips of Boris Johnson being heckled about his response to the flood and why he had refused to say sorry. Lewis said: “Obviously, it’s not the PM’s fault that there’s been a flood.” He also suggested Johnson had held back from visiting flood-hit areas because he didn’t want to hamper the clean-up operation. He said: Sometimes when a big group of politicians and the media turn up, they get in the way and they distract people from doing the job. The prime minister was able to visit when it’s right, not distracting from the core work of getting people’s lives back together as quickly as possible. Lewis was challenged on why Doncaster, one of the areas worst hit by the floods, has had its funding cut by 50% since 2010. He defended the government austerity policy. He said: We had such a dreadful economic situation back in 2010 that we inherited that we had to reduce spending so the country could get back gradually to living within its means. Local authorities are a huge part of the public sector expense. And if it was right that they played their part and there was a lot of efficiencies we could find. Asked if he was claiming that 50% of Doncaster budget was being wasted, he said: The 50% [cut] refers to just one part of their budget. It doesn’t include the council tax and other income they get. So it not a 50% cut overall. When we have a situation like flooding, that’s why we have what’s called the Bellwin scheme and that’s something that kicks in to take on in this kind of natural disaster. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, has rejected pressure to withdraw more of his candidates in Labour or Liberal Democrat seats. Speaking to Today, on the day when nominations for candidates close, he said: We’re going to fight 300 seats and that’s exactly what we’re going to do. The job of the Brexit party is to hold him [Boris Johnson] to account, because too many times over the last three years the Conservatives have made promises and not delivered. He also criticised the Conservatives for refusing to do a deal with the Brexit party in Labour seats. “I’ve realised that the Conservatives want a Conservative majority in parliament, not a Brexit majority in parliament.” He added: There are very clearly seats in which we are the lead challenger and their are other seats in which they are the lead challenger to Labour, and we could have done a deal on that basis, but the priority for the Conservative party, they do not want the Brexit party to get seats in parliament. They’d rather risk not winning the election than having a leave majority, a leave alliance. He also criticised his old ally Arron Banks, who urged him to withdraw more candidates. Farage said Banks was suffering from “Brexhaustion”. And he claimed the election would be decided by tactical voting. Farage said: I’m going to go out around the country saying to Labour voters: ‘You are being let down badly, betrayed by the Labour party who now want you to vote again.’ And the same for Conservative voters: in seats that the Conservatives have never won in 100 years, your best chance of getting Brexit is to get us in there and hold Boris Johnson to account. And ultimately this election will be decided by tactical voting decisions all across the country. Luciana Berger, the Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for health and social care, has defended the party’s insistence on putting up a candidate in Canterbury despite the previous candidate decision to stand aside in favour of Labour. Berger, who defected from Labour earlier this year, conceded that the Labour candidate’s, Rosie Duffield, is “a very lovely person”. But speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme she added: I know her very well personally, but she’s campaigning to put Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. This comes down to the choice who’s going to be our next prime minister at this general election. Berger pointed out that Labour had refused to take part in cross-party talks on a remain pact. She said: I wish the Labour party would have been involved in the unite to remain discussions. They had ample opportunity to do so but they refused to engage. One of the most senior members has said that the Labour party is not a party of remain. And if people want to party remain at this election, they have to vote for the Liberal Democrats. The papers Matthew Weaver brings us one of the more disturbing stories of the day. Boris Johnson dropped a reference to “onanism” from an election campaign speech after previews of the text drew criticism from the opposition. On Tuesday night Johnson’s advisers released extracts from the speech the prime minister was due to give at an electric taxi factory in the West Midlands on Wednesday. In the texts given to journalists, Johnson likened Labour’s approach to spending, Brexit and Scottish independence to “self-obsession and onanism”. But when Johnson delivered the speech the word onanism was left out. Asked about the omission by the Sun’s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, Johnson tried to laugh it off. He said: “All I can say is that a stray early draft seems to have somehow found its way into your otherwise peerless copy, by a process that I don’t pretend to understand, but I will make inquiries.” Reports of the pre-briefed version of the speech led to a spike in Google searches for the arcane term for masturbation. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has promised that a Conservative government would reduce immigration overall, in an attack on Labour’s immigration policy. Patel criticised Labour’s immigration policy, which has not been announced yet, saying: Under Corbyn’s Labour, immigration would surge and put huge strain on schools and our NHS. Jeremy Corbyn has no credible plan for how to deal with the consequences of his open borders policy. The biggest risk to our NHS is Corbyn’s plans for uncontrolled and unlimited immigration, for ever. By contrast, the Conservatives will get Brexit done, end free movement and introduce an Australian-style points system so that we can control our borders and protect our public services. We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: This is more fake news from the Conservative party’s make-believe research department. Unlike the Tories, we won’t scapegoat migrants or deport our own Windrush-generation citizens. The damage done to our society has been through damaging Conservative cuts to our public services, not by EU nationals coming to work in them. Boris Johnson has hit back at claims he is “in cahoots” with Nigel Farage. In a speech he said that in fact “the Sturgeon-Corbyn alliance would consign this country to months, if not years, of dither, delay, discord, division”. Corbyn said Labour was “not doing pacts, not doing deals” if it failed to win a majority in the election, rejecting suggestions fuelled by Sturgeon that he had privately agreed to support a second independence referendum in exchange for Scottish National party support. Instead, he challenged Sturgeon to support a minority Labour government. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the day’s politics news. It is Equal Pay Day – when the average woman effectively stops earning for the year, taking into account a mean gender pay gap of 13.1%. The Lib Dems and Labour will use it to announce measures to tackle the gender pay gap. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to oblige bigger companies to publish data on employment levels by gender, as well as for BAME and LGBT staff, and would push for a law to end the so-called pink tax, whereby companies charge higher prices for fundamentally identical products such as razors or deodorants simply because they are marketed at women. Labour has pledged to eradicate the gender pay gap by 2030 through measures such as fines for organisations that fail to report on the subject, and by extending the reporting requirement from firms with 250 or more employees to those with more than 50. Boris Johnson has come under fire for his government’s slow response to the flooding across parts of England’s north and has declined to apologise, saying a huge amount of work was going on to help and compensate victims. The PM spent time in deluged regions of Yorkshire, the east Midlands and Lincolnshire on Wednesday. Corbyn has criticised the government, saying its spending on flood defences until 2021 “heavily favours London and the south-east of England”. Richard Partington has fact-checked this claim, and while it is technically true, those figures are seriously influenced by long-term funding for Thames estuary projects running up to 2100. Over the spending period to 2021, Labour is wrong, with more spent per head on flood defences in Yorkshire and the Humber. I’ll be running the blog for the first hour or so, before handing over to my colleagues. You can get in touch with me on Twitter. Thanks for reading."

          "headline": "Labour pledges free broadband for all homes and firms in UK",
          "bodyText": "Labour has promised to provide free “full-fibre” broadband for every home and business by part-nationalising BT. In a speech due to be delivered in Lancaster on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn will outline his proposals to create a new British broadband public service, saying it will “bring communities together in an inclusive and connected society”. The scheme would be a radical shift in provision of broadband services, which are currently provided by companies at an average cost per household of about £30 a month. It builds on Labour’s existing plans to nationalise the energy utilities, water companies, postal services and railways as part of its plan for a transformation of the public sector. Party strategists are hoping that such an eye-catching consumer offer to voters will help narrow the poll gap with the Tories, who are trying to keep the election focused on Brexit and immigration. Labour said the estimated capital cost of rolling out full-fibre broadband was £15bn, on top of the government’s existing £5bn earmarked for broadband expansion. This would be funded from its green transformation fund – paid for by borrowing. In addition, Openreach – the broadband network which is a distinct company within the BT group – would be nationalised under the plan. It is worth about £12bn-£15bn but the party said parliament would decide the rate of compensation. Labour has said it would issue government bonds to shareholders for all nationalisations. The cost of maintaining the network is estimated at about £230m a year and would be partly paid for by high taxes on web companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google. “The internet has become such a central part of our lives,” Corbyn will say. “It opens up opportunities for work, creativity, entertainment and friendship. What was once a luxury is now an essential utility. “That’s why full-fibre broadband must be a public service, bringing communities together, with equal access, in an inclusive and connected society. “It’s time to make the very fastest full-fibre broadband free to everybody, in every home in every corner of our country. Making it free and available to all will open up opportunities for everybody, at the cutting edge of social and economic change.” The Conservatives criticised the policy, saying it was a “fantasy plan to effectively nationalise broadband [that] would cost hardworking taxpayers tens of billions”. Nicky Morgan, the outgoing culture secretary, said: “Corbyn is clearly so desperate to distract from his party’s divisions on Brexit and immigration that he will promise anything, regardless of the cost to taxpayers and whether it can actually be delivered. What reckless idea will be next?” The Tories said Labour had significantly underestimated the costs, saying BT estimates the cost of full-fibre rollout at £40bn. They also highlighted the wages of Openreach staff amounting to about £800m a year and said the costs of running the network would be far higher. Labour said its plan was fully costed, would involve a massive upgrade in the UK’s telecommunications network and would put an end to patchy and slow coverage. It said the rollout would begin with places that have the worst broadband access, including rural and remote communities and some inner city areas, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then by areas that are currently well-served. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “This is public ownership for the future – a plan that will challenge rip-off ‘out-of-contract’ pricing – and that will literally eliminate bills for millions of people across the UK. “Every part of this plan has been legally vetted, checked with experts, and costed. What we are offering in this election is real change.” The party will also announce plans for a new Charter of Digital Rights. This would involve powers for individuals and collectives to challenge “algorithmic injustice”, where online algorithms “cause disproportionate harms to particular groups” and powers for individuals and collectives to prevent the use of digital infrastructure for surveillance. BT’s chief executive, Philip Jansen, told BBC News he was happy to work with whoever wins the election to help build a digital Britain but warned the impact of any changes on BT pensioners, employees, shareholders – and the millions of investors via pension schemes – needed to be carefully thought through. Julian David, the chief executive of TechUK, which represents many UK tech firms, said: “These proposals would be a disaster for the telecoms sector and the customers that it serves. “Renationalisation would immediately halt the investment being driven not just by BT but the growing number of new and innovative companies that compete with BT.” In September, the communications watchdog Ofcom said that full-fibre broadband had been made available to about 8% of homes and businesses, but the UK is still far behind other countries."

          "headline": "UK-educated Russians are upholding Putin’s regime, says dissident",
          "bodyText": "The children of Russian oligarchs learn about freedom in the UK only to return to Moscow to reinforce Vladimir Putin’s dictatorial rule, Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian dissident jailed for five years by Russia, has warned in a stark assessment of Putin’s stranglehold on power. Sentsov, Russia’s most famous political prisoner, was released with 35 other Ukrainians in a high-profile prisoner swap in September, in which an equal number of Russians were released. As a film-maker and Russian-speaking Crimean, he was kept in remote Russian prisons for five years during which he held a 145-day hunger strike that almost killed him. He had been sentenced to 20 years in jail in 2014 for terrorist offences and his defiance became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Sentsov is due to be personally presented with the Sakharov prize, which recognises human rights defenders and which he won in 2018, by the European parliament. He also visited London this week partly to thank Amnesty International for its role in securing his freedom. Asked whether the UK education of children of Russia’s elite might create a more liberal class, he said: “By studying here in the UK they should be able to compare and understand what kind of country they have come from and for what their parents are responsible. “But I would not expect them to want to challenge the Russian state because it would be contrary to their interests. This state is what keeps them going. This is what pays for their tuition in the UK. “Once they have completed their studies, they want to return to Russia and then lead as the younger elite so things can stay the same. These people will never go out and join the barricades.” He continued: “Britain needs to do more to fight Moscow’s dirty money in London since corruption is a cornerstone to Putin’s regime. It is like medieval feudalism in which he dispenses influence to his supporters. They cannot hide from personal sanctions.” He painted an unforgiving picture of Putin building a parody of the Soviet Union. He added: “[Putin] is a very cunning, cynical, unprincipled and evil man. The peacekeeper’s mask that he has on is just that - a mask. What is hiding behind is the face of a dictator and murderer. That is the main thing to understand about him. He does not want peace in Ukraine. He wants Ukraine on its knees, by his feet. “He wants to launch a Soviet Union 2.0, an authoritarian state with a zone of influence around himself along Russia’s border. Anyone who tries to leave this sphere of influence he punishes just as he has in Georgia and Ukraine. When he runs out of political options, he deploys military means. He does not seek peace, he seeks subordination.” According to Sentsov, the poker face shown by Russia when its intelligence agency, the FSB, was “caught red-handed poisoning Sergei Skripal” was just a microcosm of how Putin denies his role in the murder of thousands of Ukrainians. Overall, he said, Russia was moving from authoritarian to totalitarian state. “They are already installing controllers that eavesdrop on internet traffic in Russia. The government, the media and the social organisations all work for Putin. The only thing over which Putin did not have control is the internet. Sentsov said he had often been asked since his release how he found the will to resist, even when he knew others in his jail were being tortured. He said he still cannot answer that question. His jailers, he said, “saw me as their ideological enemy. They went out of their way to make my life miserable.” But he added: “It was very important to me to understand that I was not alone and people supported me. Each letter marked Amnesty International was a drop of hope.” Sentsov said his time in Russia had made him rethink his belief that Putin would fall. “I have had a long exposure to the Russian mind in prison and to my utter astonishment people do believe Putin, even in prison where their lives have been ruined and destroyed. It is the result of 20 years of brainwashing and propaganda about the west. In the Russian media realm, there is only one person, Putin, and then there is everyone else.”"

          "headline": "Virgin V6 TV review: jack of all trades, master of none",
          "bodyText": "Virgin Media is Sky’s long-time rival in the pay-TV space, delivering TV coverage through its own cable network to its latest V6 box. Positioned as the king of the aggregators where you can get everyone’s channels for cheaper, does Virgin deliver? First things first, Virgin TV only works if you happen to live in a cable area, which immediately makes its availability smaller than Sky, BT or the others. Virgin currently covers over 50% of UK households with a target to reach 53% by the end of 2020. Virgin’s TV services are handled by its latest generation Tivo, simply called the V6. It’s a small, inoffensive-looking black box that will happily sit alongside any other under your TV, and adopts Virgin’s red-on-black theme for lights and highlights. It supports 4K, HDR and can record six shows while you watch a seventh, with 1TB of space for all your recordings – which is plenty given on-demand content is streamed not downloaded. Fire up the V6 on your TV and you’ll immediately be struck by how old-fashioned the interface looks. The box is fast, meaning flicking between menu options, channels, scrolling through guides and other actions are quick. There’s even a previous channel button to immediately flick between two channels. I would absolutely take speed over a pretty interface any day. But many actions are buried deep in menus. The TV guide looks particularly dated, and while you can create a favourites list you cannot reorder them. So you’re stuck with a lot of scrolling to do if you want to see all your usual suspects. It’s also fairly complicated to navigate, but once you dig a little deeper you discover that Virgin’s recording and content handling is really powerful. Beyond simply setting a full season to record you can specify the quality, the channel, how many episodes to keep, whether it’s new episodes only or all of them and add a little time buffer before and after the recording. When you come to the end of a recording you the V6 box offers to delete it there and then, without having to go back to the recordings menu to clear it out. Virgin actually tells you when a show was first broadcast in the TV guide too, so you don’t have the problem of thinking a repeat is new. It’s particularly useful for something like Midsomer Murders that has new episodes broadcast seemingly at random. Search On-demand content on the V6 box is pretty extensive too, because it supports most services and aggregates them all on to one box. You can play Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, practically every UK catchup service, plus YouTube and many other internet video services, although it’s on a bring-your-own basis as any required subscriptions aren’t included in your Virgin TV package. The best thing is the unified search. Tapping out the name of shows, actors or similar can be a bit tedious, but results are fast and predictive. Clicking through you can see everywhere the show or movie you’re trying to find is available, both subscription and pay-per-view. Search for Peaky Blinders, for instance, will show you four seasons on Netflix and a fifth on BBC, so if like me you were late to the show you can seamlessly binge-watch them all the way through. Bookmark shows you want to watch and they’ll show up in the My Shows section alongside recordings for easy access. Virgin’s WishList feature also allows you to record everything by a particular actor, director or show that comes on TV, so you can build your own personal Keanu Reeves, Tom Hanks or Jason Statham playlist. You can also like or dislike shows, which teaches the V6 box what you prefer allowing it to suggest shows you might like or have missed. It works pretty well if you’re dedicated to doing it. To aggregate everything under one roof, Virgin had made the V6 app-centric, behaving like a smart TV or streaming box. Catchup content is handled by the respective broadcaster’s apps, not fully integrated into the platform as recordings are. Go to view a BBC show and you are thrown out of the TV interface and into the BBC iPlayer interface, which takes a good couple of seconds. It then starts streaming with buffering and everything else you might have to deal with. It also means that not all catchup content is in HD or in the same quality as broadcast TV. Playing Brooklyn Nine-Nine from All4 wasn’t in HD, and looked pretty bad – nothing like as good if I had recorded it. It’s also worth noting that on-demand content is delivered over your Virgin internet connection, not through the TV cable connected to the V6 box. That means if your router isn’t relatively near the TV box you might have problems. 4K HDR The V6 box can handle both 4K and HDR10 content, which gives it a leg up on some of the competition. Virgin has its own add-free 4K channel, which has a few select shows such as the Rook and nature documentaries. You can also get BT Sport Ultimate in 4K for live sport, but that’s it for channels. Sky Sports is limited to HD. The rest of the 4K content generally relies on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube, with the majority of on-demand not available above HD, including Sky’s content, even if it’s available in 4K on Sky’s platform. Sound isn’t as good as competitors, with large disparity between channels, which is annoying. Ending a recording from BBC and jumping to BT Sport requires some quick jockeying of the volume to avoid being blasted. Other than the odd Virgin 4K channel and the pay-per-view store, the rest of the channels and content are third-party. The movies are from Sky, same with sport alongside BT. With Virgin operating as a middleman, it offers more premium channels from more operators in bundles than competitors, combining Sky Sports and BT Sport in one big sports bundle, for instance. And that’s Virgin’s primary selling point: everything on one box for less than the competition, illustrated by its claim that it offers the cheapest way to watch all football across Sky, BT and Amazon. Virgin TV Go Virgin’s recently revamped TV Go app is effectively the streaming equivalent of your TV package on a tablet or phone. It doesn’t let you watch recordings from your V6 box – for that you’ll need the separate Virgin TV Control app or a second V6 box – but does allow you to download TV shows or watch live TV over the internet, all apart from BBC shows and TV, which demands you head to iPlayer instead. It works well enough, but even over a fast internet connection quality can be a bit hit and miss. It’s enough for keeping an eye on the news or football while cooking. Observations There’s a constant advert for some movie purchase at the bottom of the main user interface, which is annoying Go into settings and everything drops from 4K to SD – which looks like something from 10 years ago The remote can be pointed in any direction, but is a bit too uniform, making picking it up the wrong way round without looking at it a distinct possibility Pressing buttons on the remote while it’s resting on your leg or sofa is almost impossible because of its rounded shape Connected via cable the TV works even when there’s a thunderstorm or heavy rain, unlike satellite The only Sky channel you can’t get on Virgin is Sky Atlantic, which means HBO shows such as Game of Thrones are out Price Virgin Media’s TV pricing can’t be bought without broadband and phone line and starts at £33 a month for 12 months with the “Big bundle” for Mixit TV (110 channels, of which 19 are in HD) and 54Mbps broadband. From there you can build your own bundle, but it gets complicated and expensive really quickly. Adding documentaries, drama, lifestyle or some limited sports channels are £10 a month each. BT Sport channels are £18, Sky Sports channels are £31.75 a month plus £7 for HD, Sky Cinema channels are £21 a month. Sky Sports and Cinema together is £39.25 with various other bundles available. Virgin’s Bigger bundle includes Maxit TV with 230 channels (63 in HD), 12 months of Amazon Prime and 108Mbps broadband for £57 a month. The top package is called the Ultimate Oomph bundle, which is £99 a month and includes 270 channels, BT Sport in 4K, Sky Sports in HD, Sky Cinema, 12 months of Amazon Prime, 516Mbps broadband, phone line and a mobile phone sim card with unlimited data, minutes and text messages. Verdict Virgin’s V6 box is a mixed bag. It’s fast, but looks dated. The interface isn’t particularly intuitive, but dig deep enough and you can find some powerful features. You can get practically everything through one box, but you have to deal with an app-centric service, which asks the question as to why you’re bothering using the V6 box rather than your smart TV or a more intuitive streaming box. While Virgin actually has full live 4K channels, in the shape of its own UHD channel and BT Sport Ultimate, it is the lack of 4K on-demand content for services included in your subscription that is the biggest hole. Sure you can stream Netflix or Amazon in 4K, but you have to bring your own subscription, which means you likely don’t need the V6 box at all. So the power of the V6 box is about being the one-stop shop for everything and doing so is a classic jack of all trades, but master of none. Pros: fast, one-stop-shop for on-demand, BT Sport in 4K, powerful recording features, HDR support, can be fairly good value if bought in bundles Cons: dated and intuitive interface, app-centric on-demand can be jarring, not all on-demand content is in HD, lack of 4K content outside third-party subscriptions, remote is annoying"

          "bodyText": "We have reached the ‘get me out of here’ section of the Senate sitting, where nothing new is being discussed and everyone is responding to comments made earlier in the day. Plus, after this week, and the new depths we have plunged, everyone is quite happy to lie low. There are two more sitting weeks left in this year, with just a week’s break in between. So I hope you get to take that time to recalibrate and prepare for insanity ahead. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp, as well as everyone else in the Guardian brains trust. But mostly, thank you to everyone who followed along with us this week, despite the lows, and the bushfire emergency surrounding so much of the east coast. Make sure you check back to the Guardian site for the latest breaking news. The blog will be back on 25 November. In the meantime – take care of you. Murray Watt is in the Senate, asking why the government can’t produce the documents on the regional jobs and investment packages. Tony Burke is on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, talking about the climate change debate – and the intervention from the former fire and emergency chiefs. Look, as you’d expect, I’m not going to use today as an opportunity to have a slanging match with the government over all of this. The sort of warnings you refer to, you can go back to 2008, for me, before I was environment minister as agriculture minister, where I referred specifically to what was predicted to happen with bushfires by 2020. At the time there was a fair bit of ridiculing of that. We always have to respect the science. Now that goes to a few different angles. It doesn’t only go to how you deal with climate change policy. It also deals with how you work towards adaptation for what’s already happened. It goes to making sure you’ve got the emergency services work. And all of that’s a conversation that needs to be had. We’ve had some pretty awful moments of politicians using tragedies to try to drive home particular political points [in the last week]. I’m not going to add to that today. So what didn’t we get this week? The ensuring integrity bill or medevac. Christian Porter has admitted the ensuring integrity bill won’t be coming on until that last sitting. That’s because the government doesn’t have the numbers. One Nation is not on board and Jacqui Lambie is not across the line. That is a problem for the government. And medevac? Well, no word on that one yet, but if the government had the numbers, it would be listed. What does that mean? Well, we are either about to get a ‘soz, can’t’ letter from Michael McCormack, tabled by a senator representing him, or we’ll get silence. Either way, it doesn’t look like the documents will be forthcoming. The government still gets to use commercial-in-confidence and cabinet-in-confidence as reasons it can’t produce documents, even when ordered to by the Senate. The government has missed the 3.30 deadline to table the documents regarding the regional jobs and investment packages – the grants that Sarah Martin has been writing on. Thus ends the last question time during the Senate-only week. Thank Lizzo. Marise Payne has released an official response to the escalating violence in Hong Kong: We are deeply concerned by the violence in Hong Kong and the increasing divide between the authorities and Hong Kong people. We reiterate our view that it is crucial for all sides – police and protestors – to exercise restraint and take genuine steps to de-escalate tensions. It is essential that the police respond proportionately to protests. Australia continues to urge genuine efforts by all parties to find an effective political solution that supports and upholds Hong Kong’s freedoms and advantages, an open and accountable law enforcement and the professional and unbiased application of justice. A statement by the international expert panel providing advice to Hong Kong’s Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) has identified limitations in the capability of the IPCC to oversee the police. It suggested there should be further independent investigation into police responses to the protests. Australia encourages the Hong Kong authorities to address the panel’s recommendations. These steps are essential for any meaningful dialogue and restoring the trust of Hong Kong’s people. Our Consul-General in Hong Kong continues to raise our concerns with the Hong Kong authorities at the highest levels. Consulate staff are working closely with Australian business and community members in Hong Kong. Australia has a substantial stake in Hong Kong’s success. The city is home to one of our biggest expatriate communities globally and our largest commercial presence in Asia. Ugh. No. Don Farrell gets up to ask a question on sport funding to Richard Colbeck. He’s taken so many questions today, I think we know the identity of Labor’s ‘wounded gazelle’ target today, if it wasn’t already obvious. (Operation Wounded Gazelle is Labor’s new question time tactic in the House and Senate, where a minister it considers to be a “weak link” is targeted with the majority of questions.) Oh we get to the reason why Bridget McKenzie is still in the chamber – it is to take a dixer on how terrible it is that Victoria has stopped the native forestry timber industry. It is the last question. To which Penny Wong made another short statement: If the story goes as the leader of the government suggests it does, can you please advise why the opposition was not advised of Senator McKenzie’s absence earlier today? 9.07am, you sent an email, but all the sudden she’s available, so why is she not representing the leader of the National party? To which Mathias Cormann made a short statement: I think the Australian people will be quite confused that we are spending this much time on this issue. I think that they’d be quite confused that this is the most important priority to the Labor party. The reason is because by the time I sent the letter to the president, the decision was made prior to sending the letter, the decision was made that we would ensure that Senator McKenzie would be available in question time today, specifically because of course the particular interest that has been, you know, obviously on display in this chamber in relation to Senator McKenzie’s portfolio areas of responsibility, and, and of course, of course, and that is why Senator McKenzie has delayed her departure from Australia. If that decision has been made earlier, that decision has been made last week, then obviously, you know, we would have made different arrangements. So then Mathias Cormann made a statement in response: What we’ve just seen is that this is a display of what the Labor party has descended into. Here we are. We’ve got communities across large parts of Australia, large parts of Australia fighting, fighting bushfires. We are dealing with some serious, serious challenges. Senator McKenzie, today, is due to depart Australia to attend a food ministers meeting in New Zealand. When the the arrangements were made, when the arrangements were made, as to who would represent Senator Canavan today, when Minister McKenzie was also to be absent, obviously the arrangements were put in place as I’ve advised the chamber, but to suggest that there is some sort of conspiracy here is juvenile. It is desperate, and it just shows the Labor party has completely lost the plot. I mean, we are a strong and united coalition. Senator McKenzie is an outstanding minister. And if it hadn’t been for the fact that she was due to depart Australia for New Zealand earlier, the representative arrangements would have been different. But I’m sure that any question the Labor party wants to address to Senator McKenzie, she will as always respond to, with absolute distinction. Penny Wong: Well, the question that should be asked is why the government leader in the Senate no longer trusts the deputy leader of the National party to represent the National party. He doesn’t trust his representative... Mathias Cormann: What we just experienced... What is not a brief statement. This is a political spray which is without foundation because it’s based on an assumption whatever gossip is published on Twitter is somehow accurate. Scott Ryan: Senators know once leave is granted, leave is granted. I’m not in a position to restrict its use. Senator Wong. Wong: Well, on Monday Senator Canavan was absent. As is normal, as previously occurred and as would be normal, Senator McKenzie represented him. She struggled to answer anything. She took seven out of nine questions on notice, and now the extraordinary situation where the deputy leader of the National party is not trusted by the Liberals to speak for the National party. We’ve got an extraordinary situation where a Liberal party senator represents the leader of the National party in this place. The only conclusion, they don’t trust Senator McKenzie, and/or they don’t trust the National party, to speak for themselves. Meanwhile, it was the battle of the props at the press club: There is still a bit of confusion around why Bridget McKenzie, the deputy leader of the Nationals, is not the senator representing the leader of the Nationals, Michael McCormack, in the Senate. Matt Canavan is absent (fires) so he can’t represent McCormack, but McKenzie is there and she is not representing McCormack, because she is apparently leaving for New Zealand at any moment. So Michaelia Cash is representing McCormack, and Simon Birmingham is representing Canavan. Which means that two Nationals are being represented by two Liberal senators, when the deputy leader of the National party is sitting there. I can see her. She’s holding up papers. What she’s not doing is representing anyone in her party. In taking a question from the South Australian senator Marielle Smith, Richard Colbeck responded with thanking Senator M Smith. He seemed a little surprised to find himself corrected that her name was actually Marielle, and not M. “Senator Marielle Smith if it pleases the chamber,” he says, adding he didn’t mean any offence but that M Smith was a “term I had heard in this chamber”. From AAP: Miners looking at digging up the rare earths and critical minerals needed for many modern technologies could get double the help from taxpayers as the federal government looks to expand the market opportunities. Projects will now be able to get support from Export Finance Australia, including its defence branch, and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility if they meet the criteria. ...Australia and the United States are teaming up to develop the sector in a bid to counter China’s near-stranglehold on supply of the vital minerals. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the government had been working carefully and steadily to build the market’s potential. The way the sun is coming through the Senate chamber makes it seem like Scott Ryan has been anointed from above to descend from the mountain. Mathias Cormann on the economy: “The only thing we have floundering here is the shadow treasurer,” he says. Weird flex, but cool. Senate question time begins with a statement from Penny Wong, about Bridget McKenzie not answering questions today. Wong says that the changes mean that the deputy leader of the National party isn’t being trusted to answer questions on behalf of the National party. Mathias Cormann says she is on her way to New Zealand, and has to leave early, so arrangements were made to replace her portfolio responsibilities (in terms of answering questions). It is all very awkward though, because McKenzie is in the Senate, sitting there like she has just seen a school of CARP and told that’s tonight’s dinner. The Greens have just passed a motion in the Senate, calling on Scott Morrison to meet with Greg Mullins and the other former emergency chiefs. They will meet with David Littleproud. The Senate motion won’t compel Morrison to meet with them though – that’s the decision of him and his office. At least someone is: Stuart Robert had to be schooled by the National Press Club president, Sabra Lane, that journalists can ask any question they like of speakers, regardless of what the topic of the speech is, after Paul Karp asked about robodebt. PK: Can I ask with your government services hat on about the robodebt program? The former senior AAT member has said that robodebts are illegal because you can’t calculate a debt based on estimates of income, and he cites his evidence on the fact that when welfare recipients appeal debts, Centrelink folds its tent, it waives the debt and it refuses to fight the issue in court. So could I please ask, if you are so confident that it’s legal, why has Centrelink never defended them in court? SR: I don’t think I’ve ever been asked by an NDIS participant about income complaints or earned income compliance. I’m not too sure NDIS participants listening are really interested in it. I am focused in terms of how to actually deliver services quicker, seamlessly and less bureaucratically in terms of participants who desperately need the services. So today is probably not the day to talk about income complaints and where. Happy to look at it another time. Sabra Lane: Why isn’t it? We are the press club and we like to talk about all sorts of issues and everyone who gets an invite here understands that they might be asked about the speech and they might not. Robert then sort of addresses the issue: SR: As Australians engage with us and provide information to us, many times they can actually prove that they haven’t earned too much. And in fact in 19.9% of cases Australians actually demonstrate through their bank account records or salary payslips that they don’t have a debt. Speaking to Hunter Valley radio station 2NM, Joel Fitzgibbon agreed with Scott Morrison that people need to chill on the climate change debate while the fires are burning, because that’s his role now. I’m with the prime minister on this one – and indeed Anthony Albanese said something very similar yesterday – people just need to tone the debate down. Surely we can’t be having a debate about whose fault all of this is in the middle of a crisis. We’ve got people out there risking their lives to help others. We have people who have their lives threatened by the situation in their homes or in their communities, and the last thing we need is politicians playing a blame game. And what concerns me most, Jess, is that within that blame game there’s a whole lot of extended rhetoric and exaggeration, and if you like “fake news” going on about the causes or otherwise of these events. We need to get our people through this terrible situation, and yes we can have a conversation about those things after the events. OK, so I have just had a chance to read through the Australian Bureau of Statistics data on jobs. The economy shed 19,000 jobs in the last month – the biggest fall since May 2014 (thank you Shane Wright) which equated to 10,300 full-time jobs and 8,700 part-time jobs. That means the number of people out of work increased by about 17,000, which brings the number of people without a job to just over 726,000. So on the seasonal adjustment measure, unemployment rose by 0.1% to 5.3% from a low of 4.9% in February, and way off the Reserve Bank of Australia’s target of 4.5%. Suddenly, Stuart Robert appears to have found the figures the ABC couldn’t get in its FOI request: Labor has just had two motions pass on the voices in the Senate. One of them is a continuing order for the production of documents, meaning the government will have to now disclose monthly onshore protection visa claims – the people who arrive in Australia by plane, and then apply for protection. Under the order, which was put forward by Kristina Keneally, the government will have to disclose, monthly, the statistics on: · Country of origin of people making these claims · Grants · Refusals · The number awaiting a refugee status determination · The number of refusals deported · The number of refusals yet to be deported (among other things) The second motion was about a national agricultural day – asking the government to address labour supply issues in the ag industry. The government opposed both, but didn’t force either to a division, meaning it passed on the voices. The prime minister’s office has pointed to this response from Scott Morrison’s February press club address, to show that yes, the government is comfortable talking about climate change, in response to Greg Mullin’s comments: JOURNALIST: Quentin Dempster from the New Daily Prime Minister. You’ve recently been in Tasmania and Townsville as you’ve mentioned in your address, to comfort and support Australians suffering from wildfires and unprecedented inundation and flooding. Now, insurance actuaries are constantly revising risk assessments and are now factoring in climate change as an exacerbating factor in the higher frequencies of extreme weather events. Do you acknowledge that climate change is now the major factor affecting extreme weather events and if you do, doesn’t that mean that Australia’s national disaster response needs greater national coordination than what you’ve been able to announce under the national security umbrella that you’ve canvassed today? Scott Morrison: I don’t know if I agree with your reasoning, we have a clear commitment to reduce emissions, 26 per cent by 2030. So that is our response, we are taking action on climate change. We do have a response in place to address the very real threats of climate change that you’ve articulated. That’s part of our Government’s plan, to do exactly that. Right now, in the middle of the fires in Tasmania and the floods in Queensland - they’re not fires just in Tasmania, as we know, but in Victoria and Western Australia and other parts of the country -this is happening at a time when we have met the commitments that we have already set for this time. So the action we’ve taken to address climate change has been taken and we’re meeting the commitments we’ve made up until right now, when these very events you speak of are occurring. So my answer to that is, we will continue to take action, just as we have. I acknowledge it’s a factor, of course it is. Australians do, the vast majority of Australians. But the issue is how you achieve it. We believe you need sensible, achievable targets to address climate change and we have them and we’re achieving them. What we disagree with is having reckless targets that shut down your economy and take people’s jobs, which is what Labor proposes. Their target requires an emissions reduction of roughly about three times what we still have to achieve by 2030. Now, if you think the Boyne Aluminium Smelter is going to be open under Labor plan, you’re kidding yourself. It won’t be. Josh Frydenberg, through the Australian, announced the government would be looking at foreign capital tax concessions for infrastructure projects, as the government tries to kickstart productivity. From the Simon Benson story: Tax incentives to drive billions of dollars in foreign capital for nation-building infrastructure will be granted for projects worth more than $500m in a move by the Morrison government to inject further stimulus into the economy. A Treasury paper — obtained by the Australian and to be released on Thursday — will set a 15% concessional rate for projects that qualify, including energy, transport, water and communications, as the government seeks to leverage the global capital market. Jim Chalmers says that was announced in the 2018-19 budget papers, and was legislated in April. Josh Frydenberg is recycling an old policy to try and distract from the fact that the economy is floundering on his watch and that he doesn’t have a plan to turn it around. Pretending that an old policy is new again or a new way to deal with an economy which is slowing is not a plan, it’s a con. What Josh Frydenberg is proposing today is pretending that an old policy is new again to deal with an economy which has deteriorated since the election. This is not a plan, it’s a con. Stuart Robert is at the press club. Paul Karp is taking that one for you. Simon Birmingham says the prime minister takes the issues of climate change, the drought, and ensuring the community is safe “extremely seriously”, in response to questions about Greg Mullins comments. He says David Littleproud will meet with the group. Could someone let the senators know that we are all watching for a change, and they should probably have their act together in terms of procedure? I mean, it shouldn’t be their first rodeo. We are still a little unclear on why the government wants the Senate timetable clear – but yes, the calls are being made. Jordon Steele-John says the motion to gag the NDIS debate (so it is dealt with by a certain time) is denying disabled people a chance to receive clarification on what the bill will mean for them. Basically, the government is moving to make sure that the NDIS bill is wrapped up by question time – so it is done today. The US ambassador to Australia, Arthur B Culvahouse Jr, has issued a statement on the bushfires: On behalf of the American people and government, I would like to extend my sincerest condolences to the families and communities who have lost loved ones, homes and livelihoods in the terrible bushfires in recent days. The fire and rescue services of Queensland and New South Wales have faced exceptional danger and challenges over the last week, and more is yet to come with additional dry, hot conditions predicted. Australian firefighters are some of the most professional and effective anywhere in the world. As Americans, we know this because we have seen it first-hand – when your firefighters have come to help us face our own devastating forest fires. Our fire services’ cooperation extends back decades and is part of the long U.S.-Australian friendship and alliance. I understand that the tactical firefighting air-tanker Tanker 911 is already headed to Australia from New Mexico as part of an ongoing arrangement. These converted DC-10 aircraft can drop up to 9,400 gallons of fire retardant and have been used with success in Australia several times in recent years. I will be reaching out to the Prime Minister and his cabinet team, as well as the New South Wales and Queensland Premiers, to offer additional assistance, if needed. American citizens visiting or living in Australia should pay close attention to the information and directives of the NSW Rural Fire Service and Rural Fire Service Queensland. These can be found online, on their respective mobile apps, and on ABC local radio (Australia’s emergency broadcaster during natural disasters). Happy unemployment figures day. Over in the Senate, the government is attempting to gag debate on the NDIS bill – to reorder business. Not sure why yet. Greg Mullins continued: This is very frustrating for this group of emergency chiefs, because had we spoken back in April, one of the things we would have said was try to get more aircraft on lease from the northern hemisphere, this is going to be a horror fire season. We are only going to have seven of those large air tankers you saw at Turramurra saving homes the other day. They can be a decisive weapon. I have just come back from California – they had about 30 on one fire. But because the fire seasons are overlapping with the northern hemisphere, they are not available when we need them most ... The fire and emergency services in each state and territory, the commissioners, they are doing a great job. The volunteers and paid fire fighters, the national park [workers] on the ground are just incredible, salt-of-the-earth people who will do anything for anyone. Structurally, we would like to actually go back to being retired and not to have to speak out. We would like the doors to be open to the current chiefs, and allow them to utter the words “climate change”. They are not allowed to, at the moment. We want a national summit, where people are brought together. You need the insurance industry, you need farmers, you need the defence forces, you need fire services, of course, other interested groups. And we want a bipartisan approach. None of us can understand why climate change in Australia is so political. In the UK, the conservatives said years ago, Margaret Thatcher, said this is a major problem. But in Australia, it’s a major demarcation. We would like to see Labor, the Coalition government, the crossbench, the Greens, all come together, declare a climate emergency and start to do something about the base cause – the burning of oil, coal and gas, the generation of CO2, and methane and nitrous oxide, which is what is warming the planet and making our bushfires unfightable. On the meeting the former fire and emergency chiefs have been seeking with the prime minister and other responsible ministers about Australia’s fire preparations since April, Greg Mullins said: I wrote to the prime minister on two occasions. I didn’t expect a response to the first letter in April, because of the election in May. I wrote a couple of months later, or a few months later, there was a response, saying he was unable to meet and a message saying minister Taylor would be in touch. When I was able to speak to minister Taylor’s office, I did point out that he was probably not the right minister to speak to, with minister Littleproud, maybe the finance minister, but definitely the PM – he was unable to assist with that. I wrote to the PM’s office again, I haven’t received a response. But now minister Littleproud has reached out, we have set a meeting. Why does he think it took so long? This government fundamentally doesn’t like talking about climate change. I will probably say ... that is all I will say about that. Greg Mullins on the Michael McCormack’s “raving green lunatic” comments: There has been some interesting political dialogue – I am not even going to dignify it with comment, we will leave that there. But you have a group of 23 former fire and emergency chiefs who have varying political views and backgrounds, they live in various areas, not all in the city, and they’ve all come together because they are vitally concerned for the future of our planet, and of Australia, and of communities that are increasingly under threat from extreme weather events caused by climate change. If it is not time now to speak about climate change and what is driving these events, when? This fire season is going to go for months – so do we simply get gagged? Because I think that is what happening. Some people want the debate gagged because they don’t have any answers. The Grenfell fire in London, people talked about the cause from day one, train crashes they talk from day one, and it is OK to say it is an arsonist’s fault, or pretend that the greenies are stopping hazard reduction burning, which is simply not true, but you are not allowed to talk about climate change. Well, we are, because we know what is happening. Greg Mullins, the former NSW fire chief, is unloading about the ridiculousness of not being able to talk about causes as the fire emergency unfolds. Obviously, this is just the ideological ravings of the lunatic left. The university lobby group Universities Australia has welcomed the move: Universities Australia Chair Professor Deborah Terry AO said the nation’s university leaders had demonstrated a strong commitment to this work. “This has genuinely been an equal partnership between universities and Government,” she said. “Our shared aim has been to build on existing protections against foreign interference, without damaging the openness and global engagement essential to Australia’s strengths and values.” “The global collaboration of our universities is a powerful national asset – putting us at the forefront of research breakthroughs and knowledge advances that deliver benefits to Australia.” “It is in Australia’s interests to safeguard that openness as we navigate in an ever more complex world.” Professor Terry said the intention was not to create an onerous new set of rules or reporting requirements, but rather to continue to build on prudent risk management practice. The key aim was to deepen the level of advice and cooperation between universities and agencies in a shared responsibility to understand and manage risk. “The intent is not to add to the regulatory or compliance burden for universities – but to enhance resources and intelligence to further safeguard our people, research and technology.” “University autonomy remains a foundational principle of Australia’s university system, and this partnership approach respects this central tenet of universities whilst managing risk.” As a member of the ongoing taskforce, Universities Australia will continue to support the university sector to share practical resources, knowledge and advice. This is quite interesting. From AAP: Australian universities will have to name their research partners and financial donors under new rules to safeguard against foreign interference. The federal government directive follows concerns about China’s influence in Australia and a 2018 cyber attack on the Australian National University, which was only revealed in June. Political ties of research collaborators, the end goal of the research and the objectives of foreign governments will all be scrutinised under the changes. Universities would also have to review intellectual property rights and whether foreign military organisations might benefit. The new rules were drawn up by universities and intelligence experts from the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Under the voluntary guidelines, universities will have to consider the “dual-use” of their research. Earlier this year, University of Queensland researchers were found to be collaborating on facial recognition technology used by the Chinese government to surveil ethnic Uighurs. The paper detailing the new guidelines does not list any penalties for universities found to be breaching the new rules. Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan said the guidelines were about due diligence. “We’ve got to make sure that we continue to adapt, because with the foreign interference threat at unprecedented levels, it will evolve,” Mr Tehan told the ABC on Thursday. Asked on Sky why the guidelines weren’t compulsory, Mr Tehan said the best approach was a collaborative one. “If we can get a change of culture on our campuses ... that is the best way that we can ensure that we deal with the threat of foreign interference.” The paper doesn’t specifically name China and Mr Tehan dodged questions on whether it had been responsible for the ANU hack. The paper says foreign actors may be trying to influence Australian researchers through economic pressure, hacking or recruitment. But the guidelines aren’t just aimed at staff, with universities asked to remind students of the risks of foreign interference. Intelligence agencies would also work with universities to help them identify risks and respond. Universities would also be required to list collaborators on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme. Late yesterday Linda Burney was asked about the NT police officer charged with the murder of Kumanjayi Walker. Here is what she had to say: Well, the charge of course is very serious. And I don’t think that it’s appropriate that I comment any further. There’s a coronial inquest under way, and obviously, this has become a very serious police matter. But I do think there are two issues running here. There is the direct issue of the death of this young man; and the circumstances around that; the way the family’s feeling; and the demand for a thorough and independent investigation. But there’s a broader issue as well: and that is the frustration of people living in the territory, particularly First Nations people; the blanket introduction of the cashless debit card next year; the extreme poverty in communities; the lack of clean water; the lack of a secure food source; and of course, remnants of the intervention, some 12 years ago. These are the frustrations that people also are voicing ... I think the way I feel is the way that many people feel, and that’s a level of frustration in the sense of listening to Aboriginal people; making sure that the appropriate services in communities; and particularly for people living in remote Australia, understanding what the challenges are for people that live in remote Australia – and the importance of connection to country; connection to culture; connection to language. And the frustration obviously being expressed of, ‘Please listen, listen to what we’ve got to say.’ Josh Frydenberg is speaking in Adelaide today, expanding on his “get the federation to work for you” theme, which has been a recurring message since the economy started tanking. The treasurer wants the states to do more to stimulate the economy. But he wants to ask them to do that without saying stimulus, because a surplus economy shouldn’t need stimulating. From Paul Karp: In extracts of the Sir John Downer oration, seen by Guardian Australia, Frydenberg argues that Australia’s federal system has “matured” with greater uniformity in states’ approaches on taxation, education and transport and a single national approach to corporations law and the regulation of credit. “But despite this progress we should be under no illusions about the inefficiencies that exist in our federation and the handbrake it represents on our productivity,” he says. “This is where we can and must do better, knowing full well that a new bucket of money will not make our economy more efficient or businesses more productive. “As we seek to lift our productivity from its current five-year average growth rate of 0.6% commonwealth and state governments need to work together and treat the productivity challenge as a national imperative.” Frydenberg argues that with the challenges of an ageing and growing population facing the Australian economy “we must make sure the lines of accountability between levels of government are not blurred”. Meh – tell this to anyone who carries a toddler. At least it doesn’t squirm in an attempt to launch itself into traffic. This also happened yesterday: Sherele Moody, who started the petition calling for Pauline Hanson to be removed from the latest family violence inquiry, which was tabled into the Senate by Larissa Waters, said this as part of a press conference: “After a cataclysmic event like this, domestic violence peaks,” she said. “Women become extremely unsafe, when generally the men return home from the fires and subject them to domestic violence.” Moody made her comments while standing next to Waters, causing the Greens senator to issue this statement later in the afternoon: The Greens absolutely do not support the statement made today by Sherele Moody that firefighters are responsible for an increase in domestic violence during times of disaster. Ms Moody is not affiliated with the Greens and does not speak for us. Today’s press conference with Senator Waters was held to receive a petition regarding the Family Law Inquiry. Ms Moody chose to make comments regarding matters unrelated to the press conference without our prior knowledge. That motion for the production of documents came after stories like this one from Sarah Martin, who has been meticulously making her way through the grants, researching what they are actually for. Here is the latest: A Wollongong dog breeder was awarded a $205,000 federal grant for an aquaculture project for which he tried to raise more than $5m on the blockchain market by issuing “aqua tokens” that offered a return to investors based on the price of fish. The taxpayer-funded grant was made under the government’s regional jobs and investment packages scheme (RJIP), which was the subject of a damning auditor general report and has seen a slew of projects receive funding against the recommendations of the department. This is also happening today: The Senate ordered that the government provide by no later than 3.30pm on 14 November 2019: All written briefings and responses to and from Ministerial Panels informing the approval of grant funding, including all scoring and assessment of applications. All records and reasons by Ministerial Panels to award funding to applications that had not been recommended by the Department. All records and reasons by Ministerial Panels to not award funding to applications that had been recommended by the Department. Any documents identifying projects as ineligible or late, including any of the six that received funding. Any documents identifying co-funding exemptions, including the four granted an exemption. The assurance review contracted by the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development. The July 2017 MoU under which the Industry Department’s Business Grants Hub was engaged and documents that show how the cost of $8.078 million was determined. All documents relating to the selection of the Business Grants Hub and correspondence between the Departments of Industry and Infrastructure. The request for quote and final contract between the Department of Industry and the contractor who undertook the assessment process at a cost of $3.15 million. Medevac is still ticking away. The government does not have the votes it needs to scrap it, but Peter Dutton is doing his damnedest to try to make it happen. Which includes saying that he can’t deport people who come to Australia for treatment, or that anyone in treatment is not in detention. Except that the independent health advice panel report, tabled in the Senate yesterday, says the default is to keep people in detention. “Any transitory person who is brought to Australia for a temporary purpose must be detained whilst in Australia. That detention must continue until the time of the person’s removal from Australia or until the person is granted a visa.” That’s made Kristina Keneally’s day. She said in a statement: All Medevac transferees must be detained in immigration detention by law, unless Peter Dutton approves their release from detention. This is designed to keep the Australian community safe. The report also shows the IHAP upheld Minister Dutton’s decision to deny a transfer on medical grounds in the majority of cases (45 of 57 cases considered) in the 1 July through 30 September 2019 period. Labor supports the current Medevac laws because they allow sick people to get the medical care they need and ensure the Government, or Government-appointed doctors, control who comes to Australia. This bodes well for future elections – from Katharine Murphy: Facebook has rebuffed an appeal by the ACTU to take down fake tweets purporting to be from Sally McManus and Bill Shorten, arguing that the content doesn’t violate the social media giant’s community guidelines. Screenshots of the fake tweets, one from McManus saying the Labor conference had endorsed an inheritance tax, and another from Shorten saying “immigration of people from the Middle East is the future Australia needs”, are posted on the Facebook pages Respect Australia Rally – National and I’ll Stand by Tony Abbott. The fake McManus tweet declaring Labor’s support for an inheritance tax first appeared on 21 April, and the ACTU secretary disavowed it immediately. Stuart Robert started the morning with good news – that 310,000 people are now on an NDIS plan, but he still couldn’t help but be Stuart Robert about other parts of his portfolio, as this bit of Sabra Lane’s ABC radio interview with him shows: Got to love that right to know. He’ll be at the press club today, so there are plenty of other opportunities for Stuart Robert to be Stuart Robert as the day unfolds. It is a bit of taking stock day here, as the bushfire emergency continues. A fourth person has been confirmed dead after a body was found in Kempsey this morning. Both the government and Labor have come to an understanding to lay low and let the fires take precedence. But we’ll bring you everything that does happen as the day unfurls. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp along for the journey. Plus, the rest of the Guardian brains trust. I am not ready for today, but since when has that stopped us? Let’s get into it."

          "headline": "Kumanjayi Walker: more than 1,000 protest Yuendumu police shooting",
          "bodyText": "More than 1,000 people have marched in Alice Springs to protest against the police shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in the central Australian community of Yuendumu. An NT police officer, Zachary Rolfe, has been charged with murdering the 19-year-old Warlpiri man on Saturday night. Rolfe, 28, intends to plead not guilty, the NT Police Association said on Thursday. Protests and vigils have sprung up across the country demanding a full and independent investigation. Elders called for calm as the rally approached the Alice Springs police station. Warlpiri elder Harry Jakamarra Nelson told the crowd: “Please, we come in peace. We want to know the truth. No more lies. That incident last week hit us like a rocket. We didn’t know what to do, we were shocked. “At this gathering I’m telling you, once again, this is a peaceful rally.” Rolfe was charged with murder on Wednesday night and has been released on bail to appear in Alice Springs court in December. He has been suspended on pay, police confirmed. The police association said Rolfe would “vigorously contest the charge”. “He, like all, has the presumption of innocence in his favour. “The member and his family have the complete support of the NTPA, as do all of his colleagues and all of our members, who put their lives at risk every day to protect the community of the Northern Territory from violent offending,” the association said. Earlier, the Northern Territory’s chief minister and police commissioner both called for calm. The chief minister, Michael Gunner, said it was “his job to make sure the Territory goes through a healing process and goes back to normal as soon as possible”. “This is an incredibly sad time for all. It is a time of high emotion. There are many people hurting in Yuendumu and around the Northern Territory and in our police force,” Gunner said. “It is my priority that the community of Yuendumu, a community that is in a lot of pain right now, and other communities and towns in the Northern Territory who are also hurting, are supported to return to normal to make sure that kids are going to school, to make sure they have the healthcare that they need, to make sure they are still receiving critical services. “That is why we are helping people get home from Alice Springs after the rallies today.” Hundreds of Warlpiri people and their supporters, including a big contingent of families from Yuendumu, gathered in Alice Springs on Thursday to march to the law courts. The Walker family and Yuendumu community said they welcomed the murder charge, but wanted the coronial inquest to take place in Yuendumu, and pushed for alternative community policing, such as night patrol. The NT police commissioner, Jamie Chalker, said Territorians needed to “come together to work towards the future of our home”. “My officers are hurting, the community is hurting. My intention is to help you all,” he said on Thursday. “The path we are on will be a search for the truth. We have reached a point where the court will need to make the decision. Everybody must respect that process. “Everybody must respect that anyone involved in this process is afforded natural justice,” Chalker said. “I need all my officers to step to the fore, to trust in one another, trust in the process, to remember the oath they took and the importance of integrity, ethics and fairness.” The Yuendumu community has also called for 24-hour medical staffing of its health clinic. The clinic was closed on the day of the shooting after “community unrest”, according to the NT health department, forcing staff to leave the town. The local independent MP, Scott McConnell, told Guardian Australia he supported calls for better services, saying the situation in Yuendumu was the result of “bad policies from a bad government”. “Remote police stations have been downgraded, remote clinics have been downgraded. They have severely eroded the relationship with Aboriginal communities and it is the NT government’s fault,” McConnell said. “We are not delivering even basic services to these communities and the care factor about it is absolutely zero. Our priorities are completely wrong.” The chief executive of the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, Priscilla Collins, said justice for Aboriginal people would remain an issue “until racism is acknowledged, confronted and addressed across our nation”. “The people of Yuendumu have demonstrated great dignity and resilience throughout these heartbreaking events. “It is of vital importance that this murder charge now properly proceed through the criminal justice system.” Labor’s spokeswoman for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, told ABC radio she was confident an independent and thorough investigation would take place, even though there was “enormous surprise out there in the community that bail has been given”. “However, the most important thing that the family’s asking for is calm and respect. “People are still very much feeling the wrath of the intervention – the poverty, the lack of clean water in communities, is something that most people would be astounded at. And those broad issues are what people are very frustrated about as well.”"

          "headline": "Top 10 golden age detective novels",
          "bodyText": "Just how golden was the golden age of crime fiction? For some, the celebrated flowering of the detective story in the 1920s and 30s gave us enduringly popular, elegantly written novels that have yet to be bettered. The period introduced us to household names such as Christie, Sayers, Allingham and Tey, and established detective fiction as a brand through those addictively collectable green and white Penguins. For others, golden age or “cosy” crime, is a lowbrow, sanitised form of fiction; class-ridden and formulaic, and full of meddlesome British spinsters and eccentric foreigners whose lives (and deaths) were somehow less real than those developing concurrently on the hardboiled American streets. It’s no mystery that detective stories flourished in Britain after the first world war: loss, violence and social change are at the heart of most crime novels, and there’s surely no period in our history when all three were experienced more deeply. But it took the second world war and its aftermath to bring them to maturity; many of the authors whose careers began 20 years earlier wrote their best books in the 1940s and 50s. The sinister sparkle of murder is still there, as is the fair-play puzzle and the uncomfortable intrusion of the past. But the order and resolution that appealed in the first wave of golden age novels are far less common in the second. These novels simmer with a restlessness that still feels urgent. They struggle with injustice and the shortcomings of the law. The innocent suffer and the culprit isn’t always caught, but the noose is a tangible presence. Murderers are more complex, and the body in the library finally leaves a stain on the carpet. These are stories that are so much more than puzzles. That’s what inspired me to write books that honour the golden age, most obviously through my series character, the real-life author Josephine Tey. She consistently tore up the rule book in her unsettling, highly engaging novels. By showing so effectively the aftermath of crime, she paved the way for modern novels to treat crime as an entertainment while never forgetting its painful reality. That, for me, is the true spirit of the golden age. Here are 10 novels that celebrate it. 1. And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie (1939) Christie was ruthless with her characters and readers. Nothing is off-limits: the child did it; the policeman did it; they all did it. No pillar of the community was above suspicion. It’s hard to think of a more brutal novel than this groundbreaking, characteristically ingenious story of 10 people invited to a small island, only to be killed off one by one. It is almost unbearably claustrophobic and its dazzling solution is a scream against injustice. 2. Green for Danger by Christianna Brand (1944) The creator of the original Nanny McPhee stories also wrote great crime novels. Brand’s books are peopled with subtle, beautifully drawn characters and richly evocative of their time and place. Green for Danger is set in a military hospital during the second world war, where a patient’s death is the catalyst to a tale of intrigue, jealousy and frustrated passions. Witty and cleverly plotted, the book is an unsentimental tribute to the doctors and nurses who calmly carried on working as the bombs fell around them. 3. To Love and Be Wise by Josephine Tey (1950) Here Tey demonstrates an extraordinary understanding of the psychology of a killer – not a crazed figure of evil, but an ordinary person, who, through extremes of love or obsession, might decide that someone no longer deserves to live. “I’ve done a lot of good solid hating in my time,” the author once admitted to a friend, “and the curious thing is that although I did nothing, the people I hated all went satisfyingly to the bad.” This book is an unsettling, ingenious reminder of what we’re all capable of. 4. An English Murder by Cyril Hare (1951) As the glut of reissued Christmas mysteries testifies, there’s something appealing about the combination of sherry, fruit cake and sudden death. Hare’s is one of the best: a classy, entertaining country house murder that respects tradition while extending its boundaries. 5. The Tiger in the Smoke by Margery Allingham (1952) Not every golden age novel is set in a village: Allingham’s beautifully evoked fog-bound London is a character in its own right, synonymous with the palpable sense of evil that seeps from the pages. Her ruthless, psychopathic killer Jack Havoc is a memorably chilling creation. A psychological thriller rather than a classic whodunnit, the battle between good and evil is convincingly played out in the genteel squares and dark alleyways of postwar England’s capital. 6. The Killings at Badger’s Drift by Caroline Graham (1987) A tranquil English village, the death of a well-loved spinster – you could be forgiven for placing this 50 years earlier were it not for the barbed humour that is sometimes lost in the parallel TV world of Midsomer. Dedicated to Christianna Brand, this novel established Graham as the natural successor to Brand’s impeccable plotting. 7. Death in Holy Orders by PD James (2001) James did more than anyone to reinvigorate the classic English detective story, using golden age conventions to create novels that live and breathe for modern readers. For me, this is her masterpiece. Set in a remote theological college on the Suffolk coast, the book builds an intense picture of the fear, rage and desperation experienced by a society under threat. The skies and sea are the dominant forces, a powerful symbol of endurance against which human dramas feel both transient and shocking. 8. The Act of Roger Murgatroyd by Gilbert Adair (2006) Adair’s Evadne Mount trilogy (this was followed by A Mysterious Affair of Style and And Then There Was No One) is both a celebration and parody of the golden age, and Christie in particular. Subtitled “An Entertainment”, this novel is exactly that, packed as tightly as Miss Marple’s suitcase with the classic ingredients – a locked room, a rambling mansion, an unpopular victim – and authentic down to the controversial inclusion of racism, snobbery and antisemitic remarks found in many golden age originals. 9. Magpie Murders by Anthony Horowitz (2016) A dark and stylish take on the classic golden age novel. Alan Conway, creator of Atticus Pund (a Poirot-esque outsider who solves mysteries in 1950s England), provides clues to his own death in an unfinished manuscript. Magpie Murders works on many levels, but – as with everything Horowitz touches – the voice is pitch-perfect, and his impeccable honouring of the golden age greats is so addictive that you long for Atticus Pund to be coaxed from a premature retirement. 10. The Truants by Kate Weinberg (2019) This list comes full circle with this intriguing and recent debut. English fresher Jess Walker is studying Agatha Christie, wrestling with the author as both a feminist revolutionary and purveyor of order and compromise. But Christie ultimately becomes less fascinating than Walker’s charismatic tutor. After surprising twists, Weinberg provides a satisfying conclusion while asking the question: does a mystery lose its magic once it’s solved? • Sorry for the Dead by Nicola Upson is published by Faber &amp; Faber (£12.99).

          "bodyText": "Proud and elated to announce this week that I have managed to fill in two of my election bingo card squares: I got “Nigel Farage is up to something” and “conspiracy row involving the BBC” one day after another. I just need “man on the street yells directly in the face of standing MP”, “viral Sarah Vine column in which she coyly alludes to Michael Gove being horny” and “Jacob Rees-Mogg looms in the background, terribly” and I win a tenner off Chuka Umunna. Anyway, Armistice Day this week, which is either a sombre occasion for reflection on the unfathomably heroic sacrifice hundreds of thousands of soldiers made for our country (good) or a sort of competitive respect event in which there isn’t a single poppy big enough to show our thanks (bad). This year’s Cenotaph-adjacent vein-busters were basically the same as the previous years: “Fury as Jeremy Corbyn fails to shave his head and paint ‘LEST WE FORGET’ across his skull in poppy-red face paint” – and I, for one, am calling for fresh story lines. Nearby, Boris Johnson looked, frankly, as if he’d left my house at 10am in an Uber with a can of Dark Fruit for the road “to perk one up”. He looked like I’d been begging him to get two hours sleep – mate, please, you can use my bed, honestly – but he insists on playing The xx remixes off YouTube instead. Keeps asking me how the PlayStation controller works and whether it is possible to close any more curtains. His phone’s on 1% because he keeps Googling what time the shops open. That sort of thing. Only… oh? The footage of the wreath-laying on BBC Breakfast on Monday morning showed a markedly fresher-faced Johnson, laying a different coloured wreath, the right way up this time, and looking, well, as if he didn’t have an entry-stamp to The Dolphin on his inner wrist and £60 in notes in his wallet just in case. Eagle-eyed viewers immediately noticed the discrepancy, and the BBC issued a short mea culpa: the line they stuck to was that footage of the 2016 wreath-laying, prepared for a preview of the 2019 wreath laying, was accidentally used instead of footage of the 2019 wreath laying ceremony. And because it’s 2019 we all accepted the apology and moved on. Ah, sorry, my mistake, no: because it’s 2019 we’re still talking about it days later and will continue to for many days and possibly years to come. Are there lessons from what history will refer to as #Wreathgate? On the one hand, it does seem like a particularly lazy conspiracy to make Boris Johnson look good: is anyone more likely to vote for the man because he combed his hair once three years ago, rather than looking like he finished all my cans at 3am and, in desperation, moved on to that Lucozade bottle full of amaretto I took to Leeds Fest this summer instead? Very hard to tell. On the other hand: if you’ve ever seen a nerd in a dark room editing video you would realise how particularly difficult it would be to reach three years back into the archives and accidentally splice one shot in among the fresh stuff – it is simply too many mouse-clicks to fathom. On a third hand, which is a thing: Rob Burley, the editor for BBC live political programmes and unlikely star of this election so far, came out and tweeted a Big And Bruising denial (“wave upon wave of insulting, self-righteous and hysterical tweets keep on coming because people really want it to be true”), which perversely makes me believe the conspiracy more. I don’t know what to do. What I do know is this: if you’re going to do a conspiracy in big, big 2019, do it a bit better than that. Do you know how many eyes are watching? Do you know how many high-functioning online entire subreddits dedicated to this there are? Do you know how on edge we all are after the whole Epstein thing? In 2016, American conspiracy heads got carried away and fired a rifle in a pizza parlour because it didn’t have a big enough basement. We’re not in the mood for this any more. You can’t go round splicing respectful footage into other respectful footage and thinking you can get away with it. Do better, BBC. Do better. Other things to hate or enjoy – delete as appropriate Sorry to double-down on Boris Johnson – I know, I know, I’m part of the conspiracy too – but the footage of him going to flooded Derbyshire and tepidly mopping up a Specsavers is very fascinating to me. There’s always something intriguing about watching politicians trying to act like people under the laser-hot glare of the media – we all remember how spectacularly Ed Miliband messed up eating a sandwich just because someone was watching him – but the man cleans like he’s only been introduced to the sheer concept of mopping in a short brief on the car ride over (“It’s a series of strings on the end of a stick, Boris, commonly used on the wetter end of domestic messes”). Would be very up for a series of videos of him just doing things over the next five weeks. Scratching his head over the recycling schedule. Logging into Netflix using only a TV remote. Changing the timer on his oven after the clocks go back. Sky News, hit me up for more. Two key policies from the Lib Dems this week: the first, a proposed lifelong-learning “skills wallet” grant of £10,000 for every adult in the UK – or about one year of tuition fees, if you’re counting. The skills wallet is a sort of manifesto equivalent of stepping on a rake you last left outside nine entire years ago – and has already been picked over by more cerebral columnists, so it falls to me to announce the second: a later breakfast policy at McDonald’s, suggested as a joke by Lib Dem HQ, which would be a disaster for this country. The strict 10.30am cut-off that currently exists works on two levels: it gets hungover people out of bed with some sort of deadline to work to, and it means cooks don’t have to keep a fried egg warm all day in an over-capacity kitchen. If you want an Egg McMuffin, wake up and get it. Anything beyond that is anti-worker, frankly. This should be a far bigger furore than it is. • Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant. He is writing a regular column during the election campaign"

          "bodyText": "Doctors overseeing the transfer of asylum seekers to Australia for medical treatment have raised concerns about delays in their advice being presented to Peter Dutton in the latest official snapshot of activity under the medevac regime. That reference in the report, tabled in the Senate late on Wednesday, will reinforce concerns among refugee advocates that the medical transfer process has been slowed as the Morrison government has counted down the weeks until it can attempt to repeal the medevac regime, which was passed during the last parliament when the Coalition governed in minority. As well as the complaint that advice isn’t getting to Dutton quickly enough, the Independent Health Advice Panel (IHAP) has also flagged concerns about the lack of in-person interpreters available for transferees – “especially those with mental health issues” – and about “lack of movement from Nauru when the panel has recommended transfer to Australia”. The latest report from the medical panel documents that 57 medevac cases were considered between July and September 2019. The independent panel made 12 recommendations to approve a transfer, and upheld Dutton’s decision to refuse the transfer of 45 people. The report also indicates that membership of the IHAP has expanded, and now includes members from the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine and the Australian Psychological Society. The latest snapshot of the medevac regime had been due for tabling within three sitting days after 30 September, but the document was not produced until Labor moved an order for the production of documents in the Senate. The Morrison government wants to repeal the regime but has been is one vote short. The critical swing vote is the independent Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who insisted on having a Senate inquiry into medevac before she made her decision. There was some expectation that the repeal vote would be brought on this week because the Senate is sitting but it has not surfaced yet, and Lambie has previously warned the government against launching pre-emptive action. The medevac laws allow for Australian-based doctors to recommend a refugee or asylum seeker offshore be transferred to Australia for care. The minister can refuse if he disagrees with the clinical assessment – in which case it goes to the independent medical panel for review – or on security or criminal grounds. The panel cannot override vetoes based on security or criminal concerns. Labor, the Greens, key crossbenchers, and most relevant stakeholders have opposed a repeal of the laws. This story was amended on 19 November 2019 to clarify that the independent panel made 12 recommendations to approve a transfer, and upheld Dutton’s decision to refuse the transfer of 45 people."

          "headline": "Europe needs another cultural revolution. But who would lead it?",
          "bodyText": "I was an East Berlin student in 1989 when Mikhail Gorbachev visited the GDR and warned our leaders that if they didn’t change, they would be overrun by history. Theatres and churches became pop-up platforms for real democracy. Rock bands played the anthems of change and stopped caring about state censorship. Half a million people took over Alexanderplatz in Berlin in a show of extraordinary courage and optimism. I was filled with hope and anxiety. And then the Wall came down: the defining moment of my life. I knew then that nothing was impossible; that hope had won. Europe could reunite in peace. Over the next three decades I would become a practising European citizen with a British-German family living in six different European countries. All was good. Fast-forward to 2019 and my feelings of hope and anxiety are strangely familiar. A new kind of polarisation threatens the gains of European cooperation. Unacceptable levels of inequality erode the fabric of our societies; gaps of understanding and trust divide citizens and those they perceive as elites. Shortly after the excitement of the 1989 revolution, an arrogant sense of the end of history set in. What else did we need beyond fine-tuning the wonderful twin-engines of capitalism and democracy? The collapse of the Soviet empire happened in the heyday of neoliberal capitalism, bringing with it aggressive privatisation, the rolling back of state regulation and, praise the lord, shareholder values. This neoliberal medicine was prescribed for the former communist countries in the form of economic shock therapy, which produced mixed results but was always accompanied by rocketing levels of inequality. I guess for most Easterners, myself included, copying the western way of life seemed good enough for a while. But a copy-and-paste revolution is not a real revolution. The 2008 financial crash, ground zero for postwar capitalism, should have been a warning that capitalism needed more than a facelift. And instead of just imitating the over-consumption and remote governance of western Europe, the newly reunited continent should have leapfrogged into an era of more sustainable economics and revived grassroots democracy. Historically it was a missed opportunity for imagining a better Europe, together. Artists and cultural workers played a central role in 1989. They disobeyed, they challenged, they offered hope and strength and energised people who had been resigned to the status quo. I think of the East German actor Ulrich Mühe, who used the stage to call for a peaceful revolution and who later starred as a Stasi officer in the Oscar-winning The Lives of Others. I think of André Herzberg, frontman of the band Pankow, the Rolling Stones of the GDR, whose every concert, every song, was a call to rebellion and freedom. I think of Václav Havel, who went from dissident playwright to Czech president. The revolution of 1989 was cultural as well as political. What was also remarkable was how public spaces, town centres, marketplaces, theatres, stadiums, railway stations, were occupied by the forces of hope. Graffiti and leaflets appeared everywhere. Satire and humour were deployed to powerful effect. Today our public and civic spaces are shrinking, more restricted, more segregated and more commercial,usually covered in advertising. And when governments turn autocratic, public spaces are especially vulnerable to surveillance abuse and manipulation. So what’s happened to artists in the last 30 years? Did they keep up the pressure or sink into complacency? Did we all sink into complacency? I believe artists and cultural figures can and must again be the drivers of change. They can imagine a better Europe beyond simplistic talk of growth rates. They can help save Europe from nostalgia for 20th-century nationalism. Because the most pressing challenges of our times, like climate destruction, are global. The European public sphere is still weak. But where it exists, art and culture have been its forerunners. Look at the range of European orchestras, festivals, exhibitions, pop culture and architecture. Don’t forget Eurovision or the Champions League – seriously. But at a time when US and Chinese digital platforms dominate the European public space, European governments and institutions also need to invest in a digital architecture based on democratic values and European privacy standards. And artists can demystify and rehumanise digital technology. We also need to invest in European experiences of all sorts: studying together, playing sports, working, cooking, creating startups and helping each other out in times of crisis. Shared experiences create a sense of belonging, a European sense of purpose separate from big EU declarations. The EU’s Erasmus programme is the world biggest student exchange programme but it should be considered a pilot for a much bigger investment, which goes well beyond students and young people. We need an Erasmus for all. Times of anxiety are also times of opportunity. They create urgency and a demand for imagination. By drawing on the lessons of 1989, we can turn these times of anxiety into times of hope again. • Andre Wilkens is director of the European Cultural Foundation"

Leave immediately and leave now alerts had been issued at locations including Kinkuna Waters, Pechey, Buxton, Woodgate/Walkers Point Road, Kilkivan and Noosa North Shore. There were 293 vehicles across all of the fires around the state. 14 homes had been destroyed. 100 interstate and international personnel had arrived in the state to assist. Very high to severe conditions were expected to persist across Queensland. Conditions may ease in some areas on Thursday but severe fire danger was expected again into the weekend. In New South Wales: There were 76 active fires. None were currently at emergency warning level, most were at watch and act or advice level. Conditions eased on Wednesday after the catastrophic and extreme fire danger ratings on Tuesday. Thursday was forecast to bring very high fire danger across much of the state, as was Friday, with potentially severe fire danger on Friday in the greater Hunter region. The very high fire danger being experienced in the north-east of the state was expected to continue for the rest of the week. The Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said severe conditions forecast for the weekend would be followed by another burst of hot air next week, meaning crews “simply aren’t going to get the upper hand on all of these fires”. In Western Australia: One fire was at emergency warning level at Drummond Cove in Geraldton. A second fire, the Utakarra fire in Geraldton had been downgraded to watch and act. AAP was reporting that two homes had been destroyed and two homes had been damaged in Geraldton. AAP has this on the fire at Noosa North Shore: Residents and holidaymakers have piled onto boats to escape a large out of control bushfire whipped up by gusty winds on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast. Firefighters and water bombers battled the blaze that jumped containment lines at Noosa North Shore on the northern banks of the Noosa River on Wednesday afternoon. “About two hours ago we thought we had it contained but the wind is terribly variable at the moment,” Noosa mayor Tony Wellington told AAP. “A change of wind means it’s now spotting beyond containment lines.” Mr Wellington said the entire population of about 180 residents and holidaymakers had been evacuated from the peninsula of land that adjoins the Great Sandy National Park. The only way in and out of the area is by ferry or private boat, he said. “This is the second time they’ve been evacuated ... they were evacuated over the weekend during the Cooroibah fire,” he said. Another alert from Queensland: Buxton, leave immediately. From AAP: A bushfire has reportedly destroyed two homes and damaged two others in Geraldton in Western Australia’s Mid West region. Mayor Shane Van Styn said he had been told about property loss at Utakarra but it was yet to be officially confirmed. Mr Van Styn said he had not heard of any injuries. Strong, hot winds would drive a separate blaze towards coastal Drummond Cove, north of Geraldton, if it was not contained, Mr Van Styn said. An emergency warning remains in place for Drummond Cove, neighbouring Glenfield and Utakarra. “These fires commenced in vacant properties next to residential areas and are very fast moving,” Mr Van Styn told AAP. He said students who usually took buses home to those areas were being kept at school for the time being. Roads have been closed and motorists are asked to avoid the areas. Kinkuna Waters: Leave now Some more from the Elands, NSW resident Susie Russell, who has highlighted a problem some residents of other rural areas have also spoken to Guardian Australia about this week. She says it has been very difficult to get timely information in and out of Elands about the fire situation. A phone tower was recently installed to bring communication to the town, but it’s been down since Friday. Residents who remain in Elands have been going to a single spot where they can get phone reception from another point on the coast. Another resident, Jarra Hicks, told Guardian Australia people had doorknocked on Monday to alert friends and family of the need to evacuate. Residents have been trying to highlight the need for a generator. “They could bring in a generator to power the tower instead of us all having to drive around like crazy or ring triple zero to find out what’s going on,” Russell says. “That would be one thing they could do to make this community safer. That would be one practical thing they could do tomorrow.” The emergency warning for the southern part of the suburb of Utakarra in Geraldton, Western Australia remains in place. An update from Elands in northern NSW from resident Susie Russell. Most of the village was evacuated on Monday night, but Russell is among a small group of residents who chose to stay and defend property. The town has a small volunteer fire crew that has been battling multiple fires, including the Rumba Dump fire. She says the fires are being controlled, but the threat remains. “We dodged a bullet last night,” Russell says. “The southerly wasn’t as strong as we feared. Our magnificent fire captain got permission to do a backburn, which worked really well. “The 15 houses that would have otherwise gone up in smoke are still standing strong.” Elands is in steep country and fires are making their way along the tops of the ridges, Russell says. It’s usually very green as well, but at a time of year when they would normally have had more than a metre of rainfall, they’ve had less than 500mm. “The country is just really, really in trouble. Everything around here looks like it’s going to burn and there’s no rain in sight,” Russell says. Some more on the Pechey fire from the QFES Facebook page: Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) advises there is a bushfire approaching Pechey. Leaving immediately is the safest option, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive. Follow your bushfire survival plan now. If you do not have a plan, your safest option is to leave immediately if it is clear to do so. If you cannot leave, identify where you will seek shelter from the bushfire. If you are not in the area, do not return, as conditions are too dangerous. Currently as at 5.10pm, Wednesday 13 November, a fast-moving fire is travelling in a north-easterly direction between Pechey and Hampton. It is expected to impact Deeth Road, Lanyon Road, Williams Road and Pechey Forestry Road, Pechey in the coming hours. The fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community. You can find the full post here. Another alert for the Pechey fire in Queensland. Leave immediately. Conditions have eased at the Hillville Road fire in NSW. The fire has been downgraded to watch and act. There have been a rising number of “leave now” or “leave immediately” warnings in Queensland in the last hour: Kilkivan Noosa North Shore Buxton (part of Woodgate/Walkers Point fire) Pechey (near Hampton) Woodgate/Walkers Point Road Kinkuna Waters (part of Woodgate/Walkers Point Road fire) Woodgate/Walkers Point Road (south of Bundaberg) grass fire You can find the full details of each warning here on the QFES Facebook page. Queensland firefighters say the Kilkivan fire could reach Thornside Road and Upper Thornside Road soon. A bit more detail is filtering through about the helicopter incident on the Darling Downs, near one of the state’s most concerning bushfires. Most concerning is that the Pechey fire appeared to breach containment lines after the incident. It is not yet clear whether other aerial operations were suspended temporarily as a result. About 2pm the aircraft – a private water-bombing helicopter run by McDermott Aviation – got into trouble while attempting to land near Grapetree Road. It came down hard – though there remains some conjecture about whether it constituted a “crash landing” or just a rough landing. The pilot, in his 70s, has been taken to hospital in a stable condition, but will likely be OK. Queensland Ambulance earlier described his injuries as minor. Some aerial images have come in via an ABC journalist of the helicopter. Certainly looks nasty. And here is a photo from South Turramurra yesterday: An update on the South Turramurra fire: The Ku-ring-gai mayor, Jennifer Anderson, has slammed potential arson in South Turramurra as an “almost unimaginable” act during Tuesday’s catastrophic fire conditions on Sydney’s upper north shore. Police are investigating whether multiple fires in bushland around South Turramurra were deliberately lit on Tuesday afternoon. One fire, in dense bush off Canoon Road, came within metres of homes. It was stopped by an intense firefighting effort involving water bombing with a pink-coloured fire retardant. Anderson told the Guardian the cause of the fire was still being investigated by police. “As mayor it seems almost unimaginable that someone would put our community in such danger,” she said. “With the total fire ban still in place, we ask residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity near bushland to police.” NSW police said they had no update on the status of their investigation. Many homes in Turramurra were still coated with a pink layer of fire retardant on Wednesday. The chemicals are essentially fertilisers (ammonium and diammonium sulphate and ammonium phosphate) mixed with a red-coloured pigment, made from iron oxide. Firefighters use the pigment so they can see where retardant has already been deployed. The council is cleaning the chemicals off at no extra charge. The clean-up is expected to take several days. Some new images showing spot fires breaking out at Hillville today. The RFS has just issued a new emergency warning for the fire. The NSW Rural Fire Service has issued the first emergency warning for NSW for Wednesday for a fire at Hillville Road, Hillville on the mid-north coast. The New South Wales parliament had been set this week to debate legislation that would try to stop planning authorities from blocking coal and gas developments because of their scope 3 emissions. Environment groups had called for the debate to be postponed given the bushfire disaster in NSW and a protest was held outside the parliament in Sydney on Tuesday. It now looks like that legislation will be debated in the lower house next week. The one-week delay means it is unlikely to be debated by the legislative council until next year. A short inquiry will be held into the bill over the summer break. Back in NSW: Brad Edge is a resident of Congarinni on the mid-north coast of NSW. We spoke to him on Monday when fires were threatening his property. He and his family had been evacuated from several different locations. On Wednesday he said the situation has not improved and his house remained under threat. Containment lines had been put in on his property. “The fire has broken the containment lines,” he said. “So now the RFS is backburning. They’re going to burn about 40 acres of bush. “You can see it from the house now. “The closer it gets and the hotter it burns, it’s harder to control. But I hope it’s controlled.” Edge has spent the day helping a friend prepare his property, which is now also threatened. “As they say, this won’t be over for quite a while,” he said. The mayor of Toowoomba, Paul Antonio, was speaking live to ABC News 24 when word came through a water-bombing helicopter had crashed in the area. The Queensland Ambulance Service is calling it a “heavy landing” and says the pilot has minor injuries. Residents of Pechey and Hampton, to the north of Toowoomba, have been told to leave their properties with the fire front approaching. Antonio said he wasn’t aware, but was thankful to the fixed-wing and helicopter pilots who were helping to fight the fires. “Our thoughts are with all concerned and we are looking forward to it working out the right way,” he said. “There was three aeroplanes and a number of helicopters involved [because] parts of this fire are in inaccessible country. “The fire is well resourced.” An update on the pilot involved in the helicopter crash. The ABC is reporting the pilot has survived. The Queensland Ambulance Service is calling it a heavy landing, rather than a crash, and says the pilot is being treated for minor injuries. Some breaking news: The ABC is reporting a water-bombing helicopter has crashed while fighting a fire at Pechey on the Darling Downs, west of Brisbane. The Queensland Ambulance Service and the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services are responding, a QFES spokesman said. “QFES is seeking further clarification regarding the condition of the pilot,” he said. More than 70 fires continue to burn across NSW, and 61 across Queensland. Conditions eased compared to the catastrophic danger ratings in NSW yesterday, but worsened in Queensland. In Queensland: An emergency “leave immediately” warning was issued for Noosa North Shore. Five “leave now” warnings were issued: Pechey, Woodgate/Walkers Point, Kinkuna Waters, Kilkivan, and Spicers Peak Lodge. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk confirmed 14 homes had been lost, 13 of them in the Cobraball fire near Yeppoon. Severe conditions were declared for Wide Bay and Burnett, Darling Downs and Granite Belt and the Southeast Coast. In NSW: Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was relieved no lives were lost yesterday. 21 people were injured yesterday – 13 of them firefighters and eight members of the public. None of the injuries were life-threatening. At least 50 homes were damaged or destroyed yesterday. There were 2,000 calls to triple zero yesterday. NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said that coordination had “never been better” than yesterday in fighting the fires. But he warned that we still had “the worst of the summer ahead of us” and that “the science is suggesting, and we are experiencing, that fire seasons are starting earlier and are extending longer”. Today, severe conditions were declared for New England. An update on the Noosa North Shore fire, which is still at emergency and still at “leave immediately”. “The fire may soon impact the Wallaby Track so residents on Noosa North Shore are advised to leave immediately. The fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community. People leaving the area should take the Noosa River Ferry to Moorindil Street. An evacuation centre has been established at the Noosa Leisure Centre on Wallace Drive. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services has issued a new and separate warning for Kinkuna Waters, near the existing Woodgate/Walkers Point Road fire, which is also at “leave now”. “A fast-moving bushfire is burning near Woodgate Road and Woppis Road, travelling towards Kinkuna Waters Estate,” QFES say. “Residents in Kinkuna Waters Estate should evacuate west on Woodgate Road towards Goodwood. “There is a separate warning current for residents in Woodgate/Walkers Point Road. Residents in this area should follow instructions given in that warning.” This is what a watch and act fire looks like. This photo from Monday, taken by a Nasa satellite, shows the smoke all along the coast. Police are also investigating 12 fires for potential arson, according to AAP. Those include three fires in Balgownie near Wollongong and four fires throughout Morisset near Lake Macquarie. They are also looking at suspicious fires in Sydney’s South Turramurra, at Loftus in the Royal national park, at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, at Wollongong’s Berkeley and at Moonbi near Tamworth. Five men have been caught today breaching the state’s total fire ban, AAP reports. One man allegedly resisted arrest when he was caught lighting candles at a Campbelltown campsite. Others were lighting barbecues and incinerating rubbish. Two men have also been charged after being found with allegedly stolen RFS equipment. The first man was allegedly found with an RFS uniform and documentation in Lismore, northern NSW, and the second man was found in Loftus impersonating a firefighter and wearing a Fire and Rescue NSW uniform. Some footage of a spot fire from Hillville, from Jessica Hromas and Michael McGowan on the scene. Smoke alert for Mackay: Residents of Pechey (near Hampton) have been told to leave now, and head towards the New England Highway. “There is a bushfire in Pechey and Hampton and conditions are getting worse,” the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service says. “A fast moving fire is travelling from Grapetree Road towards Deeth Road, Sewell Road, Parker Road, Bush Road and Misty Mountain Road. It is currently impacting Parker Road and Sewell Road. The fire could have a significant impact on the community.” Images of Walkers Point, which is also at “leave now”. More photos from Jessica Hromas from Rainbow Flat, where the volunteer Rural Fire Service base sadly burnt down while they were fighting other fires. Taronga Zoo has sent us this advice for what to do if you find wildlife affected by bushfires. Put your own safety first Be aware of ongoing danger from fire, embers, downed power lines or trees and only attempt to rescue animals if it is safe to do so. Bats should only be handled by a trained person who has appropriate vaccination. Snakes should be handled by a trained reptile handler unless confirmed as non-venomous. When picking up an injured animal use a towel or gloves to prevent injury to yourself. Keep the animal cool (not cold) and in a quiet area It is best to keep them at comfortable room temperature. It is a good idea to keep a cardboard box or light pillow slip in your car to contain injured wildlife rather than keeping it wrapped in a towel. When transporting an injured animal, turn on the car air conditioner, turn off the radio and get the animal to help as soon as possible. If you cannot transport it immediately, keep it in a quiet, dark room. Do not disturb the animal once rescued as it will be highly stressed and frightened. Minimise noise (eg radios, loud voices) and keep household pets away. Offer water It is OK to offer the animal a shallow dish of water to drink. Water may also be offered from a syringe or dropper but do not force the animal to drink. Seek veterinary care as soon as possible. Do not attempt to treat the animal yourself and do not apply cream or ointments to injuries. Take injured wildlife to your local vet, or call WIRES (1300 094 737) or Sydney Wildlife Carers (9413 4300) for assistance. You can also call the Taronga Wildlife Hospital for advice on 9978 4785. Incredible pictures here of the smoke from the beach at Noosa North Shore. A nervous few hours for residents and firefighters in Hillville, just outside of Taree. Homes have already been lost in the suburb and on Wednesday morning winds picked up and began pushing the fire in a north-westerly direction. We watched as one family fought desperately to stop spot fires making their way up the hill towards their home. No sooner did it look like the blaze was under control, when an ember would spark somewhere else in the dry paddocks. Two helicopters dropped water on homes as a fire crew tried to stop the blaze in its tracks. Everyone here is nervous, it seems. Tuesday’s catastrophic conditions may have passed, but they know they are not out of the woods yet. The Noosa North Shore fire has worsened, and there is now an emergency warning and a “leave immediately” warning in place. Previously, the fire was at “leave now”. “Leaving immediately is the safest option, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive,” says QFES. “An unpredictable fire is burning on Noosa North Shore near the First Cutting. “People leaving the area should take the Noosa River Ferry to Moorindil Street. An evacuation centre has been established at the Noosa Leisure Centre on Wallace Drive. “Conditions are now very dangerous and firefighters may soon be unable to prevent the fire advancing. The fire may pose a threat to all lives directly in its path.” People in Walkers Point south of Bundaberg are being told to evacuate. A fast-moving bushfire is burning near Woodgate Road and Woppis Road, burning towards Walkers Point Road and conditions are getting worse. Those in the Woodgate township are not yet required to evacuate at this time, but QFES says that “if you do not have a plan, your safest option is to leave now if it is clear to do so”. Those in the Walkers Point area should evacuate via Walkers Point Road, towards Woodgate Bowls Club, Kangaroo Court. Just breaking now – an exclusive story from my colleague Anne Davies. Yesterday, as bushfires raged, a meeting of NSW bureaucrats were directly told in an email to “not discuss the links between climate change and bushfires”. The bureaucrats were at a conference about adapting to climate change. “For those attending AdaptNSW today, public affairs has issued advice not to discuss the link between climate change and bushfires,” the email said. Read the full story here: Queensland authorities have updated their advice on the fire heading towards Noosa North Shore and say conditions are unpredictable, “very dangerous” and that firefighters might not be able to stop its advance. The fire is burning on Noosa North Shore, near the beach at First Cutting. It may soon head towards Wallaby Track. Residents are advised to leave immediately. “The fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community.” The evacuation centre is at the Noosa Leisure Centre, on Wallace Drive. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) has issued another leave now advisory, this time for a bushfire at Kilkivan, near Gympie. “Currently as at 11.30am Wednesday, 13 November, a large fire is burning in the vicinity of the Des Simpson Memorial, heading in a south-westerly direction towards Thornside Road and Upper Thornside Road. “The fire is likely to impact Thornside Road and Upper Thornside Road within 30 minutes. The fire could have a significant impact on the community. “Those residents looking to self-evacuate should travel along Thornside Road onto Upper Widgee Road heading towards Gympie.” Some new images from Queensland yesterday, from photographer Cam Neville in Tarome and Lower Beechmont. There is severe fire danger across the southern part of Queensland today, with hot, dry and windy conditions. The Bureau of Meteorology’s Victoria Dodds says a predicted wind change is adding “real complexity to the forecast, and it will make conditions really challenging for our firefighters on the ground”. “We’ve got a south-westerly change – a cold front that’s moving in – and we’ve also got a south-easterly change. “There’s a bit of a battle of air masses at the moment. With that south-westerly and the south-easterlies, where that air comes together, there is the potential for some thunderstorms to form this afternoon. “The air is really, really dry, so we’re not going to see any significant rainfall with these thunderstorms, but there’s definitely the potential for some lightning.” The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is providing an update on bushfires and confirms 14 homes have been lost in the state. The main areas of concern are in the Scenic Rim area and near Noosa, where people are being asked to leave. “Now is not the time to be complacent, the conditions are of concern to us,” Palaszczuk said. The premier said reinforcements were arriving from Tasmania today to assist with the firefighting effort, joining New Zealanders who arrived yesterday. More than $40m in estimated insured losses have been claimed following the NSW bushfires, with plenty more to come, according to the industry’s national peak body, AAP reports. Insurance Council Australia spokesman Campbell Fuller said more than 360 claims had been made from catastrophe areas, including 80 properties that could be total losses. Fuller said the catastrophe declaration made by the ICA on Saturday meant every claim would be prioritised by insurers. Fuller advised policyholders affected by the bushfires to contact their insurers as soon as possible, even if the extent of damage was yet to be determined. “If they know their home has been badly damaged, then the insurer is made aware of it and can work out how best to help them, because that’s what insurers try to do – lower or reduce the financial, physical and emotional distress that these property owners have experienced,” he said. Footage of residents leaving Noosa here: And photos of the fire: A leave now alert has been issued for Noosa North Shore, near Beach Road and the First Cutting, 10km from Noosaville. “The fire may impact the Wallaby Track soon so residents are advised to leave now, the QFES says. “This fire could have a significant impact on the community.” “People leaving the area should take the Noosa River Ferry to Moorindil Street.” Previously, two fires were burning in the area, and have now been combined into one alert. They were at watch and act and advice previously. “Follow your bushfire survival plan now. If you do not have a plan, your safest option is to leave now if it is clear to do so. If you are not in the area, do not return, as conditions are too dangerous. “An evacuation centre has been established at the Noosa Leisure Centre on Wallace Drive. “Ground crews and waterbombing aircraft are working to contain the fire but firefighters may not be able to protect every property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door. Power, water and mobile phone service may be lost.” Something from Sydney: a major exhibition of the art of Banksy will be closing abruptly from today – due to heatwave concerns over the next few weeks. It was above 35C in Sydney yesterday, and in a statement, the exhibition said “the collection of artworks on display in the exhibition’s temporary marquee structure have to be very carefully climate-controlled”. “This can no longer be guaranteed due to the heatwave, which is forecast to continue over the coming weeks.” The exhibition was scheduled to run until Sunday 1 December, but will close now. Some footage of the bright pink firefighting effort in Turramurra. Our photo editor Jessica Hromas is on the mid-north coast, and took these photos in Rainbow Flat, where fires rages last weekend. Footage of commissioner Fitzsimmons speaking this morning, and a video wrap up of the fires still burning today. Four alleged breaches of the NSW total fire ban have occurred this week, according to the state’s police. The first was a 27-year-old man who lit a small campfire at Wallacia in Sydney’s west on Monday to boil water for tea, AAP reports. He extinguished the flames when authorities arrived and was fined $2200. A 35-year-old man at Lalor Park in Sydney’s west on Tuesday also allegedly burned fence palings in a cylindrical barbecue, causing a fire. A third man allegedly lit a small coal barbecue. And a nine-year-old boy was warned in Nowra after he and a group of other children admitted to using a blowtorch to light a grass fire. There is also a total fire ban in place today. Three different weather fronts could cause uncertainty, the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services assistant commissioner Tony Johnstone has told the ABC. “We’ve got a cold air and a warm air and when the cold air and the warm air sort of mix we end up with three different wind directions, which can basically turn ... the flank of a fire into a head fire pretty quickly,” he said. “Potentially ... we could actually have three different weather fronts.” One of the major concerns for Queensland right now are the communities west of Brisbane and the Gold Coast, AAP reports. But the large Cobraball fire near Yeppoon, which has been burning for days, is also a concern. The fire is only 70% contained, and erratic weather and strengthening gusts could fan its flames. Thirteen of the 14 houses lost in Queensland were as a result of the Cobraball fire. Gusts are expected to near 50km/h later in the day, with temperatures in some areas 6C to 8C above average. An update from Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, where actor Russell Crowe’s property was one of the many affected. Last night Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce responded to criticism after he said yesterday that two of the people who died “most likely” were Greens voters. Joyce had said the Greens were to blame for worsening fires because their influence meant fire services had not conducted sufficient hazard-reduction burns. He told Sky News on Tuesday: “I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party” but said he did not want to attack them or the Greens but focus on the policy mix. On Tuesday night he released a statement: “No matter which party an individual votes for, they do not deserve the tragedy that fell upon the Wytaliba bushfire victims. “Any suggestion that I said otherwise is a deliberate misinterpretation. Tragedies such as this transcend party politics.” On Monday, Nationals leader and deputy prime minister Michael McCormack said any link between climate change and the worsening bushfires was “woke capital-city greenies ravings” and “cheap political point-scoring”. Russell Irving, the project coordinator of the Minyumai Indigenous Protected Area, has written in with an open letter. The Minyumai protected area is a 2,000 hectare conservation reserve near Woodburn on the north NSW coast. It’s home to endangered animals, provides employment to locals and holds deep cultural significance to the Bundjalung traditional owners. “Our protected area is currently under direct threat by the Myall Creek fire,” he writes. “We’ve had fires in previous years which have been controlled and limited in scale due to the annual fuel reduction burns ... These and other fire control measures have become largely ineffectual in the face of the devastating and growing impacts of climate change in the region. “We are in the grip of a severe drought which has rendered the gullies, waterfalls and creeks bone dry for years. Fuel reduction burns can only rarely be safely conducted due to the shortening winter periods and when fires do occur they are driven by extreme above-average temperatures, hot dry winds and low humidity. “The 10 Bandjalang Aboriginal rangers we employ and their families are at risk of losing their workplace and livelihoods. Many have lost their homes from the nearby Bora Ridge fire and others are suffering ill health from the smoke. “We (and many of our small-scale agricultural neighbours) are at threat of becoming members of the rapidly growing number of climate refugees in this country. “Although we welcome the ‘thoughts and prayers’ of politicians it is not enough ... Australians are crying out for action on manmade climate change.” Despite helping to protect his and a few other neighbour’s homes, Col’s neighbour says he feels guilty he wasn’t able to stop the fire tearing through his friend’s property. “I wasn’t sleeping, just lying in bed about midnight hearing the crash of the trees. I heard a big bang and thought it was just another tree but when I came back here in the morning, it was the roar of the house going.” A few days later, he’s still reliving Friday night. It was scary, he said, to watch the speed at which the fire moved up the ridge near his home. “It’s an adrenaline rush, you know, I slept four hours last night and that’s the most I’ve slept in days. I’m tired and I’m aching but I was still up at 5am,” he said. The road into Rainbow Flat is still cut off, and since the fire he says he’s been living off Vegemite sandwiches. Yesterday, though, a friend dropped off some eggs and a slab of beer so he treated himself to six scrambled eggs and “about 10 beers”. “And I’ll back it up again,” he told me. A few days later, people are starting to filter back in but to a very different-looking Rainbow Flat. Leo and Geesje Carter evacuated on Thursday night and drove to Taree. It took them a couple of days to get back. Their home survived, but they were shocked at how close the fire came to their bush-facing property. “Luckily the fence survived, I just finished building the thing,” Leo said. Col Meredith was one of the few who stayed behind in Rainbow Flat near Taree when fires tore through on Friday night. “My son lives in Singleton, he was saying ‘Dad just go, go into Forster’, I said mate I’m not going anywhere,” he said this morning. Col’s house survived, but his neighbour a few hundred metres up the road wasn’t so lucky. Guardian Australia found him clearing their driveway and watching out for potential looters. “The roar of the thing on Friday night, it’s like nothing else, believe me. I was here with the firies and had to come up on to the bitumen just to try to breathe for a minute,” he said. Queensland is bracing for another day of fires on par with those in September, which remarkably damaged pockets of subtropical rainforest and the iconic Binna Burra Lodge. Yesterday police told the Gold Coast Bulletin that fire had been started by a cigarette discarded by a group of teenagers. On today of all days it should serve as a reminder that the hot, dry and windy conditions can fuel dangerous fires, but that taking precautions and adhering to fire bans could prevent them breaking out in the first instance. NSW RFS commissioner Fitzsimmons has just said: “We are mindful that the science is suggesting, and we are experiencing, that fire seasons are starting earlier and are extending longer.” “There is no doubt that this drought is having a profound effect,” he says. When asked about the coming summer, he sounds a word of warning. “The risk is here. The risk is real. We’ve got the worst of the summer, the worst of the season still ahead of us as we head into summer.” Fitzsimmons says he has never seen better coordination than yesterday – between emergency services, governments, media and more. “I don’t think the coordination, cooperation, integration arrangements have ever been better in this state than what I’ve observed yesterday,” he said. “Unequivocally, yesterday, we saw together all the jurisdictions, the state’s agencies, the community, the media, come together like I’ve never seen before, and we will take a lot of lessons out of that.” Fire and Rescue commissioner Paul Baxter adds that there were 2,000 calls to Triple Zero yesterday. He paid tribute to the quick work of agencies. “I think that the reports of minimal loss of property, life and injuries, is indicative of the preparations that have been done by all the agencies. “The fires that we did see occurring in the urban areas, such as the Turramurra incident yesterday, were dealt with really quickly. We threw a weight of response in and a speed of response and that was an incident that showed fire rescue crews, along with RFS crews and Parks and Wildlife crews, working together seamlessly.” Shane Fitzsimmons says there will be hotter, worse conditions next week. And many of the fires burning today will still be burning then. “We will not have all these fires contained before then,” he says. “We will not have all these fires contained and locked up for many, many weeks. “Unfortunately, what we need is rain. What we need is meaningful rain. And there is certainly nothing in the forecast for the foreseeable future that’s going to make any discernible difference to the conditions that we are experiencing.” NSW RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons is speaking in Sydney now. He says there have now been an estimated 300 homes destroyed since the start of fire season, after 50 were damaged or lost yesterday. There are 17 fires today at watch and act, with none at emergency. But that is “subject to the weather today” and “we could still see some volatility” and changes to that. “The reality is it could have bene a whole lot worse,” he says. And in map form: The New England fire area – which includes Glen Innes, Tenterfield, Uralla, Walcha and Armidale – is the only one in NSW rated at severe today. Fires have been raging in those areas for days now. All other areas, all up the north coast, are at very high. As the political fingerpointing flared up yesterday, and continues today, read this from Graham Readfearn to get the facts behind the debate around hazard reduction. The latest figures on the bushfires, via AAP. In NSW: 83 fires are burning, 50 uncontained. More than 1.1 million hectares have burned, more than the past three bushfire seasons combined. The catastrophic fire danger rating has been lowered to “very high” for the Greater Sydney, Hunter and Illawarra/Shoalhaven regions. Very high fire danger ratings are also in effect for the southern and central ranges and north-western, northern slopes, north coast and far north coast regions. Armidale is one notch higher, with a fire danger rating of “severe”. 3,000 firefighters deployed or on standby, 80 aircraft at the ready, 400 fire trucks in the field. 21 people were injured – 13 of them firefighters and eight members of the public. None of the injuries were life-threatening. In Queensland: 61 fires burning ahead of dangerous wind change on Wednesday Severe fire danger for the south-east coast (including Brisbane, the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast); the Darling Downs and Granite Belt; and the Wide Bay and Burnett region. Temperatures near some fire grounds to reach 6C to 8C above average The Cobraball fire near Yeppoon continues to burn out of control State of fire emergency in force across 42 local government areas, total ban on outdoor fires and activities that can spark fires. At least 50 homes were damaged or destroyed yesterday in NSW, the RFS has confirmed. In South Australia overnight, the fire near Port Lincoln was also contained. It had earlier been at emergency alert on Monday evening. SA Country Fire Service said: “Fire activity and weather conditions on the fireground have abated with decreasing winds, rising relative humidity and low temperatures continuing to aid firefighting efforts.” But hot spots and burning trees are expected to burn for several days. In Western Australia an emergency fire that broke out on the outskirts of Perth was also contained and downgraded yesterday afternoon. The fire in Bullsbrook in the City of Swan flared up quickly and went to emergency alert as it raced towards homes. But in the evening it was downgraded and contained with no homes destroyed. Residents are still being advised to remain vigilant. The Spicers Peak Lodge in Queensland, which has a leave now warning in place, has already been evacuated, AAP reports. No guests stayed at the lodge overnight and staff were doorknocked early on Wednesday. The Spicers Peak fire is moving quickly and is threatening all buildings nearby. Meanwhile other parts of the Scenic Rim in Queensland are also facing fires. Local mayor Greg Christensen told ABC radio he fears another black day for his community. “It has the potential to be, absolutely, because of the severity of the conditions and the number of fire fronts,” he said. On Tuesday, inmates from the low-security Palen Creek correctional centre, 100km south-east of the lodge, were evacuated to another prison. For Queensland today, a dramatic wind change to come later on has the potential to shift fire fronts and cause more uncertainty. Conditions are worse today than yesterday, and more than 60 fires are currently burning across the state. The NSW RFS has confirmed that as of 8.18am AEDT, there are no fires at emergency warning. Yesterday, there were 19 different fires at emergency, and at its peak, 16 at the same time. Conditions remain difficult, and fires unpredictable today. The RFS tweet above has a small typo – it should say “advice or watch and act” rather than “advice or emergency”. The map and current website confirms that there are none at emergency. And here is Rodney Smith and his dog Bundy in the bowling club, safe and waiting to go home. The Tuncurry bowling club on Tuesday night was where residents of the twin towns of Forster-Tuncurry, 35km from Taree, evacuated. My colleague Michael McGowan was there, speaking to the 80 or so people who had gathered, some of them holding “dogs, birds, cats and goldfish”. “We’re a bit of a menagerie at the moment and it looks a bit like Noah’s ark out the back,” said the manager, Terry Green. Police also believe it is possible that the fire in Turramurra was deliberately lit. AAP report that police have set up a crime scene in the upper north shore suburb as they work to establish the cause of the blaze. Officers were seen searching a car and speaking to two young males at Canoon Road, they reported. Yesterday, a nearby fire at Kissing Point Road was also briefly at emergency level but was quickly brought under control and downgraded to advice. Yesterday evening, an emergency alert was issued for South Turramurra, on the outskirts of north Sydney, as fires tore through scrubland. It was eventually contained after firefighters dramatically dropped bright pink fire retardant over homes, cars, and even people. Firefighters have spent the night still putting out spot fires in the suburb. My colleagues Helen Davidson and Christopher Knaus had this report. Actor Russell Crowe’s home in Nana Glen, 25km from Coffs Harbour, has also been hit by the fires, he confirmed on Wednesday morning. Queensland is also set for exceptionally poor air quality today – a combination of smoke from fires and airborne dust from the Darling Downs. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has confirmed that no lives were lost yesterday during catastrophic conditions, and said she was “hugely relieved”. On Tuesday catastrophic conditions were declared for three regions, and 300 new fire fronts were started. Fifteen different fires were at emergency warning level, at various times. But no lives were lost and nobody is missing. “I have to confess to being hugely relieved this morning that yesterday our amazing volunteers and emergency service personnel withstood the catastrophic conditions and did manage to save life and property,” Berejiklian told media in Sydney on Wednesday morning. Three people died last week over Friday and Saturday. NSW emergency services minister David Elliott said the result was “a dividend paid by the great preparation” of the NSW Rural Fire Service. NSW remains in a state of emergency and a statewide total fire ban is in place. There are currently 83 fires burning across NSW, 50 of which are uncontained. In Queensland this morning, there are six fires at watch and act or higher: Barney View/Palen Creek (Mount Barney fire) Clumber and Moogerah (south of Boonah). Mount Alphen and Double Top is part of this fire Tarome Rosevale (south west of Ipswich) Kilkivan Cobraball/Bungundarra/Maryvale/Lake Mary fire near Rockhampton. The Adelaide Park fire is part of this fire The Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald carried the same striking front page picture by AAP photographer Dan Peled of Sharnie Moren and her 18-month-old daughter Charlotte looking on as bushfires burned near Coffs Harbour. AAP has filed this report from Queensland on preparations for today’s extreme conditions across the state: Residents north of Rockhampton in the path of a raging bushfire have been warned to prepare to leave. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services say the fire is still travelling from Cobraball – south-west of Yeppoon in central Queensland, where homes have been lost in recent days – towards Bungundarra, Maryvale and Lake Mary. “The fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community,” the QFES said early on Wednesday. Another blaze in Adelaide Park, which forms part of Cobraball bushfire, is also causing concern, with authorities warning it could also get worse. A “watch and act” warning remains in place as fire crews wait to see if a fire break holds and containment operations are successful. Meanwhile, a fire in the Mount Lizard area is safely burning within containment lines and backburning operations have been completed nearby, and crews will remain at the scene throughout the day. Firefighters are battling more than 50 blazes across the state. The fire threat is set to intensify on Wednesday as a front brings strong winds and high temperatures. Another primary area of concern is the Scenic Rim, west of the Gold Coast, where defence force personnel have been creating breaks around fires burning in remote terrain since September. At 3.40am AEST, the fire at Spicers Peak Lodge was upgraded to “Leave now”. QFES says the fire is burning near Spicers Gap and travelling in a south-westerly direction towards Spicers Peak Lodge. The fire is likely to have an impact on Spicers Peak Lodge. “Residents should leave via Wilkinson Road,” QFES says. “There is a separate warning for Mount Alphen and Double Top and residents should refer to that warning to determine what action they should take.” Hello and welcome back to our continuing coverage of the bushfire crisis across NSW and Queensland. There are currently two fires at emergency alert level in NSW and one in Queensland that was upgraded this morning. Today, conditions in Queensland will be worse than yesterday, when 60 fires were already burning. Strong winds and temperatures in the mid-30s are predicted. Three regions are at severe fire danger levels: Darling Downs and Granite Belt, Wide Bay and Burnett, and the south-east. All other parts of the state are at high to very high. In NSW yesterday, catastrophic fire conditions swept through the Illawarra-Shoalhaven, greater Hunter and greater Sydney. Three hundred new fires were started yesterday and dozens of homes destroyed. At its peak, 15 fires were at emergency warning, with temperatures in the high 30s, 80km/h winds and only 5% humidity. Firefighters have worked through the night and brought the number of emergency warnings down to two. If you are in a bushfire-affected area, please stay tuned to your local emergency broadcaster, have a bushfire plan in place, follow instructions from fire crews and avoid bushland areas. You can find up-to-date information on the NSW fires here, and the Queensland fires here. If you wish to donate to support those affected, you can find information on that here."

          "headline": "A gifted physicist reduced to living in his car: what killed Hamid Alamdari?",
          "bodyText": "Hamid Farahi Alamdari was full of stories. When he was living out of his car in a Tesco car park in Harlow, Essex, he told anyone who would listen about his exciting past as an avionics engineer, Iranian war veteran and physicist. Then there was his pièce de résistance: the time he was shortlisted to be Stephen Hawking’s assistant. “I took it all with a pinch of salt at first because he was telling me all these stories and I could tell he was a drinker,” says account manager Adam Protheroe. “He could have been anybody. He could have told me that he was the king of Iran and I wouldn’t have known any better.” Protheroe became close friends with Hamid in 2017. “I’d seen him around and he was living in a Peugeot 206 that was parked up just around the corner. I came back a couple of days later with a bag full of clothes and bits and pieces and socks. My wife cooked him a nice meal and I took it down to him in a little box and started talking to him from there.” He would eat with him, take him to appointments and raised more than £700 to get Hamid accommodation in the winter that followed. Protheroe wasn’t bothered whether he was telling the truth or not. He liked Hamid, and who wouldn’t spin a yarn or two when life had dealt them such a bum deal? Protheroe was by no means the only one to fall for Hamid’s raffish charm. Many of the locals had a soft spot for the bearded stranger with the laughter lines and exotic accent. Hamid chatted to his new friends about literature and science, spiritualism and martial arts, Iraq and war, pretty much anything. And then one day he was gone. Just as he had arrived unannounced, he disappeared. In February 2018, Hamid was taken ill and moved into emergency accommodation. He died there alone. Like two-thirds of homeless people, Hamid suffered with addiction. And like many people who die homeless, he looked far older than his 55 years. Harlow is one of the new towns built after the second world war to ease overcrowding in London. In its early years it had a thoroughly modern can-do feel to it, boasting Britain’s first all-pedestrian shopping precinct and first modern high-rise residential tower block. But more recently it has fallen on tough times. This year, Harlow’s Conservative MP, Robert Halfon, suggested the town had become a dumping ground for London councils, which have sent hundreds of “troubled families” to live in converted office blocks in his constituency. The last census, in 2011, showed that Harlow had higher unemployment, less home ownership, lower educational qualifications and poorer health than the average for both Essex and England. In June, however, Halfon said things were looking up for the town. “The news that homelessness is at its lowest level since 2010 is a real step in the right direction,” he declared. Halfon quoted the absurdly low figure of five homeless people, and was soon corrected by a local Labour councillor, Tony Edwards, who pointed out that the figure referred to rough sleeping not homelessness, and that in fact more than 4,500 people were on the housing-needs register in Harlow and about 400 people had made “homeless” applications in 2018/19. That paints a very different picture. It means that, with a population of 85,000, 5.3% of people in the town are waiting to have a housing need met. It is 18 months since Hamid died, and we meet Protheroe in the Tesco superstore cafe where he and Hamid would often get together for coffee and bacon sandwiches. Protheroe is business-like and comes straight to the point. He says he doesn’t want us to get the wrong impression; he’s not a do-gooder. He considered Hamid a friend rather than a charity case. “I’m not a selfish bastard, but I’m not out to help everybody I can,” he says. “If anything, I’ll help animals more than I’ll help people. I just got to know Hamid and we became mates.” In 1981, when he turned 19, Hamid was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war Hamid told Protheroe he had ended up homeless in 2017 after selling his pension in a dodgy deal and then running into money troubles. But even here there is a mystery. Unlike most people living on the streets, he still had savings in the bank. He camped in woodland close to Tesco until his tent was set alight. Protheroe says Hamid told him that teenagers were responsible, but he didn’t like to talk about it. Soon after this a Harlow local gave Hamid the old Peugeot 206. He parked it by Tesco and moved in. The interior of his car-home was crammed with donated clothes and books – science books, spiritual self-help guides, novels, all sorts. The only space left for Hamid was the passenger seat. Protheroe thought his friend might be an eccentric hoarder. Hamid told him he spoke seven languages, that he had a PhD in astrophysics and theoretical maths, and mentioned the job he almost got with the late Prof Hawking. He also talked about fighting in the Iran-Iraq war, showed him photographs of members of his platoon who had died, and told him he suffered from terrible flashbacks. That’s why he drank, he said – to blot out the memories. Protheroe is surprised by how well they got to know each other in such a short period of time. He would find himself visiting Hamid at night to make sure he was OK. Although Hamid was a good deal older, 41-year-old Protheroe found himself playing a paternal role. He would often tick Hamid off about the state of his car-home. “I’d open up the car door and he’d been smoking roll-ups in there. I said you’ve got to sleep in there, and there’s smoke billowing out. It wasn’t the kind of car I would have liked to have slept in, if I’m being honest. Hamid wasn’t very tidy. I’d have a go at him – ‘Sort yourself out, you look like a sack of shit, you need to run a brush through your hair.’ I’d just have a dig at him and we’d have a bit of back and forth. He’d laugh at me, and take the piss.” * * * Like Protheroe, Chrissy Sorce is almost apologetic about befriending Hamid. “I don’t know why I took to him. I don’t go out and randomly do that to everybody. It’s just something about him – he was likable.” Sorce, who is 51, works at a car-rental firm based in the industrial park next to Tesco. “He parked the Peugeot behind our workplace, and I just started chatting to him on my fag breaks,” she recalls. Sorce talks about his fondness for scratch cards – “He was always trying to win millions, bless him” – and how she stored books for him in her daughter’s shed to free up space in the Peugeot. “They were quite intellectual books. He was very educated. But something obviously went wrong somewhere along the line, which can happen, can’t it?” Hamid told Sorce many fascinating and funny stories. But for all that, there was a terrible vulnerability about him, she says. “It was all a fake, really, because at the end of the day he was still lying in that car and sleeping in the freezing cold.” Sometimes when he was drunk he would weep and tell her he wished he was dead. Sorce says she told him not to be daft, and to take any opportunity that came along. But she admits, at this stage of his life, few opportunities were coming his way. “I think the council could have housed him. He could have been put in a room a lot sooner, surely. They all knew where he was.” Adam Protheroe says he often used to tell Hamid off about the state of his Peugeot home. Photograph: Adam Protheroe What she most liked about Hamid is that he didn’t want anything from her. “He never even asked me for a pound.” She pauses and smiles. “He did ask me to go out for dinner, though, but I had to let him down and say no. I think he liked the women. He would go into Tesco and chat to them.” She once did his washing for him, she says. “I washed and ironed everything. I said to him: ‘Do you want me to do any more?’ But he never gave me any more to do. He was proud. After I did that, he went out and bought me washing powder to replace what I’d done. I told him not to bother, but he did it anyway.” She knows some people couldn’t understand why she wanted to help him. They said it straight out to her. “When I took home his washing – and yes, it really did stink – one of my managers said: ‘Eeeeugh, how could you wash all his clothes?’ I said: ‘Easy, you just put them in the washing machine and take them out.’” Sorce says she couldn’t help thinking it could just as easily have been her living in that car. “We’re all one pay cheque away from being homeless. You never know what’s going to bring you down, that’s how I see it.” At times, she says, Hamid seemed confused. She and Protheroe believe he had early-stage dementia. As for his stories, she didn’t know what to make of them. “You never know what’s true and what’s not, do you? You just go along with it.” * * * Both Sorce and Protheroe were anxious that Hamid should take care of his appearance. They believed that this, coupled with sobriety, could be the difference between him getting a council home or not. That’s why Protheroe ended up taking him to his barber’s one day. “Hamid was attending an alcohol dependency therapy group in Harlow,” says Protheroe. “The idea was that, if he demonstrated he could get off the booze, they would recommend that the council should give him somewhere to live. I was trying to sober him up and make him look a bit more respectable. So I took him to my barber. Hamid had this big old white Father Christmas beard and he took all that off, cut his hair and he looked like a different person.” It was at the barber’s that Protheroe began to suspect Hamid may have been telling the truth about his academic background. “My barber is a very intelligent guy, and him and Hamid were having conversations about string theory, this theory, that theory. It was really bizarre to hear Hamid coming out with these things.” Hamid never did get council accommodation, but Protheroe says in some ways he was his own worst enemy. The Harlow homeless project Streets2Homes tried to find a place for Hamid to live. “They’d say: ‘We’ve got a room for you, but you can’t drink or smoke in the room, and there are all these rules and regulations.’ Hamid was like ‘Nononono, I’m not having that.’ And he just wouldn’t do it. If you want help, first of all you’ve got to help yourself. Hamid was like: ‘I’d rather sit in my car and drink and smoke.’” Protheroe admits he may be being tough on his friend – insisting that an alcoholic does not drink in his own home is a big ask. Hamid may well have benefited from the Housing First model, whereby homeless people are provided with a home and then addiction issues are addressed with wraparound support. Streets2Homes declined to talk to us for this article. There was also something about the car-home that made Hamid special. He was well known to Tesco customers and became something of a local celebrity. Hamid and his Peugeot had become a landmark. Protheroe reckons Hamid had good reason to be wary of council accommodation. He tells us of the time Hamid was robbed while staying in a hostel. “He had his bloody pin number written on his bank card and whoever it was that stole it from the hostel emptied his bank, absolutely emptied his bank. So I was on the phone to his bank and tried to get it all sorted out. He had a couple of grand in the bank; that was what was left over from his pension.” Sorce thinks Hamid declined offers of housing because they were not permanent, and he felt he would be even more exposed there. “He wanted to steer clear of people who were similar to him,” she says. Hamid told her he was offered a place at Terminus House in Harlow, a grim-looking block of flats often described as a “human warehouse” where hundreds of residents, sent from councils across London, are crammed together in tiny flats. Halfon has referred to the practice of rehousing families from London in his constituency as “social cleansing”. The building made headlines in July because of a drugs network operating nearby, and police figures show that crime within a 500-metre radius of Terminus House rose 20% in the 10 months after it opened. Rather than accepting a place in Terminus House, Hamid returned to his silver Peugeot, carried on smoking and drinking, and continued to be berated by his good friend for his slovenliness. Protheroe says that somehow Hamid, for all his bad habits and obduracy, brought out an incredible generosity in the Harlow community. One day Hamid broke the key in the lock of the car door, and Protheroe posted a shout-out on Facebook for help. “This guy got in touch, came down, and sorted him with a key. It was normally a £200 job, but he did it as a gesture of goodwill.” When the weather turned and Protheroe was worried Hamid might get hypothermia, he set up a GoFundMe page. “A kind-hearted girl phoned me up around midnight, and said: ‘I can’t stop thinking about this guy. I want to come out and help him.’ I said: ‘Right, I’ll get out of bed and come and meet you.’ She and her husband drove down in a hundred grand Mercedes AMG Jeep. They paid 400 or 500 quid to put him up in the Park Inn for a week.” Another woman turned up with a huge biscuit tin crammed with cigarettes. “It was filled to the brim. There must have been a couple of thousand roll-ups in it.” And soon after it became apparent that there was no longer room for Hamid in the Peugeot, another miracle happened. “A guy rocked up with an Audi estate car, which was like twice the size of his existing ‘premises’. He parked that up behind, and the Peugeot became a storage facility for all the junk while Hamid moved into the Audi.” Family and friends at Hamid’s funeral in Harlow, 4 May 2018. Photographs: Martine Xerri/BPM Media It’s a story deserving of a happy ending. But of course it didn’t have one. Eventually, as he became ill, Hamid did accept help, and during a cold snap in February 2018 he was provided with emergency accommodation by Streets2Homes at the Oasis Hotel in Harlow. Nav Hussein, the hotel manager, checked on Hamid after receiving a concerned call over his whereabouts. When he went to his room, he saw two empty bottles of alcohol, and Hamid sitting upright on the bed. Hussein called out to him, but received no reply. He then noticed there was something different about the colour of Hamid’s hands and realised he was dead. The autopsy revealed that Hamid had died of organ failure, but Protheroe is convinced he had simply lost the will to live. At the time, Hamid was on a complex cocktail of medication. “I think that it had got to the point where he’d just had enough, and he stopped taking his meds.” A few weeks after his death, the council arranged a funeral for Hamid. Protheroe was disappointed by the turnout. He was pleased that Hamid’s family were there, but wondered where they had been when his friend needed them most. * * * Hamid Farahi Alamdari’s Facebook was last updated in November 2015. It states he started a new job as an aircraft engineer in 2006, and that he worked as an aircraft maintenance engineer for British Airways World Cargo. Most of his “friends” are beautiful young women from any number of countries, and a few are aviation engineers and fellow Iranians. His Facebook biography says he graduated from Bristol Aeronautical University in 1997. But there is no Bristol Aeronautical University. There is a renowned aerospace engineering department at Bristol University. However, Bristol University tells us Hamid never studied there. British Airways refuses to confirm that he worked there. At the bottom of the list of friends is a man called Ariane F Alamdari. Ariane is Hamid’s nephew. Over the phone he tells us that his uncle could be a difficult man, particularly when he was drinking, but he did not believe he was a liar. “Of all his personality traits, embellishing the truth or telling fibs was not one of the things that I knew him for.” Ariane says the details of his uncle’s life are a puzzle to him. He introduces us to his father, Hamid’s older brother Saeed, who he says can tell us more. Saeed is a 64-year-old academic who lectures in engineering at Bradford College and lives in Roundhay, a well-to-do suburb of Leeds. We meet in Roundhay Park, one of Europe’s largest city parks. Saeed is a short, slight man, who carries himself with an easy elegance. He has just completed the first half of his regular 10-mile walk around the lake. Saeed talks quietly and thoughtfully about Hamid and their parents, who came to Iran from Azerbaijan and spoke Turkish. He says that he was the lucky brother. Because he was eight years older than Hamid, he managed to leave Iran for the UK before the shah was overthrown and Ayatollah Khomeini established an Islamic republic in Iran. This was the main thing that set their lives apart, he says. Saeed does not pretend to know every detail of his brother’s life. There were so many years they were apart. Like us, he has been trying to piece together a complex jigsaw since Hamid’s death. Saeed Alamdari says it was was obvious from early on that his brother was outstandingly gifted. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian Saeed and Hamid were two of four children born into a middle-class family in Tehran. Their parents were practising Muslims and their children grew up in a secular Iran. Their father had a good, stable job working in security for the ministry of health, while their mother brought up the children. Saeed says it was obvious from early on that young Hamid was outstandingly gifted. “He was good at all sorts of sports, but most of all he was academically brilliant.” Both boys were drawn to the sciences, engineering and maths. There was something else that stood out about young Hamid – he loved to take risks. “He and his friends used to go on to the roof of mosques and jump off them, and the curator would chase them,” recalls Saeed. “He liked getting chased. He wanted to be on the edge.” Life changed for everybody after the revolution of 1979. By then Saeed had already established himself in the UK. He left Tehran in 1974, studied mechanical and aerospace engineering at Leeds University, did a masters degree in combustion and settled to a life in academia. Hamid was only 16 at the time of the revolution. In 1981, when he turned 19, he was conscripted into the army to fight in the Iran-Iraq war, which had begun the previous year. Because he was such a high achiever, he was drafted in as a lieutenant. Saeed shows us a photo of a fresh-faced Hamid, standing at ease in an army uniform that looks a couple of sizes too big for him. However, Saeed thinks he was anything but at ease. Here was a young man responsible for the lives of so many other men who simply didn’t want to be there. “He had a platoon under his control, and most of these soldiers were drafted from villages. Hamid told me that on the day they were leaving for the front, the soldiers’ mothers got together and told him: ‘We’re leaving our sons in your hands.’ And during the war he lost most of his platoon – he always blamed himself for that.” Saeed says the war left Hamid with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hamid suffered a recurring nightmare – that Iraqi soldiers were coming towards him with their hands raised, but he shot them anyway. After leaving the army, he went to India to study physics and to try to heal himself. Hamid told Saeed he studied for a degree, then completed a PhD. He also said he spent much of the time meditating and reading the great 13th-century Persian poets Rumi and Shams Tabrizi. “I think meditating and reading were coping mechanisms for him,” Saeed says. But by now Hamid also had another coping mechanism: booze. After India, Hamid returned to Tehran, where he found himself in trouble. He could not cope with the oppressive regime or the alcohol ban. On one occasion, Hamid told Saeed, he and his friends were sentenced to 80 lashes after being caught drinking. “But one of his friends had a hump on his back, and Hamid said: ‘You’re not going to lash him.’ He was asked: ‘Well, do you want to take his punishment?’ He said: ‘I will’, and he received 160 lashes. That’s when he came to the conclusion that this was not the place for him.” Tributes left on Hamid’s car following his death. Photograph: Adam Protheroe In the mid-90s, Hamid came to the UK. He was in his early 30s and lived with his sister in Croydon while doing an admin job with the charity Age UK and studying English at Croydon College. According to Saeed, he won the college’s student of the year award. From there he moved to Bristol, but Saeed says that, rather than studying at university, as suggested on his Facebook profile, Hamid attended Bristol College to get a diploma to enable him to work on planes. It was around this time that he made his application to become Stephen Hawking’s assistant at the University of Cambridge. A letter dated 31 August 1997 confirms his application for the post, but there does not appear to be any correspondence about his shortlisting. Hamid didn’t get the job as Hawking’s assistant, but was employed as an aeronautical engineer in Bristol. He had a stable job, lived with a girlfriend and made a decent life for himself. Saeed says these were his happiest years in Britain. But even then his brother had noticed a change. He had always been a risk-taker, but now he was becoming positively reckless. Hamid told him of a time he had gone to a drug-dealer’s house in Bristol to buy cannabis. “He said they had machetes and everything, and all the drugs were on the table. He and his friend took everything from the table and just ran away. For a few months he had to stay low. It’s not that he needed the money. He did it for the high.” In 2008 Hamid lost his job, and went on a downward spiral. He moved to the market town of Great Dunmow in Essex and stayed with a friend for a while. By now it was obvious to Saeed that his brother was addicted to alcohol and cannabis and that his life was becoming increasingly chaotic. At one point, Saeed paid for Hamid to go to Afghanistan for an interview for a job at a US air force base. Hamid also told Saeed that he went to Saudi Arabia to be interviewed for a post in avionics. But neither of these jobs materialised. Hamid would often phone Saeed at work, asking for money. Eventually, Saeed had to give an instruction not to put Hamid’s calls through to him. Saeed had his own problems. He and his wife had separated and he was looking after his son, who has Asperger’s. When Hamid came to stay in Leeds, he inevitably brought trouble. There was one terrible weekend in 2011 when, within 20 minutes of Hamid arriving, there was a knock on Saeed’s door. It was Hamid’s drug dealer. “I was furious that he had arranged that. I told him, you come here whenever you want, Hamid, but no drugs. I’ve a son living with me – no drugs, no alcohol.” The next day they were walking back to Saeed’s car. “He had fallen behind me, and I realised he was drinking from a bottle of whisky in a brown paper bag. His face was getting redder and redder. When he saw me looking at him, he put it in his pocket. I dragged it out and smashed it on the floor. I said: ‘Didn’t I tell you, if you’re coming here, no alcohol.’ I had my son with me.” Saeed couldn’t cope with his brother’s behaviour. “On the Monday, I took him to the bus station. I shook hands with him and I said: ‘I’ll see you in another world.’” That was the last time the brothers saw each other. Hamid would occasionally phone – usually asking for money. “The last time he phoned was three in the morning. His speech was slurred. I said to him: ‘Assume you have no brother.’” Saeed looks out on to the lake. He says he knows he was hard on Hamid, but he felt he had to choose between his brother and his son’s welfare. “I have my regrets,” he says. “Possibly I was asking too much from him.” It was around five years later, in 2017, that Hamid sold his pension and ended up homeless. A year later he died. Hamid Farahi Alamdari – physicist, spiritualist, risk-taker, addict, war veteran. He may have fought his war in a faraway country for a remote regime, but in many ways he was typical of the thousands of British war veterans who are homeless – never shaking off the ghosts of the battlefield and left with lifelong PTSD. He might have told all the friends he made in that industrial park in Harlow about the beautiful and clever things in life, but ultimately it is his confessions about nightmares and the psychological scars left by war that left the strongest impression. As for the PhD and being shortlisted for the job with Hawking, who knows? All his friends are certain of is that he had exceptional ability, that he died a disappointed man, and that they miss him. Adam Protheroe and Chrissy Sorce knew him for less than a year, but he changed their lives. Sorce says she knows she helped Hamid, but she still thinks she let him down at the end. “I felt a bit bad because he messaged me a few times and I was so busy with my own family that I didn’t really respond back to him as much as I should have. I did feel something towards him. He had a nice nature. I have a plant here he bought me for Christmas. I called it Hamid.” It’s a large succulent, is thriving and sits on her windowsill at home. At the cafe in Harlow, Protheroe says he can’t drive past Tesco these days without thinking of his friend. He was “gutted” when he heard of Hamid’s death. He mentions a book Hamid gave him as a present. “It’s called The Prophet. It’s only a thin book, and it was just inspirational stuff – live your life this way, do good, be the best person you can.” It means a lot to him, he says. Back in Leeds, Saeed admits it was a shock when he discovered Hamid had been living in a car and died homeless. He says he can’t express just how grateful he is to the people of Harlow for looking after Hamid when he had given up. “We were stunned by the number of books in the car, the clothes that people had given him, all the flowers at his funeral.” He spends a lot of time reflecting on his brother’s life, and says that these days he can remember the good times more easily. “Astrophysics was a favourite subject of his. Parallel universes.” He shakes his head. “It was a waste of a good life. I’m just hoping that in other universes, parallel universes, Hamid will be living a better life.” Saeed and his sister decided not to tell their 90-year-old mother, who still lives in Iran, about Hamid’s death because they thought it would break her heart. “But about a week after he died, she called my sister from Iran saying: ‘I’m getting these dreams – either Hamid is ill or he is dead, which is it?’ And then my sister said: ‘Yes, he has passed away.’” Saeed says that his mother was relieved Hamid is finally at peace. Saeed is getting ready for the second half of his walk around Roundhay Park. Sometimes he meets a man in the park who reminds him of his brother. “Seven o’clock in the morning he’s feeding swans, and he’s got a bottle of wine with him,” Saeed says. “There will come a time when I will strike a conversation with him. ‘Listen, I had a brother and he went right through what you’re going through now.’” For now, Saeed just tells him to take care of himself.

          "bodyText": "We end the blog with emergency warnings for South Turramurra in Sydney being issued. Stay safe, everyone. Do what you need to do. We’ll be back tomorrow morning for the third day of the Senate-only sitting. I hope, for all of our sakes, it is a boring day, with low winds, calm conditions and safe communities. In the meantime – take care of you. Please. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund, (which is often called the “no actual infrastructure fund” around these halls, because of the lack of infrastructure) is not only undergoing another inquiry – it will also lend $20m to the North Queensland Cowboys for a training centre. The fund which was designed to turn the north into an economic powerhouse will also help the Cowboys train its Thurstons of the future. Funding for the new state-of-the-art Cowboys Community, Training and High Performance Centre continues to take shape with the advancement of a Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) loan moving to the next stage of approval. The North Queensland Toyota Cowboys’ application to NAIF has progressed, with NAIF’s Board making an investment decision to approve a loan to the project. The $20m NAIF loan would complement the existing $15m federal government grant announced in March enabling the construction of the project to commence. Completion is targeted for the facilities to be available for the 2021 NRL season. The proposed centre, to be located adjacent to the new North Queensland Stadium in Townsville, will combine community areas, multi-sport high-performance training spaces, sports medicine and sports science laboratories, together with the stadium and administration offices, located in between Ross Creek and Saunders Street in Townsville City. Scott Morrison is on his way to the Australian crisis centre, in Canberra, to get a fire update. It is still not listed for debate - which means the government doesn’t have the numbers it wants, but the medevac issue is till ticking away. An alliance of Australia’s medical professionals have put out this statement calling for medevac to stay: Medical decisions should be made by medical professionals – Alliance of medical authorities appeals to parliament to save medevac The presidents of leading medical colleges across Australia are appealing to the Senate to maintain the medevac legislation and the Independent Health Advice Panel (IHAP) process. The medical community remains united in asking the parliament to maintain the medevac legislation and to allow the IHAP panel to continue its critical work providing independent clinical review and oversight. There is clear evidence of the effectiveness of the medevac legislation, and the medical need. Medevac has improved access to appropriate healthcare for refugees and asylum seekers being held offshore. It is providing greatly improved oversight and accountability. As doctors, we continue to put patients first and uphold the basic human right to healthcare. We know that previous delays and failures to transfer ill asylum seekers resulted in preventable suffering. This statement is on behalf of the presidents of: The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) The Australasian College of Dermatologists (ACD) The Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Physicians (ACSEP) The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) The Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (ANZCA) The College of Intensive Care Medicine of Australia and New Zealand (CICM) The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) The Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators (RACMA) The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) The solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, has asked the high court to refuse Annika Smethurst’s bid to order police to destroy evidence seized in the raid of her home to preserve evidence for possible future prosecution. Donaghue noted that evidence seized in the raid can be used to prosecute offences other than the one listed on the warrant – namely, the police could use it to prosecute Smethurst’s source. He said Smethurst is “at the other end” of an alleged unlawful disclosure, a “serious breach” of the Intelligence Services Act. There is discretion for a court in a possible future criminal trial to reject evidence that was unlawfully obtained, and Donaghue asked that the court not order destruction or return of evidence that would “pre-empt” that process. He noted that even if Smethurst wins in her constitutional argument that the offence police were investigating in relation to her publication of the material was unconstitutional, the material should still be left in police’s hands because of the possibility it could be used to prosecute her source. Mark Butler has put out this statement on Angus Taylor: Today it was revealed in a Senate estimates spill-over hearing that the minister’s department provided a draft letter to the Minister’s office which responded to the letter from the lord mayor of the City of Sydney. That draft letter is very different to the final letter sent by Minister Taylor to the lord mayor. The department’s draft letter provided to the minister’s office contained no reference to the City of Sydney’s travel expenditure. Senator Keneally: Did that draft response include reference to the City of Sydney’s travel expenditure? Departmental Official: No Senator, it did not. (Environment and Energy Estimates spill-over hearing, 12 November 2019) The department confirmed that after it provided this draft response, Angus Taylor’s office did not request any further information or drafts. It was also confirmed that the department was not asked to verify any additional information in the version of the letter signed by Angus Taylor which contained the doctored figures. Despite repeated questioning, the minister representing the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Senator Birmingham, refused to provide further information about where the doctored figures came from and instead referred to Angus Taylor’s previous statements. Angus Taylor needs to come clean about exactly how these doctored figures turned up in a letter signed by him – because we have yet to see a public document that confirms his version of events. If Angus Taylor won’t provide the answers, the prime minister should direct his embattled minister to provide a full and frank explanation. Mike Bowers has been out and about Penny Wong just tried to bring an end to question time – “I think the time for questions has expired,” she says, probably hopefully. Alas, no. There are two more minutes. Annika Smethurst’s lawyers have been urged to clarify their case on whether material copied from her phone was confidential to support her bid to force police to delete the information taken during the raid on her home. On Tuesday the high court stood over oral submissions to Wednesday’s hearing to give Smethurst’s counsel time to clarify her case and consider seeking an order to prevent the use of material copied from her phone rather than its destruction. Smethurst has asked the court for an injunction ordering the police to destroy material collected and copied from her phone on the basis the raid in June constituted trespass. Smethurst’s counsel, Stephen Lloyd, was grilled repeatedly about how the court could order destruction of documents, without a breach in equity such as a breach of confidence. Chief justice Susan Kiefel said that a breach of confidentiality could result in destruction of confidential material but noted “that’s not this case” and the plaintiffs had “never said the information was confidential to the plaintiff”, an observation echoed by Justice Patrick Keane. Justice Geoffrey Nettle noted that trespass could result in damages but asked what grounds Smethurst had to ask for destruction of the information “if it is not confidential – and it doesn’t sound like it is [confidential] to you”. Lloyd responded that damages were “not an adequate remedy” and although the plaintiffs hadn’t asserted breach of confidence the court should undo the wrong of material being “forcibly taken from the phone” through the torts of trespass and conversion. Kiefel suggested some of the material may be confidential depending on its “ultimate source” and queried whether a negative injunction ordering the police not to use the information would be sufficient. Lloyd said that it may be. Lloyd then changed tack, arguing that copied material is confidential in the sense that “it’s on their own phone and they’re the only one that can access it”. After a short break, the court returned and Kiefel suggested it stand over submissions on relief so that Smethurst’s counsel could consider their position further. Lloyd suggested on Wednesday he may shift Smethurst’s case to seek a negative injunction preventing police using material seized and copied, rather than its destruction. Kiefel replied that Lloyd would still have to examine the “underlying cause [of action]” and warned “the basis for a negative or mandatory injunction needs to be dealt with with a good degree of particularity tomorrow morning”. Again, it was Barnaby Joyce who raised the issue in response to a question about resources for hazard reduction burns. His comments were run in full. Barnaby Joyce has explained his comments to Sam Maiden at the New Daily: Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Joyce told Sky News the local community needed more resources for hazard reduction burns and said: “And that’s the crazy thing there, and I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them. That’s the last thing I want to do.” But he accused critics of “wantonly misrepresenting” his remarks about two NSW bushfire victims – Vivian Chaplain and George Nole. Mr Joyce said he was actually trying to urge politicians to be more respectful of the alternative community where the victims lived, where the majority of residents did vote for the Greens. “My point is I was saying ‘just be careful, you don’t understand’. If you came into my community and talked to them – I am not having a go at the Greens, I think that’s completely wrong,” Mr Joyce told the New Daily. “The people who live there are in a commune basically. Wytaliba is an alternative community. They don’t vote for me, they vote for Greens, and I’ve got no problem with it. They agree there should have been more burn reduction, fuel reduction.” Jacqui Lambie asks about the number of lobbying and unescorted passes in parliament. It is a question for Scott Ryan, as a representative of DPS. Ryan refers her estimate hearings transcripts. It is worth noting that Barnaby Joyce brought this up himself – he was asked about whether or not fire and emergency service workers had enough resources for hazard reduction, and included the deaths of Vivian Chaplain and George Nole and his view of their political leanings in his answer, without any prompting. I am not sure there is ever an appropriate time to bring that up – and not just because now is not the time “to talk politics”. Richard Colbeck is now talking about all the action the government has taken on aged care. Given that most of the response has been “this is terrible, and we will look at it”, it is not the strongest of answers here. Does Simon Birmingham have any information about potential power blackouts in South Australia, Stirling Griff asks? Grid reliability in SA is improving, Birmingham says. The reliability standard in SA is “expected to be met”. Oh look – a lot of it is because of new renewables coming on to the grid. We move on to the dairy code of conduct – and why the exposure draft has been changed (which was the question Bridget McKenzie couldn’t answer this morning on ABC radio). There is still not an answer. But we do have a nice history of how we got here. Senate question time begins with an update on the fire, and the defence force role. It is as expected – helping with coordination and remaining on standby – but they are not firefighters. We are coming up to Senate question time. Sigh. Larissa Waters has seen the Parliamentary Friends of Resources Christmas party invite: As Queensland and NSW burns, both the Liberals and Labor thought it was a good time to invite parliamentarians to Christmas drinks hosted by the fossil fuel industry, whose product is fuelling climate change and donations are blocking climate action. It sounds like satire but it’s the sad reality of Australian politics in 2019. Mehreen Faruqi singled out Joel Fitzgibbon: Seriously, Joel? Our state is on fire and this is the day you pick to invite us all to drinks with the oil and gas lobby, some of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis … This seems like pretty bad timing, given everything that is happening with the fire emergency: Dear Colleagues, As Co-Chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Resources we are pleased to invite you to the Bright Sparks Christmas drinks hosted by the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association (APPEA). The event will be on Wednesday, 4th December at 6:30pm. Please see attached the formal invitation and direct any RSVPs to [redacted by me] Cheers, Hon Joel Fitzgibbon Mr Craig Kelly Shadow Minister for Resources Member for Hughes Member for Hunter Labor senator Murray Watt jumped in there, with an interjection: MW: We are used to Senator Steele-John’s lectures … but it is highly offensive for him to refer to members of this chamber, regardless of their political party, as arsonists. … It is an indication of the lengths that the Greens will go to to make their political point and I ask him to withdraw. Jordon Steele-John did not have to withdraw: Senator Steele-John was not making a direct reference to any senator in particular. Please continue, Senator Steele-John. There is no point of order. Steele-John: There will come a time when the Australian community will look back and ask itself a simple question: what were we doing when they were defending their homes, when they were protecting their communities, when they were defending precious natural habitat, what were we here doing? The answer this day, as has been the answer on so many occasions since I have entered this place, is make the problem worse, because it was too difficult to do otherwise or because somebody was paying us to do it. That is the only answer that they will discover in this place and they, like me, will be disgusted and ashamed at the weakness, at the cowardice, at the self-interest, at the ignorance that led us to this moment. They will condemn you, as you should rightly be condemned, and hold you accountable at the ballot box and beyond. Meanwhile, over in the Senate, Greens senator Jordon Steele-John has accused both major parties of being “no better than a bunch of arsonists, borderline arsonists” for supporting the coal industry, during the big stick Senate debate. Steele-John: There is not a scientist in this country – there is not a qualified individual on the face of the earth – that would say anything other than that there is a direct causal link between the burning of coal and the creation of dangerous climate change. And there is not an individual – a scientist or any other qualified person – who would deny the link between climate change and the disasters we are experiencing today. It is hypocrisy in the extreme – it is inappropriate beyond words – for this government to propose that, in this moment of national crisis, we should be using the powers of the federal government to maintain a system of burning coal for energy generation. That is what this bill seeks to facilitate. You, funded by your corporate backers, interested only in your continued political survival, have played a role in driving our country to the edge of an ecological abyss from which we may never recover. Your selfishness and your ignorance have known no bounds for decades, and now our communities are paying the price, just as your spinelessness, your contemptible inability to formulate yourselves into anything like an opposition, anything vaguely approaching an organisation capable of countering the bunch of self-obsessed corporate elites that is the Liberal party, has let this community down again and again. We heard your feeble mutterings in the chamber yesterday about the idea that, at some other point in the future, it might be the appropriate time to raise the issue of climate change. Now! Now! Now! In the past, when we as a community have confronted issues of national tragedy and crisis, such as we did after Port Arthur, we have come together as a nation and acted. We had a national firearms agreement within 11 days. How dare you suggest that our country is beyond the ability of rising to a similar challenge. How dare any of you suggest that, in this moment, at this time, it is appropriate to be prosecuting a piece of legislation with the aim of propping up coal. You are no better than a bunch of arsonists – borderline arsonists – and you should be ashamed... This is also going on Over in Senate estimates, Barnaby Joyce’s comments have made waves: Kristina Keneally: Minister I have a question for you. Earlier today Barnaby Joyce said on Sky News … Chair David Fawcett: Excuse me Senator Keneally just a reminder to use the correct titles when referring to members of the other House. KK: The member for New England said on Sky News that the two people who died in bushfires, he said, “I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party so I’m not going to start attacking them. That’s the last thing I want to do.” How does he know who they voted for and why does it matter? They’re dead; they died in a bushfire. Isn’t that enough? Simon Birmingham: I’ve not seen the quotes Senator Keneally, I have no idea what Mr Joyce was referring to and they’d be questions for him. KK: Do you think it matters who they voted for? SB: No Senator. KK: Do you associate yourself with those comments? Fawcett: I remind you this is a Senate estimates hearing into the Department of Environment. The comments by a backbencher are not relevant for this hearing. KK: They’re very relevant. Gerard Rennick had the third spot on the LNP Senate ticket: he wasn’t supposed to win. But Labor’s primary vote tanked in Queensland, meaning they lost a Senate spot to the LNP. And Rennick is in for six years. There are bets about how long he’ll stay in the LNP before moving the crossbench/One Nation – from within his own party room. Those other things he is interested in? Read One Nation’s policy document and you can pretty much cross them off. He also thinks we need some sort of modern holey dollar to get the economy out of the doldrums. Good. Times. But it got SO MUCH BETTER. Because has Gerard Rennick read the bureau’s explanations – the peer reviewed explanations – given, you know, he is accusing them of manipulating data, because he knows data? Rennick: No, I haven’t actually read that. Oh? Why? Wouldn’t that be a good idea, given his concerns? Rennick: I read someone who I trusted, Jennifer Marohasy, who has a PhD in biology … she has heaps and heaps of statistical information, so I basically posted an article by her, on my website, on Facebook page, and I basically agreed with what she said.” Dr Marohasy, it might interest you to know, is attached to the IPA. Tom Connell: One person has written something, and you have agreed with that based on what they have said. Rennick: Well based on her credentials, yes. Connell: But you haven’t read the data, or sought other resources. Rennick: Well, I don’t … at that time I was a Senate candidate, and my view is, and I know enough to know, because I have a background in statistics, if you are not doing a parallel run, if you are not doing regression analysis properly, then you have to be very careful about changing data. Connell: Do you have to be careful about making accusations as a senator? … Have you sought briefings from the bureau? Rennick: And I’ll get to that, that is not the main reason that I ran for politics, so there are other things I would like to get to first. Connell: But don’t the facts matter? Rennick: Well the facts do matter, but the problem is the facts are there was data recorded in the 1930s that got changed, so what are you going to call the facts? Yesterday on Sky News, LNP senator Gerard Rennick told Tom Connell about why he believes the Bureau of Meteorology rewrote weather records to fit in with a global warming agenda. What is the proof of that? Connell asked. The proof of that, is basically, that they, basically adapted a new weather measuring instrument and they didn’t run a parallel run at the time. So if you are going to adapt a new measuring instrument, which they did in the late 90s, they should have run a parallel run with the old measuring instrument, so you knew what the difference was between the old measuring instrument, and the new instrument was.” The BOM have released a lot of information on homogenisation of information, Connell says – and if you took that route, it would look like global warming was even worse. Rennick: I’ve worked in finance for 25 years and I have never known a CFO to walk into a company and rewrite the financial statements from 100 years ago. So why you go back 50 or 60 years and rewrite records, that you have no idea how they were measured, the standardisation or anything, and then change that, you have got to have proof. And the way you do regression analysis, is that you have to have a large number of observations to do this. Connell comes back with there being some issues with measuring stations, the changes in the environment giving different reasons - outlining some of the detail the BOM has put forward as why they did this. “What are you accusing them of exactly?” Rennick: I am accusing them of not following proper process for recording statistical data. Connell: But you had the word “agenda” when you mentioned this - so are you saying there are people in there deliberately altering data within the BOM? Rennick: I am saying we should have more rigorous testing of the Bureau of Metrology in the way they change data, absolutely. Connell: But the agenda part, as in, they want more people to sort of take global warming seriously, so they are deliberately fiddling data. It is a pretty serious accusation. Rennick: Yeah, it is a serious accusation, and I stand by it, I don’t believe the change in records, and the way they have gone about it, and I have a background in system accounting, where I have changed records, and we have always done a parallel run. The Senate sitting has begun. Barnaby Joyce’s comments have reached the red chamber. I’ll bring you some of that in a moment. Despite receiving letter signed by 22 of Australia’s former fire chiefs in April – followed up by another letter in September – requesting meetings to discuss the impact of climate change on the bushfire risk, the federal government failed to meet with the high level delegation. Minister Simon Birmingham, representing the minister for energy and emissions reduction, Angus Taylor said the minister’s office had contacted the group on 10 September offering a meeting in October, “but this hasn’t been taken up by the former fire chiefs”. Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked why it had taken five months since the first request to offer a meeting. Birmingham replied that the April letter had asked for a meeting after the election in May, so it was not five months. In the high court, Annika Smethurst’s counsel has been attacking the warrant authorising the search on her home, arguing it failed to describe the conduct which allegedly constituted the offence. The warrant said: “On the 29 April 2018, Annika Smethurst and the Sunday Telegraph communicated a document or article to a person, that was not in the interest of the commonwealth, and permitted that person to have access to the document, contrary to section 79(3) of the Crimes Act 1914, Official Secrets.” Stephen Lloyd argued the warrant needed to describe the information police were seeking and “how it became proscribed in relation to both the [potential] accused”. Warrants must “refer to the offending conduct not merely a reference to the section”, according to Lloyd. He attacked the floating phrase “that was not in the interest of the commonwealth” – arguing it wasn’t clear if it referred to a document or a communication that wasn’t in the interest of the commonwealth. The warrant both “didn’t state an offence known to law” and lacked sufficient particularity, he said. The lack of detail was “apt to mislead Smethurst and the executing officers” to allow a broader search. Joel Fitzgibbon has held a doorstop on the dairy code of conduct, flanked by senators and members of the NSW and Queensland dairy sector. Fitzgibbon called on Bridget McKenzie to explain the changes to the dairy code of conduct, saying it had been watered down to the extent that some farmers would rather have no code than the one proposed. “Senator Bridget McKenzie, the agriculture minister, needs to immediately answer the question she declined to respond to five times on ABC radio this morning – she needs to tell dairy farm communities who it was that recommended to her that the all-important code of conduct in the dairy industry be watered down – watered down so significantly that dairy farm leaders are now saying that this dairy code would be worse than not having a dairy code at all.” Fitzgibbon said Labor was calling for the code to be introduced “sooner rather than later” alongside a floor price on farm gate prices. He said the deregulation of the industry that occurred under the Howard government in 2000 had not resulted in a “good outcome” for dairy farmers, who were struggling with the cost price squeeze. He called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to intervene in the sector. “Scott Morrison needs to put his pride aside and admit he has it wrong [and] concede that we do need some significant government intervention in the dairy industry. “A code of conduct is important, but it won’t fix the wide range of problems facing our dairy farmers, including that price squeeze. We need a minimum farm gate milk price so that farmers can receive a fair price for their milk. “If we don’t intervene, we don’t have a dairy industry in this country and, god forbid, we will be importing our milk.” Fitzgibbon said that he never expected Pauline Hanson’s dairy industry bill to pass the parliament, and defended the “symbolic” move against criticism that the legislation may have had some flaws. He said details could have been thrashed out in the House of Representatives had the legislation won the support of Nationals MPs, who could have crossed the floor in support of the Hanson bill. Dairy farmers from NSW and Queensland also spoke to the media, saying they were disappointed that the code had been watered down, noting concerns about the ability of contract prices to be revised down in certain circumstances. “We are very disappointed that the code has gone backwards in our opinion,” Brian Tessmann, the president of the Queensland Dairyfarmers Organisation, said. He said the number of dairy farmers in Queensland had dropped from 1,500 in 2000 to just 350 today. “We are losing them all the time.” Fitzgibbon said that dairy farmers needed to unite to persuade the government to act, singling out the SA dairy industry for opposing the minimum farm gate price. When asked if he believed the code had been watered down to appease large producers in McKenzie’s home state of Victoria, Fitzgibbon said Australians needed to consider who would benefit from the changes. The interview finishes with this. Kieran Gilbert: But the thing is, you’re also arguing for policies to change in this context, which I, which I understand and your constituents are affected here. But would any of that be enough to deal with these catastrophic conditions that we are seeing? Barnaby Joyce: Well, the only thing that burns is vegetation and if you’ve done fire hazard reduction burns, you don’t have the vegetation or the amount there, to burn. And the other thing is, these fires are super hot, super aggressive, because of the fuel load. And not only does that, not only does that incredibly dangerous and fatal for people, it also kills the trees. You’ll go back later and because it has been so hot, the trees will be dead, and in the past, you will do a fire reduction burn and therefore the heat of the fire, when it would go through again, they would definitely be further bushfires, but they’re not to the same intensity. And that is something that we need to rediscover, because it’s something the Aboriginals discovered years ago, because they wanted to stay alive. KG: In the wash-up in this tragedy, this disaster, there needs to be a discussion about how we maximise our response to this, because you have said yourself the fire season is longer, the window is shorter in terms of trying to protect these communities, to backburn, to reduce these hazards. BJ: Yes, that is a fact and I used to be stupid to argue against that, that is a fact. And to say that, you know, that this the same climatic conditions as in the past is wrong, because we are in a record drought and by statement of its record droughts, it is automatically different – that is a fact. To say that a policy that is conducted in Australia from a room in Canberra, where 76 out of 150 will vote for it, that will change the bushfire season, is an absurdity and erroneous and it is completely misleading because it’s going to have no effect on the climate whatsoever. Gilbert continues. KG: But the thing is that we hear from as I mentioned, Jason McKellar, the incident controller, the New South Wales deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said earlier that hazard reductions have gone on each and every year, each year we get as much done as we would like ... Barnaby Joyce: Well see, you’re using different words there, “as they are able to do”. KG: Do they have enough resources to get it done? BJ: I just think that it, here, in the first instance, they may need more resources, but they also need legislation regulations, to allow them to get in there and do it in a more substantial way. And that the crazy thing there, and I acknowledge that the two people who died were most likely people who voted for the Green party, so I am not going to start attacking them. That’s the last thing I want to do. What I wanted to concentrate on is the policies that we can mitigate these tragedies happening again in the future. That’s where I’m going to focus. And what I wish Mr Bandt would do, is not trying to extend this argument to political purposes that he is following and I think he’s a member for both Melbourne Ports, is that correct? A long, long way away from the people who were fighting the fires in the New England, on the coast, who are actually putting their lives on the line, their time on the line, doing it for free. And again, the statements he’s making his for his political purpose of stopping coal production in Australia and I can understand that’s his purpose, he’s entitled to that purpose. But to make these spurious links, that a policy change would have stopped the fight is so insulting and just completely beyond the pale, to cast that, because people think, well, maybe if that was the truth, I wouldn’t be burnt, maybe if that’s the truth, a good friend of mine would not be dead. And you can’t do that Adam, just can’t do stuff like that. Kieren Gilbert from Sky News asked Barnaby Joyce about Greg Mullins’ comments: Of course, for the salaciousness, we want sort of an adversarial relationship where people are throwing rocks at one another. I, like, completely condone that this is climate change. So let’s put that one aside. And I acknowledge that things are getting drier. We’re in a record drought. I mean, it’s the bleeding obvious – look at the windows, wanna see what’s happening. But if you say, and where I really disagree, though, is when Mr Bandt said, ‘Oh, well, if we reduce, we stop using coal and have an anti-coal policy in Australia – that the fire season will be minimised.’ That was his words. Go back and check your tape, that is what he said. That is either a lie, or absurdly misrepresenting and wrong. And I think it’s because there is no policy domestically in Australia that’s going to have any effect on the climate whatsoever. There are a range of things that affect the climate and on a global scale, you should be part of it, and acknowledge it would have an affect, and I acknowledge that there are other issues as well. There’s just the the oscillation of the seasons. There’s a change in the magnetic field of the sun. KG: But do you accept that the fire-burning opportunity is reduced, because of the fire season being longer. So the question is, when do you get to do the backburning? BJ: In the middle of winter, in times, where, after a sufficient period after rain, you – it’s not as if there is no period where we do have the capacity to do it. It has been confounded by excessive bureaucracy. And I think that the bureaucracy is driven by, let’s call it by conservation principle, by people who do not live in the forest, they do not live near the area. You know, we have the belief that there’s a political sort of zeitgeist purpose that sits behind this, because it definitely was a political decision to let fire trials fall into disrepair. And it is definitely a bureaucratic process, that means that even when they can backburn, it is so difficult bureaucratically, that it either doesn’t happen or it doesn’t happen to the extent that it needs to. And it was a process and it is a policy that they don’t have central watering points in the state forests and in the in the areas where they can get access to the mechanisms to fight these fires. And the other thing – the trees are right next to roads, and of course the trees burn fall over the roads, the fire trucks can’t get in, and more importantly, people trying to escape the fire, can’t get out. (Just another reminder that the fire authorities have said they have done hazard reduction burning ahead of this season.) Did I miss that period in Australian political history where the Greens held every single government? Or that the Liberals have held government in NSW for the last eight years? Or that the Coalition has held federal government for 17 of the last 23 years? Former NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins wrote this in the SMH yesterday: Warmer, drier conditions with higher fire danger are preventing agencies from conducting as much hazard reduction burning – it is often either too wet, or too dry and windy to burn safely. Blaming “greenies” for stopping these important measures is a familiar, populist, but basically untrue claim.” He would know. It was his job to know. He, along with former fire and emergency chiefs from all over the country have tried to meet with the government since April to discuss issues with Australia’s fire preparation, including the impact of climate change, and why the old way of doing things just isn’t cutting it anymore. They didn’t get that meeting. Barnaby Joyce is on Sky News talking about the hazard reduction burns and other things he thinks have been policy failures, less than 20 minutes after Scott Morrison told Ray Hadley that all of these issues (ahem, climate change) should only be discussed after the fire emergency. This is despite experts like Greg Mullins, saying that the fire seasons are getting closer together, leaving less time to do things like hazard burns. And also, that the Greens are not in power anywhere in Australia, and therefore have not actually enacted policy anywhere. As well as emergency service chiefs saying hazard reductions have been occurring each and every year. Joyce says it can be done during the winter. Which would be just before the Queensland fire season began this year – in September. When the rainforest was on fire. Gabby Chan has written about Michael McCormack’s ABC radio interview yesterday – and the impact that his words have on people who live in the areas his party is supposed to be representing: Those of us who live in the country need metropolitan Australians to understand our lives more than ever. Yet this sort of rubbish about ‘woke inner-city greenies’ is exactly the sort of crap that divides the nation and takes the place of the more difficult policy work to address some of our challenges. It is cheap talk that kills farmers’ social licence at a time when we need cities to understand how important the job of food-growing is for their own bellies and how important food production is to the economy of regional communities. As the dairy industry bleeds under crippling water prices, we need to have a serious conversation about the diversity of our food sector and its building blocks – soil, water and energy – and how they are impacted by climate change. We need the city to understand how important the growing renewables sector is to providing new jobs to our communities, while ensuring we take our own coal workers by the hand into new opportunities. The high court is sitting in Canberra today to hear Annika Smethurst’s challenge against the validity of the warrant authorising the police raid on her home. In June the Australian federal police raided Smethurst’s home, investigating an alleged breach of section 79(3) of the Crimes Act, which prohibits “communicating or allowing someone to have access to an official secret without authorisation”. Smethurst’s challenge has two prongs: one challenging the validity of the warrant and the second challenging the validity of the offence on the basis it infringes the implied freedom of political communication. At the start of the hearing, chief justice Susan Kiefel reveals that the court has asked Smethurst’s lawyers to focus their arguments on the validity of the warrant. Smethurst’s counsel Stephen Lloyd says his understanding is the court wants him to make submissions about the warrant and then stop, which Kiefel confirms. This is a big hint that the case is not going to be decided on the constitutional argument. Attorney general Christian Porter has intervened in the case, asking the court to refuse a bid to destroy material collected from the raid, arguing it “may well be important” for a potential future prosecution. Porter and the Australian federal police will be represented by solicitor general Stephen Donaghue. South Australia has intervened supporting the commonwealth, while the Australian Human Rights Commission has made further submissions about the limits of commonwealth power in support of Smethurst. Scott Morrison to Ray Hadley on “policy discussions” to be had after the fire emergency: But you’re absolutely right, Ray the time to have those policy discussions are not in the middle of an operational response. And whether it’s that [hazard reduction burning] or any other issue. It’s not that people don’t think those issues are important or need to be acknowledged – whatever issue we’re talking about, it’s just going to focus our efforts on the operational response that’s what people in the crisis areas need. Alexander Downer performing, “lol, I am not a spy (not that I can talk about it).” I’m not gonna say anything more about it,” he told Sky News. The Australian government’s fully cooperating, although I don’t work for the Australian government any more. I’m obviously in touch with them on all of this. And so that’s our line ... ... America’s politics is for Americans, not for us. I think we’re best to keep me out of it if we possibly can.” Scott Morrison is speaking to Ray Hadley on 2GB. “I just really want to assure people that everything that can be done, is being done,” he said, despite nature probably “throwing some curveballs”. The defence force is on standby to assist – they are not necessarily trained in firefighting, but they can help with evacuations and coordinating teams. Alexander Downer is working his way through “I can’t talk about it because it is an ongoing US investigation, but I am not a spy” tour. He will address the National Press Club later today. Meanwhile, the number of lobbyists wandering around Parliament House has almost doubled in less than a decade (spoiler – nothing is being done to address it). From Josh Taylor The number of lobbyists with unfettered access to the halls of Parliament House to see politicians, staffers and journalists under the sponsored pass holder scheme has nearly doubled in the last seven years, Guardian Australia has learned. In addition to parliamentarians, their staffers, building employees and the press gallery, there is a separate category for sponsored passes where people, often working as lobbyists, can enter and exit the building through the private entrances, and not need an escort through the non-public parts of the building. The passes are sponsored by MPs and senators, and although the orange passes are not limited to lobbyists, a significant proportion of those issued would be to groups lobbying in parliament. You can read more about that here. We start another day by talking about a trainwreck interview performance from a National party leader – this time Bridget McKenzie. It was over the dairy code, which is what sparked calls for her to be scrapped as deputy leader just a few weeks ago. After three years of discussions, the Nationals looked ready to move forward with the much-vaunted code. Then One Nation cottoned on to it and started making a lot of very public noises over it, including withholding votes on non-crucial legislation until one was implemented. It was a stunt more than anything – One Nation still turned up for every vote that mattered, but it was a very loud stunt and it forced McKenzie into saying the timetable would be moved up, meaning the code would be implemented early next year instead of mid next year. Pauline Hanson claimed victory. The National party MPs who had spent the past three years working on the code (marrying up the different state industries is a little difficult, but hey – that’s the federation for you) were pretty annoyed that One Nation was taking credit for their work and went on the offensive. Next thing you know, there are backbench drought-assistance submissions and Barnaby Joyce is anywhere a blinking camera light is featured, and the Nats came together for peace in our times. Except that’s not possible with all the stuff that is going on right now. McKenzie looked stressed in Senate question time yesterday, and her colleagues are openly questioning whether she is up to the job. It wouldn’t matter so much if they weren’t also questioning whether Michael McCormack was also up to the job, and after his tone-deaf head-in-the sand performance yesterday morning over climate change and its link to the catastrophic early bushfire season, well, things aren’t exactly great in the Nationals group chat. So McKenzie got up this morning and spoke to ABC radio about the dairy code and just how on top of it she all is. Except – she’s not. And she had to concede she didn’t have all the answers about why changes have been made to the exposure draft. And she had to admit that it more than likely wouldn’t be ready by January. “We either want to get it done quickly or we want to get it done right,” she said. “I am not going to rush to put out a code that is not going to be fit for purpose and not going to actually work in all eight of our [dairy] regions across the country.” That sound you hear is Hanson skipping into work today. We’ll cover that, plus the Senate, plus the government response to the ongoing bushfire emergency. You’ve got a one-coffee Amy on your hands, so I will fix that, but you have the incomparable Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin to make up for my failings. Which may include, but are not limited to, typing diary instead of dairy every now and then. Ready? Let’s get into it."

          "bodyText": "As the serpentine Amazon river meanders through a sea of jungle, a little red boat speeds across its muddy brown waters. Powered by two outboard motors, the vessel carries a cargo of volunteers, medics and nurses, an awning, and dozens of HIV screening tests. The first stop is Nueva Vida Yahua, an indigenous village 40 minutes down the Nanay river from Iquitos. The women are dressed in red skirts and grass tops worn draped over their shoulders, the men in long grass skirts and headdresses made from blue macaw feathers. As volunteers erect a canopy over a plastic table and chairs, a queue of people begins to form for the finger-prick HIV tests. Village elders use a megaphone to summon more people for the visit by the Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF). Alongside the tests, team leader Silvia Barbarán talks frankly to a group of young women – many of them breastfeeding infants or caring for toddlers - about the importance of safe sex and condom use. The women are curious, as though it’s the first time anyone has ever talked to them about safe sex or HIV. The tests take just 15 minutes to show results: no one in this small hamlet is HIV positive. The mood is jubilant as the volunteers are led to the maloca, the village’s principal palm-thatched hut. The head man, Anselmo Cahuachi, stands in the centre, singing a plaintive song and beating a drum as the villagers dance in a circle around him, each one holding a visitor by the hand. It is difficult to rush anything in Peru’s largest state, Loreto. At the heart of this swathe of Amazon basin is Iquitos, the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road. One of Peru’s poorest regions, with the highest levels of infant malnutrition and anaemia, Loreto now faces a growing threat from HIV and Aids. The virus has spread throughout the vast region since the first reported case in the early 1990s, and particularly affects sex workers, traders, oil workers and indigenous communities. According to the epidemiological control department of Peru’s health ministry, infection rates in Loreto are exceeded only by Peru’s capital, Lima, and its port district Callao, despite the population of the Amazon region being a fraction of the size. While Lima and Callao have a combined population of nearly 11 million, Loreto’s inhabitants number less than 1 million. Between 2000 and 2018, around 72,000 cases of HIV and 30,000 cases of Aids were recorded in Lima and Callao. Data from the same period placed Loreto in third place, with roughly 6,000 cases of HIV and 4,000 of Aids. To counter the rising figures, HIV activists are taking to the river to detect and treat the virus and spread the safe sex message. “The geography of our jungle is a big problem for getting around,” says Barbarán, Iquitos’ most recognisable and vocal activist for HIV awareness and LGBT rights. “Thanks to this boat we’re saving lives, because with an early diagnosis we can give prompt treatment and that person can get on with their life.” Barbarán, whose turquoise hair is styled into a quiff, has been HIV-positive since 2000 and came close to death. Treatment in Peru has improved dramatically in the past two decades, and in 2004 the country introduced free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. Barbarán managed to get ARV treatment soon after she was diagnosed, thanks to relatives who lived abroad. Since the rubber boom at the beginning of the 20th century, Iquitos has been a trading post. Add to that tourism and more internal movement and “some infections which didn’t exist in the region begin to enter,” says Dr José Luis Sebastián, director of AHF for the Andean region. “As these are small circles it’s felt in a much stronger way than in regions with a bigger population,” he adds. Of the more than 4,000 people tested for HIV in Loreto by AHF between January and August, 5.8% have tested positive, which is slightly higher than health ministry figures. As dusk falls, the team is taken by noisy motorised rickshaws to the home of one of their youngest patients, in nearby Padre Cocha. Leonidas, eight, contracted HIV from his parents. Abandoned by his mother, Leonidas was adopted by his aunt Micaela Aquituari when his father – her brother – died from Aids in 2014. He lives with Aquituari, a health administrator, and his doting grandparents in a concrete shack with open blue wooden shutters. Electric cables hang off a discoloured wall, on which hangs a photo of Leonidas in his school uniform. “My brother died and we were very sad, but we have hope for life through his son,” says Aquitari. “For us [my brother] lives through his son for as long as God wishes and we will carry on his treatment so he continues to have a long and happy life.” Antiretroviral treatment pulled Leonidas back from the brink of death in 2014. He must take large, hard-to-swallow tablets each day for the rest of his life. He wants to be a doctor when he’s older. Dr Carlos Benites, who leads Peru’s HIV and Aids control programme, says indigenous populations living in the Amazon have certain risk factors due to local customs and practices. “Beginning sexual relations early, the custom of having more than one sexual partner … the use of condoms is very low,” Benites explains. Some Amazon groups believe they contract HIV because someone has cursed them, he adds. After Nueva Vida Yahua, the boat travels on to Tamshiyacu. The craft has been named ‘Angely’ after a girl in a remote village who died of Aids because she did not get treatment. In a torrential downpour, José Roca runs down the concrete steps to the riverside wearing hotpants and a soaking red T-shirt to help unload the boat. Roca, a former sex worker who runs a hair salon, has lived with HIV for more than two decades. “I knew what I was getting into,” Roca says of contracting HIV. “The pain was not for me, the pain was for my family.” Peru’s male LGBT community is the demographic most impacted by the virus. Barbarán admits that sometimes she feels powerless to stop the virus’ advance. “You have to tell people to love themselves and take care of themselves,” she says. She and colleague Lupe Chistama talk frankly about safe sex to a group of young mothers and teenage girls. If a suitor asks you for a “test of your love”, you ask him for his “HIV test”, she jokes. Loreto has Peru’s highest teenage pregnancy rate. In 2017, more than 30% of 15 to 19-year-old girls became mothers or got pregnant for the first time, almost three times the national average of 13.4%. Barbarán cares for a 14-year-old girl and her baby son at a centre she set up for HIV positive children in Iquitos. The baby was not infected with the virus when he was born, but Barbarán worries that the problem of transmission is all too common in remoter parts of the region. The girl came from an indigenous community in Requeña, on the region’s south-eastern border with Brazil. “We hear from the health service that many mothers don’t collect their antiretroviral treatment … I don’t know if it’s culture or negligence,” she says, a note of desperation in her voice. “We have to focus on the mothers.” Back in Iquitos, the team unload the Angely into waiting motorised rickshaws on the dock. Thoughts are already turning to the next trip along the Amazon and its myriad tributaries. The goal is to reach even more people, says Barbarán, no matter how arduous the journey."

This pool – part natural, part carved into the rock – offers a safer place to enjoy the chilly Cornish seas. Created in the 1930s to provide a safe pool for the people of Bude, it is supervised by lifeguards during working hours in the summer but not out of season. Friends of Bude Sea Pool, the charity that runs it, advises avoiding high tide and swimming at low tide. Head to Life’s a Beach cafe for a warming cuppa afterwards. • budeseapool.org Llyn Padarn, Snowdonia national park At the foot of Mount Snowdon, near the village of Llanberis, the stunning, glacially formed Llyn Padarn is so popular it’s sometimes described as the “local swimming pool”. Take a dip here and you are swimming with the Torgoch, a rare type of Arctic char fish that has survived since the ice age. The lake also has a range of swim-scapes, from the shallow lagoons, where families often paddle during the summer, to deeper waters. Llyn Padarn’s waters have been designated as bathing water by Gwynedd council and meet the highest EU guidelines. There is plenty of parking – paid in the village, or free at the Surflines shop – and a public toilet. • visitwales.com Lake 32, Gloucestershire For those more interested in endurance training than a quick dip, Waterland, at Lake 32 at the Cotswold country park, Lake and Beach, is a go-to swim spot for triathletes and aquathon competitors. A naturally fed lake approximately 6ft in depth, it has buoyed courses of 200, 400, 750 and 1,500 metres – though we would advise keeping your swim-time short during the lower-temperature months. Non-members can swim Tuesday, Thursday and Friday evenings from 5.30pm until dusk (from 2 April) as well as weekend mornings. In winter you need to be a member to swim. • ukwatersports.co.uk Loch Tay, Perthshire One of the most important things about location for a chilly winter swim is where you warm up afterwards, and Taymouth Marina with its Hot Box, an outdoor hot tub and wood-fired sauna-with-a-view, has the perfect answer to that. This facility, set in a magnificent Perthshire loch, even offers a slide that takes you right out into the lake. Last March, for the inaugural Scottish Winter Swimming championships, the sauna was adopted as a post-race gossip box for those who entered. Many of us were still wearing our race “silly hats” as we chatted, on an after-dip high. But it’s open all year round and worth booking if you want to be sure of a spot on the warm-up bench. • taymouthmarina.com Loughrigg Tarn, Cumbria Said to be one of the warmest lakes in the Lake District, this gorgeous pool, nestled beneath the steep side of Loughrigg Fell, is often used as a drinking pond by cows, and is covered in lilies during the summer. Wordsworth described it as “Diana’s Looking-glass … round, clear and bright as heaven.” Although it feels remote – Alfred Wainwright described it as “one of the most secluded of tarns” – it’s actually one of the lowest and most accessible of ponds in the Lake District, reached by a short walk from a lay-by car park. For those who like to wake up under canvas and take a romantic dawn dip, there is even a nearby campsite, Tarn Foot, open from April to October. Warm up after your splash with cake or homemade lunch at Chesters by the River at Skelwith Bridge. • visitcumbria.com Portobello Beach, Edinburgh City swimming at its best, from Edinburgh’s town beach. An enormous and enthusiastic community has developed round the local Facebook group here, and almost any time of the year the chances are high that if you head down to the beach and promenade and linger for a short while you’ll see a few people charging down between the groynes, whooping and giggling. You can also go for a post-dip indoor shower or swim at the municipal pool on the front – though wetsuits are not allowed inside – and there is a string of good cafes for hot chocolate afterwards. We recommend Miro’s. • visitscotland.com River Lugg, Herefordshire The river Lugg, which winds from Llangynllo in Powys into the Wye near Hereford, has many lovely swimming spots along its meandering course. One of the best is at Bodenham village, where its course offers both long, sandy beaches and river pools. You can reach the water’s edge on a path that runs from behind St Michael’s church. There are, though, plenty of other idyllic spots on the Lugg, including the two-mile stretch from Lugg Mill to Lugwardine Bridge, through Lugg meadow, one of the few surviving Lammas meadows in the UK – a relic of the open-field common grazing systems, on which livestock is not allowed to graze until after Lammas day (1 August). • visitherefordshire.co.uk Loch Insh, Cairngorms There’s nothing quite like Loch Insh for a sunset swim, snatched in the pink-orange glow as the winter sun descends over the surrounding trees. The loch, at the base of the dramatic Cairngorms, has long been host to a watersports centre. It’s also not far from here to one of the best Spey river-dipping spots. Warming and hearty food is available at the friendly restaurant on the shore, and there are several cabins you can rent if you want to stay the night. • lochinsh.com Frensham Great Pond, Surrey Though it may look like a natural lake, Frensham Great Pond, near Farnham in the Surrey hills, was actually dug out in the 13th century as a fishpond for the Bishop of Winchester. You don’t have to be a fish, though, to want to swim in its lovely, shallow, spring-fed waters, which are inviting at most times of the year – and in winter you won’t need to worry about the algal bloom that sometimes afflicts it during the hotter summer months. You might even find yourself dipping with the overwintering wildfowl, the moorhens, mallards and greylag geese that make it their home. There is a sandy beach and buoyed areas reserved for swimming. • waverley.gov.uk Janet’s Foss, Malham, North Yorkshire It’s said that Janet, Queen of the Faeries, resides here in a cave behind the falls. A short walk out of Malham, through a magical wooded gorge, its icy waters plunge into a natural bathing pool, cradled in a limestone valley. Winter is when you can get this place – busy the rest of the year – to yourself (there’s also no danger of it drying up, as it did in a heatwave last year).

          "bodyText": "Scarlett Thomas’s latest novel is a fast, fizzy read. Tash, the daughter of a mysterious Russian billionaire, arrives at an English boarding school. Then we’re into 224 pages of sheer audacity and voice as Tash tries to figure out who she is. Thomas is satirically attuned to the intricate frustration of teen life, the ignoble obsessions of puerile minds and the speed at which hygiene, decorum and false pretences vanish in a single-sex boarding institution. This makes for an entertaining, irreverent and wrong-hilarious read. The girls engage in competitive anorexic narcissism (“Fruit has been specifically bred by insatiable, corrupt farmers to be full of sugar”), mortification of the flesh through sport and snobbery about local “plebs” whose tattoos are “desperate cries for help rendered in fading ink”. The girls both enact and encounter various forms of contempt, inappropriateness, ambiguity and sleaze. The novel is full of brilliant lines and I’m deliberately not quoting the best ones, to save them for buying readers. OK, just one. Some male trauma counsellors come to visit: “Look, where do you even get two therapists who look so much like paedophiles? ...[One of them] has the eyes of a lifeguard who lets people down.” I came to Oligarchy having devoured Thomas’s brilliant Worldquake fantasy series, similarly set in a remote town with young characters and a strange school. She is on a red-hot streak of invention right now and these narratives succeed because of the novelist’s deep understanding of the cracks and quirks of such communities. Underneath the inconsequentiality of Tash’s teenage high jinks is a barely repressed sense of panic and self-doubt. She is full of fear about returning to her old life of “people shouting at each other, but always about the wrong things”. When Thomas slows down for a moment I am reminded how excellent her dialogue is. She expertly conveys the complexities of character through natural speech, as when Tash is advised by her worldly Aunt Sonja or has a date with a privileged guy who is at once snobbish and observant and “smelled triply of boy and man and animal”. The text is haunted faintly by other narratives. I caught whiffs of The Virgin Suicides, The Crucible, The Bling Ring, Clueless, Alan Warner’s The Sopranos, Picnic at Hanging Rock, the fervour of Antonia White’s Frost in May and the anguish of Edward St Aubyn. But these don’t stick, banished by the sheer blast of stroppy, scathing energy. This is more like Malory Towers with wifi or Sweet Valley High with the sweetness taken out. There are sinister whispers about murder, suicide, mass hysteria and tragic school folklore. But they are outweighed by the wit, which is plentiful, freewheeling and almost shocking in its callousness, like the childhood memories of when a girl “dropped acid and watched The Silence of the Lambs while the house flooded and no one did anything”. Despite the occasional spangles of darkness, this is hugely enjoyable. It’s about as menacing as a cool girl’s black glitter nail polish – and just as much fun. • Oligarchy by Scarlett Thomas is published by Canongate (£14.99).

          "headline": "Badger cull activists hit out at cost of shooters' tracking devices",
          "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money has been spent on equipping badger cull marksmen and women with tracking devices so that their movements could be mapped by co-ordinators and police. Anti-cull activists have criticised the expense, arguing that the cost of the cull should be met by farmers rather than the public purse. The tracking devices were intended to keep the shooters safe during this autumn’s cull. But it has emerged that saboteurs were able to use a security flaw in the devices to locate shooters and disrupt their activities. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) revealed that more than £300,000 has been spent on the tracking devices. Defra accepted that farmers were expected to fund the cost of the cull but said that on the advice of the police in order to keep shooters safe it had bought the devices. In 2017, it emerged that almost £500,000 of taxpayers’ money went on buying radios to link shooters with police in remote areas where there is little mobile phone coverage. Then, too, saboteurs turned the tables by investing in equipment that enabled them to trace the signals produced by the radios, pinpointing the position of marksmen and giving activists the chance to disrupt the shooting. Jay Tiernan, of Stop the Cull, said: “Once again we have found clear evidence that the killing of badgers which the government told us would be paid for by farmers, is in fact paid for by the British taxpayer. “Tracking devices that are used by the shooters so that their movements can be coordinated by a central ops room are supposed to be paid for by farmers not coming out of an already overburdened public purse. “As in previous years, the devices chosen by experts have once again shown to have serious security flaws and have made life much easier for activists to find and neutralise any shooting efforts.” In September, it emerged that ministers had approved 11 new areas for culling, taking the total up to 43 with up to 64,000 animals likely to be killed. Badger culling has been the mainstay of the government’s attempt to tackle bovine TB since 2011, with a system of licensed shooting introduced in Gloucestershire and Somerset two years later. Meanwhile, a man who ran a field sports business in Cornwall has been given a suspended jail sentence after the carcasses of 28 badgers were found in freezers on his home and at an industrial unit in July. Scott Milne, 42, from Bodmin, admitted killing the badgers outside the time of the authorised cull and passing them off as animals legally shot during the permitted period. Defending Milne at Bodmin magistrates, Michael Green said: “This is an unusual case in many ways. He felt a pressure to meet badger cull targets to keep his licence, which contributed to him making the stupid decision to shoot badgers outside the cull period.” Sentencing Milne, the chairman of the magistrates’ bench told him: “Although you were licensed to cull badgers these actions were done entirely outside of any licence period.” Milne received an 18-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. He must also carry out 150 hours of unpaid work."

          "headline": "The tiger next door: America’s backyard big cats",
          "bodyText": "It was the sort of headline impossible to scroll past: “Pot Smokers Find Caged Tiger in Abandoned Houston House, Weren’t Hallucinating: Police.” Last February, a group of people had snuck into a deserted house in Texas’s largest city to smoke marijuana when they stumbled upon a full-grown tiger in a cage – a cage secured by just a nylon strap and a screwdriver. Sergeant Jason Alderete of Houston Police Department’s animal cruelty unit, later told a local TV station: “It wasn’t the effects of the drugs. There was an actual tiger!” The animal was given a name, Loki, and sent to an animal sanctuary in the country, run by the Humane Society of the United States. You’d be forgiven for thinking Loki’s experience was an isolated incident – it isn’t. An oft-quoted statistic is that there are more tigers in American back yards than there are left in the wild. According to the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, there are between 3,200 and 3,500 tigers remaining in the wild globally. By some estimates there are 5,000 in captivity in the US, though there might be more. The truth is we have little idea how many there are in American ranches, unlicensed zoos, apartments, truck stops and private breeding facilities, due to a mishmash of state, federal and county laws governing their ownership. According to the World Wildlife Fund, only 6% of America’s captive tiger population lives in zoos and facilities accredited by the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums; the rest are in private hands. Some are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture and others by state laws, but some are not regulated at all. “In some states, it is easier to buy a tiger than to adopt a dog from a local animal shelter,” says the WWF. In Texas, which lets each of its 254 counties regulate the ownership of dangerous wild animals, it’s hard to accurately gauge how many there are. In a state that prides itself on promoting individual freedoms, like openly carrying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles or bringing concealed handguns on to university campuses, it’s perhaps not surprising that owning a tiger is considered (by some) to be a God-given right. The deplorable conditions in which Loki was found illustrate the fact that these “rights” can come at a cost. He was discovered in a 5ft x 3ft cage in the dark garage of the abandoned home. The cage’s floor was made of plywood. It was three months before police arrested his owner, a 24-year-old woman named Brittany Garza, who was taken into custody and charged with animal cruelty. She responded that she was in the process of relocating and had not abandoned the animal, as it had food and water. Katie Jarl, the Humane Society’s southwest regional director, says there have been numerous similar incidents. In 2016, police in Conroe, a town north of Houston, received reports of a tiger roaming a residential neighbourhood after it escaped from someone’s back yard. “No one knew about them,” she says. “They were completely off the map.” In 2009, a 330lb tiger escaped from its enclosure in Ingram, Texas, and was found in a 79-year-old woman’s back yard. In 2007, a one-year-old tiger “wearing a makeshift lead” was found shot dead in a wooded area off the motorway in Dallas. In 2003, in another Dallas suburb, a motorist spotted a four-month-old tiger roaming the side of the road. In 2001, a three-year-old boy was killed by one of his relative’s three pet tigers in Lee County, Texas. And in 2000, animal control officers near Houston spent three hours searching for a tiger that had escaped from a garden cage while its owners were out of town. That same year, in Channelview, Texas, a three-year-old boy had his arm ripped off by his uncle’s 400lb pet. As for Loki, Jarl says a law-enforcement source of hers outside the city had got in touch to say the authorities had known about Loki’s owner for a long time. “She had been raising cubs in her home for years,” Jarl says, “in a county where there were no restrictions.” This year, two state legislators filed bills aimed at prohibiting the private ownership of “dangerous wild animals”. But this is Texas, where the private ownership of pretty much everything is sacrosanct, and neither bill became law. There was “passionate testimony” on both sides of the debate, says the assistant to one of the legislators involved. According to one conservation charity, four states (Alabama, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin) do not regulate the private ownership of exotic pets at all. Brittany Peet, director of Captive Animal Law Enforcement for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), says there are a “patchwork of laws” regulating the possession of big cats. “And you can usually get around those laws by applying for a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) exhibitor’s licence,” she says. “It’s as simple as filling out an application and writing a cheque for $100. The regulations are very minimal – as long as you have a cage where the animal can fully stand up and turn around you shouldn’t have a problem getting a licence. “Everyone should be terrified and shocked by this,” Peet adds. “These animals are extremely complex and powerful and can kill a human being with a swipe of their paw. People keeping tigers in back yards are not experts. They don’t know what they’re doing, and they’re not providing these animals with enrichment and stimulation that they need in order to live relatively normal lives in captivity.” Bill Rathburn disagrees. He believes he provided the seven tigers that once lived on his private, 50-acre ranch 80 miles east of Dallas, with more than enough enrichment and stimulation. For more than two decades, Rathburn and his now ex-wife Lou raised the animals from cubs. For the Rathburns, the tigers were a surrogate family. I interview Rathburn over the phone and later he sends me a photo of himself and Raja, the first tiger he and his wife bought. The pair are nose to nose inside its cage. “That was the relationship I had with him,” he says. “I’m not a reckless person and wouldn’t have gone into the cage with him if I hadn’t raised him, or knew I’d be safe doing it. He was the most loving animal from the day we got him to the day he died.” Not everyone in the Rathburns’ neighbourhood shared their enthusiasm. “Tiger sanctuary has residents growling,” read one local headline. Rathburn is a former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and chief of police of the Dallas Police Department. In 1996 he was director of security for the summer Olympic Games, in Atlanta. It was while he was there that Lou bought their first tiger. Rathburn admits to feeling “kind of overwhelmed” initially, thinking about all the work and expense that would inevitably go into raising it. But when he came home he says he “immediately fell in love”. The following year the couple bought two more tiger cubs “from a guy who had tigers in the back yard of his house in Houston”. Rathburn and his wife raised the cubs in their house. They installed a heavy mesh screen door “so they couldn’t get out of the pantry and wander round the house at night”. Outside, they constructed a cage complex. “If you saw it,” he says, “you’d realise it was a pretty good life for a tiger: a 10,000sqft play area with grass, trees and bushes, so they could run, play, hide, and chew on grass to help their digestive system.” Raja lived to be 21. “He was unsteady on his feet towards the end,” Rathburn says. “I knew it was time to put him down. The vet came round and agreed. I was crying like a baby. It broke my heart.” Their second animal developed a tumour on her spine. When she died, Lou insisted on having her skin made into a rug. “And after we got divorced I ended up with the rug,” Rathburn says. “I have it over a chest in my bedroom, and it’s wonderful way to remember her. I talk to her once in a while.” Eventually, he says, a neighbour complained to county officials about what they described as a growing tiger problem next door. “He got county officials upset, and two votes can sway an election in a rural area. So the county commissioners weren’t willing to extend my permit.” Rathburn believes in regulation. “There should be adequate confinement areas, [and regulation] protecting animals and protecting people who might be injured by them.” But, he says, he stands by the rights of individuals to own big cats. While this might sound incredible to someone in the UK, Rathburn’s sense of entitlement – this rugged individualism that says the government shouldn’t interfere with an individual’s right to own pretty much whatever they want – runs deep in America. Marcus Cook has owned and worked with big cats since the early 1990s. Back then he was working for a zoo in south Texas, and when the owners retired and closed their business Cook adopted a couple of black leopards. “Anyone who says they can tame one is unrealistic,” he tells me by phone one morning from his home in Kaufman, Texas. “But they’re handleable.” Cook says he’s owned everything “from small cats, like cougars, to lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars. The big guys.” He says his own firm, Zoocats, began as a hobby in 1995 and grew from there. He began to take the animals on the road around the US – to schools and fairs and temporary exhibits. Cook says it was all about education – “creating an entertaining wow factor” – but his critics say he was ruthlessly exploiting the animals for gain. He has been accused of numerous animal welfare violations, subjected to various complaints, and issued citations over the years. Loki, the tiger rescued from the Houston garage, was taken to a vast ranch in Murchison, Texas, run by the Humane Society. Murchison, population 594, is a rural farming community 70 miles southeast of Dallas. The Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch is situated discreetly, a few miles outside town, next to a remote country lane. You can see horses and cattle grazing in fields next to the road, but none of the exotic animals that also live here. Noelle Almrud, ranch director, meets me at the main office and we climb into a truck to drive to the enclosures at the back of the ranch that house its two tigers. It’s not unlike a wildlife park, although there are no gawking tourists here and the enclosures are bigger. Loki lives in a quarter-acre fenced area, but he rotates each week from this into a three-acre enclosure next door. Both have an abundance of willows and oaks to provide shade. As we walk towards the fence, Loki gallops over and makes a breathy snort that Almrud says is known as “chuffing” and signals affection. He rubs himself against the wire enclosure before running back to his water trough and jumping in. “He’s acclimated really well,” she tells me. “We feed him 8lb of food a day – humanely raised beef, turkey, large rats, or rabbits and supplements – six days a week, then he has a day of fasting, as he would in the wild.” Two years ago, Almrud helped found the Big Cat Sanctuary Alliance, a network of reputable big cat sanctuaries whose mission was to strengthen the regulation of big cats in the US and get conservation facilities to work together to place rescue animals. But they face a big challenge, she explains: “Roadside zoos need shutting down, but where do you put all the animals? You couldn’t re-house all the tigers currently in roadside zoos in America. We need more money and more facilities. In a perfect world,” she says, “I’d like to be put out of business.” Judging by the Texan appetite for big cats, that won’t be happening anytime soon."

The man was shot at Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, at around 7pm on Saturday after two police officers went to the property to arrest him. “During that time a struggle ensued and two shots were fired and he sadly passed away later,” acting deputy commissioner Michael White said. He said the man lunged at a police officer as the pair attempted to arrest him. “My understanding is he was armed with a weapon,” he said. White said a warrant for the man’s arrest had been issued after he breached parole. After the shooting police provided first aid to the victim as there were no medical staff in the community at the time. An ambulance from a neighbouring community was called to attend the scene. Sky News reported he was taken to the local police station for two hours while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. A police officer received a shoulder wound during the incident, White said. The death is being treated as a death in custody. The body has been taken to Alice Springs and a coronial investigation will be held. Fewer than 800 people live in the Yuendumu community."

          "headline": "Jamie Vardy takes Leicester second as pressure on Arsenal’s Unai Emery grows",
          "bodyText": "The last time Leicester played a league match in such a downpour they scored nine goals. There was never any chance of that happening here yet in moving up to second place in the Premier League the Jamie Vardy and James Maddison double that won the points for the Foxes was arguably just as valuable. Leicester have now won four in a row since their last league defeat at Liverpool, and with every passing week look an even better bet for a Champions League placing. Arsenal did not play badly here, they even had their chances to take something from the game, but their winless run now extends to four, they remain on the fringes of the elite and life is not going to get any easier for Unai Emery over the international break. “We’re not really thinking about the title,” Brendan Rodgers said when asked about the possibility of overtaking Liverpool as well as Manchester City. “But if we can bring European football back here that would be great.” Arsenal took the field with a flat back five in an attempt to neutralise Leicester’s variety of attacking options, a tacit admission of insecurity that set the tone for the early part of the game. Leicester spent the first quarter trying to work out a way to enter the Arsenal area, and though the visiting defence held tight they had a couple of scares due to David Luiz giving the ball away in his own half. For all the home side’s possession and pressure, however, it was Arsenal who created the best opportunity to open the scoring when Alexandre Lacazette took the ball off the toes of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but managed to miss the target with a shot from the edge of the six-yard area. Leicester had an excellent chance to go ahead when Héctor Bellerín made a mistake on his first league start of the season, playing a pass from the touchline straight to Vardy, and though the striker did the right thing in allowing the ball to run on to Ayoze Pérez the former Newcastle forward’s shot just cleared the bar. A Pérez cross from the right flashed across Arsenal’s goal with no one in a blue shirt able to get a touch moments later, before Youri Tielemans opted to blast a shot wastefully high after carving a swathe through midfield with the assistance of Maddison. Leicester kept getting closer as the first half progressed, and only the watchful presence of Calum Chambers at the far post prevented Vardy reaching the most inviting of low crosses from Pérez. Maddison went close with a free-kick on the stroke of half-time after he had been fouled just outside the area by Lucas Torreira, before Arsenal finished the half with a free-kick routine of their own, David Luiz launching a ball from his own half for Aubameyang to chase. It ended up reaching Kasper Schmeichel first, though the Leicester defence was almost caught out, a warning that Arsenal are never quite out of a game even when they are fighting to stay in it. Leicester upped their attacking efforts at the start of the second period and should really have gone ahead in its opening minutes. First Harvey Barnes made inroads down the left but crossed too high for Pérez to finish, then after Ricardo Pereira reached the byline on the right his perfectly placed cut-back gave Wilfred Ndidi almost too much time to finish. It looked as though the midfielder could hardly miss but he did not get over the ball well enough and a slightly casual sidefoot came back off the bar. Arsenal had the ball in the Leicester net shortly after that, just to show what an open game it had become, though the linesman flagged for offside when Aubameyang touched in Sead Kolasinac’s cross from the left and after an acceptably short delay – one that one would like to think was not prompted by the Arsenal fans chanting “VAR, VAR” – his decision was ratified by the remote technology. Pereira did well to cover back and pinch the ball from Aubameyang in the area after the Arsenal captain had eluded the central defenders once again to fasten on to another long ball from David Luiz at the back. The full-back was furious no offside flag had been produced but replays showed Aubameyang was onside and Pereira’s intervention had been necessary. The Leicester breakthrough came midway through the second half, when a subtle flick from Barnes found Tielemans in front of goal and he had the presence of mind to simply move the ball on to his left to an unmarked Vardy. Leicester’s leading scorer does not miss chances like that and Vardy duly stuck the ball beyond Bernd Leno, before turning provider seven minutes later after the impressive Pereira had made ground through the middle. The full-back’s accurate diagonal pass found Vardy, who turned the ball back for Maddison to beat Leno a second time with a shot through Bellerín’s legs. Once ahead, Leicester played out the remainder of the game with that brisk passing and pressing game they do so well, while Arsenal capitulated in the way they do so often. It must have made miserable viewing for Emery, especially with the crowd alternating between chants of “Ole” for the passing and “You’re getting sacked in the morning” for the Arsenal manager."

          "bodyText": "After a 10-year battle by elders and renal health workers in central Australia, the first remote South Australian dialysis clinic officially opened its doors this week at Pukatja (Ernabella), an Anangu community about seven hours south-west of Alice Springs. Seven patients, who were previously living in Adelaide, Port Augusta and Alice Springs for treatment, have already returned home to continue dialysis at the four-chair, two-nurse Purple House centre at Pukatja, 30km across the SA border in the Musgrave Ranges. Purple House is an Aboriginal community-controlled health service that provides dialysis in 17 remote communities and a mobile unit called the Purple Truck, which allows patients to head back home to visit family, for festivals, funerals and other cultural business. The Purple Truck this year trekked to Arnhem Land so that patients could attend Garma festival while receiving life-saving treatment. One of those in the chair at Garma was the actor Jack Thompson. The Purple House began with an auction of paintings at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2000, when Papunya Tula artists from Walungurru and Kiwirrikurra developed four collaborative paintings that were auctioned with a series of other work and raised over $1m. Since the centre – which is entirely Indigenous owned and run – began, central Australia has gone from having the worst survival rates for kidney disease to some of the best in Australia. The Purple House chief executive, Sarah Brown, said the clinic at Pukatja was the culmination of a decade of work by patients, their families and the community. “Ten years ago, Kinyin McKenzie knocked on the door of the Purple House in Alice Springs, homesick for his community and looking for somewhere that would let him boil up a chicken in a billy,” Brown said. “Our directors welcomed him in. While his chicken boiled on the fire, he told us about all the people far from home who were desperate to return to their APY communities, their country and families. “Our bosses, Pintupi people from the Western Desert, said: ‘Poor things. It doesn’t matter that they are Pitjantjatjara, everyone on dialysis is family to us. We need to help them to get home.’” Years later, Purple House had an opportunity from the commonwealth government to nominate places for new dialysis infrastructure. “Our directors quickly suggested Pukatja, even though they didn’t have dialysis in all their own communities at the time,” Brown said. The clinic is named for Kinyin McKenzie and in memory of those who “fought for this service and passed away before they were able to get home”. “But current and future dialysis patients will benefit from their determination,” Brown said. “This is a great example of Aboriginal people working together to make lives better for families in communities.”"

          "headline": "30 years of televised parliament: how Westminster became mainstream entertainment",
          "bodyText": "When Ian Gow, the member for Eastbourne, rose to his feet on 21 November 1989 to make the first televised speech in our most ancient of parliaments, it is fair to say he wasn’t too happy about it. “I have always voted against the televising of the proceedings of this House,” said the Tory MP, and he was not alone. His ire stemmed partly from a letter that had been circulated to MPs three weeks earlier, confirming in his mind the cynical and unseemly nature of the whole ghastly endeavour. “The impression you make on television,” Gow recounted from the advice contained in the memo, “depends mainly on your image (55%), with your voice and body language accounting for 38% of your impact. Only 7% depends on what you are actually saying.” The guidance to camera-shy members went on to say: “We can guarantee to improve your appearance through a personal and confidential image consultation. You will learn if you need a new hairstyle – and where to get it – and the type of glasses to suit your face.” Gow considered himself “beyond redemption on both counts”. Neil Kinnock sympathised, recalling that before he made his entrance on to what was now essentially a TV set, he had been handed a “papier poudré, which looks to me like cerebral blotting papers which apparently are for mopping one’s head”. Self-deprecation aside, much of the dialogue came from MPs wearily accepting something that had divided Westminster, and been delayed by its members, for decades: the inevitability of the mass media age. Not only on the issue of picking your best side for the camera, but over deep philosophical anxieties about the nature of democracy, and the very soul of a democratic chamber itself. Today, as we approach the 30th anniversary of that first televised session, it is hard for most of us to imagine what the fuss was about – not least a younger generation so used to capturing and sharing almost anything and everything as part of daily life. This is especially true of the withdrawal agreement, a year-long soap opera that has seen live parliamentary coverage cross over from niche geek activity to mainstream spectator sport. John Bercow, until recently Speaker of the House, is now a star on the continent, where an app can imitate him saying: “Uuuuhhhder”, and BBC Parliament even enjoyed a ratings spike that briefly took it above MTV. It would be hard for any democrat to argue today that a citizen has no right to see inside. John Reith first pushed the idea of parliamentary broadcasting as far back as the 1920s, but it was never given serious consideration until Harold Wilson arrived in No 10 for his “white heat of technology” revolution. What precipitated the unthinkable? The 1960s had brought a sharp rise in TV interviews and panel debates between politicians, and there was a rising sense that the “supreme forum” of national debate was being substituted for something baser. So in May 1965, the member for Ilford (the appropriately named Mr TL Iremonger), begged to move that “the maximum involvement of a responsible people in the processes of parliamentary government is a sure guarantee of liberty”, and it was time to directly enter people’s homes. But a select committee investigation and test screenings brought unfavourable feedback, and members voted against. As they again did in 1972. And 1975. It took more than 22 years and 11 debates before a sea-change occurred – in that bastion of forward-looking modernity, the House of Lords. A sort of “out of town tryout” was initiated in “the other place” by Christopher Soames – leader of the Lords and son-in-law of the orator-in-chief, Winston Churchill – in December 1983. They tested it in January 1985, when Harold Macmillan – whose own premiership had been destined to end when he was mocked in a theatre by Peter Cook and the rest of Beyond the Fringe – stole the show. The Commons, whose inhabitants would be elected by those watching, after all, had many concerns. Who was going to edit the coverage? Would exhibitionists get to hog the mike? Would it change the character of the house, turning politics into mere performance – the substance, the nuance gone? But the die seemed cast by 1989, when the leader of the House reported back from the select committee with reassurances: “Eight remote-controlled cameras will be mounted just under the galleries and will be as unobtrusive as we can make them. We went into lighting with some care, as many honourable members feel passionately about the subject.” Only a standard head-and-shoulders shot would be permitted. There would be limited use of wide-angle shots, a limit on the use of reaction shots, and a prohibition on the use of split-screen. No panning, just straight cuts. All in the interests of fair coverage and balance. It didn’t take long for the pressures of “good drama” to intervene. Only weeks after opening night on 21 November, the restriction on reaction shots was relaxed. Today, the controller of BBC Parliament, Peter Knowles, tells me that the intention is to “make you feel like you are part of the event. We see members who are actively taking part in the debate – not just when they are speaking – and in the floor-level shots you see the chamber much as the Speaker sees it, which gives some thrilling moments of drama. “There’s suddenly – and perhaps surprisingly – a big appetite for the authenticity and rawness.” And it is thrilling. At least, I think so. I began watching footage of the House on the evening news as a boy in the early 90s, as the industries in my Nottinghamshire village began to disappear as a consequence of the discussions and the votes taking place on the TV. Getting to know the faces, learning the names. It’s a fascination that fed into the writing of my play This House for the National Theatre in 2012, about the high drama of the 1974 hung parliament. So, have the old anxieties passed about turning the chamber into a variety hall and politics into mere performance – about parliament becoming a place where the best actors triumph over the best minds, with elected representatives in the chamber not so much speaking to each other as simply broadcasting to those outside? The motivation for Boris Johnson’s war against parliament was the message being sent out to his leave base – he had little time for winning around the people sitting opposite him. And Jeremy Corbyn’s final question in PMQs is no question at all, but clippable content to share among the Momentum network. My own local MP, Gloria De Piero, retiring this year and a former TV news star herself, champions the way the cameras force you to think of your constituents watching at home. When getting to her feet, she says: “I am totally thinking about my constituents, and bringing their voice to parliament.” She doesn’t judge those who use the stage to grandstand and wax lyrical, “but I just can’t think of the job like that”. The best question she thinks she ever asked was 11 words long, to David Cameron: “Does the prime minister support the closure of local police stations?” The British remain squeamish about cameras entering other public spaces, courtrooms in particular. Yet this too is now being trialled. The direction of travel was set, 30 years ago this month. But as the boundaries continue to blur between real and manufactured, truth and lies – as a reality TV star prepares to fight for a second term in the White House, having instigated a new culture of constant campaigning that is taking root here – our anxieties over politics as exciting television persist. We celebrate what has been gained, but fret over what we may have lost. Cameras in the Chamber: a history in 10 scenes 1. Geoffrey Howe resigns, 13 November 1990 Iconic for what it captured on camera as well as the events it precipitated off (the Iron Lady would be out two weeks later). The camera cut from the quiet assassin on the backbenches to the stony-faced Thatcher listening upfront, staring forward, trapped in the frame and possibly cursing the decision to let the cameras roll a year before. Howe joked about her cabinet being a cricket team whose “bats have been broken before the game by the team captain”; the laughter that followed echoes down the ages to all restless leaders looking over their shoulders. 2. ‘I’m enjoying this!’, 22 November 1990 Margaret Thatcher reclaimed the spotlight on the day of her resignation, refusing to be cowed by the Commons. “Her performance was as tough and uncompromising as ever,” came the Paxman review that night. There are some classic, quotable lines for sure, such as her attack on the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes. “He would rather the poor were poorer, provided the rich were not richer,” said Thatcher, mockingly demonstrating her view of socialist economics with her fingers to the delight of loyalists behind. Then came a classic quip from Dennis Skinner. In response to the question of whether Thatcher would continue her fight against a central European bank, the Beast of Bolsover volunteered from his sedentary position: “No, she’s gonna be the governor”. Cue a roar of laughter, unusual for coming from all sides – including the Iron Lady, who had been crying only hours before. “What a good idea!” she cried, giving a swing of her fist.It was such a bravura swansong that the party may have already begun to regret getting rid of her. And she knew it. “I’m enjoying this,” she trumpeted with a smile. 3. The death of John Smith, 12 May 1994 It’s often the more sombre sessions that bring out the best behaviour. John Major should have been facing John Smith at the dispatch box that day, but the Commons instead met together in grief. “When I think of John Smith, I think of an opponent, not an enemy,” said Major. Despite her clear grief, Margaret Beckett – who as deputy leader took the place of her friend – was impossibly dignified as she informed the House of the closing words of a speech Smith had given the night before: “‘The opportunity to serve our country. That is all we ask.’ Let it stand as his epitaph.” 4. Robin Cook resigns, 17 March 2003 There were many turbulent and emotional scenes in the lead-up to the Iraq invasion in 2003; the resignation of the respected former foreign secretary, who could not support the war, was one. “History will be astonished,” he rightly predicted. Note that man to the left of the frame, sitting behind him – a future Labour leader and key player in the Stop the War coalition. 5. Purple rain, 19 May 2004 One of the more surreal moments, as a screaming Fathers4Justice campaigner in the public gallery launched a flour bomb at Tony Blair, which connected with his shoulder and burst into a purple puff. No one knew what the concoction was, so the session was suspended immediately. A Perspex barrier has sealed off the gallery from the chamber ever since. 6. ‘That is that. The end’, 27 June 2007 Tony Blair ended his tenure with a quieter turn than Thatcher, paying tribute to the House despite admitting he was not exactly a “Commons man”. Politics, he said to the occasional swallow, was the arena that set the heart beating a little faster, a place for noble causes. “I wish everyone, friend or foe, well. And that is that. The end.” A highly unusual (and technically forbidden) standing ovation from the entire chamber followed. 7. Tributes to Jo Cox, 20 June 2016 As with the death of John Smith, this was an occasion everyone would sooner had never taken place. But it was also, once again, a deeply moving national moment that showed the House at its humane best, and a testament to a clearly loved colleague. The white rose of Yorkshire was worn by every member and also occupied the seat – alongside a red rose – where Cox should have been, as her friends repeated the sentiment now familiar (though still too frequently ignored) from her maiden speech: “We have more in common than that which divides us.” 8. May government found in contempt, 4 December 2018 The Netflix-style saga around the withdrawal agreement’s traumatic passage through parliament has too many episodes from which to choose, from the points-of-order attacks against the Speaker for selecting the Grieve amendment, to Labour members trying to prevent the proroguing of parliament, to the final fall of May. But this is where it began: a government voted 311 to 293 to be found in contempt of parliament for the first time in history. One member is heard to call out “beginning of the end”. Talk about spoilers. 9. Rosie Duffield recounts her abuse, 2 October 2019 There is no better recent example of MPs reminding us they are real people, with real lives, than Rosie Duffield’s brave and precise account of the ways, big and small, that abusers can trap those that they abuse. She makes it all the way to the end before allowing her grief to flow out, to be immediately swamped with hands by her colleagues and friends. 10. Saturday matinee, 19 October 2019 The first televised weekend fixture in the House’s history. It must have been serious. Kick-off was 9.30am and the big vote to delay a vote on Johnson’s deal was passed around 3pm. It didn’t have the fireworks or the memorable lines of other Brexit sittings – in fact, everyone was trying to be very collegiate and statesperson-like. How much of that had to do with the cold light of a Saturday? Or was it a greater understanding of the little lenses fixed menacingly around the chamber, as they have been now for three decades, the knowledge of a captivated world watching?"

          "headline": "The Other Name: Septology I-II by Jon Fosse review – a momentous project begins",
          "bodyText": "“You don’t read my books for the plots,” the Norwegian writer Jon Fosse has said. Over the past two decades, Fosse, a playwright, poet, essayist and children’s author as well as a novelist, has won almost every award going in Norway, while his “slow prose” has gained him a cult following in English translation. He has been compared to Ibsen and Beckett, and his writing has elements of both the former’s severity and the latter’s use of insistent repetition. (Fosse’s 1996 play Someone Is Going to Come was based on Waiting for Godot.) In 2018 Fitzcarraldo published his short-story collection Scenes from a Childhood. This proved to be a taster for a more ambitious project: the Septology series, of which The Other Name is the first instalment, is billed as a three-volume septet, featuring not a single full stop throughout. Such is his command of the rhythm of his prose, nimbly and hauntingly translated by Damion Searls, that the omission is barely noticeable, and after a while, engagingly welcome. The work simply loops and flows. The style is formal, yet with a sense of restlessness. As for plot, there is plenty. It is late autumn, close to Advent. Two older men, painters, live near each other on the south-west coast of Norway, one in the city of Bjørgvin (a thinly disguised Bergen), the other in remote Dylgja overlooking the sea. Both men are called Asle. One is an alcoholic, twice married and divorced, virtually estranged from his children, living alone with his dog and struggling with a persistent deathwish. The other Asle, widowed and childless, is also solitary, outwardly more stoical. He gave up drinking years before and is a fairly recent convert to Catholicism. That this is a story of doppelgangers is obvious: at one point, when Asle the drinker nearly dies in the snow after suffering a blackout, it is the other Asle who saves him. The two share the following exchange: You’re leaving? he says You don’t have to go he says I do have to go I say But you can’t, we’re too far out to sea, he says I have to go, I say The book is marked by pairings, from its two-part structure (each beginning with an identical paragraph) to the painting sober Asle is creating, which takes the form of two lines making the diagonal cross of a saltire and is brown and purple in hue. These colours in turn echo the apparitions or memories this Asle conjures up of himself and his wife Ales (even their names are interchangeable) as young lovers, one moment playful, the next intensely serious; his brown leather shoulder bag, her purple clothing. Sober Asle’s neighbour in the countryside is Åsleik, companionless farmer and fisherman, with whom he has a passive-aggressive relationship (there are echoes of Godot’s Vladimir and Estragon here), exchanging paintings for a freezer full of lamb and smoked fish. The paintings are a gift for Åsleik’s sister Guro, who may or may not be the same Guro with whom both Asles have had some sort of intimacy in the past. Then there is Alida, a sister who is mentioned almost incidentally early on as having “died too young” and later appears in a stunningly rendered, unsentimental memory sequence from the siblings’ childhood. The doubleness is both a challenge and a reflection: “I just sit and stare into the empty nothingness and probably in a way I’m the empty nothingness I’m looking at.” The version of Asle who has found God (which he gently insists is “knowledge” not “belief”) provides some of the book’s most ecstatic, probing scenes. In one passage Christ’s nativity is alluded to almost in passing; a well-worn story, yet one which Fosse somehow makes refreshingly original. Similarly, his descriptions of young Asle’s growing awareness of colour and its endless variations prefigure Asle the mature artist. The overall theme of a “shining darkness”, referring to Asle’s painting, his losses and his faith, is used to illuminate the fugue state of being. Fosse’s fusing of the commonplace and the existential, together with his dramatic forays into the past, make for a relentlessly consuming work: already Septology feels momentous. • The Other Name Septology I-II, translated by Damion Searls, is published by Fitzcarraldo (£12.99).
